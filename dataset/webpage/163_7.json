The son of a career navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.[1]\n\nBy the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll DeCamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition, and by age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that positing until Mancini's death in 1994.[2]\n\nWhile appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royces, tone and approach to changes. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker and Bucky Pizzarelli.With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano.\n\nDuring his career Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US national jazz radio charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists!

As a guitarist, he toured with Motown singer Marvin Gaye and later played for over twenty years in Henry Mancini\u2019s orchestra until the composer died in 1994. Royce Campbell\n\nJB: How old were you when you started to play jazz guitar and what was most helpful in your personal development as a guitarist?\n\nRC: I was around 16 when I started playing jazz. My uncle, Carroll DeCamp was most helpful in my development. He was an accomplished pianist/guitarist/arranger who played with Wes Montgomery\u2019s group in the 1950s. I learned more from him than I could have from a music school. He also introduced me to a host of older players in the Indianapolis area who also contributed a lot to my development. I learned on the gigs with them rather than in classes. I got a lot of work as a pit orchestra player for musicals and had to develop my reading skills for those jobs. Even though these weren\u2019t jazz gigs, I grew a lot as a player and as a professional.\n\nJB: What are three of the most influential jazz guitar albums and why?\n\nRC: The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery was among the most influential albums for me because it was the first jazz LP I ever bought. It introduced me to jazz guitar. Pat Martino\u2019s album The Visit was another one that was an early influence. It introduced me to Martino and was the first album I attempted to do some transcribing. The other is also a Wes album, Smokin\u2019 at the Half Note. Since this album was live it presented Wes in a looser environment where he could really stretch out so I could hear Wes at his very best.\n\nJB: Practice and listening aside, can you pinpoint one or two \u2018things\u2019 that really boosted your profile and career toward where it\u2019s at today?\n\nRC: Initially, it was my recordings with other guitarists that helped me build a profile in the first place since so many of them were famous. I recorded with Pat Martino, Larry Coryell, John Abercrombie, Bucky Pizzarelli, Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Mundell Lowe, Cal Collins, Charlies, Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Herb Ellis, John Pisano, and Dave Stryker. I am really grateful that I had the chance to be forever associated with them in this way.\n\nIn later periods of my career, the other \u2018thing\u2019 that contributed to my profile was the recordings I was able to do for small labels in Holland, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Those labels specialized in building catalogs of world-class recordings despite the fact that they did not have the resources of bigger labels, and they also gave me a chance to play with and be associated musically with some extraordinary musicians.\n\nJB: Talk about your musical experience with the great Henry Mancini.\n\nRC: My 19 years with Mancini have given me the fondest memories of my career. Not only did I play great music with Mancini, but he was really a great bandleader who was always kind, generous, and loyal to his musicians. I feel that playing his compositions all those years helped my development as a composer.\n\nJB: What was it like working with the Smithsonian Jazz Orchestra in the Washington DC- Northern Virginia area?\n\nRC: Years ago, I played in DC with the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra which is an awesome big band. It might just be one of the most under-appreciated collections of musicians anywhere. I had the honor and privilege to play with incredibly talented colleagues, real\u201d jazz musicians\u2019 musicians.\u201d\n\nJB: What about your career today that you find rewarding?\n\nRC: Due to health issues I\u2019m semi-retired now, but I do some gigs at retirement communities that are rewarding because the residents appreciate the music so much. I also still compose and work on recording projects, some my own and some as collaborations.\n\nJB: Talk about your composing.\n\nRC: Composing is incredibly rewarding. To create something from nothing is pretty special; there is an energy and beauty to the process that is an important counterpoint to some of the darker aspects of our world right now.\n\nI still love to do recording projects. The whole planning process, the actual sessions, and the post-production work are all exciting and energizing, and even though I am getting older, that process never does.\n\nIn a bigger sense, one of the most rewarding aspects of my recording career in particular is that those recordings still draw new, young audiences. It seems that younger generations don\u2019t get hung up as much on specific genres of music or time periods and fashions; they are willing to engage with a broader variety of styles. I am always gratified when I hear from young fans\u2014some fellow guitarists others just new fans\u2014that they enjoyed listening to particular albums. It might be corny, but it makes the last 50+ years in the biz really worth it.\n\nJB: Tell us about the guitar and amp that you use.\n\nRC: I usually use a Benedetto Fratello guitar and an Acoustic Image amp. I do some gigs that include some funk; for that, I use a Gibson ES-335. I also still play a Gibson L5 from time to time. I love the difference in tone that I get from the Benedetto and the Gibson. One is bright and a little cool, and the other is darker and warmer; each offers different possibilities in terms of what I can create.\n\nJB: Tell me about one of your CD albums that best represents your playing.\n\nRC: It\u2019s difficult to pick just one because I\u2019ve done different styles from mainstream jazz to smooth jazz to free jazz. My personal favorite of the 33 CDs I\u2019ve released is the Tribute to Henry Mancini CD. It was an inspiring moment when we recorded it. Mancini was definitely present, and we could all feel it. It made us all play at our best. I recently had a gig with my friend, bassist Bill Moring, and completely without prompting he said much the same thing. He also still remembers that session as musical magic.\n\nJB: How has your playing changed over the years?\n\nRC: I hope it\u2019s gotten better. I feel that over the years my soloing has gotten more melodic. Because I have gotten older and various health conditions have posed challenges, I might not have the same technique I had as a younger player or the speed, but I think my sense of melodic storytelling has been sharpened over the years. Composing and improvising go hand in hand for me and are both ways to tell stories that listeners can relate to. I happen to be a romantic, and melodic lines tell the stories that I want to tell, so I have been working on that all my life, though it\u2019s become even more important in recent years.\n\nSubscribe to Jazz Guitar Today \u2013 it\u2019s FREE!"}, {"url": "https://www.benedettoguitars.com/player/royce-campbell/", "page_content": "December 28, 2017 Royce Campbell\n\nRoyce Campbell is a prolific recording artist and performer with over 30 albums released as leader or co-leader.

These sessions appeared on Campbell's own Paddlewheel Records, which was a subsidiary of the Japanese King label. They were released in the United States on Evidence. At that time, Royce Campbell was approached regarding a new project that would team the guitarist with five leading jazz plectrists of his choice. The resulting album, 6 X 6, featuring Campbell in performance with John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Pat Martino, Bucky Pizzarelli and Dave Stryker, was released in 1994 in Japan and later in Europe to critical praise. One decade later, the album is finally being made available in the US, retitled Six By Six.\n\nEach of the guest guitarists is given two tracks apiece with, essentially, their own bassist and drummer, and Royce Campbell is the second guitarist on each of the selections, providing rhythm and the opportunity to trade fours with the respective players. Considering the range and experience of these guitarists, all are playing in a mainstream style. Perhaps the biggest surprise is Dave Stryker, who since the early 1980s has shown a distinct blues jazz influence per his association with Stanley Turrentine and Jack McDuff. On both Bill Evans' \"Interplay\" and \"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise,\" Stryker is a lyrical treat. Larry Coryell, who is quite comfortable in a variety of jazz guitar settings, shines on \"Happy Blues\" and \"Love for Sale.\" John Abercrombie displays a typical blurred note delivery on his selections, while Bucky Pizzarelli shows his expertise with round, warm notes on the ballad \"Darn That Dream\" and then a swinging \"Dancing on the Ceiling.\" Pat Martino, who has garnered even more success since this recording date, shows his technical prowess on a lovely bossa version of \"Naima\" and the Miles Davis standard \"Milestones.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyce Campbell has also recorded five other independent albums in a small group setting and with strings, plus an additional tribute to Charlie Byrd. Perhaps it is now time for him to reach a wider audience."}, {"url": "https://jazztimes.com/reviews/albums/royce-campbell-trio-make-me-rainbows/", "page_content": "Royce Campbell\u2019s prolific discography is surely one of the most expansive in today\u2019s jazz guitar circles. Whether it\u2019s his outstanding solo outings, his gypsy-tinged tribute, or his albums of reworked standards, Campbell seems adverse to repeating himself even as all his work shares a pronounced melodic sensibility. On Make Me Rainbows, a reissue of his 1995 album, Campbell steps into the classic organ trio setting with the legendary musicians Melvin Rhyne and Jimmy Cobb. Given this lineup it\u2019s not a matter of if the session will smoke, but only of how hot.\n\n\n\nThe fire ignites immediately with \u201cMr Montgomery\u201d, a bouncing tribute to Wes Montgomery with whom both Rhyne and Cobb played. Assured in his own stylist approach, Campbell smartly incorporates mannerisms of the jazz guitar great without falling into mimicry. Loosing none of his youthful agility, when Rhyne lets loose with an organ solo one could be forgiven for mistaking the decade. The vibrate feel continues in \u201cSoftly, As In A Morning Sunrise\u201d which Campbell has reworked into waltz time. Cobb\u2019s light touch really shines on this cut \u2013 propelling it along while never over-shadowing the others. Especially pleasing here is the way Rhyne\u2019s backing interweaves with Campbell\u2019s deft lines. On the slower side, the ballads are equally interesting and harmonically fertile. Both \u201cRuby\u201d and \u201cYou Go To My Head\u201d show off the beauty of Rhyne\u2019s lush chordal accompaniment as well as Campbell\u2019s ability to play in and around the smooth backing while never surrendering his harmonic voice to it.\n\n\n\nThankfully, Make Me Rainbows has been rescued from the out-of-print netherworld with this reissue. It justly deserves to be heard again. The warm timbre of the classic guitar-organ-drums grouping shimmer with rich with overtones, and with the trio of Campbell, Rhyne and Cobb, the harmonic and rhythmic interplay is pleasingly expressive throughout.\n\nOriginally Published"}, {"url": "https://www.jazzwax.com/2019/11/royce-campbell-organ-trio.html", "page_content": "\n\nOne of my favorite albums celebrating the music of Henry Mancini is guitarist Royce Campbell's Tribute to Henry Mancini, recorded in 1996. Royce marvelously captures Mancini's hip and gentle melody lines and his passion for space. Royce should know. He was Mancini's guitarist for 19 years. A year before this album, Royce recorded a solid organ-trio album with organist Melvyn Rhyne and drummer Jimmy Cobb. You don't climb into the proverbial ring with those guys unless you know exactly what you're doing\u2014and Royce did and does.\n\n\n\nNow, 24 years later, he has released a second organ trio album (recorded in 2016) called Organ Trio (Moon Cycle), with Jonah Kane-West on organ and Billy Williams Jr. on drums. In addition to being a lovely guitarist, Royce has great taste, as you'll see when you give a listen. There are two standards\u2014Close Your Eyes and The Brothers Go to Mothers from Mancini's Peter Gunn. The rest are groove-rich originals such as Lucky, the pensive Letter to Henry, the swirling Toe the Line, a holiday-flavored That Time of Year and more.\n\n\n\nEven on up-tempo blues, such as Organ Trio Blues, and funky tunes like Caribbean Sea, Royce never wheel-spins nor is he ever in a hurry. He's deliberate and sensitive. On this album, Royce gives the organ-trio format the Mancini touch. He swings gently and lets the sound of ringing tones wash over you before releasing another flurry. I could listen to him all day. As for Kane-West (above) and Williams (below), solid organ playing with an equally gentle approach and drums that stir things up without turning them over.

His wealth of experience has taught him to treasure these holiday songs. Nineteen years as Henry Mancini's guitarist, plus numerous tours with singers Mel Torm\u00e9, Cleo Laine, Perry Como, and Marvin Gaye, have given Campbell an appreciation for the deep meaning that these songs convey year after year. The acoustic timbres of his trio allow the music to flow naturally.\n\nWith a mellow tone and crystal clear articulation, the guitarist interprets each of these traditional favorites as jazz trio adventures. Filled with outside quotes and spontaneous forays, the trio's cool passion allows for many happy returns. Campbell's guitar solos with melodic authority, Tom Baldwin's upright bass steps out with adventurous designs, and Howard Curtis' drums provides a light but sturdy foundation. The trio likes to present its interpretations as lightly Latin or slightly blue. Campbell swings gently and puts a wealth of rhythmic joy into each piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\" flows smoothly with a windswept melody, but as Campbell and Baldwin step out to solo, the scene changes quickly from one of peaceful landscapes to one filled with spontaneous surprises. Both artists fit the jazz tradition into their interpretations comfortably. Curtis' fours allow them to converse as naturally as neighbors over the backyard fence.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded separately, Campbell's \"Live Every Day Like Christmas\" features Everette Greene's warm baritone voice with strings. Marking the solemn spirit of the holiday season, Greene and Campbell remind us how important it is to accept the spirit at this time of the year and to carry it with us all year 'round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Christmas Song\" closes the album with warm thoughts of a cozy fireplace and loved ones by your side.

He thinks outside of the box while using material that comes from inside the box. He does so on his sophomore album Roses And Wine from Philology Records, opening with a rollicking jive-inspired tune \u201cTake A Train\u201d that conjures up the feeling of riding a steam locomotive across country. There is more to Campbell\u2019s music than the melodic haikus of his guitar pizzicatos or andante strumming, for instance, the folksy-Hawaiian sizzle in the chord textures of the title track infuses a pacifying mood which features the bebop phrasing of Hod O\u2019Brien\u2019s piano keys. Also showcased on the recording are Pete Spaar and James King who share the bass duties.\n\nEvery track sounds like it is smiling at the listener thumping along the upbeat ruminations of the trio and the pliable chord coordinates of the melodic patterns. The smooth bluesy piping of \u201cLover Guy\u201d pervades a sensual stroll in Campbell\u2019s guitar riffs as the vigorous arcos of the bass in \u201cThere\u2019s No Other You\u201d are enhanced by add-ons of vaunting jetties in the piano phrases. The laid back chord expressions of \u201cD. .Jam Blues\u201d have a Louisiana sound that shifts into a cool bebop traction in \u201cAll The Things.\u201d The leisurely gait of the piano keys in \u201cThat\u2019s Not All\u201d moves in harmony with the moonlight coloring of Campbell\u2019s guitar chords as the comfy grooves of \u201cMore Than Just Friends\u201d imbue the melody with a cheerful sprint. The bebop motifs strewn across \u201cInto Nowhere:\u201d and \u201cD. Jam Blues\u201d have a vintage Americana feel reminiscent to Chet Baker and props a happy tapping along the rhythmic beats.\n\n\n\nRoses and Wine is feel good music from beginning to end and displays the trio\u2019s ability to play like a well-oiled machine. Campbell has a lengthy recording history that includes working on tribute albums for Wes Montgomery and Henri Mancici, in addition to being a sideman on other artists records as well as making albums in his own right.
