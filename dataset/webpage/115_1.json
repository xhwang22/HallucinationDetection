His breakthrough to stardom came with the role in Na Hong-jin's serial killer film The Chaser (2008). One of the leading actors of his generation in Korean cinema, Ha Jung-woo showcased his versatility across movies from many genres: road movie My Dear Enemy (2008), sports film Take Off (2009), crime drama The Yellow Sea (2010), gangster saga Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time (2012), romantic comedy Love Fiction (2012), spy thriller The Berlin File (2013), and action thriller The Terror Live (2013). He made his directorial debut through the comedy film Fasten Your Seatbelt (2013), followed by Chronicle of a Blood Merchant (2015).\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn as Kim Sung-hoon, Ha Jung-woo came from an acting family. His father Kim Yong-gun is a well-known veteran actor who has appeared in many movies and television series, while his younger brother Kim Young-hoon (stage name: Cha Hyun-woo) is an aspiring actor. Ha has said that since he was 4 or 5 years old, he has always dreamed of becoming an actor like his father. Before entering college, Ha studied at a private acting institute and at one point had actor Lee Beom-soo as his instructor. He then enrolled at Chung-Ang University as a theater major, where he acted on the stage.\n\nIn 1998, Ha began his military service, working in the Armed Forces Public Relations Department. He put his acting experience to good use during this Time, appearing in 10 promotional films for the military.\n\n2002\u20132007: Beginnings\n\nKim Sung-hoon made his acting debut in the 2002 SBS sitcom Honest Living and his feature film debut in the 2003 film Madeleine. For the next few years, Kim's acting career was relatively low-key, appearing in several supporting roles, but not receiving a lot of attention. In 2005, Kim signed with talent agency SidusHQ and on their recommendation adopted the stage name \"Ha Jung-woo.\" He then appeared in his first starring role in the indie film The Unforgiven, a blistering critique of the physical and psychological violence within military ranks.\n\nHa's subsequent roles in controversial arthouse director Kim Ki-duk's Time and Breath brought more notice to his acting talents in Korea and overseas. His portrayal of a cool-headed prosecutor who is romantically involved with a feisty police officer played by Go Hyun-jung in the popular MBC drama series H.I.T attracted female fans and gained him popularity among the masses. He also starred in the American indie film Never Forever opposite Vera Farmiga, which garnered praise from the film festival circuit.\n\n2008\u20132009: Breakout\n\nHa's breakout came in the 2008 film The Chaser, in which he played a pyschopath character loosely based on serial killer Yoo Young-chul. The movie became a huge hit at the Korean box office, raking in over 5 million ticket sales, while also garnering high praise from critics and numerous awards from local award-giving bodies. American director Martin Scorsese, rumored to be attached to a Hollywood remake of The Chaser, has complimented Ha as having as much potential as his The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Ha followed this up with a portrayal of a charming scoundrel in My Dear Enemy that same year, showcased his versatility and elevated his status as one of the most sought-after actors in the Korean film industry. From 2008-2009, he took on diverse but compelling roles in The Moonlight of Seoul, Boat, and Take Off. Take Off, based on the Korean national ski jumping team, became one of the biggest box office hits of 2009.\n\n2009\u20132013: Commercial and critical success\n\nHa reunited with his The Chaser director Na Hong-jin and costar Kim Yoon-seok in Na's sophomore feature The Yellow Sea, which netted Ha Best Actor trophies from the Asian Film Awards, Baeksang Arts Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics. Ha then starred in the legal thriller The Client, which evoked his early days of theater, and the director praised Ha for his \"moments of true brilliance and genius\" during the production. In early 2012, Samsung Electronics produced an ambitious PPL-frequent-film project featuring Galaxy Note, their latest Tablet hybrid mobile. Titled as Cine Note, the giant project comprises three shorts by directors Kang Hyeong-cheol, Jang Hoon and E J-yong. Ha played the leading role for all the three of the films, while celebrated musician Lee Seung-chul produced music using the device, and noted webtoon artists Son Jae-ho and Lee Gwang-soo created the film\u2019s animated content.\n\nNameless Gangster: Rules of the Time was Ha's third collaboration with longtime friend director Yoon Jong-bin, also starring acclaimed veteran actor Choi Min-sik. This was followed shortly by the unconventional romantic comedy Love Fiction opposite Gong Hyo-jin. Both were box office hits. After wrapping Love Fiction, Ha along with Gong and 14 other actors went on a cross-country walking trip from Seoul to Haenam, South Jeolla Province. Their journey was chronicled in the documentary 577 Project, denoting the total distance covered in kilometers. Ha was in charge of three aspects of the production including planning, acting and casting. He said he did it to thank fans for their support after he won back-to-back Best Actor awards at the 2010 and 2011 Baeksang Arts Awards. In Ryoo Seung-wan's The Berlin File, Ha starred as a North Korean agent in Berlin who is betrayed and cut loose in the midst of a financial espionage intrigue. He then appeared the action thriller The Terror Live, playing a news anchor with an exclusive, live broadcast on a terrorist attack.\n\n2014\u2013present: Directorial works, Assassination and The Handmaiden\n\nHa then made his directorial debut with Rollercoaster (released internationally as Fasten Your Seatbelt), based on his own screenplay about the comic interactions between the cabin crew and passengers (including an arrogant Hallyu star played by Jung Kyung-ho) of a flight from Tokyo to Gimpo International Airport which becomes in danger of crashing when the plane hits a major storm. Working with Yoon Jong-bin again, Ha played a Joseon era butcher-turned-outlaw in the period action film Kundo: Age of the Rampant. In 2015, Ha directed, wrote and starred in Chronicle of a Blood Merchant, a film adaptation of Chinese author Yu Hua's 1995 novel. He then appeared in one of the biggest domestic hits of the year, Choi Dong-hoon's Assassination about resistance fighters given orders to kill a Japanese army commander in the colonial era. In 2016, Ha starred again in two box office hits; Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, an adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel Fingersmith also set during 1930s Korea;, and survival thriller The Tunnel. Ha has been cast in several upcoming films: a biopic on Andre Kim, Korea's first male fashion designer; Kim Yong-hwa's Along with the Gods, an adaptation of the same-titled webtoon about a court in the afterlife where the deceased undergo multiple trials for 49 days. and 1987, about a political crisis that led to the June Democratic Uprising in 1987 which ended the military regime of President Chun Doo-hwan.\n\nOther activities\n\nHa Jung-woo is also an artist. Though it began as a hobby in his university days, Ha began painting in earnest in 2007. His paintings, all done in a hybrid of Pop art and Expressionist styles, have been displayed in several solo art exhibitions. Critics have said his paintings, with their strong colors and interesting composition are reminiscent of those by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. \"Life as an actor is like living through an invisible war. Paintings soothe me and make me rational. It is too extravagant to say that painting is my hobby; it is rather a way for me to survive as an actor,\" said Ha.\n\nIn 2011 he published a compilation of essays titled Ha Jung-woo, Good Feeling. Besides his musings on life, Ha also wrote his thoughts on famous artists such as Pablo Picasso. The book also included about 60 of his own drawings.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHa dated fashion model Gu Eun-ae from August 2008 to January 2012.\n\nMusic video\n\n\"Betrayal\" (Big Mama, 2007)\n\nTheater\n\nWaiting for Godot (2002)\n\nBe Strong, Geum-soon!

How do you go about preparing for a specific role and do your preparations differ between films that are largely story-based and those that are essentially character studies?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Basically, I am full of curiosity and I am very interested in people. In fact, I love people. I normally get my first ideas about a specific character I am to play from screenwriters but in Korea most directors are also screenwriters so I always ask directors lots of questions like \u201cHow did this character start out\u201d or \u201cHow did you begin to develop this character\u201d. Essentially, I do a lot of research about a character whether it is for a story-led film or a character study and that\u2019s how I build the way in which I will play the role. For example, the character I played in \u2018My Dear Enemy\u2019 was actually modelled on the director\u2019s friend and so I was able to learn a great deal about him by asking the director. I read lots of novels, too, and that also helps to build up characters, in general. For each role I play, I endeavour to take on the persona of a real-life person to make the character more believable. If you take the example of \u2018The Chaser\u2019, you probably know that the character I played was a real person in Korea, the film was based on a real story, and so I looked into the police investigations of the case and how the main investigator had written descriptions of that person in his reports and how he had detailed that person\u2019s reactions to questions so that when the police interrogated the suspect in the film I could make my reactions as true-to-life as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 was your directorial debut. Why did you decide to move into directing and what were the challenges you faced directing the film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Being a director has always been part of my plan. It\u2019s not a new idea, I always intended to direct as well as act. I love working around films and yes, of course, I began my career as solely an actor but my plan for the future is to be both an actor and director. As far as the challenges of directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 are concerned, as I am an actor and I know how acting works I probably expected too much from the actors involved and perhaps my aim wad too high. \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 \u2013 the film that is screening tonight \u2013 was filmed right after I finished directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and because of that I was able to understand the director to a far greater degree \u2013 having been a director myself, I was able to communicate a lot better with the director of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. Communication is, of course, very important in day-to-day life but it\u2019s even more so in film.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I\u2019d like to ask you about Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 which I think was really your first much more straightforward action film; in terms of stunts and particularly the martial arts sequences. How did you find the training for the film and was the chance of doing some of that work what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I\u2019ve always very much liked director Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s action films and we always had a plan to work together on a film. However, we were unsure of what project that would be until \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 came up, and that was the film we ultimately ended up working on together. In my opinion, I would say \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 is a drama rather than an action film, but there we go, and for the action scenes I just did what I was told by the fight choreographer. I did a bit of action before but as an agent doing martial arts \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 was the first time so I guess because I felt I had no real experience I went to train at \u2018stunt school\u2019 and practiced rally hard; basically starting from learning how to punch properly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You\u2019ve mentioned acting and directing. I believe you have a film coming up called \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019, based on a Chinese novel, in which you act and direct at the same time. I wondered how that came about. Was it something you were a fan of or did someone else approach you?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Because it\u2019s a very interesting, funny story is the main reason I chose to work on \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019. About two years ago, I received a novel from a production company and the CEO of the production company is actually a friend of the writer. Initially I was offered a job as an actor in the production. The story, as I\u2019ve said, was really interesting but I felt I was too young to play the character so at that time I refused. Two years later, the same CEO came to see me on the set of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 and said there was no time to waste as the publication rights were close to running out, but I still refused because I\u2019m in my 30s [Ha Jung-woo laughs] and I told him if the rights could be extended to when I turn 40 then I would be interested. Just a couple of days later, he came back and said he had asked the writer if he could wait but he was unable to as the film would soon be made in China, anyway. The CEO said how much he loved the story and how he really wanted to see the film made in Korea and he agreed that he would be happy as long as it was done by 2014. So, shooting will go ahead next May. As I said, up to that point I was only going to be an actor in the film but after I accepted the role we met up to discuss who would be the director. Around the same time, I was editing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and there were some good rumours going round the editing room and shortly after that I heard that I had been chosen as the director, too. That was a proposal that really made my heart leap and so I accepted the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: Do any of the roles you play affect you outside of shooting? In \u2018The Chaser\u2019, for example, you play a very sadistic character. Is it difficult to switch off once shooting ends for the day?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t find it hard to switch off because when one role is close to completion I\u2019m always thinking of the next role to move on to. I try very hard not to bring what happens on set into my home and I make a real effort to separate my work and home life. I guess that\u2019s why I find it fairly easy to switch off from a specific character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: You appeared in two of director Kim Ki-duk\u2019s films, \u2018Breath\u2019 and \u2018Time\u2019. I wondered what it was like working with director Kim as he seems to be quite hard on his actors to get the performance he wants out of them?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I know it\u2019s rumoured that he\u2019s quite hard on actors but he wasn\u2019t like that at all when we worked together, and for me it was an absolute honour to have the chance to work with him. When you shoot a film, normally you met up to read the script together and that\u2019s how you first met and get to know the character you\u2019re going to play, etc. But with Kim Ki-duk there was no reading of the script for \u2018Time\u2019, and I don\u2019t know if he always does this or if it was just the case for this film, but he said the acting and building of the character was basically down to me, in a very trusting way. Eight years ago, I was quite a \u2018newbie\u2019 and I didn\u2019t have that much experience at the time, but the whole shoot was so comfortable I was really amazed that director Kim let me to decide on the character and the way to act. It was all done very comfortably and pleasurably as if I was working with my friends, unlike the rumour [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. When we worked on our second film together, \u2018Breath\u2019, it felt like we didn\u2019t talk about the film; we just talked about other things, really.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: You seem to be a multi-talented actor and director in the vein of James Franco; an American, he too acts, directs, he writes and he also paints. I know that you do painting as well, and I actually went to one of your exhibitions three years ago. What is it about painting that you enjoy? Do you feel it allows you to express something different to that of your films?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I graduated from university, I was practically unemployed. Obviously, I went for auditions but I had no tomorrow or certain future and it seemed just a continual repeat of mundane life. As such, I really wanted to do something creative and one day I just went to an art shop and bought a sketch book and paints and began painting. I found that while painting I was able to get rid of those worries about my future and it largely became both my life and my hobby. Once I began to get acting roles, my career moved up but still at times as an actor I\u2019ve felt quite isolated and my painting has served as a way to get rid of that feeling and discharge that emotion. On the set, I\u2019m forced to be logical and the director but I can feel quite emotional when I come home sometimes, whether I feel I did a good job of acting or not, and I guess when I see the end result of my painting it refreshes my mind and alleviates that stress. I guess my painting is my emotional diary.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: I\u2019ve been wondering why directors like Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan are always choosing you to run in films. What do you think directors see in you that makes them cast you in such roles; your characters often escaping from one place to another?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Maybe because I was born in the year of the horse [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan, after \u2018The Chaser\u2019 etc, recommended me to other directors saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make him run, and your film will definitely be successful\u201d [Ha Jung-woo laughs, again].\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: If I could just add to that, you also have a lot of eating scenes. Is that a special skill, too?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I always make sure they bring out hot food that you can actually eat, rather than just looking nice. In \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019, as you likely remember, there were many eating scenes; eating potatoes and hot dogs and they were really, really hot too \u2013 almost too hot to eat \u2013 and that really helped to make it more real and made expression easier. In Korea, there are many captured clips from films of me eating, with many of them online, and when I go to a restaurant with my friends there will always be one or two people filming me eating [Ha Jun-woo laughs]. So, it\u2019s really difficult for me to eat out in public. These days, when I see people in certain postures or making specific gestures, I know that they\u2019re trying to film me.\n\n\n\n\n\nCine_Asie: You come from a family of actors: Your father was a famous TV actor and your brother has started appearing in more and more television dramas, as well. When you started your career you acted in a TV series and you have since moved away into acting in films and have also added directing to your career. Earlier in the year, we met director Ryoo Seung-wan who has worked with his brother and as your brother is an actor, so far mostly in TV, are you considering working with him in film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Once I get more experience as a director then I should be able to cast my brother in a film. I think to shoot a film together as a family, rather than just being in a film as an actor, would be a good experience and something to remember.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Tonight, there will be a screening of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. How did you prepare yourself to be in character Young-hwa\u2019s shoes as a news announcer in a very tight space; two locations within a news room?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t think the small space matters that much. It\u2019s more about how the audience will see the film without feeling bored \u2013 because a newsroom is essentially a boring space. We talked a great deal about how to ensure the audience wouldn\u2019t feel bored in the space; different camera work, different cuts, and the use of multi-camera shots. The film comprises of 21 chapters and each chapter lasts for between five and ten minutes and we wanted to have a \u2018live\u2019 feel to it almost like a theatre. So, we shot non-stop for each chapter. The director had prepared for the film for five years and had prepared in such depth that he had shots from other films that he used and combined within the construct of the script and he showed me the demo film he had made. I think that in itself shows how much preparation he undertook.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: On a much more general subject, I have spoken to a lot of actors and directors who have talked about the difficulties faced by smaller independent film productions as a result of Korean film studios\u2019 continued focus on large budget blockbusters. As you are both an actor and a director, what are your thoughts on that issue?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I think the actual number of smaller film productions has increased in recent years because it\u2019s now so much easier to film in numerous ways; even with a mobile phone, as has been done on more than one occasion in Korea. So, even though there is indeed still ongoing pressure from large Korean film companies and studios for films that are either large budget blockbusters or almost certain money makers, I believe that the passion of those people who truly love films will enable small and independent films to continue to exist and even flourish.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I wanted to ask you about EJ Yong\u2019s film-within-a-film \u2018Behind the Camera\u2019, which you star in: Working with all those big name stars over what I believe was a tight two-day shooting schedule, what was it like working with a director who wasn\u2019t on set or even in the same country, for that matter?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It was amazing [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. To make it worse, I was working with EJ Yong on a different short film at the same time. So, in \u2018Behind the camera\u2019 I had a very small part and in the other short film I was the main actor. Director EJ Yong had a very clever idea to produce the film and we accomplished it through online chatting. I actually had another camera and I thought it was filming me, but it turned out it was just filming the background. In relation to the previous question about independent productions, because of directors like EJ Yong I don\u2019t think low budget films will disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You mentioned working with EJ Yong on another film and you have worked with other directors more than once, like Lee Yoon-ki, Kim Ki-duk, and Na Hong-jin. Is there one director you would still like to work with a second time, in the future?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Of course. I have talked about doing another film with director Kim Byung-woo, but we haven\u2019t decided on anything specific at this point. I feel very blessed and lucky to have met such good directors throughout my career and having good people around me has regularly made me want to work with a director on more than one film.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 premiered at this year\u2019s Busan International Film Festival. How did it feel to have your directorial debut premiere at such a prestigious film festival?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I went to the Busan Film Festival in 2005 with \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 as an actor and then this year I was invited to go as a director. So, it felt really great and the festival itself felt very different going in as a director and I felt much closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: A number of Korean actors and directors have tried to make or appear in films in the US. You appeared in a US/South Korean film by Gina Kim [Never Forever] but would you choose to appear in or direct a film in the US?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I do have plans to, and I\u2019d also like to but I can\u2019t really say much about that specifically, at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: Could you tell us a little bit about your next project \u2018Kundo\u2019 which I believe is a historical film? Is it more difficult or more fun to play in an historical film rather than a modern role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It\u2019s not fun at all. In the summer, Korea was very hot and I had to wear long trousers and big boots - layers and layers of clothing - and I had a shaved head and I had to have a beard and wear burnt make-up. So, it was incredibly difficult. There were also many horse-riding scenes and because it was so hot, the horses wouldn\u2019t listen or do what they were told. Nothing was easy at any given time during shooting. People might think that having a shaved head would be cool, but I spent so long in the sun that at night I could even feel the heat coming up again. So, I was able to learn quite a lot about solar energy [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: Prior to \u2018Project 577\u2019 you made a promise to the Korean people that resulted in a beautiful documentary about Korea. Do you feel you freed your spirit and do you think the rest of the actors hate you now? [In 2010, Ha Jung-woo won an award at the PaekSang Arts Awards and promised he would walk across Korea if he won the award again\u2026 He won the award the subsequent year and convinced some acting friends to go with him on his 577km journey to fulfil that promise].\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: After that incident, I\u2019ve never talked about anything like that again but through that three week cross-country walking trip I learnt a lot and realised that parts of Korea I didn\u2019t know about are really beautiful. I was lucky that Korea is small [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: You have been in a number of action films, The Chaser, \u2018Yellow Sea, \u2018The Berlin File\u2019, and normally no stunt men are used and you have to do the action scenes yourself. How do you endure the pain until the director says \u201cOk, that\u2019s the perfect shot\u201d?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I didn\u2019t do all the action and fighting scenes myself. There is a \u2018double\u2019 who looks exactly like me from the back. So, it wasn\u2019t all me.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: You are almost instantly recognisable in the majority of your roles but in 2006 you played a far less recognisable part in \u2018The Fox Family\u2019. What specific difficulties were there in working in a musical fantasy as opposed to a straightforward action film or drama and what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I received the script, I was very much reminded of Tim Burton\u2019s work and I tried to get the feel for the character from his films. That\u2019s also what attracted me to the part and though I\u2019m not sure how audiences felt about the role I played it was Burton\u2019s work that I based my performance on. As far as the musical aspect of the film and the dancing sequences are concerned, because I began my career as a theatre actor I didn\u2019t find any real difficulty in performing as I was required to.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: You\u2019ve been lucky to never have been typecast \u2013 you\u2019ve played in a variety of roles from romantic lead to spy to serial killer. I wondered what sort of roles you like playing most and is there anything you\u2019d like to try that you haven\u2019t yet?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: My dream role would be Hamlet on stage because I did theatre studies and being Hamlet to any theatre actor is a blessing and an honour. I was actually offered a job in 2009 but as I was so busy making \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 I wasn\u2019t able to do it, but hopefully before I get too old I\u2019ll get the opportunity to play Hamlet. Choi Min-sik, who I believe was here in England recently, played Hamlet in 1999 and ten years later to celebrate the role I was offered the part, but as I said I was at that time too busy to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: We talked about the directing of \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 but as far as the writing is concerned did you have some collaboration?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Obviously I got ideas from the actors and actresses involved when we were reading the script but the film was actually based on a real story, experienced by Ryoo Seung-beom.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: What has been the most physically demanding role you\u2019ve had to date?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Without question, \u2018Kundo\u2019 was by far the most physically demanding as a result of the heat alone. In that film I was using a very knife while the other actor was using a long sword and I was worried that I might actually get cut or injured. Whenever I talk about physically demanding roles, \u2018Kundo\u2019 will always be the one I mention. Before that film, I would probably have said \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 because the shooting was for 11 months and also took place in suburban China.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: Who are the directors and actors who have inspired you throughout your career?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: There are many: Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Tim Burton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Downey Jr, even perhaps James Franco [Ha Jung-woo laughs]\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Choi Min-sik is going to star in Luc Besson\u2019s \u2018Lucy\u2019 with Scarlett Johansson. Are you interested in working with foreign directors and cast members in order to extend your work in terms of different cultures\u2019 film productions?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I am open to the idea. In fact, I had a call from South Africa at one point but I thought it was too far to go. Hopefully at some point in the future a suitable opportunity will arise.\n\nOn behalf of everyone involved, I'd sincerely like to thank the Korean Cultural Centre UK for allowing us all to interview actor Ha Jung-woo at such length. Also, many thanks to Sinae Hong for her superb interpreting throughout the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://marriedbiography.com/ha-jung-woo-biography/", "page_content": "Ha Jung-woo is currently single and he is focusing on his career rather than being in a relationship.\n\nWho is Ha Jung-woo?\n\nHa Jung-woo is a South Korean actor, screenwriter, film director, and film producer.\n\nHe is one of the highest-grossing actors in South Korea, and his starring films have accumulated more than 100 million tickets.\n\nJung is best known for his role in \u2018The Chaser\u2019 in 2008, \u2018My Dear Enemy\u2019 in 2008, \u2018Take Off\u2019 in 2009, \u2018The Yellow Sea\u2019 in 2010, and many more.\n\nHow many siblings does Ha Jung-woo have?\n\nHe was born on March 11, 1978, in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nHis birth name is Kim Sung-woo and he is currently 40 years old.\n\nHe came from an acting family.\n\nHis father\u2019s name is Kim Yong-gun, a well-known veteran actor who has made appearances in many movies and television series.\n\nHis younger brother\u2019s name is Kim Young-hoon, an aspiring actor.\n\nHe always dreamed of becoming an actor like his father since the age of 5.\n\nHa Jung-woo: Education, School/College University\n\nHe joined a private acting institute and got actor Lee Beom-soo as his instructor.\n\nLater, he enrolled at Chung-Ang University and majored in theatre.\n\nHa Jung-woo: Professional Life and Career\n\nHe started his military service in 1998 and began working in the Armed Forces Public Relations Department.\n\nHa appeared in 10 promotional films for the military at that time.\n\nHe debuted acting in 2002 in the 2002 SBS sitcom \u2018Honest Living\u2019 and his feature film debut in the 2003 film \u2018Madeleine\u2019.\n\nJung- woo made his first starring role in the indie film \u2018The Unforgiven and became more famous after his performance in \u2018Time\u2019 and \u2018Breath\u2019.\n\nHe played the role of serial killer Yoo Young-Chul in the 2008 film \u2018The Chaser\u2019 and the movie became successful selling over 5 million tickets.\n\nIn the same year, he played in \u2018My Dear Enemy\u2019, \u2018The Moonlight of Seoul\u2019, \u2018Boat\u2019, \u2018Take Off\u2019, etc.\n\nHis remarkable films between 2009-2013 include \u2018Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time\u2019, \u2018Love Fiction\u2019, \u2018The Berlin File\u2019, \u2018And the Terror Live\u2019, where he made his collaborations with directors like Ryoo Seung-wans, Yoon Jong-bin, and so on.\n\nHe directed the movie \u2018Rollercoaster\u2019 and the film was a box office success.\n\nHa portrayed the role of the Joseon era in the film Kundo: Age of the Rampant.\n\nHe wrote, directed, and starred in \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant in 2015 and made his appearance in one of the biggest domestic hits of the year, \u2018Assassination\u2019.\n\nHis performance in movies include \u2018The Handmaiden\u2019 in 2016, \u2018Along With the Gods: The Two Worlds\u2019 in 2017, \u20181987: When the Day Comes\u2019 in 2017, Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days in 2018, and \u2018take Point\u2019 in 2018.\n\nRecently, he was cast in the science fiction film \u2018Mount Paektu\u2019.\n\nAlong with that, he is a fine artist.

How do you go about preparing for a specific role and do your preparations differ between films that are largely story-based and those that are essentially character studies?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Basically, I am full of curiosity and I am very interested in people. In fact, I love people. I normally get my first ideas about a specific character I am to play from screenwriters but in Korea most directors are also screenwriters so I always ask directors lots of questions like \u201cHow did this character start out\u201d or \u201cHow did you begin to develop this character\u201d. Essentially, I do a lot of research about a character whether it is for a story-led film or a character study and that\u2019s how I build the way in which I will play the role. For example, the character I played in \u2018My Dear Enemy\u2019 was actually modelled on the director\u2019s friend and so I was able to learn a great deal about him by asking the director. I read lots of novels, too, and that also helps to build up characters, in general. For each role I play, I endeavour to take on the persona of a real-life person to make the character more believable. If you take the example of \u2018The Chaser\u2019, you probably know that the character I played was a real person in Korea, the film was based on a real story, and so I looked into the police investigations of the case and how the main investigator had written descriptions of that person in his reports and how he had detailed that person\u2019s reactions to questions so that when the police interrogated the suspect in the film I could make my reactions as true-to-life as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 was your directorial debut. Why did you decide to move into directing and what were the challenges you faced directing the film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Being a director has always been part of my plan. It\u2019s not a new idea, I always intended to direct as well as act. I love working around films and yes, of course, I began my career as solely an actor but my plan for the future is to be both an actor and director. As far as the challenges of directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 are concerned, as I am an actor and I know how acting works I probably expected too much from the actors involved and perhaps my aim wad too high. \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 \u2013 the film that is screening tonight \u2013 was filmed right after I finished directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and because of that I was able to understand the director to a far greater degree \u2013 having been a director myself, I was able to communicate a lot better with the director of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. Communication is, of course, very important in day-to-day life but it\u2019s even more so in film.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I\u2019d like to ask you about Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 which I think was really your first much more straightforward action film; in terms of stunts and particularly the martial arts sequences. How did you find the training for the film and was the chance of doing some of that work what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I\u2019ve always very much liked director Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s action films and we always had a plan to work together on a film. However, we were unsure of what project that would be until \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 came up, and that was the film we ultimately ended up working on together. In my opinion, I would say \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 is a drama rather than an action film, but there we go, and for the action scenes I just did what I was told by the fight choreographer. I did a bit of action before but as an agent doing martial arts \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 was the first time so I guess because I felt I had no real experience I went to train at \u2018stunt school\u2019 and practiced rally hard; basically starting from learning how to punch properly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You\u2019ve mentioned acting and directing. I believe you have a film coming up called \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019, based on a Chinese novel, in which you act and direct at the same time. I wondered how that came about. Was it something you were a fan of or did someone else approach you?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Because it\u2019s a very interesting, funny story is the main reason I chose to work on \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019. About two years ago, I received a novel from a production company and the CEO of the production company is actually a friend of the writer. Initially I was offered a job as an actor in the production. The story, as I\u2019ve said, was really interesting but I felt I was too young to play the character so at that time I refused. Two years later, the same CEO came to see me on the set of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 and said there was no time to waste as the publication rights were close to running out, but I still refused because I\u2019m in my 30s [Ha Jung-woo laughs] and I told him if the rights could be extended to when I turn 40 then I would be interested. Just a couple of days later, he came back and said he had asked the writer if he could wait but he was unable to as the film would soon be made in China, anyway. The CEO said how much he loved the story and how he really wanted to see the film made in Korea and he agreed that he would be happy as long as it was done by 2014. So, shooting will go ahead next May. As I said, up to that point I was only going to be an actor in the film but after I accepted the role we met up to discuss who would be the director. Around the same time, I was editing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and there were some good rumours going round the editing room and shortly after that I heard that I had been chosen as the director, too. That was a proposal that really made my heart leap and so I accepted the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: Do any of the roles you play affect you outside of shooting? In \u2018The Chaser\u2019, for example, you play a very sadistic character. Is it difficult to switch off once shooting ends for the day?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t find it hard to switch off because when one role is close to completion I\u2019m always thinking of the next role to move on to. I try very hard not to bring what happens on set into my home and I make a real effort to separate my work and home life. I guess that\u2019s why I find it fairly easy to switch off from a specific character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: You appeared in two of director Kim Ki-duk\u2019s films, \u2018Breath\u2019 and \u2018Time\u2019. I wondered what it was like working with director Kim as he seems to be quite hard on his actors to get the performance he wants out of them?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I know it\u2019s rumoured that he\u2019s quite hard on actors but he wasn\u2019t like that at all when we worked together, and for me it was an absolute honour to have the chance to work with him. When you shoot a film, normally you met up to read the script together and that\u2019s how you first met and get to know the character you\u2019re going to play, etc. But with Kim Ki-duk there was no reading of the script for \u2018Time\u2019, and I don\u2019t know if he always does this or if it was just the case for this film, but he said the acting and building of the character was basically down to me, in a very trusting way. Eight years ago, I was quite a \u2018newbie\u2019 and I didn\u2019t have that much experience at the time, but the whole shoot was so comfortable I was really amazed that director Kim let me to decide on the character and the way to act. It was all done very comfortably and pleasurably as if I was working with my friends, unlike the rumour [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. When we worked on our second film together, \u2018Breath\u2019, it felt like we didn\u2019t talk about the film; we just talked about other things, really.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: You seem to be a multi-talented actor and director in the vein of James Franco; an American, he too acts, directs, he writes and he also paints. I know that you do painting as well, and I actually went to one of your exhibitions three years ago. What is it about painting that you enjoy? Do you feel it allows you to express something different to that of your films?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I graduated from university, I was practically unemployed. Obviously, I went for auditions but I had no tomorrow or certain future and it seemed just a continual repeat of mundane life. As such, I really wanted to do something creative and one day I just went to an art shop and bought a sketch book and paints and began painting. I found that while painting I was able to get rid of those worries about my future and it largely became both my life and my hobby. Once I began to get acting roles, my career moved up but still at times as an actor I\u2019ve felt quite isolated and my painting has served as a way to get rid of that feeling and discharge that emotion. On the set, I\u2019m forced to be logical and the director but I can feel quite emotional when I come home sometimes, whether I feel I did a good job of acting or not, and I guess when I see the end result of my painting it refreshes my mind and alleviates that stress. I guess my painting is my emotional diary.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: I\u2019ve been wondering why directors like Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan are always choosing you to run in films. What do you think directors see in you that makes them cast you in such roles; your characters often escaping from one place to another?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Maybe because I was born in the year of the horse [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan, after \u2018The Chaser\u2019 etc, recommended me to other directors saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make him run, and your film will definitely be successful\u201d [Ha Jung-woo laughs, again].\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: If I could just add to that, you also have a lot of eating scenes. Is that a special skill, too?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I always make sure they bring out hot food that you can actually eat, rather than just looking nice. In \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019, as you likely remember, there were many eating scenes; eating potatoes and hot dogs and they were really, really hot too \u2013 almost too hot to eat \u2013 and that really helped to make it more real and made expression easier. In Korea, there are many captured clips from films of me eating, with many of them online, and when I go to a restaurant with my friends there will always be one or two people filming me eating [Ha Jun-woo laughs]. So, it\u2019s really difficult for me to eat out in public. These days, when I see people in certain postures or making specific gestures, I know that they\u2019re trying to film me.\n\n\n\n\n\nCine_Asie: You come from a family of actors: Your father was a famous TV actor and your brother has started appearing in more and more television dramas, as well. When you started your career you acted in a TV series and you have since moved away into acting in films and have also added directing to your career. Earlier in the year, we met director Ryoo Seung-wan who has worked with his brother and as your brother is an actor, so far mostly in TV, are you considering working with him in film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Once I get more experience as a director then I should be able to cast my brother in a film. I think to shoot a film together as a family, rather than just being in a film as an actor, would be a good experience and something to remember.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Tonight, there will be a screening of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. How did you prepare yourself to be in character Young-hwa\u2019s shoes as a news announcer in a very tight space; two locations within a news room?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t think the small space matters that much. It\u2019s more about how the audience will see the film without feeling bored \u2013 because a newsroom is essentially a boring space. We talked a great deal about how to ensure the audience wouldn\u2019t feel bored in the space; different camera work, different cuts, and the use of multi-camera shots. The film comprises of 21 chapters and each chapter lasts for between five and ten minutes and we wanted to have a \u2018live\u2019 feel to it almost like a theatre. So, we shot non-stop for each chapter. The director had prepared for the film for five years and had prepared in such depth that he had shots from other films that he used and combined within the construct of the script and he showed me the demo film he had made. I think that in itself shows how much preparation he undertook.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: On a much more general subject, I have spoken to a lot of actors and directors who have talked about the difficulties faced by smaller independent film productions as a result of Korean film studios\u2019 continued focus on large budget blockbusters. As you are both an actor and a director, what are your thoughts on that issue?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I think the actual number of smaller film productions has increased in recent years because it\u2019s now so much easier to film in numerous ways; even with a mobile phone, as has been done on more than one occasion in Korea. So, even though there is indeed still ongoing pressure from large Korean film companies and studios for films that are either large budget blockbusters or almost certain money makers, I believe that the passion of those people who truly love films will enable small and independent films to continue to exist and even flourish.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I wanted to ask you about EJ Yong\u2019s film-within-a-film \u2018Behind the Camera\u2019, which you star in: Working with all those big name stars over what I believe was a tight two-day shooting schedule, what was it like working with a director who wasn\u2019t on set or even in the same country, for that matter?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It was amazing [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. To make it worse, I was working with EJ Yong on a different short film at the same time. So, in \u2018Behind the camera\u2019 I had a very small part and in the other short film I was the main actor. Director EJ Yong had a very clever idea to produce the film and we accomplished it through online chatting. I actually had another camera and I thought it was filming me, but it turned out it was just filming the background. In relation to the previous question about independent productions, because of directors like EJ Yong I don\u2019t think low budget films will disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You mentioned working with EJ Yong on another film and you have worked with other directors more than once, like Lee Yoon-ki, Kim Ki-duk, and Na Hong-jin. Is there one director you would still like to work with a second time, in the future?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Of course. I have talked about doing another film with director Kim Byung-woo, but we haven\u2019t decided on anything specific at this point. I feel very blessed and lucky to have met such good directors throughout my career and having good people around me has regularly made me want to work with a director on more than one film.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 premiered at this year\u2019s Busan International Film Festival. How did it feel to have your directorial debut premiere at such a prestigious film festival?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I went to the Busan Film Festival in 2005 with \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 as an actor and then this year I was invited to go as a director. So, it felt really great and the festival itself felt very different going in as a director and I felt much closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: A number of Korean actors and directors have tried to make or appear in films in the US. You appeared in a US/South Korean film by Gina Kim [Never Forever] but would you choose to appear in or direct a film in the US?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I do have plans to, and I\u2019d also like to but I can\u2019t really say much about that specifically, at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: Could you tell us a little bit about your next project \u2018Kundo\u2019 which I believe is a historical film? Is it more difficult or more fun to play in an historical film rather than a modern role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It\u2019s not fun at all. In the summer, Korea was very hot and I had to wear long trousers and big boots - layers and layers of clothing - and I had a shaved head and I had to have a beard and wear burnt make-up. So, it was incredibly difficult. There were also many horse-riding scenes and because it was so hot, the horses wouldn\u2019t listen or do what they were told. Nothing was easy at any given time during shooting. People might think that having a shaved head would be cool, but I spent so long in the sun that at night I could even feel the heat coming up again. So, I was able to learn quite a lot about solar energy [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: Prior to \u2018Project 577\u2019 you made a promise to the Korean people that resulted in a beautiful documentary about Korea. Do you feel you freed your spirit and do you think the rest of the actors hate you now? [In 2010, Ha Jung-woo won an award at the PaekSang Arts Awards and promised he would walk across Korea if he won the award again\u2026 He won the award the subsequent year and convinced some acting friends to go with him on his 577km journey to fulfil that promise].\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: After that incident, I\u2019ve never talked about anything like that again but through that three week cross-country walking trip I learnt a lot and realised that parts of Korea I didn\u2019t know about are really beautiful. I was lucky that Korea is small [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: You have been in a number of action films, The Chaser, \u2018Yellow Sea, \u2018The Berlin File\u2019, and normally no stunt men are used and you have to do the action scenes yourself. How do you endure the pain until the director says \u201cOk, that\u2019s the perfect shot\u201d?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I didn\u2019t do all the action and fighting scenes myself. There is a \u2018double\u2019 who looks exactly like me from the back. So, it wasn\u2019t all me.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: You are almost instantly recognisable in the majority of your roles but in 2006 you played a far less recognisable part in \u2018The Fox Family\u2019. What specific difficulties were there in working in a musical fantasy as opposed to a straightforward action film or drama and what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I received the script, I was very much reminded of Tim Burton\u2019s work and I tried to get the feel for the character from his films. That\u2019s also what attracted me to the part and though I\u2019m not sure how audiences felt about the role I played it was Burton\u2019s work that I based my performance on. As far as the musical aspect of the film and the dancing sequences are concerned, because I began my career as a theatre actor I didn\u2019t find any real difficulty in performing as I was required to.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: You\u2019ve been lucky to never have been typecast \u2013 you\u2019ve played in a variety of roles from romantic lead to spy to serial killer. I wondered what sort of roles you like playing most and is there anything you\u2019d like to try that you haven\u2019t yet?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: My dream role would be Hamlet on stage because I did theatre studies and being Hamlet to any theatre actor is a blessing and an honour. I was actually offered a job in 2009 but as I was so busy making \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 I wasn\u2019t able to do it, but hopefully before I get too old I\u2019ll get the opportunity to play Hamlet. Choi Min-sik, who I believe was here in England recently, played Hamlet in 1999 and ten years later to celebrate the role I was offered the part, but as I said I was at that time too busy to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: We talked about the directing of \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 but as far as the writing is concerned did you have some collaboration?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Obviously I got ideas from the actors and actresses involved when we were reading the script but the film was actually based on a real story, experienced by Ryoo Seung-beom.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: What has been the most physically demanding role you\u2019ve had to date?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Without question, \u2018Kundo\u2019 was by far the most physically demanding as a result of the heat alone. In that film I was using a very knife while the other actor was using a long sword and I was worried that I might actually get cut or injured. Whenever I talk about physically demanding roles, \u2018Kundo\u2019 will always be the one I mention. Before that film, I would probably have said \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 because the shooting was for 11 months and also took place in suburban China.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: Who are the directors and actors who have inspired you throughout your career?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: There are many: Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Tim Burton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Downey Jr, even perhaps James Franco [Ha Jung-woo laughs]\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Choi Min-sik is going to star in Luc Besson\u2019s \u2018Lucy\u2019 with Scarlett Johansson. Are you interested in working with foreign directors and cast members in order to extend your work in terms of different cultures\u2019 film productions?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I am open to the idea. In fact, I had a call from South Africa at one point but I thought it was too far to go. Hopefully at some point in the future a suitable opportunity will arise.\n\nOn behalf of everyone involved, I'd sincerely like to thank the Korean Cultural Centre UK for allowing us all to interview actor Ha Jung-woo at such length. Also, many thanks to Sinae Hong for her superb interpreting throughout the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.kepoper.com/actor-ha-jung-woo-profile-movie-drama-facts-and-tmi/", "page_content": "Ha Jung Woo Profile\n\nBirth Name: \uae40\uc131\ud6c8 (Kim Sung Hoon)\n\n\uae40\uc131\ud6c8 (Kim Sung Hoon) Stage Name: \ud558\uc815\uc6b0 (Ha Jung Woo)\n\n\ud558\uc815\uc6b0 (Ha Jung Woo) Nationality: South Korean\n\nSouth Korean Date of Birth: 1978.03.11\n\n1978.03.11 Zodiac Sign: Pisces\n\nPisces Chinese Zodiac: Horse\n\nHorse Height: 183.7 cm (6\u201902\u201d)\n\n183.7 cm (6\u201902\u201d) Weight: N/A\n\nN/A Blood Type: A\n\nA Agency: Workhouse Company\n\nWorkhouse Company Personal Social Media: N/A\n\nHa Jung Woo Facts & TMI\n\nHa Jung Woo was born as Kim Sung Hoon.\n\nHe was born in Seoul and grew up in the neighborhood of Gangnam.\n\nHis family consists of father Kim Yong Gun and younger brother Kim Young Hoon (born 1980), both are actors.\n\nHe is Christian.\n\nHe uses the stage name Ha Jung Woo because he wants people to acknowledge him as Ha Jung Woo himself instead of veteran actor Kim Yong Gun\u2019s son.\n\nHis father recommended the stage name Geum Sung Hoon, be he refused to use the name.\n\nBesides acting he had directed several movies including \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019.\n\nHa Jung Woo debuted in a 2002\u2019s movie titled \u2018Madeleine\u2019.\n\nHe made his very first TV appearance through SBS sitcom \u2018Honest Living\u2019 in 2002.\n\nAt the moment, Ha Jung Woo is widely known as an actor representing Chungmuro (South Korea\u2019s equivalent to Hollywood) in the 21st century.\n\nSince his debut, he has been continuously releasing movies every year without rest except when he served in the army.\n\nHe enlisted in the army at the age of 22 as an active-duty soldier.\n\nEver since his debut, he has been consistently receiving praises for his acting.\n\nAs of August 2018, Ha Jung Woo has recorded a cumulative viewers number of 100 million, making him the youngest actor to reach a 100 million viewers milestone.\n\nHe was the president of the student body in his junior high school.

Since he was not very famous back then, so the news was overlooked.\n\nAs his popularity increased significantly in 2008 after starring in the movie \u2018The Chaser\u2019, it was widely highlighted by the public that he was the son of Kim Yong Gun.\n\nIn December 2019, Ha Jung Woo was blackmailed by a hacker that threatened to leak his pictures, conversations, and other personal information from his cellphone for 1.5 billion won. Instead of fulfilling the hacker\u2019s wish, Ha Jung Woo calmly responded to him and bought time for police to capture the hacker.

Titled Assassination, the project is eyeing some big talent for leading roles. Ha Jung-woo, Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae are also considering major parts in Choi's follow-up to The Thieves, the 2012 hit caper film that became the second most viewed Korean film of all time by accruing almost 13 million admissions domestically.\n\nSave for featuring an assassination plot that takes place in the 1930s, little has been revealed about the film's plot, yet the period setting and potentially huge cast in the sure hands of Choi is more than just a little tantalizing. Though adept at big spectacle, as shown in Woochi (2009) and The Thieves, Choi's strong suit as a director is keeping his films squarely focused on characters, despite the many moving parts that surround them. Choi also directed The Big Swindle (2004) and Tazza: The High Rollers (2006).\n\nThe redhot Ha Jung-woo became known to international viewers in Na Hong-jin's films The Chaser (2008) and The Yellow Sea (2010) and is now one of the industry's biggest stars following his 2013 hits The Berlin File and The Terror Live. He will next be seen in period action film Kundo: The Age of the Rampant and Chronicles of a Blood Merchant, which he is also directing. Jun Ji-hyun, a star since 2001's My Sassy Girl and Ha's co-star in The Berlin File, and Lee Jung-jae, who also had a great 2013 with New World and The Face Reader, both previously worked with Choi on The Thieves. The thesps are currently considering parts for the film that is aiming for a 2015 release."}]}
