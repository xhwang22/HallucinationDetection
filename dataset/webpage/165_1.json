{"Geoff Griffin played for South Sydney Rabbitohs, Eastern Suburbs Roosters, North Sydney Bears, and Balmain Tigers.": [{"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2021/01/29/the-forgotten-players-south-sydney-rabbitohs/", "page_content": "This is the 28th and final episode in the series where we look at some of the forgotten players from your favourite club.\n\nThe series has covered all of the current clubs, those that disappeared in mergers, those that came and went and those that just disappeared.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how many players have come and gone through the various clubs over the years, how many who had brief careers, how many who had their careers cut short by injury, how many went from club to club like footballing nomads and how many became club stalwarts and legends.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nThis is the last in the series, so it\u2019s fitting that we end with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, not only one of the two remaining foundation clubs and a club that won the first premiership in 2008 and then went back to back in 2009 but also a club that faced extinction at the end of the 1999 season only to be reborn bigger and better than ever in 2002.\n\nIn total 1142 players have proudly represented the Rabbitohs since Arthur Hennessy led the team out for their first-ever match at Birchgrove Oval in April 1908, and the list is littered with both club legends and icons of the game, including Clive Churchill, Ian Moir, Bobby McCarthy, John Sattler, John Sutton, Eric Simms, Michael Cleary, Greg Inglis, Howard Hallett, Elwyn Walters, Harold Horder, Benny Wearing, Ron Coote, Ernie Hammerton, Nathan Merritt, Johnny Graves, Bernie Purcell, Sam Burgess, George Treweek, Jack Rayner, Adam Reynolds \u2013 and so the list goes on and on.\n\nHere is a team made up of some of South Sydney\u2019s lesser lights who represented the club since the mid-60s. How many do you remember?\n\n1. Bronko Djura\n\nDjura had two stints with Souths and a season with St George and ended his career with a cameo with Wests. He was a Newtown junior and a very talented sportsman, representing Australia at schoolboy level in both rugby league and cricket. He made his first-grade debut for Souths in 1984 and had three seasons with the club. After a season with St George he returned to the Rabbitohs in 1988 for another two years. In all he played 79 games for Souths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Bernie Lowther\n\nLowther was a very fast and powerful outside back with a knack for taking intercepts. He came from the Auckland competition to join Canterbury Bankstown in 1972 and then joined Souths for the 1975 and 1976 seasons, playing 42 first-grade games. He later played and coached in the Brisbane competition. He also played nine Tests for New Zealand.\n\n3. Jacin Sinclair\n\nSinclair was an exceptional talent but a player whose career was hampered both by injury and the pressure of living up to his early promise and accolades. He made his debut in the top grade with Balmain in 1991 but then headed to Souths in 1994 after a fallout with Balmain coach Alan Jones. He had three years with the Rabbitohs, playing 28 first grade games, before moving on to Easts. Sinclair passed away at the age of just 38.\n\n4. Bob Honan\n\nHonan was a dual international, playing two rugby Tests against the All Blacks and going on to play two league Tests against the Kiwis. Blessed with speed and a great step, he switched from the Brothers Rugby Club in Brisbane to South Sydney in 1967 after being controversially left out of the Wallabies tour side that year, and he went on to play 89 first-grade games with the club, winning premierships in both 1968 and 1970.\n\n5. Henderson Gill\n\nGill scored nearly 200 tries in his 300-plus-game career over 14 years. A Great Britain international who played 15 Tests, Gill was both quick and elusive, and his only experience in the Australian competition came in 1985 when he joined the Rabbitohs for eight games during the English off-season.\n\n6. Ken Wright\n\nWhat Wright lacked in size he made up for with both acceleration and great footwork. He first came to notice when playing for the Randwick Rugby Club, and he went on to play nine Tests for the Wallabies and six games for the Waratahs. He switched to league with Eastern Suburbs in 1979 and eventually arrived at Souths in 1982, where he played 36 games for the club over the next two years.\n\n7. Brett Kearney\n\nKearney was a solid performer who could play anywhere in the spine. He came to Souths in 2003 from the Central Coast via the Bears juniors and played 28 first-grade games for the Rabbitohs over the next three years before having three years with the Sharks. He moved to the UK in 2010 and played 112 top-level games for Bradford over the next five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Harry Eden\n\nEden began life a centre and somehow ended up in the front row, and he just loved the physical encounters. After making his first-grade debut with the Roosters in 1969, he had a few seasons with the Dragons and then ended up at Souths in 1974, where he played 38 first-grade games over the next two years. Eden was both super fit and very quick for a front-rower and was a noted try-scorer, running in 27 tries in his 73-game first-grade career.\n\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\n9. Lee Jackson\n\nLee Jackson was quite simply one of the best hookers to lace on a boot. He came from the UK to Souths in 1995 and played just eight games for the club before joining the Knights in 1996 and helping them to their first premiership in 1997. The rest of his long and successful career was played in England, and he also played 23 Tests for the Great Britain and English sides.\n\n10. John Burke\n\nJohn Burke was an old-school English front-rower who was not afraid to push the boundaries on the field, resulting in him being sent off more than 20 times during his 16-year career. He joined Souths in 1976 and played ten first-grade games for the club that year, joining other formidable Souths front-rowers in John O\u2019Neill and George Piggins. Playing against John Burke was not for the faint-hearted.\n\n11. Kane Cleal\n\nKane Cleal is the son of the legendary Noel Cleal and came from the bush to join Manly, making his first-grade debut for the club in 2004. Cleal joined Souths in 2006 and never really hit top form, playing just nine games for the Rabbitohs that year and being released at the end of the season.\n\n12. Tony Rampling\n\nYou always knew what you were going to get when Rampling took the field \u2013 hard and straight ball running, kamikaze defence and a large dose of mongrel. Rampling had two stints with Souths. He made his first-grade debut for the club in 1981 and played for the Rabbitohs for the next six seasons, also playing three Origin matches for New South Wales along the way. After stints with both Easts and the Gold Coast during the 1987 and 1988 seasons he returned to Souths in 1989 before spending time with both Salford in the UK and Western Suburbs. In all he played 91 first-grade games for the Rabbitohs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Ashley Harrison\n\nA former Australian Schoolboys representative, Harrison was playing in the Brisbane competition when he was called up to first grade by the Broncos in 2000, winning a premiership that year. One of the best lock forwards in the game at the time, he signed with South Sydney in 2003 and went on to play 66 games for the club over the next three years before moving on to the Roosters and then the Titans. He played 277 first-grade games in his 15-year career and 15 Origin matches for Queensland. He was one of the best players never to receive an Australian jersey.\n\n14. Troy Slattery\n\nSlattery was a versatile player and at different times played five-eighth and virtually every position in the pack. He made his first-grade debut with the Bunnies in 1993 and played 46 top-level games between 1993 and 1999 before finishing his career in England.\n\n15. Rick Stone\n\nRick Stone never really hit the heights as a player \u2013 in fact his only three first-grade appearances were off the bench with Souths in 1989. However, since his retirement as a player he has established himself as a quality coach, holding the clipboard for both the Newcastle Knights and the Huddersfield Giants.\n\n16. Paul McNicholas\n\nOne of the biggest players going around in his day, McNicholas was another who had two stints with Souths. He made his top-level debut with Souths in 1996 and went on to play 26 games for the club over the next four years. He then had a couple of years with the Sharks before rejoining Souths in 2002, notching up another eight first-grade games. He then headed to the Cowboys in 2003 before finishing his career in England. He also played three Tests for Ireland.\n\n17. Jaiman Lowe\n\nA hard nut by any standard, Lowe was a big and rugged forward who came to the Rabbitohs from the Cowboys in 2006 and played 50 first-grade games for the club over the next five seasons. He then moved on to the Storm and 2012 premiership success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks for following the series."}, {"url": "https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/12/14/nrl-2020-in-memoriam/", "page_content": "The rugby league world said goodbye to several well-known players, coaches, administrators and people associated with the sport in 2020.\n\nBrian James\n\n1943-January 10, 2020\n\nA high-quality winger for South Sydney who represented Australia at the 1968 World Cup before retiring at the age of 26.\n\nThe son of former Cootamundra Maher Cup prop Jack \"Swifty\" James, he came to rugby league via rugby union after attending Newington College and playing a season of first grade with the St George rugby club.\n\nHe switched to rugby league with St George in 1961 where he played centre and wing but top-grade opportunities were scarce in the Dragons\u2019 star-studded backline, so he made the decision to transfer to South Sydney in 1966.\n\nHe was quickly vindicated, playing more first-grade games in his first season with Souths (18) then he did in four years at St George (16). A winger of above average pace (he pursued professional sprinting in the off-season), James earned his first representative jersey with City Seconds in 1967 before making City Firsts the following year.\n\nHe progressed to NSW selection and then was named in Australia\u2019s 19-man squad for the World Cup. Although overlooked for the opening games he was given an opportunity in the pool match against France.\n\nAustralia won easily but James saw little of the ball and the chance to play his way into the top 13 for the final was lost. James played in four consecutive lower-grade grand finals with St George (winning all but one) before appearing in three first-grade deciders with the Rabbitohs.\n\nHe shared in Souths\u2019 triumphs over Canterbury in 1967 and Manly in 1968 but tasted defeat against Balmain in 1969. James retired soon after to pursue a career in transport and logistics.\n\nHe died on January 10 following an accident on his property at Capertee in central-western NSW.\n\nMark Harris\n\n1947-January 15, 2020\n\nMark Harris was a blockbusting centre who made his mark with Eastern Suburbs in the early 1970s and in 1974 helped secure the club its first premiership title in 29 years.\n\nHarris made a meteoric rise with the Roosters after being signed sight unseen by officials, who had heard of his exploits with the Kone Tigers in Port Moresby.\n\nHarris was a first-grader after only a handful of games in the lower grades at Easts and by the end of his first season was chosen in Australia\u2019s 1970 World Cup squad. A cousin of former Test prop Dud Beattie, Harris played on the wing in the brutal Cup final against Great Britain, won 12-7 by Australia at Headingley and figured in a second World Cup campaign in France two years later.\n\nHis career took a sudden detour in 1973 after his kicking abilities were identified by an American radio broadcaster who had undertaken a worldwide search for a kicker for the Boston Patriots NFL team.\n\nHarris tried out with the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles before landing a contract with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. Harris struggled to learn the nuances of the new code and was frustrated that his input was limited to taking kick-offs.\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Harris scores as Coote and Beetson split the Bulldogs\n\nHe returned to Easts in 1974 and resumed his centre partnership with former Wallaby John Brass. Under Jack Gibson\u2019s direction, Harris recaptured his rampaging attacking form and scored a crucial grand final try against Canterbury.\n\nA fractured leg in the preliminary final against Manly cost Harris the chance of back-to-back titles with Easts a year later but he continued to flourish at representative level and helped Australia to another World Cup title in 1977.\n\nAfter playing 195 first-grade games in a decade with Easts, Harris crossed the bridge to join North Sydney for the final two seasons of his career in 1980 and 1981. He died in Sydney on January 15 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nGreg Hawick\n\n1932-February 6, 2020\n\nEven before Greg Hawick played his first Test for Australia, he was described by former Test captain Len Smith as \u201cthe most competently versatile footballer the rugby league code has had since Jim Craig in the 1920s.\u201d\n\nIt was praise that the young South Sydney player lived up to over the next decade, featuring in four different positions in a 10-Test career for his country. Hawick displayed versatility from his earliest days as a footballer, alternating between lock and five-eighth at Gardener\u2019s Road Junior Technical School and even filling in at centre and wing when required.\n\nHe played primarily five-eighth for the Rabbitohs and occupied that role when Souths ended an 18-year premiership drought in 1950. But in his first three Tests for Australia he played five-eighth, lock and halfback to effectively cement his reputation as one of the game\u2019s great all-rounders.\n\nHe added a second premiership title with Souths in 1954 but injury cost him the chance of winning three more when he missed deciders in 1951 (broken jaw), 1953 (shoulder) and 1955 (knee). Hawick headed bush in 1957, joining Wagga Kangaroos and lifting the club from the doldrums to win back-to-back titles in 1962-63.\n\nIt was in 1957 that Hawick etched his name in the record books by booting 15 goals for NSW in a 69-5 demolition of Queensland. Hawick returned to Sydney in 1959 for two seasons with Norths but afterwards settled into country life.\n\nHis only foray back into the big smoke was an unedifying stint as North Sydney coach in 1985.\n\nNamed in South Sydney\u2019s all-time Dream Team in 2004 (on the bench) and in the NRL\u2019s Team of the 1950s in 2007 (at five-eighth), he died in Wagga Wagga on February 6, aged 87.\n\nDon Furner\n\n1932-February 24, 2020\n\nDon Furner was best known as the foundation coach of Canberra but his years with the Raiders were only part of the story of a remarkable lifelong contribution to the game.\n\nFurner\u2019s career began as a player in the Balmain juniors in the 1940s and culminated in selection for the Kangaroos in 1956 and a Test jersey against Great Britain.\n\nHis journey included stints at Toowoomba, where he shared in five consecutive Bulimba Cup titles in the annual triangular tournament with Brisbane and Ipswich, at Mackay and Mitchell in rural Queensland, along with Tumbarumba, Junee and Queanbeyan in southern NSW.\n\nFurner quit playing in 1966 but continued to coach Queanbeyan United, steering the club to five grand finals and three premierships. He took on the Eastern Suburbs coaching job in 1970 and guided a team that included Arthur Beetson and Ron Coote to the grand final in 1972.\n\nReturning to Queanbeyan, Furner coached representative teams including Monaro and Country Firsts and Seconds. The Raiders endured a tough initiation into the NSWRL competition but Furner built steadily, eventually enticing high calibre players Mal Meninga, Gary Belcher, Steve Walters and Peter Jackson to the club and, in partnership with Wayne Bennett, led the Raiders to their first grand final in 1987.\n\nFurner coached the Australian team on a second undefeated Kangaroo tour in 1986 and plotted Australia\u2019s defeat of New Zealand in the 1988 World Cup final.\n\nHe became Australia\u2019s chairman of selectors for a decade and coached Fiji at the 2000 World Cup. Furner\u2019s legacy at the Raiders was carried on by his sons David (200 first grade games) and Don jnr (CEO since 2007). Don snr passed away in Canberra on February 24, aged 87.\n\nDon 'Bandy' Adams\n\n1934-March 4, 2020\n\nA stockily built dairy farmer from Nelson Plains in the Hunter Valley, Adams was the star of Australia\u2019s 1956 home series win over New Zealand before he winged his way to England with the Kangaroos.\n\nHis chance at Test level came in the lead-up to the first Test against the Kiwis, when Newcastle\u2019s Brian Carlson injured a leg at training. Adams emerged the hero of a knife\u2019s edge contest at the Sydney Cricket Ground, scoring two tries in Australia\u2019s 12-9 win, including a long-distance match-winner with a minute to play.\n\nAfter seeing little of the ball in a forwards-dominated second Test in Brisbane, won 8-2 by Australia, Adams played another blinder in the third, crossing for a hat-trick of tries in a 31-14 cakewalk and guaranteeing his place among the Kangaroo tourists later in the year.\n\nAdams hit the ground running in England, scoring the first try of the tour, and four for the match against Liverpool. But his progress was slowed by a knee to a kidney at Barrow and despite finishing with 11 tries from 15 games, he played only the one Test against Great Britain and one against France.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where his big-time representative career ended. Adams came to Sydney with Country teams in 1957 and 1958 but after that he was content to stay in the Hunter where he turned from farming to work as a telephone linesman.\n\nAdams played 11 seasons with Maitland, before stints as player coach at Gloucester, Scone and Muswellbrook. His eldest son, David, later played first grade with Manly and Balmain. Don died at Scone on March 4 at the age of 86.\n\nTony Branson\n\n1946-April 1, 2020\n\nTony Branson took the ride of a lifetime in 1967, progressing from first grade at the Nowra Warriors all the way to a Kangaroo tour, where he scored a glorious try to set up Australia\u2019s Ashes victory at Swinton and then played all three Tests against the French.\n\nThe 20-year-old pivot was virtually unknown to Sydney crowds at the start of that season but after representing Group 7 and Southern Division, he played for Country Firsts and then NSW before beating no less a player than Bob Fulton for a place in the Kangaroo squad.\n\nHe signed on with St George after the tour. There he came face-to-face with another high-profile five-eighth, Phil Hawthorne, recruited from Wallaby ranks the same year. Branson admitted in a 2010 interview that he was blindsided by Hawthorne\u2019s signing and claimed he had no idea that he had signed with St George as a centre.\n\nBranson didn\u2019t have the speed for the position and although he tried hard to make a success of the role, his confidence and form suffered and he was eventually dumped to reserve grade. Branson stayed with the Dragons until 1973, playing 101 top grade games and appearing in the club\u2019s 1971 grand final loss to South Sydney.\n\nHe signed with Wollongong before returning to Nowra in 1977 and finally hanging up his boots. He died on April 1, aged 73.\n\nArthur Summons\n\n1935-May 16, 2020\n\nArthur Summons was never one to dwell on the disappointments that could have dimmed the great moments of a career of outstanding endeavour in two rugby codes.\n\nWell before he became the Western Suburbs and Australian captain and then one of the iconic figures adorning the game\u2019s premiership trophy, Summons enjoyed resounding success in rugby union. He played 10 Tests for the Wallabies, debuting against the Springboks in 1956 before touring the British Isles in 1957-58.\n\nHe made the decision to switch to league in 1960 and within two seasons he had become a dual international, playing the first of nine Test matches in his new code.\n\nSummons was appointed Test captain for the third Test of 1962, beginning an undefeated run of five Tests as skipper.\n\nIn 1963 he was selected as captain-coach of the Kangaroos touring team and even though a knee injury kept him out of the three Ashes Tests, he remained at the helm of the first all-Australian team to win the Ashes on British soil.\n\nHe played in three grand finals in five seasons with Western Suburbs, all of them ending in heartache at the hands of St George, the 1963 defeat hurt the most.\n\nIt was a controversial finish and involved a hint of scandal but for Summons there was a silver lining. The photograph snapped by Sun-Herald sharpshooter John O\u2019Gready just after the full-time siren proved to be a life-changer.\n\nHis muddy embrace with Dragons skipper Norm Provan became rugby league\u2019s most famous image, the basis for the game\u2019s premiership trophies since 1982 and led to a lifelong friendship with his former rival that was only broken by Summons\u2019 death on May 16.\n\nBobby Dimond\n\n1929-May 30, 2020\n\nThe passing of Bobby Dimond in a Gold Coast retirement home in May marked the end of an era. Dimond was the last surviving member of the 1948-49 Kangaroos, the first team to tour Great Britain and France after World War II.\n\nDimond was the baby of the tour, becoming only the second Kangaroo (after Charles \"Chook\" Fraser in 1911) to celebrate his 19th birthday while in England. Dimond failed to make the Test team but gained invaluable experience in 15 tour games, playing mostly as a winger and occasionally at centre.\n\nHe came into first grade at Dapto at the age of 16 and played his first senior representative football early in 1948, turning out for Country Firsts and NSW before sailing for England aboard the Maloja with his Kangaroo teammates later in the year.\n\nHe had begun to make his mark in Sydney football with Western Suburbs when he suffered fractures and a severe concussion in a motorcycle accident which ruled him out of the game for two years.\n\nHe attempted a comeback with St George in 1954 but fractured his wrist in a trial and after making a brief comeback at Kempsey in 1955, Dimond was selected for Country Seconds but was forced to withdraw with injury.\n\nDimond\u2019s younger brother Peter toured with the Kangaroos in 1963-64. Bobby was 90 when he died on May 30.\n\nNoel Kelly\n\n1936-June 14, 2020\n\n\"Ned\" was as rough and rugged as they come. Raised in rural Queensland, Kelly took to rugby league like he was made for it and stood his ground against the toughest opponents that played the game in his era.\n\nHe cut his teeth in the ultra-tough Bulimba Cup competition (Ipswich-Brisbane-Toowoomba) in the late 1950s, wore his first Australian jersey in 1959 and became a fixture in the Test line-up for a decade. He became the first front-rower to make three Kangaroo tours (1959-60, 1963-64 and 1967-68) and played 72 games for his country, including 28 Tests.\n\nIn club football, Kelly ensured that few teams enjoyed playing Western Suburbs as he dished out his own brand of punishment for nine seasons. He played 111 games of premiership football for Wests, a figure undoubtedly diminished by regular suspensions.\n\nHis top-level career wound up in 1969 before a brief stint as captain-coach at Wollongong. Kelly became non-playing coach of North Sydney from 1973-76 but apart from steering the Bears to a mid-week final, success proved elusive.\n\nHe remained heavily involved in the game, his character shining through as a panelist on Rex Mossop\u2019s Controversy Corner and he later rendered outstanding service to the Men of League organisation.\n\nIn 2008 Kelly was bestowed the ultimate honour when named in the Australian Rugby League Team of the Century, at hooker. He passed away on June 14 following a brief illness, aged 84.\n\nKeith Middleton\n\n1931-August 24, 2020\n\nKeith Middleton was still a teenager when he achieved his greatest moment in rugby league, throwing the final pass for the try that won the Ashes for Australia after a 30-year drought.\n\nOn any other day it would have been applauded as a slick, if regulation, backline movement but with the SCG a quagmire, the Ashes up for grabs and the match delicately balanced at 2-all, the pressure was intense.\n\nFrom an Australian scrum win, Keith Holman, Frank Stanmore and Doug McRitchie played their part before Middleton sent winger Ron Roberts galloping away for the match-winning try.\n\nMiddleton emerged from the NSW far south coast town of Bermagui, playing his early football as a half and five-eighth before shifting to centre when he joined North Sydney as a 17-year-old in 1948.\n\nHe was selected for Australia for the first Test in 1950 after only one representative game for City Seconds. Middleton\u2019s performances in all three Tests caught the eye of former Test captain Len Smith, who was convinced that the young centre was poised for a long representative career.\n\nApart from one further appearance for NSW, and a couple of games for City, he played no further rep football. By 1955 he announced his retirement to pursue a career as a building executive.\n\nHe made a brief comeback with South Sydney in 1956 before retiring for good at 25. He died at Miranda on August 24, aged 89.\n\nGary Parcell\n\n1933-November 30, 2020\n\nA farmer from Harrisville, a small rural hamlet 25km south of Ipswich, Gary Parcell gained fame as a rugged second-rower or prop in a 10-year career in which he represented Ipswich, Queensland and Australia.\n\nHe won a place in Ipswich Brothers\u2019 first-grade side as an 18-year-old in 1952. He played his first representative game the following season against the American All Stars and the first of 34 Bulimba Cup matches for Ipswich the same year.\n\nBy 1956 he emulated his father Perce Parcell when he was chosen for Queensland. Perce had represented the Maroons in two interstate games in 1924-25. Gary went on to surpass his father\u2019s tally, appearing 12 times in interstate matches and in three games against international opposition.\n\nParcell achieved a breakthrough year in 1959 when he helped the Maroons to a rare series victory over NSW (it turned out to be their last until the 1982 State of Origin series) and from there was chosen to tour with the Kangaroos.\n\nHe made his Test debut at Swinton in a 22-14 victory and went on to play in four of the six Tests on tour. He played his first Test on Australian soil against France in 1960, forming a famous all-Ipswich front row, along with Dud Beattie and Noel Kelly. The trio were part of Australia\u2019s World Cup squad in England later the same year. Parcell played his final Test in 1962.\n\nHis son Steve carried on the family tradition, representing Queensland Residents on a tour of France in 1989, while grandson Matt played NRL for Brisbane and Manly before forging a successful career in the English Super League. Gary Parcell died at Harrisville on November 30, aged 87.\n\nFrank Mulcare\n\nA fiery West Coast second-rower who played in four consecutive New Zealand Test wins over Australia at Brisbane, Sydney, Christchurch and Wellington in 1952-53.\n\nHe played 18 Tests (among 46 games) for the Kiwis from 1951 to 1956. Was one of four Kiwis attached to the injury-hit 1953 American All Stars touring team in New Zealand.\n\nMulcare retired at 26 the when NZRL refused him a clearance to play in Australia (where he met his wife on the 1952 tour). He became chief police prosecutor in Christchurch in the 1960s before farming in Northland until his death. Inducted in NZRL Legends of League in 2007. He died in Whangarei on January 5, aged 90.\n\nTed Curran\n\nA second-rower for NSW country clubs Adelong, Temora and Thirroul in the 1950s before becoming long-term Country and NSW selector. Curran turned 18 the day he made his representative debut for Country Seconds in 1952 before representing Combined Riverina and Western Division against that year\u2019s touring Kiwi side.\n\nHe shifted from Adelong to Temora in 1953 and represented Riverina against the American All Stars.\n\nAnd in 1958 he moved to Thirroul, representing Southern Division against Great Britain (1958) and New Zealand (1959). He died on January 9, aged 85.\n\nManfred Moore\n\nAn American-born winger who played five first grade games for Newtown in 1977 but left an impression that lived on among supporters of the Jets and the wider league community. A member of the Super Bowl-winning Oakland Raiders outfit of 1977, Moore was enticed to Sydney by advertising guru and Jets supporter John Singleton.\n\nThe 26-year-old arrived amid great fanfare, scored a try with one of his first touches but afterwards struggled to adapt to the new code. Moore returned to the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings and after retiring became a church minister. He returned to Australia for a reunion in 2007. Moore died in California on January 11, aged, 69.\n\nPaul Fisher\n\nA utility player for Cronulla in nine first-grade games (1995-97) after moving from Brisbane to play under coach John Lang in 1994.\n\nThe Souths-Sunnybank junior was equally at home at fullback, halfback and hooker.

But our initial formation goes back to September 1907 when Arthur Stephen Hennessy organised a meeting to form the club at his house in 9 Chapman Street, Surry Hills. He sent out letters to all rugby clubs in the district inviting interested parties to attend. The response was less than overwhelming, with George Ball, Billy Cann and Johnny McGrath being the only ones present with Hennessy, while Ed Fry sent his full support behind the new club and an apology for not being able to attend owing to a previous engagement. Hennessy, Cann and Fry were the three local players who had taken part in the three matches against the NZ All Golds, which were all played under rugby union rules because the Northern Union rule book didn\u2019t arrive by boat from the UK until January 1908. The seeds of our club were first sprouted at this meeting by the five brave men who were the real Founders of our grand old club, and in December 1955 Souths commissioned a photo to be taken of the five men. This photo was proudly displayed in the offices of the old Souths Leagues Club.\n\nBack Row (L-R): Billy Cann, Johnny McGrath. Front Row: George Ball, Arthur Hennessy and Edward Fry.\n\nA number of other meetings were convened during the spring and summer of 1907-08 to form the district club, and the co-founders also helped in organising fliers across the South Sydney district which read: \u201cSOUTH SYDNEY \u2013 all footballers in this district should join this club for these reasons; play for yourself and your club\u2019s advantage or play for the Union to their advantage, and no return to yourself. Savee?\u201d But despite those humble beginnings, the small band of believers managed to garner more and more support, culminating in an historic meeting at Redfern Town Hall on January 17, 1908 where South Sydney was officially formed. One of the documents held by the NSW Rugby League is the receipt signed by J.J. Giltinan which lists Souths as the number 2 affiliated club with the NSWRL (North Sydney were the first to affiliate).\n\nIn a 1931 interview, George Ball said of that night in 1908: \u201cThe attendance was excellent, quite a number of those present, no doubt, being attracted to the meeting out of curiosity, as much had been written in the press concerning the new code and the likelihood of disqualification from the Rugby Union of anyone who had the temerity to join up with the New Movement.\u201d Despite strong initial opposition from those who continued to support rugby union, the club made significant progress, with regular training sessions being held at Moore Park, where the players were taught the rules of Northern Union football. On 21st March 1908 Souths had the distinction of playing the first football game under North Union rules in Australia, when a trial was organised between Souths\u2019 Possibles against Souths\u2019 Probables at the Sir Joseph Banks\u2019 Ground, Botany. The game was played as 12-a-side, probably because the club only had 24 players on their books at the time. George Ball hired the ground for the day, which cost the club half a guinea. A month later on Easter Monday the first round of the NSWRL competition was played at Birchgrove Oval, with Souths defeating Norths by 11-7.\n\nARTHUR STEPHEN HENNESSY (1876-1959) (a.k.a. The Father of South Sydney) A regular Souths rugby union first grade forward in 1900-07 (94 games, scoring 5 tries), he toured New Zealand in 1901, and represented New South Wales against Queensland in 1904. He was Souths\u2019 first captain in the new code and was also named the club's first delegate to the NSWRL. His policy of 'no kicking' at the club earned South Sydney the title 'The Pride of the League' with their running and passing style of play. He also captained NSW in their first interstate match before being named Australia\u2019s inaugural Test captain in the series against New Zealand. When clubs and representative sides began to list their players in chronological order, as had been the case in cricket, Hennessy held the unique honour of being Number One on the Rabbitohs player register, as well as NSW Blues and the Australian Kangaroos. Hennessy had quickly absorbed the principles of the new code and became a sought-after coach; in 1911 he trained the Wyalong team. As NSW coach of the 1913 touring side to New Zealand he imposed a steak-only diet for lunch on match days. Hennessy strongly advocated the no kick principle, emphasizing the importance of ball possession to score tries. This came to be the mark of South Sydney's football, influenced by Hennessy as head trainer in 1912-13. He was amongst the first pioneers to be inducted as a Life Member of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1908. During the 1920s Hennessy was a football and boxing coach at Waverley College. He was a non-playing coach of the 1929-30 Kangaroo tour of Britain, the first and only such appointment until Clive Churchill's in 1959. Hennessy prohibited kicking and the Australians were narrowly defeated. He coached Country against City in 1942-44, and Souths' firsts in 1946; about then he also published a coaching manual, \u201cWinning Rugby Moves\u201d. \u2018The Father of South Sydney\u2019 died on 19 September 1959 at Maroubra, aged 82, and was buried with Anglican rites in Botany cemetery.\n\nSAMUEL GEORGE BALL (1884-1969) George Ball was Souths\u2019 pioneer administrator and a remarkable figure in the development of the South Sydney Club and the growth of rugby league in the 20th century. He was a man of calm disposition and solid judgement, and he had seen his beloved Rabbitohs, and the League, grow through the years to remarkable success. Mr Ball began his administrative career in 1900 as secretary of the Waterloo Albions rugby union side, which played in the junior competition. When the South Sydney club was officially formed in 1908 Mr Ball became Hon. Treasurer of the Club, and stayed in office until the following year. From there his duties included: Delegate to the League in 1909-66, Club Secretary in 1910-66, General Committee in 1943-57, Retention Committee in 1950-65, Private Member Reviewing Committee in 1950-66, Social Committee in 1950-66 and Members\u2019 Reviewing Committee in 1963-66. Mr Ball was the first Secretary of the Australian Board of Control and was for many years a NSW representative on that body. He also served as manager of NSW sides to Queensland and New Zealand and managed the 1921 Kangaroo tour with clubmate, Billy Cann, the only time any club has had such an honour. He became one of the cornerstones of the game until stepping down from all duties on 12th April 1966. Mr Ball was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1914, and he was one of 14 people who were the first to be inducted as Life Members of the South Sydney Football Club at the 54th Annual General Meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 6th February 1962. His wife Alice Pearce was a champion swimmer and she was Sid \u2018Sandy\u2019 Pearce\u2019s sister. The Pearce family were a famous swimming, sculling, boxing and footballing family. The junior representative competition, SG Ball Cup, was named after George Ball and has been in existence since 1965. Mr Ball died on 26th August 1969 at Double Bay, aged 85, and there were many fine tributes given to him after his death. But none summed up everyone's feelings towards this truly great statesman as the one given by Bill Buckley, OBE (President of the Australian and NSW Rugby League) when he said: \"George Ball was of fine character and a wonderfully sound administrator. I have never known a better one in League affairs.\"\n\nWILLIAM ASKEW CANN (1882-1958) Younger brother of Sydney Cann, who played for Souths\u2019 Third Grade in 1909. Former rugby union three-quarter with Souths in 1905-07 (playing 20 games, scoring 5 tries), Billy Cann was a member of the rebel NSW side that played the NZ All Golds in 1907. He made his first grade rugby league debut with Souths in 1908, Round 2 v Western Suburbs at the Agricultural Ground, scoring two tries on debut. Mr Cann went on to become both an innovative player and long-serving administrator with Souths. A pioneer of lock forward play, he was also elected as the club's first committeeman in 1908 as well as Souths\u2019 delegate to the NSWRL. Cann\u2019s creativity in \u2018loose\u2019 play shaped the role of the lock in the professional code and he combined brilliantly with his backline. He took part in Australia\u2019s inaugural Test series, against NZ in 1908, and was a member of the 1908-09 Kangaroos (8 matches, no Tests) and the 1911-12 \u2018Australasian\u2019 Kangaroos (18 matches, 3 Tests). Mr Cann also played against NZ (1909) and England (1914) during his international career and although he missed Souths\u2019 first premiership final because he was on tour, he later played an important part in the club\u2019s title wins in 1909 and 1914. He was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1908. Following his retirement Mr Cann was co-manager of the 1921-22 Kangaroos with Souths secretary George Ball - the only time that officials from the same club have been in charge of a touring team. During the 1940s and 50s, Cann was a vice-president of the NSWRFL. He was also an SP bookie and for many years wrote articles for The Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Cann died on 7th June 1958 at Harbord after a short illness, aged 75.\n\nJOHN JOSEPH McGRATH (1884-1966) Mr McGrath took over from George Ball as Souths\u2019 Treasurer in 1910 and stayed in that role until 1917. The following year he became Club President until 1924, as well as Hon. Auditor from 1918-19 and then club Delegate to the League in 1920-22. Mr McGrath was inducted as a Life Member of the South Sydney Football Club at the 89th Annual General Meeting held at the South Sydney Leagues Club in Redfern on 8th December 1963. He died on 15th June 1966 at Kensington, aged 82.\n\nEDWARD STEPHEN FRY (1878-1968) Brother of James Fry (who played rugby union for Souths in their very first game in 1900), Fred Fry (who played rugby league for Easts), and Bill Fry (who also played rugby league for Souths). Edward played first grade rugby union for Souths in 1902-07, playing in 62 games (scoring 9 tries and 2 field goals). He was also a member of the NSW Pioneers team who played against NZ All Golds in three games back in 1907. He made his first grade debut in rugby league in the very first game played in 1908 against North Sydney at Birchgrove Oval. He was also the Vice-Captain of the side and captained the first grade team in 5 games, including the Final against Eastern Suburbs, which Souths won by 14-12 to claim their first premiership victory. Mr Fry also played representative football with the Probables in 1908 and 2 games for NSW against the Queensland side in 1908. When his playing career ended in 1908, the loyal clubman continued at Souths in many different roles: on the Committee in 1909-32, Vice-President in 1911-19, 1921 and 1927-46 as well as Hon. Auditor in 1920-68. He was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1908, and also as a Life Member of the South Sydney Football Club at the 55th Annual General Meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 5th February 1963. He died on 27th March 1968 at Rockdale, aged 89, after a long illness.\n\nSouth Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Limited The Beginning\u2026 South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a public meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 17 January 1908. On March 5, 1908, the NSW Rugby League issued the Club its receipt No. 2 for their \u00a3 -1 \u2013 1 \u2013 0 affiliation fee. The Club\u2019s first premiership match, also the first in the NSWRL competition, was played at Birchgrove Oval on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908. Souths defeated North Sydney 11-7. Winger Tommy Anderson scored Souths first try, with others added during the historic game by forwards Dick Green and Harold Butler, who also kicked a goal. The Club was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee at a Special General Meeting on 13 June 1982. The rebirth of the Rabbitohs began on 7 June, 2006 through a new partnership between Russell Crowe, Peter Holmes \u00e0 Court and the 8000 Members of the Club. The voting Members of the Football Club voted by a 75.8% majority to convert the Club from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 19 March 2006.\n\nOUTSTANDING SEASONS 1925: Won the first, reserve and third grade premierships and City Cup. First grade was undefeated in its 12 matches \u2013 the first and still the only team to win every game in a season. 1953: Won the first and reserve grade premierships, Club Championship and President\u2019s Cup (then the only interdistrict junior competition). Runner \u2013 up in third grade, losing 11-9, after playing extra time. 1968: Won first and reserve grade premierships, Club Championships, President\u2019s Cup and Flegg Trophy.

But for the past decade, there have been three surprisingly durable truths to life in the NRL. New South Wales will lose the State of Origin. Phil Gould will be indignant, on a weekly basis, about something or other. And the South Sydney Rabbitohs will fail to make the grand final.\n\nIn that sense, this has been a genuinely revolutionary year for rugby league. The Blues have shaken off the curses of the post-Joey Johns era at their ninth attempt. Gould, the puffy, disgruntled Garfield of rugby league punditry, has softened some of his verbal edges as he eases into the gentle decline of television old age. And most shockingly of all, South Sydney, after failing at the final hurdle the last two years, are into the grand final for the first time since 1971. But what\u2019s most remarkable about the Rabbitohs\u2019 participation in Sunday night\u2019s decider is not that it\u2019s taken them so long; it\u2019s that they\u2019re there at all.\n\nFor all the triumphs of the postwar years, when premiership followed premiership and the club turned itself into the most historically successful team in rugby league, a title it continues to hold today, disappearance has always been a core theme of South Sydney. It\u2019s there, arguably, in the very location of the club, which sits in a bit of Sydney that, to me at least, has always been a little difficult to get a solid mental hold of: what, exactly (he says, dropping into his Werner Herzog voice), is South Sydney?\n\n\u201cSouth Sydney\u201d, as an idea, has none of the immediacy of the suburbs to its east (Roosters territory) and west (where the Tigers live). Even further down the parts of the south-west and south-east most obviously associated with the Bulldogs and the Dragons, respectively, seem to rush up on the inner south and rob it of any discrete urban identity to call its own; they make it feel like a place left over.\n\nNow gentrified, South Sydney is an area where light industry, plucky rows of single-story terraces and organic coffee and pig roast barns exist in an uncomfortable truce with each other; the names of its suburbs, whether mythical and exotic (Alexandria) or made-up-sounding (Zetland), add to the overwhelming sense of Rabbitohs land as a place both there and not there, on its way to something else but not quite sure of what that is. Even the club\u2019s nickname, a remnant of South Sydney\u2019s pre-league origins as a rugby union outfit, is a sign of absence, recalling the rabbits its earliest amateur players would sell in their day jobs away from the field of play. Obviously I\u2019m overdoing things a little here, but it\u2019s the season for going over the top; and besides, disappearance is on everyone\u2019s mind this week, because it was only 15 years ago that South Sydney looked like vanishing, as a club, forever. Some history may be in order here.\n\n\n\nThe Rabbitohs are playing in their first grand final since 1971. Photograph: Renee McKay/Getty Images\n\nSouths, quite apart from being the sport\u2019s most successful club, have always been the brightest laboratory for rugby league\u2019s most macho urgings: this, after all, is the team that gave us Clive Churchill, Bob McCarthy, and the spectacle of John Sattler playing virtually a whole grand final with a broken jaw.\n\nBut the strut of the 1950s and 1960s had slowed by the 1970s and as the game and Sydney itself changed throughout the next two decades, the club stumbled. Bright spots appeared under the snarling, antic leadership of Mario Fenech in the 1980s but poor economic management through the early 1990s meant it was only a matter of time before the club hit the wall (although no one imagined that Julian O\u2019Neill would personally act that process out in quite the manner that he did).\n\nThe catalyst, of course, was the Super League Wars, in retrospect less a battle over the future of the sport than a competition between two organisations of different means and outlook to see who could come up with the bigger tally of bad locations to set up a rugby league franchise. When Souths, faced with the prospect of merger or death and unable to find a partner at the frantic late-1999 dance of the historic Sydney clubs, were cut from the NRL for the 2000 season, it was difficult to see them ever returning. What beckoned, seemingly, was a future as a lower-tier Toyota Cup-level concern or as a feeder club, in the manner of the North Sydney Bears or the Newtown Jets. The Rabbitohs as an NRL team were dead.\n\nAt the turn of this century, the only things that kept the club afloat were Souths Juniors, one impassioned protest march and a handful of poo in the shoe jokes. Litigation is rarely the giver of life but it was through the courts that Souths elbowed their way back to league\u2019s top table, winning readmission to the NRL in 2002. At first things did not go well: the club finished as theoretical wooden spooners in its first season back, and actual wooden spooners the next.\n\nMost of Russell Crowe\u2019s post-Gladiator career, it\u2019s fair to say, has been about the search of one man to find different ways to wear a boofy jacket (it was probably around the time of the release of Cinderella Man that Crowe reached peak boof in terms of his fashion sense, though he\u2019s maintained a steady boof-rhythm in jacket choices since). Souths\u2019 post-readmission struggles presented Crowe with the chance to give his wardrobe the context, and his sporting ego the stage, they deserved. More than anything, it is his takeover of the club in 2006 \u2013 Peter Holmes a Court by his side \u2013 that has set the Rabbitohs on the path to Sunday night.\n\nRussell Crowe shortly before his takeover of the Rabbitohs: \u2018most of Russell Crowe\u2019s post-Gladiator career, it\u2019s fair to say, has been about the search of one man to find different ways to wear a boofy jacket\u2019. Photograph: Mark Baker/AP\n\nWhat Crowe and Holmes a Court grasped best of all was that, in sport as in life, too much talk of real struggle can reduce the struggle to mere talk. This put them into immediate conflict with Piggins and many of the club\u2019s former greats, such as McCarthy and Sattler. Where the old guard\u2019s view of the club and its position within the code was fundamentally reclamatory and retributory, nourished by very legitimate past grievances and motivated by the desire to seek their redress, the new guard understood that the best way forward for the club was to shelve the past and get on with living. (It\u2019s interesting, to say the least, that News Ltd, despite their instrumental role in forcing Souths into exile in the early 2000s, have, with their characteristic flair for playing the political angles, swooped in with an offer to broker a reconciliation of sorts between Piggins and his estranged love.)\n\nFrom being a team shaped around the hardscrabble hustle of mid-20th century inner-city working class Sydney, Crowe and Holmes a Court, the heir to a cattle fortune, changed the Rabbitohs into a much different team \u2013 a team built on meat. This was perhaps fitting, given rugby league\u2019s place as the most straightforwardly beefy of the world\u2019s football codes. There\u2019s a little bit of George Street on a Friday night in every NRL player now, and Crowe \u2013 despite the impression he gives that at heart, he\u2019s just a modest brickie out for a post-shift beer stuck reluctantly in a very wealthy man\u2019s body \u2013 embraced the George Streetification of the code with zeal. At first there was something slightly flashy and needy about the way he went about wooing the code\u2019s top players. The team of Roy Asotasi, Nigel Vagana, Dean Widders and Craig Wing, for all its obvious talent, always had the look of something whipped up in a rush, rather than a gathering force organically raised from scratch. Progress was halting. Jason Taylor came and went amid a buzz of expletives at Bar Coluzzi. Then there was John Lang; then there wasn\u2019t John Lang.\n\nBut in more recent years, the Rabbitohs have mastered the combination of bling and brawn that has marked the best teams of this generation. For a start, there\u2019s a deep bank of tactical acumen on the sidelines. Most people will see something quintessentially Australian in Michael Maguire\u2019s laconic, buzzword-allergic approach to coaching; to me he resembles more a worldwise expat, trenchcoat on, whisky in hand, at a bar in Nazi-occupied Europe, mumbling hard truths out the corner of his mouth as he checks on flights to Lisbon. The team, built on the foundation of its monster forward pack, the genetic triple- (and sometimes quadruple-) hit of the Burgess brothers and the elusive promptings of John Sutton and Adam Reynolds, does the ugly and pretty things equally well. And in Greg Inglis, this triple-decker, reverse pinball machine of a man, the club boasts perhaps the game\u2019s best non-halves back since Mal Meninga. This is a team for which, you sense, the time is finally right.\n\nThe way Sunday is being spoken about in the media it\u2019s as if we are on the cusp of something messianic and truly epoch-defining, a theatrical happening of world-historical significance to rank with the Red Army\u2019s Long March, the invention of the internet, or the final episode of Breaking Bad. And that\u2019s all true, of course.\n\nBut for all the advances made under Crowe\u2019s stewardship, Sunday, above all, is a tribute to the mere act of survival, a celebration of the persistence of one club in the face of mortal danger. This is one grand final, for once, that will be less significant as a sporting event than as a reminder of the brittle grandeur of experience, and of the delirious, critical necessity \u2013 against reason, through better evidence, no matter the disappointments \u2013 of holding on."}, {"url": "https://www.roosters.com.au/news/2022/01/21/home-sweet-home-a-history-of-roosters-home-grounds/", "page_content": "Since 1908, Moore Park has been the spiritual home of the Sydney Roosters - and with the brand-new Sydney Football Stadium nearing completion, it's only appropriate that we take a look back on the venues that we have proudly called our home.\n\nFull-Time Home Grounds:\n\nThe famous venues which have been synonymous with the Club since 1908, there are a handful of iconic grounds which the Roosters have been based.\n\n*Statistics in tables contain information regarding the Club's record at each venue as the home side - including finals matches and Grand Finals.\n\nRoyal Agricultural Society Showground: 1908-1920, 1926-1930\n\nThe Club's inaugural home ground, Eastern Suburbs played all but two of their home games in 1908 at the 'Ag' - which continued to host games regularly until 1921, when the side moved to the Sydney Sports Ground.\n\nAlternating between the two venues as their home base for the majority of the 1910s and 1920s, Easts would play their final match (albeit an away fixture) at the Royal Agricultural Society Showground in 1930, defeating North Sydney in a 43-11 thumping.\n\nThe venue also fielded the first-ever night game in Australia on December 22, 1928 in an exhibition match between Easts and Souths.\n\nPlayed: 71 Won: 53 Lost: 16 Drawn: 2 Winning Percentage: 75%\n\nSydney Sports Ground: 1911, 1921-1925, 1930-1976, 1978-1986\n\nThe home venue of the Club for the majority of the 20th century, the Sydney Sports Ground is revered by the rusted-on Roosters fan who passionately waved their Red, White and Blue flags on the famous hill until 1986.\n\nOne of the only venues without the rock-hard surface of a cricket pitch torn through the centre, the Sports Ground was first adorned by Tricolours in 1911, before becoming the Club's permanent base from 1930 onward.\n\nNoted for its dirt track around the perimeter which hosted the speedway, the Sports Ground had the unique distinction of running east to west - which caused plenty of havoc for opposition wingers and fullbacks with the gleaming rays of the sun affecting the visibility of catchers.\n\nThe final match at the famous old venue was on June 29th, 1986, with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters defeating the North Sydney Bears 21-14 in front of 8,175 spectators - one that Easts fans still recall fondly to this day.\n\nPlayed: 425 Won: 248 Lost: 162 Drawn: 15 Winning Percentage: 58%\n\nSydney Football Stadium: 1988-2018, 2022-Present\n\nWhile the early years of the Sydney Football Stadium had its fair share of issues and lopsided results, the venue quickly became synonymous with the Sydney Roosters' successes through the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nBuilt upon the site of the old Sydney Sports Ground, the Roosters took the stage at the then-world-class Sydney Football Stadium in 1988; and while early results were not favourable, the stadia soon became one of the great venues of Rugby League for the next three decades.\n\nSign up for a free NRL Account to access this video and other exclusive content.

Hosting twelve games, the Roosters won nine matches with two losses and a draw, however quickly reverted back to the Sports Ground.\n\nOnly a handful of seasons since 1913 have seen the Club not host matches at the venue prior to the Sydney Football Stadium opening, including 1929-1934, 1948-1949, 1954-1956, 1959, 1962-1966, 1969, 1971 and 1983.\n\nBetween 1988 and 2019, the Roosters played three matches at the SCG, one in 1999, 2006 and 2010, while the Club proudly recorded its 300th overall victory at the ground in 2019.\n\nThe Club recorded the highest-ever Rugby League score in their final match at the venue in Round 23, 2022 - a 72-6 demolition job of the Wests Tigers.\n\nPlayed: 197 Won: 139 Lost: 49 Drawn: 9 Winning Percentage: 71%\n\nPart-Time Home Grounds:\n\nWhether it be for just a few games or the duration of the season, the Roosters have expanded the reach of Rugby League across Australia by taking home games to notable part-time venues.\n\nHenson Park: 1987, 1989-1990\n\nWith renovations underway at the soon-to-be Sydney Football Stadium, Easts took eight games in 1987 to Henson Park in Marrickville - the home of former NSWRL side the Newtown Jets.\n\nAlthough there was a consideration of playing at the local ES Marks Athletics Field in Kensington, the Club's record while at Henson was strong, winning all but two matches at the venue (including their first six). The exciting Easts side would go on to finish the season in second position under Arthur Beetson, going all the way to the preliminary final.\n\nDespite calling the Sydney Football Stadium home from 1988, the Roosters took further matches to Henson Park in 1989 and 1990, winning their final match at the venue 16-11 against Cronulla.\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next The New Sydney Football Stadium From a View\n\nPlayed: 17 Won: 10 Lost: 7 Drawn: 0 Winning Percentage: 58%\n\nTrumper Oval: 1915, 1934, 1939, 1941\n\nAlso known as Hampden Oval, this venue played host to a number of Eastern Suburbs matches in the first half of the 20th century, when not playing the match-of-the-day at the Sydney Cricket Ground or if the Sports Ground was unavailable.\n\nBased in the Club's heartland in Paddington, Easts played ten home matches at Trumper Oval, with four in 1915, four in 1934 and one each in 1939 and 1941.\n\nThe side enjoyed a winning record at the venue, taking out nine of their twelve matches, which included thumping wins over Annandale (32-3) and North Sydney (35-4) in 1915, as well as a 40-11 victory against University in 1934.\n\nPlayed: 12 Won: 9 Lost: 3 Drawn: 0 Winning Percentage: 75%\n\nCentral Coast Stadium: 2004-2011, 2015-2019, 2021-present\n\nSince 2004 the Sydney Roosters have taken consistent home games to Gosford, and with the Club's pathways entrenched on the Central Coast, the relationship continues to grow stronger with each passing year.\n\nShooting out of the blocks with two wins in 2004 and 2005, the side's fortunes waned, and while games were temporarily held elsewhere from 2012-2014, the Tricolours returned to host annual matches from 2015, with a much greater rate of success -

Est. 1967.\n\nPenrith Panthers. Est. 1967.\n\nEach of these twelve clubs had by this stage established histories and passionate supporter bases, which greatly differed in size and stature.\n\nNewtown, Western Suburbs, Balmain, South Sydney and Cronulla were all in financial trouble. Requiring bail-outs and due to a lack of on-field success the clubs faced extinction in a competition looking to grow its national footprint.\n\nThe inclusion of the Canberra Raiders and the Illawarra Steelers in 1982, followed by the Newcastle Knights, the Brisbane Broncos and the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1988, further added pressure on these clubs as the competition grew to 16 teams.\n\nThe Newtown Jets only lasted a year during the expansion period and in 1983 where kicked out of the competition; a club who had the assets, but not the cash flow. The Magpies where kicked out as well but took the NSWRL to court and won re-inclusion into the competition before relocating from Ashfield to Campbelltown, but their on-field performances didn\u2019t improve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 1983 the same 11 Sydney teams powered on. In 1993, when the Brisbane Broncos moved to ANZ Stadium and were averaging 43,000 per game, five of the 11 Sydney teams were averaging less than 10,000, with Wests as low as 7000.\n\nThe disparity between the clubs was huge. While the quality of football was high (many people believe the Winfield Cup was the best era in the competition\u2019s history), there was no hiding the financial difficulties of many of these clubs.\n\nIn 1995, the competition expanded even further.\n\nThe Australian Rugby League took control of the game and added four new teams to the Winfield Cup. They crossed the \u2018Barassi Line\u2019 for the first time with the Western Reds in Perth. Crossed to New Zealand and started the Auckland Warriors. Brisbane got the second team that many believed they deserved the South Queensland Crushers, and Townsville became the home of the North Queensland Cowboys.\n\nThis boom expansion put even more pressure on Sydney clubs, whose crowds continued to drop below 10,000, as the expansion clubs helped deliver the ARL a season of record crowds.\n\nSydney clubs began looking for ways to ensure their survival.\n\nThe North Sydney Bears announced they would relocate to the Central Coast and were then ensured a place in the national competition. Canterbury-Bankstown and Balmain became the Sydney Bulldogs and Sydney Tigers respectively, as well as relocating to Parramatta Stadium. Easts became the Sydney City Roosters. Despite these changes, ARL CEO Ken Arthurston admitted that clubs like the Tigers were going to have difficulty to maintain their spot in the competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ARL understood they couldn\u2019t maintain a 20-team competition and announced they would be reducing the number of Sydney teams from 11 to five; Melbourne and Adelaide to be granted licenses in the future.\n\nThe position of many of these Sydney clubs was precarious. When Brian Smith left St. George in 1994 he mentioned that there was a smell of \u2018Newtown\u2019 at the club. A rich club, with a grand history but no cash flow and a Super League War to contend with; a war that threw tradition and history out the door, in the name of wealth and power.\n\nIt ripped the game apart and while most were worse off, some Sydney clubs looking for an immediate fix jumped onto the Super League bandwagon. Cronulla, Penrith and the Bulldogs took the millions from News Limited and joined the rebel competition. The other eight Sydney clubs remained \u2018loyal\u2019 to the ARL.\n\nSo when the axe fell and a peace agreement was signed, the struggling ARL Sydney clubs were wielded this axe and the Sydney Super League clubs stayed on. Wests and Balmain merged, St. George and Illawarra merged. Manly and North Sydney forced into an \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 merger, and South Sydney were kicked out of the competition.\n\nNow I\u2019m not here to start a debate about the Super League War, in fact I haven\u2019t even reached the point of my article. While the Rabbitohs are back and hopefully the bears will be on the Central Coast, the same problems that plagued Sydney clubs in the 70s, 80s and 90s haven\u2019t disappeared but rather appear stronger than ever.\n\nCronulla are in millions of dollars of debt, the Panthers have brought Phil Gould in with the wider perception being that he\u2019s there \u2018to rescue a club that is the sleeping giant of the NRL. 1967 is when Penrith entered the competition; it\u2019s a hell of a long time to be asleep.\n\nWith the Independent Commission coming in \u2013 it\u2019s going to happen, even though it\u2019s taking longer than Mariah Carey takes to finish a high note \u2013 expansion is arguably the biggest talking point of the game, and many question will be asked of the smaller Sydney clubs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving only played in two finals series since 1989,the Rabbitohs are finally in a position financially to return to its glory days. Perhaps not a complete return, but the club can now hang on to the many promising players it kept losing during its horror run. With signings like Greg Inglis, a growing membership base and a talented incoming coach, the future looks bright for South Sydney.\n\nIf the Rabbitohs capitalise and begin to string finals series appearances and win premierships, how will this affect the Sydney Roosters? The so called \u2018Glamour Club\u2019 and \u2018boys from Bondi\u2019 have a cashed up CEO (who sits on the NRL board), but a very small junior and supporter base. While they do attract decent crowds, it\u2019s usually against Sydney clubs like the Dragons and the Rabbitohs where the Rooster supporters are often out-numbered. With their very close neighbours South Sydney lifting, where does this leave the Roosters?\n\nThe Bears have the support of many Sydney-siders for re-inclusion. It must be a combination of the hatred many people feel for Manly and the bitter manner that the Bears were excluded from the competition. If they return, how will this affect Manly? Will it add to their supporter base or deter from it?\n\nThey don\u2019t necessarily attract big crowds to Brookvale Oval (it isn\u2019t the best stadium) and have struggled to turn a profit. They do have a winning culture and a well-known brand.\n\nWhere does their future lie?\n\nCronulla. Ah Cronulla. The poor sharks. No premierships, no members, no crowds, no money. While that may be a harsh assessment; I would hate to be a fan of the Sharks.\n\nHas their clubs given them much to cheer about? Three grand finals in 44 years, two coming in the 70\u2019s, and one against the rampant Broncos side of the late 90\u2019s in the Super League grand final. As the Dragons break their drought and close in on Cronulla, from the North and South, where does the future of this club lie?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou would hate to see these clubs fold, their histories are far too established and their brands too well-known, but one of the biggest questions the independent commissioners will have to ask them self. Will the game be better off maintaining the existing nine Sydney clubs, or is re-location and amalgamation an option?\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult decision, but a decision needs to be made.\n\nWill they stick by these clubs and give them every chance of survival, or look to grow the game in other areas? Whatever they decide, I pray they do what\u2019s in the best interest of the game. A game that deserves a lot better than the way history has treated it."}, {"url": "https://bestinau.com.au/south-sydney-rabbitohs/", "page_content": "The South Sydney Rabbitohs are a professional rugby league team from Australia that are based in the inner-city Sydney suburb of Redfern. They compete in the National Rugby League (NRL) competition, Australia\u2019s premier rugby league premiership. They are one of the nine remaining Sydney teams in the competition. They are often nicknamed the Souths and The Bunnies. The club has more than a centuries worth of history behind it and has been a highly successful in its time.\n\nFounded\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs are one of the oldest rugby league teams in Australia. The club was first started in 1908 and has the distinction of being one of the founding members of the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL). The club was founded to be the representative of several Sydney municipalities including Redfern, Alexandria, Zetland, Waterloo, Mascot and Botany. The South Sydney Rabbitohs are one of only two founding clubs left in the NRL, the other is the Sydney Roosters.\n\nThe club was briefly excluded from the competition in 1999 after failing to meet the NRL\u2019s selection criteria. They later gained re-admission in 2002.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B26e1V8hncU/\n\nNotable Achievements\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs have the distinction of being the most successful rugby league team in the history of Australia. They have competed in the New South Wales Rugby league (1908-1994), Australian Rugby League (1995-1997) and the National Rugby League (1998-1999, 2002-present) and have claimed an impressive 21 premierships over the course of their history. The club is also the only rugby league team to have won a premiership in their inaugural season.\n\nSome of the South Sydney Rabbitohs achievements include:\n\nTheir 21 first grade premiership wins and 20 reserve grade premierships. The Rabbitohs also have the distinction of being the club to have scored the highest number of points (42), tries (8) and goals (9) in a single Grand Final, in a game against Manly in 1951. The Rabbitohs club is also one of only six teams in New South Wales to make it through a whole season undefeated, back in 1925. In the same year the club also one the premiership in all three grades \u2013 this has only be repeated three other times throughout history with the Balmain Tigers in 1915 and 1916 and again with the St George Dragons in 1963. The South Sydney Rabbitohs have also made one of the biggest comebacks in the history of Australian rugby league in a game against the North Queensland Cowboys. The club was down 28-4 in the first 53 minutes of the game but recovered to win the match 29-28. In 2014 the club made it into their first Grand Final game in 43 years and managed to defeat the Sydney Roosters 32-22 in the qualifier match, before they later defeated the Bulldogs in the Grand Final.\n\nMany of the club\u2019s players also have a number of notable achievements under their belt and have hit some important milestones over the club history. Some examples include:\n\nJohn Sutton, who holds the clubs record for the most first grade games played for the team, after playing 283 games for the Rabbitohs. Jack Rayner holds the league record for the most Grand Finals wins as a captain and coach, with five wins between 1950 and 1955. The clubs player Eric Simms holds the record for the most points scored for the club, with 1841 points collected between 1965 and 1975. His tally for the club has yet to be beaten by any other player. Eric Simms also holds the record for the most goals scored in a season (112 goals and 19 field goals), the most career field goals (86) and the most field goals in a single game (5). Nathan Merrit holds the record for the most tries scored for the club (146). Johnny Graves also holds the clubs record for the most individual points scored in a single game, with 29 points in a game played against the Eastern Suburbs in 1952.\n\nClub Earnings\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs is currently owned by a subsidiary company of Blackcourt League Investments, which is owned by actor Russel Crowe and James Packer. The club was purchased for $3 million in 2005 by the company. Since taking on the club Russel Crowe and ames Packer have erased the $7 million worth of debt that the club was carrying before being acquired. The result of the debt being forgiven is that the club is now in the best financial position it has ever been in since the clubs founding. The clubs current net asset position is at over $6 million and the club has more financial security than it has ever previously had. The club is now said to be worth around $20 million on the market. The club posted a $1.5 million profit in 2015 following the debt erasure. Most of the clubs profits are made from its large member base. The clubs current position is in stark contrast to their previous position where they had struggled financially for a number of years.\n\nHome Ground\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs traditional home has always been across the previously working-class suburbs of South Sydney, which were occupied mostly by factories at the time of the clubs founding. The rugby league club is currently based in Redfern, where their training and club administration facilities are located. Their supporter base however is spread right across Sydney. The teams current home ground is Stadium Australia which is located in Sydney Olympic Park.\n\nIn the early years of the clubs history the Rabbitohs very rarely played home games. Most of their games were played at the Sydney Showground between 1908 and 1920. From around 1911, the Sydney Sports Ground was also used in rotation with the Sydney Showground. In 1948 the club relocated to Redfern Oval. The club played the majority of their home games their until 1988 when they began to play some home games at the Sydney Football Stadium which had recently been built on the former site of the Sydney Sports Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground. They remained at the Sydney Football Stadium until 2005. They club did not play in 2001 and 2002 however as they were excluded from the premiership. In 2004 and 2005 the club began to investigate new facilities because their contract with the Sydney Football Stadium was going to run out. The club eventually made the decision to relocate to Telstra Stadium at Sydney Olympic Park, the club is now known as ANZ stadium. In 2008 the club renewed their partnership with the stadium, committing to play their home games and final at the stadium for the next 10 years. In the same year the City of Sydney Council completed an upgrade on Redfern Oval worth $19.5 million ad in 2009 the oval became the site of the Rabbitohs training facilities and administration offices. In addition to the ANZ stadium, the club also plays some home games at the Sunshine Coast Stadium. The ANZ stadium has an impressive 83,500 person capacity.\n\nCoach\n\nThe clubs current head coach is NRL super coach, Wayne Bennett. Wayne Bennett is regarded as one of rugby leagues greatest coaches in the history of the sport. His coaching career in the NRL began with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, who won the Brisbane League premiership under his leadership in 1980. In the 1990s he was selected as Queensland\u2019s state of origin coach. He began his NSWRL coaching career with the Canberra Raiders before being later appointed as head coach for the Brisbane Broncos club in 1988, who won six premierships under his leadership. He later coached the St Geroge Illawarra Dragons who won the 2010 premiership with him and he later coached the Newcastle Knights before taking up his current position as head coach of the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\nEmblem and Colours\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs emblem, the rabbitoh is based on a now unused term from the 20th century that was used to describe hawkers who would capture skinned rabbits and sell the skin at markets. The hawkers would capture attention from market shoppers by shouting \u2018rabbit-oh\u2019. The club is often informally nicknamed the Rabbits, Bunnies and Souths. The origin of the clubs official \u2018Rabbitohs\u2019 name in unknown. In some accounts, some of the players would earn extra money working as rabbit-ohs and stained their jerseys with blood in the process; other clubs from wealthier districts did not appreciate the smell and would mock the club with the \u2018rabbit-oh!\u2019 cry. Another version of the story is that the field the team played on was covered in rabbit holes. The clubs logo is of a white running rabbit and was first adopted in 1959. The logo has evolved over time since it was first adopted. The first emblem design from the 1960s is currently featured on the clubs current jersey. In 2008, the team celebrated their centenary year with an emblem to mark the occasion.\n\nThe Rabbitohs have used red and green on their jerseys for most of their history. Prior to 1908 the club mostly wore a red and green hooped jersey. They\u2019ve sued a similar design for most of their history. In 1945 and 1946 the club broke tradition and adopted a jersey with a red and green colour scheme and a V design. In 1980 and 1984 they used a jersey that included white hoops and a green design. In 2006 the club added a predominantly white jersey for away games. In 2007 the Rabbitohs made the away jersey identical to the jersey from the 60\u2019s. They have used black shorts throughout most of their history.\n\nMascot\n\nThe clubs mascot is known as Reggie the Rabbit. The mascot\u2019s first appearance was in 1968 in a game against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. The Rabbitohs mascot is known for venturing onto other team games, other mascots only appear for home games. The mascot is also known for being involved in a lot of charity work.\n\nSupporters\n\nThe Rabbitohs have a large supporter based throughout Sydney and the rest of Australia. Their supporters are known as \u2018The Burrow\u2019. Their active supporters are also known as \u2018Gate 38\u2019. They have the highest membership numbers in the league, with numbers exceeding 35,000, of which 11,000 are ticketed members. They have members from all across Australia and from 22 countries around the rest of the world. The club also has a number of prominent backers known as \u2018Group 14\u2019 which is made up of prominent businessmen, politicians, musicians and media personalities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Rabbitohs were first formed in 1908 and won their first premiership in their inaugural year. The club experienced further premiership success in 1914 and 1918 and then had a great run of success between 1925 and 1932. The club struggled in the 1940s, struggling to win games and making the club record for the longest losing streak with a 22 game streak between 1945 and 1947. In the 1950s the club experienced resurgence and won five of six premierships between 1950 and 1955. They struggled with poor form again until they made the Grand Final in 1965. The club started to struggle financially in the 70s and their form suffered also. They recovered in the 80s and made the finals on five occasions. They suffered major financial issues in the 90s and were ejected from the league between 1999 and 2002. The club was acquired in 2005 by James Packer and Russel Crowes Company, pulling them out of financial trouble. In recent seasons the Souths have made the finals, but fallen short of a Grand Final appearance."}, {"url": "https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/content/the-greatest-rivalry", "page_content": "Team list The greatest rivalry\n\nPlayed Won Lost Draw For Against W% All Time 241 124 109 8 3634 3702 51% Finals 11 6 5 0 172 154 55% Last 10 Years 22 10 12 0 497 (Avg 23 ppg) 465 (Avg 21 ppg) 45% There is no greater rivalry in Rugby League than that between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Sydney (formerly Eastern Suburbs) Roosters. The only foundation clubs that remain in the NRL, more matches have been played between us than any other two clubs. The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a packed meeting held at the Redfern Town Hall on January 17, 1908. The Eastern Suburbs Club was formed at the Paddington Town Hall just a week later.\n\nRight from the beginning, the rivalry was fierce. We met them twice in 1908, losing the first game 13-12 at the Sydney Agricultural Ground (on the site of the Entertainment Quarter). It was our only loss that year and we avenged it in the best possible way in the very first grand final, winning 14-12. Formed a week earlier than our local rivals, Souths had established superiority on the field as well. Souths continued to dominate both Easts and the competition for some time. From 1925 until 1932 we won seven of a possible eight premierships, disposing of the tricolours in the 1928 and 1931 Grand Finals, despite finishing below them during the regular season. Three times in the next seven years, Easts proved our nemesis as their superb team of the mid-'30s dominated the competition. And amazingly, their 19-10 victory at the SCG in August 1938 was the last time we would play them in a final for 76 years! From 1939 until quite recently the two clubs seemed to take turns at success, with long periods of superiority alternating between them. The Roosters did play a significant part, however, in bringing about the end of our last golden era, and certainly contributed to our 43-year premiership drought. As we went into decline in the early '70s, they moved into the era of professionalism.\n\nThey were the first club to display a sponsor's name (City Ford) on their jumper and with the influx of cash the results soon followed. In 1971 international winger Michael Cleary became the first of a long line of key players to move from Redfern to Bondi, followed by the great Ron Coote and Elwyn Walters, the last two being instrumental in the Roosters' back-to-back 1974-75 Premierships. From 1978, however, we once again established a commanding superiority over our neighbours, winning 20 of the next 25 encounters despite the fact the Roosters continued to plunder our ranks. The only solace for Souths fans was that no matter how many players they poached from us and other clubs, the Roosters still struggled and we still mostly got the better of them. That is, until the end of 1994. As the league world turned upside down in 1995 with the emergence of Super League, so too did Souths' fortunes. And as we battled to stay afloat amid the tumultuous whirlpool that engulfed the game, the Roosters seemed to take great delight in kicking us when we were down. Kicking us hard. They beat us 13 times in a row, and for Souths fans it was sickening, but it got a whole lot worse. As if it wasn't bad enough that we were unceremoniously dumped from the competition in October 1999, the Roosters once again rubbed their very own brand of tricolour salt into our wounds. Already in deep shock as they faced the prospect of the 2000 season without their team, Rabbitoh fans then had to put up with the Roosters signing the most outstanding Souths junior for more than a decade, a player who had publicly stated he had, all his life, wanted to play his entire career at Souths: the majestic Craig Wing.\n\nThen when we did get back into the competition in 2002, it was the Roosters who demanded we play our first game against them. And while it's true the result of that game didn\u2019t matter as it was enough for us just to be back they seemed to enjoy smacking us 40-6, and then again, 42-6, in the return game later that year. We lost the next five matches we played against them but the margins began to shrink as we started to drag the pendulum back. And then the planets aligned on a wonderful, warm evening at Aussie Stadium in August 2005. It was the night our fans unveiled a mighty banner which covered nearly an entire bay, proclaiming to the world that the Roosters were: \u201cForever ln Our Shadow\u201d.\n\nDespite falling behind 12-0 early, we clawed our way back thanks to halfback Ben Walker, who led the charge. With four minutes to go, he calmly piloted a drop kick straight over the black dot for a 17-16 victory that had been 11 years coming.\n\nThe Roosters didn't take kindly to losing that night. The next time we lined up against them, in the first match of 2006, we were leading 18-12 and doing it well when Walker was smashed by Roosters prop Adrian Morley, tearing his cruciate ligament while falling, unconscious, to the ground. The Roosters scored three tries in the next 10 minutes to win the game. Walker was out for six weeks and lost his confidence for four months. Just like Walker, our season was out cold. In 2007, once again we opposed them in the opening round, on a Monday evening at Aussie Stadium. On a night when pretty much everything went right, we had their measure from the beginning, leading 12-0 at halftime and going on with it in the second half. Nigel Vagana bagged two tries and man-of-the-match Joe Williams scored one as we got the money 18-6. And from there to the final round of 2007, on a Saturday night at Telstra Stadium, when a crowd of more than 32,000 gathered to celebrate the Rabbitohs qualifying for the finals for the first time in 18 years. Not only did the Roosters spoil our party by beating us 26-12, but the end of the match exploded in controversy as Souths second-rower David Fa' alogo reacted to a tackle by getting to his feet and smashing Roosters five-eighth Braith Anasta in the mouth. Fa'alogo was suspended for seven weeks and missed our long awaited semi-final. Round 1 of the 2008 season was another night filled with plenty of anticipation that turned sour quickly. The prodigal son, Craig Wing, who had spent the last eight seasons in Roosters colours had finally returned to Souths. Unfortunately for the man of the moment, his night ended early as hooker Riley Brown crashed into his shoulder from behind as he was held up by two defenders. The hit, branded a \u201ccheap shot\u201d by most who witnessed it, resulted in Wing needing a shoulder reconstruction and a three-month stint on the sidelines. We lost the match 34-20, and to make matters worse, the demoralising loss set us on a path of losing ten of our first eleven matches, eventually finishing third last, while the Roosters finished in the top four.\n\nIn our first round of 2009 we took on the Roosters at the SFS, after they had made the top four the previous season, with us coming 14th in a very forgettable year. But this match could not have been more memorable for the Souths faithful, as our team fired to a 52-12 demolition of our oldest foe. The Chooks had been plucked, and we racked up our biggest win over them in 57 years. Later that year we beat them again comprehensively 40-20 and they ended up picking up the wooden spoon. Few fans could forget the twin thrillers of 2012. In the first game of the season, it looked as though we had secured our first win under new coach Michael Maguire, as we led 20-12 with less than two minutes left. The Roosters scored a soft try through prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, closing the margin to two points, and in the final seconds, second rower Boyd Cordner dribbled a hopeful grubber through the line, which was picked up by Anthony Minichiello who scored under the posts, to give them a 24-20 win. It was a loss that left Souths fans in disbelief, but motivated the team to better themselves throughout the season. Fast forward to Round 19 and we were flying high in the top four while the Roosters lingered at the bottom of the ladder. It was a night of milestones as the tricolours were celebrating their captain \u2013 and Souths junior \u2013 Braith Anasta\u2019s 250th NRL match, while our very own Greg Inglis was playing his 150th match in the top grade. \u2018GI\u2019 would have the first say of the match as he broke through the line and sent Nathan Merritt over after just five minutes. The Roosters struck back, but Merritt\u2019s wing partner Andrew Everingham crossed, giving us a 12-4 lead at the break.\n\nIn the second half the Roosters came out a different side, scoring three tries to give them a 22-12 lead with just five minutes to spare. But the never-say-die attitude of the Rabbitohs shone brightly that night. As brightly as it ever had. With two minutes to go Nathan Merritt crossed again after a slick passage of play across field. The Rabbitohs were four points down with just fifty seconds on the clock and the atmosphere in the stadium was electric as the red and green faithful prayed for a miracle. Anasta kicked the ball off to John Sutton, who offloaded to David Taylor. The hulking forward, sent his second rower partner Chris McQueen through a gap bringing the crowd, screaming, to their feet. \u2018Lightning\u2019 McQueen sprinted to halfway and linked up with Merritt, who ran away and found hooker Issac Luke 25 metres out from the line. With the defence closing in, and just ten metres out, Luke turned around mid-tackle and threw a Hail Mary pass behind his body. For what felt like an eternity, the ball hung up in the air, before bouncing into the arms of rookie halfback Adam Reynolds, who scuttled to the line and dived over next to the posts. The stands went absolutely ballistic, and players were running around as if we\u2019d won the comp, with commentator Warren Smith screaming his now-immortalised words \u201cYou can take me now\u2026I have seen it all!\u201d Reynolds kicked the conversion to seal a famous 24-22 victory, and we went on to make the top four for the first time since 1989, killing the Roosters finals hopes in the process.\n\nThe 2013 off-season saw the Roosters go on yet another spending spree, signing half James Maloney, Test centre Michael Jennings and one of the biggest superstars in modern sport: Sonny Bill Williams. Once more the season kicked off with the local derby, where we sent the Chooks crashing back down to earth with a dominant 28-10 win. The Roosters would recover from that, and in Round 26 we found ourselves fighting for the Minor Premiership in front of nearly 60,000 punters at ANZ Stadium. Things were running smoothly as both Greg Inglis and fan-favourite Jason Clark helped us to a 12-10 lead at halftime, but the Tri-colours ran away with a 24-12 win, lifting the JJ Giltinan shield in front of our home fans. A month later they returned to ANZ to claim their 13th Premiership, which was extremely hard to watch for any diehard Rabbitoh. But Rugby League is a funny game, and we would have to wait just twelve months for the pendulum to swing back our way, this time bringing the sweetest revenge of all.\n\nOnce again our arch enemies took out the Minor Premiership, while we sat comfortably in the top four. We met in our first finals match since 1938 in the 2014 preliminary final in front of 53,000 at ANZ Stadium. The Burrow faithful flew a banner reading \u201cWhat we do in life echoes in eternity. Your time is now. Become legends\u201d, which appropriately echoed the words of Russell Crowe in his famous speech in Gladiator. And the South Sydney players did just that. The nerves of our gladiators were apparent early though, as the Roosters struck twice to open up a 12-0 lead after just seven minutes. There was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from the year before, when we lost the Preliminary Final to Manly, but we returned serve with two tries just before half time to level the scores. We shot out of the blocks in the second half, as second rower Ben Te\u2019o bulldozed over in a game-changing try, dragged two defenders over the line, jumping up and celebrating like an absolute mad man. Greg Inglis etched his name in the history books as he scored our next two tries, diving over the line for his first, and taking an AFL-like mark off an Adam Reynolds bomb for his second. Having trailed 12-0, we had clocked up 32 unanswered points. The red and green army in the stands could barely believe what they were watching. Although the Roosters crossed twice in the last five minutes, it didn\u2019t matter in the slightest. The match finished 32-22, destroying their hopes of going back-to-back. We were going to the Big Dance for the first time in 43 years, and we had smashed the Roosters to get there. It simply doesn\u2019t get any better than that.\n\nWell, maybe it does. The next week the Provan-Summons trophy was taken from Bondi and brought back to Redfern. Back to where it belonged.\n\nAnd it REALLY doesn\u2019t get any better than that! Since then we\u2019ve had some classic matches against the Roosters. In Round 2 of 2015 we stole a 34-30 victory through a last minute try to Issac Luke. In the opening round of the next year we blew them off the park 42-10 in an absolute masterclass from Adam Reynolds. Since then though, they\u2019ve had the better of us, winning the last three encounters. That was until our emphatic win earlier this year when we blew them off the park 26-14 in a dominating display, giving fan favourite Jason Clark the perfect 150th match celebrations! There\u2019s no doubt about it, this is a rivalry for the ages. There\u2019s just something about the Roosters that just irritates the hell out the Rabbitohs. And vice versa. They (of course) claim to be the only foundation club to have played every season. It seems there's nothing they do that isn't in some way aimed at us, or at imitating us. They have changed their name twice to try and capture the inner city market. Yet, try as they might, there's no escaping the cold hard facts that South Sydney was formed before Eastern Suburbs, has won far more premierships than Easts, Sydney City and Sydney Roosters combined, and has a much greater junior and fan base. In the end, it comes down to the souls of the two clubs. Although they are indeed a foundation club, somewhere along the way the Roosters lost their soul. They simply don't have the tradition, the stories or the romance that is South Sydney. Nevertheless, for more than 30 years, the Roosters had it pretty much their own way. Professionalism. Sponsorship. The big end of town. We had to watch it all green with envy. But, despite the agony we felt just a couple of months ago with the signing of boom forward Angus Crichton by the Roosters for 2019, that kind of dominance is over now. The Roosters won't ever surrender to us without one hell of a fight, though. To beat them takes more than our bodies, more than our hearts, and more than our minds. To beat them requires that we commit our souls to the spirit of the cardinal and myrtle: the creed of the Rabbitoh."}], "South Sydney Rabbitohs played in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership.": [{"url": "https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/news/the-story-of-south-sydney", "page_content": "The Story of South Sydney\n\nThe South Sydney Rabbitohs are one of the most famous clubs in the Australian sporting landscape. Established in 1908, South Sydney remain as the oldest and most successful Rugby League Club in Australia, having won a record 21 Premierships - the most of any first-grade football team in the country. The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a public meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 17 January 1908, and on March 5, the New South Wales Rugby League issued the Club its receipt No. 2 for their \u00a3 -1 \u2013 1 \u2013 0 affiliation fee.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs.\n\nThe Club's first Premiership match was played at Birchgrove Oval on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908, defeating North Sydney 11-7. The Club won the inaugural NSWRL Premiership later that year, defeating rivals Eastern Suburbs 14-12 in the Grand Final, and in the next decade won a further three titles, establishing themselves early as a competition heavyweight. The 1920s saw the first 'Golden Era' for the Club, claiming seven Premierships in eight years from 1925-1932, earning the moniker 'The Pride of the League' by journalist Claude Corbett - a title that is still held today.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs.\n\nAs World War II turned the competition on its head, Souths struggled on the field as conscription thinned out playing stocks, and results suffered, winning just a single match in 1945 and 1946. However, the 1950s provided the second 'Golden Era' with the emergence of players such as Immortal fullback Clive Churchill and inspirational captain-coach Jack Rayner. Five Premierships from 1950-1955 saw the Club's tally reach sixteen as other clubs struggled to keep up with South Sydney's dominance. Churchill would return to the Club in the 1960s as head coach, and led the third 'Golden Era', winning four Premierships in five years from 1967-1971, while mentoring some of the Club's most cherished legends such as John Sattler, Bob McCarthy, Ron Coote, Eric Simms, John O'Neill and George Piggins, with the Premiership tally reaching 20.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs.\n\nWhile the end of the 1970s saw the Club's on-field fortunes fall with player departures, the 1980s sides provided some of the most entertaining football in the competition. With passionate players such as Mario Fenech, Craig Coleman, Les Davidson, David Boyle, Mark Ellison, Michael Andrews and Phil Blake on board, the George Piggins-coached Rabbitohs took out the Minor Premiership in 1989. Despite not winning a Premiership, the 1980s still remain as one of the most beloved eras in Club history. As the professionalism in Australian sport continued to rise, Souths struggled to keep afloat financially in the 1990s, directly affecting on-field results, with no finals appearances throughout the decade and the future of the famous Club looking bleak with the 21st century on the horizon.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs.\n\nDespite unwavering support from die-hard fans and Members, as well as the emergence of promising up-and-coming talent such as Darrell Trindall, Sean Garlick and Craig Wing, the financial pressures from the ill-fated Super League venture and the new National Rugby League saw the Club expelled from the competition in 2000. But in the time of need, the people of South Sydney stood up and fought for their Club. Over 80,000 fans - led by Club legend George Piggins - marched through Sydney's CBD to Town Hall in November 2000 to protest against News Limited and the National Rugby League for the decision to exclude the Club from the competition.\n\nThrough months of trials, tribulations, and plenty of tears, the pain for South Sydney faithful was alleviated in July 2001, as the Club successfully won their appeal to be re-admitted into the competition for the 2002 season. Although the Rabbitohs were back to where they rightfully belonged, plenty more work needed to be done off the field to ensure success on it. While the Club produced names such as John Sutton, Luke Stuart, Issac Luke and Nathan Merritt, who would finish their careers as Club legends, results were still few and far between, finishing last three times within four years. However 7 June 2006 was the turning point for the Cardinal and Myrtle. Through a new partnership between Russell Crowe, Peter Holmes \u00e0 Court and the then-8000 Members of the Club, the Members of the Football Club voted by a 75.8% majority to convert the Club from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares at a historic General Meeting held on 19 March 2006. As a result, the Club was able to reinvent itself in the professional sporting landscape, and with plenty of big names on board such as Roy Asotasi, David Kidwell, Nigel Vagana and Dean Widders, season 2007 saw the Rabbitohs make their first finals appearance in eighteen years.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs.\n\nThe Club celebrated their centenary in 2008, as the next decade proved to be the most successful since the 1970s. Emerging one of the powerhouses of the competition once again, the Club acquired the services of superstars such as Greg Inglis and Sam Burgess and in 2012 through coach Michael Maguire made the preliminary final for the first time since 1989. Souths famously broke a 43-year Premiership drought in 2014 when they defeated Canterbury-Bankstown 30-6 in the Grand Final. Burgess became the first South Sydney player to claim the coveted Clive Churchill Medal as Man of the Match, playing 79 minutes of the match with a fractured cheekbone and emulating the same courage John Sattler showed in the 1970 Grand Final when he played on with a broken jaw. The Club earned the title of World Champions as they defeated Super League Club St. Helens in the 2015 World Club Challenge, claiming the biggest winning margin in a World Club match in the 39-nil drubbing.\n\n\u201cWe came so close to achieving our goal this year and it has made us all hungrier to get that premiership success and win number 22 for the Rabbitohs."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/live-nrl-titans-home-for-first-time-in-seven-weeks-as-bunnies-look-to-return-to-winning-ways/news-story/d67d61161660443719b28b2bf529c055", "page_content": "An Alex Johnston hat-trick and 30 unanswered points in the second half helped the South Sydney Rabbitohs to a big 46-28 win over the Gold Coast Titans at Cbus Super Stadium.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all rosy for the Bunnies as they lost Origin stars Jai Arrow and Cameron Murray to serious injuries.\n\nWatch every game of every round of the 2023 NRL Telstra Premiership Season LIVE on Kayo Sports.

Established in 1908, South Sydney remain as the oldest and most successful Rugby League Club in Australia, having won a record 21 Premierships - the most of any first-grade football team in the country. The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a public meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 17 January 1908, and on March 5, the New South Wales Rugby League issued the Club its receipt No. 2 for their \u00a3 -1 \u2013 1 \u2013 0 affiliation fee.\n\nThe Club's first Premiership match was played at Birchgrove Oval on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908, defeating North Sydney 11-7. The Club won the inaugural NSWRL Premiership later that year, defeating rivals Eastern Suburbs 14-12 in the Grand Final, and in the next decade won a further three titles, establishing themselves early as a competition heavyweight. The 1920s saw the first 'Golden Era' for the Club, claiming seven Premierships in eight years from 1925-1932, earning the moniker 'The Pride of the League' by journalist Claude Corbett - a title that is still held today.\n\nAs World War II turned the competition on its head, Souths struggled on the field as conscription thinned out playing stocks, and results suffered, winning just a single match in 1945 and 1946. However, the 1950s provided the second 'Golden Era' with the emergence of players such as Immortal fullback Clive Churchill and inspirational captain-coach Jack Rayner. Five Premierships from 1950-1955 saw the Club's tally reach sixteen as other clubs struggled to keep up with South Sydney's dominance. Churchill would return to the Club in the 1960s as head coach, and led the third 'Golden Era', winning four Premierships in five years from 1967-1971, while mentoring some of the Club's most cherished legends such as John Sattler, Bob McCarthy, Ron Coote, Eric Simms, John O'Neill and George Piggins, with the Premiership tally reaching 20.\n\nWhile the end of the 1970s saw the Club's on-field fortunes fall with player departures, the 1980s sides provided some of the most entertaining football in the competition.\n\nWith passionate players such as Mario Fenech, Craig Coleman, Les Davidson, David Boyle, Mark Ellison, Michael Andrews and Phil Blake on board, the George Piggins-coached Rabbitohs took out the Minor Premiership in 1989. Despite not winning a Premiership, the 1980s still remain as one of the most beloved eras in Club history. As the professionalism in Australian sport continued to rise, Souths struggled to keep afloat financially in the 1990s, directly affecting on-field results, with no finals appearances throughout the decade and the future of the famous Club looking bleak with the 21st century on the horizon.\n\nDespite unwavering support from die-hard fans and Members, as well as the emergence of promising up-and-coming talent such as Darrell Trindall, Sean Garlick and Craig Wing, the financial pressures from the ill-fated Super League venture and the new National Rugby League saw the Club expelled from the competition in 2000. But in the time of need, the people of South Sydney stood up and fought for their Club. Over 80,000 fans - led by Club legend George Piggins - marched through Sydney's CBD to Town Hall in November 2000 to protest against News Limited and the National Rugby League for the decision to exclude the Club from the competition.\n\nThrough months of trials, tribulations, and plenty of tears, the pain for South Sydney faithful was alleviated in July 2001, as the Club successfully won their appeal to be re-admitted into the competition for the 2002 season. Although the Rabbitohs were back to where they rightfully belonged, plenty more work needed to be done off the field to ensure success on it. While the Club produced names such as John Sutton, Luke Stuart, Issac Luke and Nathan Merritt, who would finish their careers as Club legends, results were still few and far between, finishing last three times within four years. However 7 June 2006 was the turning point for the Cardinal and Myrtle. Through a new partnership between Russell Crowe, Peter Holmes \u00e0 Court and the then-8000 Members of the Club, the Members of the Football Club voted by a 75.8% majority to convert the Club from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares at a historic General Meeting held on 19 March 2006.\n\nAs a result, the Club was able to reinvent itself in the professional sporting landscape, and with plenty of big names on board such as Roy Asotasi, David Kidwell, Nigel Vagana and Dean Widders, season 2007 saw the Rabbitohs make their first finals appearance in eighteen years.\n\nThe Club celebrated their centenary in 2008, as the next decade proved to be the most successful since the 1970s. Emerging one of the powerhouses of the competition once again, the Club acquired the services of superstars such as Greg Inglis and Sam Burgess and in 2012 through coach Michael Maguire made the preliminary final for the first time since 1989. Souths famously broke a 43-year Premiership drought in 2014 when they defeated Canterbury-Bankstown 30-6 in the Grand Final. Burgess became the first South Sydney player to claim the coveted Clive Churchill Medal as Man of the Match, playing 79 minutes of the match with a fractured cheekbone and emulating the same courage John Sattler showed in the 1970 Grand Final when he played on with a broken jaw. The Club earned the title of World Champions as they defeated Super League Club St. Helens in the 2015 World Club Challenge, claiming the biggest winning margin in a World Club match in the 39-nil drubbing."}, {"url": "https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/south-sydney-rabbitohs-cody-walker-quad-injury-nsw-blues-state-of-origin-selection/90bf577b-5d0b-40ea-937a-5abbbd635fa0", "page_content": "6 hours ago\n\n6 hours ago\n\nT\ufeffhe blows keep coming for NSW, with one of the leading contenders for a spot in the halves for Origin II injuring his quad in training.\n\nCody Walker is out of the Rabbitohs side \ufeffto take on the Dragons on Saturday after feeling a tweak during some speed work at training as Souths finalised preparations for their round 15 clash.\n\nSpeaking to media after the club's captain's run on Friday, coach Jason Demetriou confirmed the news, joking that the cause of the low grade strain was \"\ufeffold man\", while remaining optimistic that Walker would be available for selection for Origin if called upon by Brad Fittler.\n\nREAD MORE: Aussies tear through India in historic collapse\n\nREAD MORE: Freddy rips Maroons star's call after Koroisau hit\n\nREAD MORE: Queensland star points finger at media over ball-carrying style\n\n\"We're working hard and he's every chance of being available,\" Demetriou said.\n\n\"It's an injury that's really short term\ufeff, it only happened a couple of days before the game so we're not in a position to risk him but Origin's not for nearly two weeks so he's every chance of being available.\"\n\nStream the NRL premiership 2023 live and free on 9Now\n\nCody Walker of the Rabbitohs looks dejected after losing the club's round 13 loss to the Raiders.

One of nine foundation Clubs, with only two to survive to the current day, the Rabbitohs would go on to become one of the most successful and loved teams in the game.\n\nThe South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was founded on Friday 17 January 1908 at Redfern Town Hall when J J Giltinan was joined on the podium by cricketer Victor Trumper and politician Henry Clement Hoyle before a large crowd of supporters.\n\nSouth Sydney was the third rugby league football club founded in Australia after Glebe and Newtown. In 1908 a rugby league competition began in Sydney with working-class clubs, including the South Sydney Rugby Union Club, leaving rugby union to play by the new rules adopted by the New South Wales Rugby League.\n\nSouths took part in the first game of the inaugural competition when it started on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908. They defeated North Sydney 11-7 at Birchgrove Oval. Souths won the inaugural Sydney premiership beating Eastern Suburbs 14-12 in the final and backed it up the following year in extraordinary circumstances when opponents Balmain refused to show up in protest of the final being played as a prelude to a Kangaroos v Wallabies match. South Sydney kicked off to no one and were declared premiers. This would mark the first of a historic 21 Premierships for the men in Red & Green.\n\nDuring these early years Arthur Hennessy was considered the founding father of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and he was assisted in administration by S.

But our initial formation goes back to September 1907 when Arthur Stephen Hennessy organised a meeting to form the club at his house in 9 Chapman Street, Surry Hills. He sent out letters to all rugby clubs in the district inviting interested parties to attend. The response was less than overwhelming, with George Ball, Billy Cann and Johnny McGrath being the only ones present with Hennessy, while Ed Fry sent his full support behind the new club and an apology for not being able to attend owing to a previous engagement. Hennessy, Cann and Fry were the three local players who had taken part in the three matches against the NZ All Golds, which were all played under rugby union rules because the Northern Union rule book didn\u2019t arrive by boat from the UK until January 1908. The seeds of our club were first sprouted at this meeting by the five brave men who were the real Founders of our grand old club, and in December 1955 Souths commissioned a photo to be taken of the five men. This photo was proudly displayed in the offices of the old Souths Leagues Club.\n\nBack Row (L-R): Billy Cann, Johnny McGrath. Front Row: George Ball, Arthur Hennessy and Edward Fry.\n\nA number of other meetings were convened during the spring and summer of 1907-08 to form the district club, and the co-founders also helped in organising fliers across the South Sydney district which read: \u201cSOUTH SYDNEY \u2013 all footballers in this district should join this club for these reasons; play for yourself and your club\u2019s advantage or play for the Union to their advantage, and no return to yourself. Savee?\u201d But despite those humble beginnings, the small band of believers managed to garner more and more support, culminating in an historic meeting at Redfern Town Hall on January 17, 1908 where South Sydney was officially formed. One of the documents held by the NSW Rugby League is the receipt signed by J.J. Giltinan which lists Souths as the number 2 affiliated club with the NSWRL (North Sydney were the first to affiliate).\n\nIn a 1931 interview, George Ball said of that night in 1908: \u201cThe attendance was excellent, quite a number of those present, no doubt, being attracted to the meeting out of curiosity, as much had been written in the press concerning the new code and the likelihood of disqualification from the Rugby Union of anyone who had the temerity to join up with the New Movement.\u201d Despite strong initial opposition from those who continued to support rugby union, the club made significant progress, with regular training sessions being held at Moore Park, where the players were taught the rules of Northern Union football. On 21st March 1908 Souths had the distinction of playing the first football game under North Union rules in Australia, when a trial was organised between Souths\u2019 Possibles against Souths\u2019 Probables at the Sir Joseph Banks\u2019 Ground, Botany. The game was played as 12-a-side, probably because the club only had 24 players on their books at the time. George Ball hired the ground for the day, which cost the club half a guinea. A month later on Easter Monday the first round of the NSWRL competition was played at Birchgrove Oval, with Souths defeating Norths by 11-7.\n\nARTHUR STEPHEN HENNESSY (1876-1959) (a.k.a. The Father of South Sydney) A regular Souths rugby union first grade forward in 1900-07 (94 games, scoring 5 tries), he toured New Zealand in 1901, and represented New South Wales against Queensland in 1904. He was Souths\u2019 first captain in the new code and was also named the club's first delegate to the NSWRL. His policy of 'no kicking' at the club earned South Sydney the title 'The Pride of the League' with their running and passing style of play. He also captained NSW in their first interstate match before being named Australia\u2019s inaugural Test captain in the series against New Zealand. When clubs and representative sides began to list their players in chronological order, as had been the case in cricket, Hennessy held the unique honour of being Number One on the Rabbitohs player register, as well as NSW Blues and the Australian Kangaroos. Hennessy had quickly absorbed the principles of the new code and became a sought-after coach; in 1911 he trained the Wyalong team. As NSW coach of the 1913 touring side to New Zealand he imposed a steak-only diet for lunch on match days. Hennessy strongly advocated the no kick principle, emphasizing the importance of ball possession to score tries. This came to be the mark of South Sydney's football, influenced by Hennessy as head trainer in 1912-13. He was amongst the first pioneers to be inducted as a Life Member of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1908. During the 1920s Hennessy was a football and boxing coach at Waverley College. He was a non-playing coach of the 1929-30 Kangaroo tour of Britain, the first and only such appointment until Clive Churchill's in 1959. Hennessy prohibited kicking and the Australians were narrowly defeated. He coached Country against City in 1942-44, and Souths' firsts in 1946; about then he also published a coaching manual, \u201cWinning Rugby Moves\u201d. \u2018The Father of South Sydney\u2019 died on 19 September 1959 at Maroubra, aged 82, and was buried with Anglican rites in Botany cemetery.\n\nSAMUEL GEORGE BALL (1884-1969) George Ball was Souths\u2019 pioneer administrator and a remarkable figure in the development of the South Sydney Club and the growth of rugby league in the 20th century. He was a man of calm disposition and solid judgement, and he had seen his beloved Rabbitohs, and the League, grow through the years to remarkable success. Mr Ball began his administrative career in 1900 as secretary of the Waterloo Albions rugby union side, which played in the junior competition. When the South Sydney club was officially formed in 1908 Mr Ball became Hon. Treasurer of the Club, and stayed in office until the following year. From there his duties included: Delegate to the League in 1909-66, Club Secretary in 1910-66, General Committee in 1943-57, Retention Committee in 1950-65, Private Member Reviewing Committee in 1950-66, Social Committee in 1950-66 and Members\u2019 Reviewing Committee in 1963-66. Mr Ball was the first Secretary of the Australian Board of Control and was for many years a NSW representative on that body. He also served as manager of NSW sides to Queensland and New Zealand and managed the 1921 Kangaroo tour with clubmate, Billy Cann, the only time any club has had such an honour. He became one of the cornerstones of the game until stepping down from all duties on 12th April 1966. Mr Ball was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1914, and he was one of 14 people who were the first to be inducted as Life Members of the South Sydney Football Club at the 54th Annual General Meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 6th February 1962. His wife Alice Pearce was a champion swimmer and she was Sid \u2018Sandy\u2019 Pearce\u2019s sister. The Pearce family were a famous swimming, sculling, boxing and footballing family. The junior representative competition, SG Ball Cup, was named after George Ball and has been in existence since 1965. Mr Ball died on 26th August 1969 at Double Bay, aged 85, and there were many fine tributes given to him after his death. But none summed up everyone's feelings towards this truly great statesman as the one given by Bill Buckley, OBE (President of the Australian and NSW Rugby League) when he said: \"George Ball was of fine character and a wonderfully sound administrator. I have never known a better one in League affairs.\"\n\nWILLIAM ASKEW CANN (1882-1958) Younger brother of Sydney Cann, who played for Souths\u2019 Third Grade in 1909. Former rugby union three-quarter with Souths in 1905-07 (playing 20 games, scoring 5 tries), Billy Cann was a member of the rebel NSW side that played the NZ All Golds in 1907. He made his first grade rugby league debut with Souths in 1908, Round 2 v Western Suburbs at the Agricultural Ground, scoring two tries on debut. Mr Cann went on to become both an innovative player and long-serving administrator with Souths. A pioneer of lock forward play, he was also elected as the club's first committeeman in 1908 as well as Souths\u2019 delegate to the NSWRL. Cann\u2019s creativity in \u2018loose\u2019 play shaped the role of the lock in the professional code and he combined brilliantly with his backline. He took part in Australia\u2019s inaugural Test series, against NZ in 1908, and was a member of the 1908-09 Kangaroos (8 matches, no Tests) and the 1911-12 \u2018Australasian\u2019 Kangaroos (18 matches, 3 Tests). Mr Cann also played against NZ (1909) and England (1914) during his international career and although he missed Souths\u2019 first premiership final because he was on tour, he later played an important part in the club\u2019s title wins in 1909 and 1914. He was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1908. Following his retirement Mr Cann was co-manager of the 1921-22 Kangaroos with Souths secretary George Ball - the only time that officials from the same club have been in charge of a touring team. During the 1940s and 50s, Cann was a vice-president of the NSWRFL. He was also an SP bookie and for many years wrote articles for The Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Cann died on 7th June 1958 at Harbord after a short illness, aged 75.\n\nJOHN JOSEPH McGRATH (1884-1966) Mr McGrath took over from George Ball as Souths\u2019 Treasurer in 1910 and stayed in that role until 1917. The following year he became Club President until 1924, as well as Hon. Auditor from 1918-19 and then club Delegate to the League in 1920-22. Mr McGrath was inducted as a Life Member of the South Sydney Football Club at the 89th Annual General Meeting held at the South Sydney Leagues Club in Redfern on 8th December 1963. He died on 15th June 1966 at Kensington, aged 82.\n\nEDWARD STEPHEN FRY (1878-1968) Brother of James Fry (who played rugby union for Souths in their very first game in 1900), Fred Fry (who played rugby league for Easts), and Bill Fry (who also played rugby league for Souths). Edward played first grade rugby union for Souths in 1902-07, playing in 62 games (scoring 9 tries and 2 field goals). He was also a member of the NSW Pioneers team who played against NZ All Golds in three games back in 1907. He made his first grade debut in rugby league in the very first game played in 1908 against North Sydney at Birchgrove Oval. He was also the Vice-Captain of the side and captained the first grade team in 5 games, including the Final against Eastern Suburbs, which Souths won by 14-12 to claim their first premiership victory. Mr Fry also played representative football with the Probables in 1908 and 2 games for NSW against the Queensland side in 1908. When his playing career ended in 1908, the loyal clubman continued at Souths in many different roles: on the Committee in 1909-32, Vice-President in 1911-19, 1921 and 1927-46 as well as Hon. Auditor in 1920-68. He was inducted as a Life Member of the NSWRL in 1908, and also as a Life Member of the South Sydney Football Club at the 55th Annual General Meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 5th February 1963. He died on 27th March 1968 at Rockdale, aged 89, after a long illness.\n\nSouth Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Limited The Beginning\u2026 South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a public meeting held at Redfern Town Hall on 17 January 1908. On March 5, 1908, the NSW Rugby League issued the Club its receipt No. 2 for their \u00a3 -1 \u2013 1 \u2013 0 affiliation fee. The Club\u2019s first premiership match, also the first in the NSWRL competition, was played at Birchgrove Oval on Easter Monday, 20 April 1908. Souths defeated North Sydney 11-7. Winger Tommy Anderson scored Souths first try, with others added during the historic game by forwards Dick Green and Harold Butler, who also kicked a goal. The Club was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee at a Special General Meeting on 13 June 1982. The rebirth of the Rabbitohs began on 7 June, 2006 through a new partnership between Russell Crowe, Peter Holmes \u00e0 Court and the 8000 Members of the Club. The voting Members of the Football Club voted by a 75.8% majority to convert the Club from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 19 March 2006.\n\nOUTSTANDING SEASONS 1925: Won the first, reserve and third grade premierships and City Cup.

Michael Curin has also contributed to this article with statistics and information. Adelaide Rams (1997-1998)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 1 0 1 18 34 0\n\nThe first instance of rugby league in South Australia was in 1914 when a Great Britain touring side played against combined South Australia in Adelaide, easily disposing of their opponents 101-nil.\n\nIn 1951 South Australia toured NSW and played the Rabbitohs in an exhibition match at Redfern Oval with Souths proving too strong, winning 56-33. The idea of the city of churches having its own team in the competition may have been conceived when nearly 29,000 packed in to see Balmain and St George play at Adelaide Oval in 1991, but a bid to have a side called the Adelaide Aces join the 1995 premiership was unsuccessful. A few seasons later the Adelaide Rams were brought in to compete in the Super League competition in 1997. The new side wore red and blue jerseys, with the Rams name targeting an ethos of strength and toughness. When the ARL and Super League competitions merged to form the NRL in 1998, the Rabbitohs were destined to play the Rams for the first, and in fact the only, time in Round 18. Coming off two big wins, the Rams were too strong for Souths, winning 34-18. The Rams were an early casualty of the Super League War, though, and were axed from the competition after 1998. The Rabbitohs played in 1999 before suffering the same fate. But, of course, nobody marched in the street to save the Adelaide Rams. Annandale (1910-1920)\n\nPlayed Won Lost Draw For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 21 19 1 1 383 143 91\n\nLike many of the foundation clubs, Annandale originated from rugby union, breaking away to compete in the NSWRL from 1910 until 1920. Souths' record against the 'Dales was exceptional, winning 19 of 21 matches, their only loss a 3-2 defeat in Round 10, 1915. Fullback Wally Dymant scored an early penalty goal to give Souths a 2-nil lead at halftime, but Annandale struck back with a second half try to seal the match.\n\nEventually the club discontinued due to poor form, winning just 25 of their 153 matches, claiming four wooden spoons, and infringing on the residential rule at the time. Cumberland (1908)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 1 1 0 23 2 100\n\nCumberland only lasted one season in the top grade \u2013 the inaugural competition in 1908. The club were a late addition, formed on the first day of the season, and didn't compete until Round 2, bringing the number of competing clubs to nine. Despite missing players such as Arthur Hennessy, Johnny Rosewell and Jim Davis on representative duties, Souths led 6-2 at halftime and went on to a comprehensive 23-2 victory in their only match against Cumberland, in Round 3. At the end of the season the Rabbitohs took out the premiership, while Cumberland came last, and were eventually withdrawn from the competition. Nearly four decades later, the Parramatta Eels became the next side to be introduced into the competition from the Cumberland area, also donning the blue and gold colours. Glebe (1908-1929)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 49 31 18 720 413 63\n\nGlebe claim to be the first rugby league club formed in Australia, with their inaugural meeting held on January 9 1908. Despite fielding strong teams through the 1910s and 1920s, the club failed to win a premiership, their best result being the minor premiership in 1911. South Sydney's record against the Dirty Reds is one of dominance, winning 31 of 49 matches, with the biggest coming in Round 11 of the 1929 season, a 31-4 win in Glebe's final season. With the two clubs being in such close proximity, it was certainly a significant rivalry in the early years of the competition. Eventually Glebe bowed out of the competition at the end of 1929 as the game continued to change, but in 2017 the club was revived and now competes in the Ron Massey Cup as the Glebe-Burwood Wolves. Newtown Jets (1908-1982)\n\nPlayed Won Lost Draw For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 163 97 58 8 2689 2189 60\n\nAfter the mighty South Sydney took out the NSWRL competition in 1908 and 1909, it was Newtown who claimed the premiership in 1910. Indeed, they won it against the Rabbitohs in a final round thriller, managing to kick a late penalty goal to seal a draw and secure the Premiership, being \"first past the post\". The two clubs would come together in the last game of the season four more times, Souths winning every one. By far the most memorable was the completion of the \"Miracle of '55\". The Rabbitohs won 12 games in a row to win the competition, the last one a thrilling 12-11 comeback after Newtown led 11-7 with just six minutes remaining. The Jets (previously known as the Bluebags) managed to win three premierships of their own, and are regarded as one of the most famous rugby league clubs in the country. But, after appearing in the 1981 Grand Final, financial hardship reared its ugly head and by the end of 1983 the club was kicked out of the competition. One of the most controversial recent games between the sides came in Round 5 of 1980 at Redfern Oval, when Souths were robbed by referee Chris Ward who disallowed a late goal. Replays showed the kick was successful, and with the scores at 10-all heading into the final minutes, the Jets were given a penalty right in front of the sticks, which gave them an unlikely 12-10 victory. Souths officials, livid with the decision, put in an official complaint, claiming Ward gave Newtown multiple sets of seven tackles and complained about the 15-7 penalty count. The complaint went nowhere and Souths fans were ropeable, perhaps even more so when Newtown captain Tommy Raudonikis later admitted the better side lost. In recent years the Jets have been acting as a feeder team in the NSW Intrust Super Premiership, and in the pre-season of 2010 the Rabbitohs hosted the Jets as a part of the 'Return To Redfern' event, scraping home against their old rivals 10-4 in a tight contest. North Sydney Bears (1908-1999)\n\nPlayed Won Lost Draw For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 197 119 71 7 3445 2846 %\n\nAnother foundation club, the North Sydney Bears, affectionately known as \"The Shoremen\", claim they were the first Sydney club affiliated with the NSWRL in 1908 (Souths held the No. 2 ticket). The Bears moniker first appeared in 1959 when they were sponsored by the local Big Bear supermarket.\n\nThe club had little success, winning their only Premierships in 1921 and 1922, after they brought in former Souths players Harold Horder and Cec Blinkhorn. From then until their departure from the league at the end of 1999, the club struggled for silverware, making the 1943 grand final and playing in preliminary finals on four occasions in the mid to late 90s but failing to go any further. Regrettably the club was forced to merge with rivals Manly Sea Eagles to form the Northern Eagles, but the ill-fated franchise ended in 2003 when Manly were assigned the NRL licence and left the Bears to fend for themselves in reserve grade. After 90 years of rivalry and over 100 years of history, over the last decade Souths and Norths have been working together, with the Bears acting as the Rabbitohs' feeder side. South Queensland Crushers (1995-1997)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 4 3 1 112 73 75\n\nWith the NSWRL looking to expand its horizons in the mid 1990s to make the competition truly national, South Queensland were one of four expansion teams brought in for the 1995 season. Unfortunately for the Crushers they had to compete with big guns and local rivals the Brisbane Broncos, and without similar support they claimed two wooden spoons in their three years in the competition. The only one of the four expansion teams to play in the ARL competition in 1997, South Queensland were excluded from the newly formed National Rugby League at the end of that year. Against the Crushers, Souths won the first three contests, but the fourth and final clash was filled with controversy. In Round 18 of the 1997 season, the Rabbitohs travelled to Suncorp Stadium with both teams coming into the match on month long losing streaks. The home side managed a close 17-16 win through a Craig Wilson field goal after Souths skipper Darrell Trindall was sent off for a high tackle. University (1920-1937)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against Draw % South Sydney Rabbitohs 36 35 0 1011 299 1 97\n\nAfter dominating the rugby union competition in Sydney, University switched codes in 1920 and joined the NSWRL premiership. Although they had plenty of potential, the Students usually wallowed at the bottom of the ladder, and they never beat South Sydney during their 18 years in the competition.\n\nThey did manage to reach the 1926 final after disposing of Glebe to qualify, but ran up against a red-hot Souths side. The Rabbitohs got away to an 11-nil lead, but were held scoreless as Uni came back after Souths forward Eddie Root was sent off in the second half for being involved in a number of incidents in the tense final. But the resilient Red and Greens held on for an 11-5 victory to claim their sixth premiership. The closest University ever got to defeating the mighty Cardinal and Myrtle was in Round 13, 1933, finishing with a 20-all draw after leading 20-12 in the second half. After consistently losing players and with on-field performance deteriorating (they won only two games in their last four season), University voluntarily withdrew from the NSWRL after 1937, but still compete in various NSWRL competitions, including the NSWRL Inter-District competition, Second Division and Metropolitan League. University are currently competing in the NSW Tertiary Rugby League competition and will celebrate it's 100th year in 2020. It is important to note that the University club are not affiliated in any way with the current Sydney University rugby union club competing in the Shute Shield. Western Reds/Perth Reds (1995-1997)\n\nPlayed Won Lost For Against % South Sydney Rabbitohs 3 1 2 52 55 33\n\nRugby League has been played competitively since 1948 in Western Australia, and although it didn't reach the popularity it has on the east coast, the sport was more successful in Perth than it was in Melbourne or Adelaide. As the 20th century drew to a close, the NSWRL expanded into the west, and in 1992 announced that a Perth-based side would enter the competition in 1995, named the Perth Pumas (later changed to the Western Reds). After losing 19-14 to the Reds in Sydney during the 1995 pre-season competition, the Rabbitohs travelled to WA in Round 12, going down similarly 18-14 at the Western Australian Cricket Ground. But Souths would get revenge in the same round the following year on their own turf at Redfern Oval, winning 24-18. The match wasn't without controversy though, as coach Ken Shine questioned the tactics of the Reds players, and specifically prop Rodney Howe, who took out half Craig Field after just 12 minutes with a high tackle."}], "Geoff Griffin played for Balmain Tigers for one season.": [{"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2021/01/22/the-forgotten-players-balmain-tigers/", "page_content": "This is the 26th article in the ongoing series in which we remember some of the forgotten players from your favourite club.\n\nToday the famous Balmain Tigers, one of the league\u2019s foundation clubs that survived from 1908 until 1999 before merging with the Western Suburbs Magpies.

Adam Starr\n\nA big prop forward, Starr joined Balmain from the Roosters in 1996 and played 41 first-grade games for the club over the next four years. He went on to play with Redcliffe in the Queensland Cup competition.\n\n16. Steve Lavers\n\nLavers was one of the most feared defensive forwards of his day and didn\u2019t take any prisoners on the field. He played 92 games for Balmain between 1975 and 1982 and also one game for NSW.\n\n17. David Grant\n\nThere weren\u2019t many better forwards going around in the late 1970s and early 1980s than David Grant. A good ball runner and punishing defender, he played 50 first-grade games for the Tigers between 1978 and 1981 before heading to Canberra, where he captained their inaugural first-grade team in 1982. He was very unlucky never to play representative football.

This was particularly true of 1989 as they lost 19-14 to the Canberra Raiders\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nThey have had some wonderful and ground-breaking players at the club and here is my top ten.\n\n10. Gary Freeman\n\nWith only four seasons at Balmain, he is still considered one of the greats. Across 51 games, Freeman scored 19 tries and appeared in both the 1988 and 1989 grand finals.\n\nAlso probably one of the best Kiwi players to never win a premiership in the NSWRL, he played 45 times for New Zealand and also captained the national side on multiple occasions.\n\n9. Tim Brasher\n\nBrasher\u2019s rookie year in 1989 proved fruitful as he made the grand final while still a schoolboy. Although this was the last time the Tigers would ever appear in a grand final it didn\u2019t stop Brasher from having a great career.\n\nHe scored 82 tries, the fourth highest in the club history and be sixth in total club appearances with 185 games. He had 21 appearances for New South Wales and 14 Tests for Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Steve Roach\n\nRoach was a powerhouse and along with Paul Sironen and Wayne Pearce, made up the most intimidating forward pack Balmain ever had.\n\nDuring his 186 games, Roach played in two grand finals (1988 and 1989) and was a destructive force. A hard hitting steamroller earned him the nickname of \u2018Blocker\u2019. He represented NSW 17 times and played in 15 Tests for Australia.\n\n7. Garry Jack\n\nJack was the second longest serving member of Balmain with 244 games, just two behind the all-time record holder Paul Sironen. He played fullback a majority of his career and appeared in the clubs \u201988 and \u201989 grand final appearances. Jack scored 62 tries, played 17 games for NSW and 22 Tests for Australia.\n\n6. Ben Elias\n\nElias is the third longest serving member of Balmain with 234 games. After debuting at Balmain in 1982, he switched from halfback to hooker and became one of the best in the game.\n\nIn 1988, he was selected as the Rugby League Week Player of the Year and is only one of two hookers to do so. He played in both grand finals and in 1990 captained NSW to their first series win against Queensland since 1986. He kicked 33 field goals, a record for a hooker and made 22 appearances for NSW along with 14 Tests for Australia.\n\n5. Paul Sironen\n\nSironen holds the record for most appearances at the club with 246 games to his name. Debuting in 1986 he won the Dally M for Rookie of the Year before playing in the 1988 and 1989 grand finals.\n\nSironen scored one of the best grand final tries in the 1989 grand final to give the Tigers a 12-2 lead at half time, however it wouldn\u2019t be enough to get the Tigers the win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis didn\u2019t stop him from going on to have a great career winning the Dally M Second Rower of the Year in 1990. Sironen represented NSW 14 times and played 21 Tests for Australia, including the 1990 Great Britain and France tour with the Kangaroos.\n\n4. Wayne Pearce\n\nDebuting in 1980, Pearce would quickly rise and take the reigns of the club becoming captain in 1982. His leadership got the team to the semi-finals in 1983 and after a long period of no finals, they made the finals every year until Pearce\u2019s retirement in 1990.\n\nHe won the Rothman\u2019s Medal in 1985 for Best and Fairest and was awarded the Order of Australia in 1988 for his contribution to League. Pearce captained the 1988 and 1989 grand final sides and is one of the greatest captains never to win a premiership.\n\nWith 193 games under his belt, he also represented NSW 16 times and made 19 appearances for Australia.\n\n3. Arthur Patton\n\nOne of the quickest men on field, Patton was a try scoring machine for the club. In his 117 games, he scored 95 tries and won three premierships (1944 as captain, 1946 and 1947). He is also the all-time leading try scorer for Balmain \u2013 a record that will never be beaten after the merger.\n\n2. Arthur Holloway\n\nComing from Glebe in 1909, Holloway was the most successful player/coache at the club. Although the Tigers lost the 1909 grand final by forfeit and Holloway left the club at the end of the 1911 season, he returned in 1915 and led the club to five premierships as a player and a player-coach from 1916 to 1920.\n\nIn 1916 he scored the team\u2019s only try in the game. In total, he played 108 games for the club and score 46 tries. He represented NSW 27 times and played ten Tests for Australia and captained the side in the 1919 tour of New Zealand winning the series 2-1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Keith Barnes\n\nThere is no doubt Barnes is the no.1 player in the history of Balmain. He holds plenty of records and is a member of the 200 club, being the fourth longest-serving member of the Tigers.\n\nBarnes is the highest points scorer with 1519 (1 tries, 542 goals and one field goal). This includes the most points in a game with 22 and most goals in a game with 11.\n\nUnfortunately, like the many greats of the club, he never tasted premiership glory, losing all his attempts in 1964, 65 and 66. He made 12 appearances for NSW and played 17 Tests for Australia.\n\nHe is the greatest man to ever pull on a Tigers\u2019 jersey.\n\nDo you agree with my list?

Both clubs were struggling for survival at that time, with Wests coming off back-to-back wooden spoons in 1998 and 1999 and the star-studded Balmain line-ups of the 1980s a very distant memory. Neither club had the financial clout to compete for players in the post-Super League market.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nInitially both clubs appeared to be headed for mergers with other more financially secure partners, Balmain with Parramatta and Wests with Canterbury, but at the last moment the two foundation clubs decided they had more in common with each other and the deal was done.\n\nHere\u2019s the team that took the field in the joint venture\u2019s very first game against Brisbane, the season\u2019s eventual premiers, at Campbelltown on 6 February 2000, ending in a 24-24 draw.\n\nNumbers in brackets are the total first-grade games the player played for the West Tigers.\n\n1. Joel Caine (75)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaine debuted for St George in 1998, moved to Balmain in 1999 and found himself in the No. 1 jersey for the inaugural Wests Tigers game. He certainly made the most of it, scoring three tries and kicking four goals that day. He finished with the most tries, points and games for the club that season. He left for the UK in 2003.\n\n2. John Carlaw (41)\n\nAfter debuting with the Hunter Mariners in the Super League competition in 1997, Carlaw was part of the Storm\u2019s inaugural side a year later and then joined Balmain in 1999, staying on for the joint venture. He left for the Warriors in 2002.\n\n3. Owen Craigie (23)\n\nFew players possessed the natural talent that Craigie had, and one wonders where he would have gone in the game with the right attitude and mentorship. He joined the Tigers from the Knights in 2000, had two disappointing seasons and then moved on to South Sydney.\n\n4. Terry Hill (49)\n\nHill had ten years in the top grade, a premiership in 1996, 13 State of Origin appearances for New South Wales and nine Tests for Australia when he joined the joint venture from Manly in 2000. He had four injury-interrupted seasons with the Tigers before retiring at the end of 2003 only to make a brief comeback with Manly in 2005.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. John Hopoate (28)\n\nHopoate joined the Tigers from Manly in 2000 but spent most of his time either before the judiciary or suspended. His Tigers career came to an abrupt end in 2001 when the club showed him the exit door following some on-field amateur proctology. He turned out for the Northern Eagles later that year. Some clubs just don\u2019t have any standards, I guess.\n\n6. Kevin McGuinness (55)\n\nBetter known as a centre, McGuinness found himself wearing the No. 6 jersey in the inaugural Tigers game. He debuted for Western Suburbs as a 19-year-old in 1995 and spent three years with the joint venture before shifting to Manly in 2003. In the 2001 season he, along with halves partner Craig Field, returned a positive drug test and was suspended for six months.\n\n7. Craig Field (28)\n\nField was a Souths junior and debuted for the club as a 17-year-old in 1990. He found his way to the Tigers after stints with Souths, Manly and Balmain and was effectively punted by the club early in the 2001 season after being suspended by the NRL for a positive drugs test. He was, as they say, a very colourful character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Jason Lowrie (31)\n\nLowrie brought a lot of experience to the Tigers and had 129 first-grade games and 15 Tests for New Zealand under his belt when he joined the merger from Balmain. He left the club at the end of the 2001 season.\n\n9. Darren Senter (96)\n\nSenter was a versatile player who was equally at home as hooker as he was in the back row. He joined the merger from Balmain after originally making the first grade with Canterbury, and he captained the Tigers for most of his time there after taking over from Jarrod McCracken. He retired at the end of the 2004 season.\n\n10. Shane Walker (43)\n\nWalker had over 100 games under his belt in a ten-year career when he came to the Tigers as a 29-year-old, most notably with Balmain. He moved to the Storm in 2002 for his final season in first grade.\n\n11. Jarrod McCracken (captain) (eight)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcCracken was a star signing for the Tigers and had played over 170 first-grade games and 22 Tests for the Kiwis when he joined to captain the club. Unfortunately his career came to an abrupt end in the Round 15 clash with Melbourne when he suffered serious neck injuries as the result of a spear tackle.\n\n12. Mark Stimson (15)\n\nHailing from Temora, Stimson joined Balmain in 1996 and stayed on following the merger. He retired at the end of 2000.\n\n13. Tyran Smith (42)\n\nTyran Smith seemed to have wanderlust, and had played with five clubs before playing in the inaugural Tigers match. He found a home at the Tigers for a couple of years and was their player of the year in their first season. He played eight Tests for New Zealand in his career and moved on to the Canberra Raiders in 2002.\n\n14.

He had just one season with the Tigers before finishing his playing career in England.\n\n16. Mark O\u2019Neill (121)\n\nA Tigers stalwart, the powerful back rower joined the joint venture after a 102-game career for Balmain and was one of only two players from the inaugural side to win a premiership with the Tigers, along with John Skandalis. He wasn\u2019t offered a Tigers contract for 2006 and finished his career in England.\n\n17. John Skandalis (185)\n\nThe big front rower became a Tigers legend after joining the club from Western Suburbs, where he made his first-grade debut as a 19-year-old in 1996. He had seven years with the club, moved to England for a couple of years in 2007 and then made an unexpected comeback with the Tigers for two more seasons in 2009. He scored the first try for the Wests Tigers in their inaugural game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. Ken McGuinness (six)\n\nA talented outside back, McGuiness debuted for Western Suburbs as a 19-year-old in 1994 and played four Origins for New South Wales across the 1997 and 1998 seasons. He never recaptured his best form with the Tigers, and he left the club at the end of 2000.\n\nCoach: Wayne Pearce (26)\n\nPearce was and is a Balmain living legend, but he was a surprise choice of coach for the joint venture club in 2000 given that he had spent the last six years coaching Balmain into oblivion. He resigned as coach after just one season.\n\nThe Wests Tigers used 34 players in first grade that year, and some of the better known players from 2000 who were not in that inaugural team included the following names.\n\nCiriaco Mescia (38)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMescia was a tough little competitor and a very handy hooker who spent six seasons with Western Suburbs before joining the joint venture. He retired before the 2002 season got underway due to a serious back injury.\n\nLuke O\u2019Donnell (48)\n\nAfter just three first-grade games with Balmain in 1999 the tough back rower joined the Wests Tigers but played only one game of the 2003 season after receiving an 11-week suspension for foul play. He headed north to the Cowboys in 2004.\n\nMatt Seers (54)\n\nPrimarily a speedy fullback, Seers spent seven years with the North Sydney Bears and had played four Origins for NSW by the time he came to the Tigers.

A right-arm, fast bowler and lower order batsman, his selection for the tour was controversial, because of his suspect bowling action \u2013 some of his deliveries were judged to be thrown rather than bowled. The core of his problem was that, due to a childhood accident, he was unable to fully straighten his right arm.\n\nDuring the 1960 tour he was no-balled for throwing in several matches prior to the Test series, but retained his place in the side nevertheless. In his second Test appearance, at Lord's in June 1960, he became the first South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first cricketer of any nationality to do this at Lord's. In the same match, however, he was no-balled for throwing eleven times, and again in an exhibition match that followed the match's early conclusion. These events ended his international career, and after fruitless attempts to resolve his problem, he retired from cricket in 1963, at the age of 23.\n\nGriffin was unfortunate to emerge on the international scene at a time when cricketing authorities were particularly concerned about the growing proliferation of bowlers with dubious actions and were determined to eradicate it. He, along with others, was convinced that he had been made a scapegoat to ensure that certain bowlers would be omitted from the Australian side due to tour England in 1961. After 1960 the throwing controversy largely subsided as an issue in international cricket.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life and cricket career\n\nGriffin was born in Graytown, Natal, on 12 June 1939. He received his education at Durban High School, where he excelled at many sports: cricket, athletics (he held provincial titles for high jump, triple jump and pole vault), and Rugby football (in which he played for the provincial under-19 XV). After leaving school he made his debut for Natal's Cricket XI in the 1957\u201358 season, and played regularly in 1958\u201359. In 1959\u201360 he returned bowling figures for the season of 35 wickets for an average of 12.23, heading the national bowling averages. His figures included 7 wickets for 11 runs in the extraordinary Currie Cup match at East London on 19\u201321 December 1959, in which Natal dismissed Border for 16 and 18. These performances were significant, because a Test tour of England was scheduled for 1960, and South Africa were looking for a partner for their star fast bowler Neil Adcock. Griffin was duly selected, at 20 the team's youngest player.\n\nThese early successes with Natal were, however, marked with a degree of controversy about Griffin's bowling action. As the result of an accident when a schoolboy, he could not fully straighten his right (bowling) arm; he experienced problems with his action while at school, and was twice no-balled for throwing during the 1958\u201359 season while bowling for Natal, although he escaped censure in the 1959\u201360 season. According to Griffin's Wisden obituarist many years later, his bent arm \"allied to an open-chested action, with front foot splayed towards gully, made him look more like a baseball pitcher than a conventional bowler\". John Waite, Griffin's future Test colleague, batting for Transvaal against Natal in 1958\u201359, says he informed the umpire that Griffin was throwing. The umpire replied: \"You concentrate on batting, and leave the umpiring to me.\"\n\nIt was Griffin's misfortune that his emergence as a possible Test bowler occurred at a time when the matter of illegal bowling was an issue of considerable and rising concern among cricket's international authorities. Incidents in a recent England tour to Australia had brought the issue to the fore; South Africa were, therefore taking some risk in selecting Griffin.\n\nSouth African tour of England, 1960\n\nEarly matches\n\nGriffin's first match of the 1960 tour was against Derbyshire, on 7\u201310 May. During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14\u201317 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \"there was something amiss\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21\u201324 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called. When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken.\n\nThe immediate step was to send Griffin to the indoor cricket school run by the former England bowler Alf Gover, in Wandsworth. This treatment seemed to help, but at the same time to reduce Griffin's effectiveness. He returned to the side, and was duly selected to play in the First Test, at Birmingham, on 9\u201314 June. Langridge was one of the umpires, but the match passed without official incident, Griffin taking two wickets in each of England's innings in a game comprehensively lost by the tourists. However, a week later in Southampton, in the match against Hampshire, Griffin was called again, so his inclusion in the South African side for the Second Test at Lord's, on 23\u201327 June, was something of a risk.\n\nLord's Test, 23\u201327 June, and after\n\nAt Lord's, England batted first and scored 362. The match provided mixed fortunes for the beleaguered bowler. In the third over of the innings, Griffin was no-balled by umpire Frank Lee, and ten further times by the same umpire, before the innings closed in sensational fashion. In three successive balls, Griffin had Mike Smith caught behind for 99, Peter Walker bowled for 52, and Fred Trueman bowled for 0, to record the first-ever hat-trick in a Test at Lords. South Africa were then twice bowled out cheaply, the match ending with their defeat early on the afternoon of Monday 26 June. Because a visit from the Queen was scheduled for later that afternoon, to fill the available time the teams agreed to play an exhibition match of 20 overs per side.\n\nIn the exhibition match, despite its informal nature, the umpires Lee and Syd Buller chose to apply the Laws of cricket strictly. Bowling at half-pace from a shortened run, Griffin was no-balled by Buller for throwing on four occasions. When the South African captain, Jackie McGlew, remonstrated, Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by\". Griffin was allowed to finish the over by bowling underarm, but was then pedantically no-balled again by Lee, standing at square leg, for failing to notify him of the change of action. These events provoked both great sympathy for the player and contempt for the authorities. The South African writer Louis Duffus challenged Buller's intransigency concerning the Laws; the exhibition match, he said, was being played outside the \"strict tenets of play\", because of the arrangement that every player was required to bowl. McGlew later wrote: \"My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce.\" There was general anger that the South African management had exposed Griffin to the Lord's Test, given the high likelihood of an incident; the management's response was to blame the press for stirring up the trouble.\n\nSubsequent matches\n\nThe events at Lord's finished Griffin as a bowler on the tour. He remained with the team, and played in a number of subsequent matches as a specialist batsman, generally in the lower order, but on a couple of occasions as an opener. He made a few useful scores, including 65 not out against Lancashire in his next match after the Lord's Test, and 37 in the final match of the tour, against T.N. Pearce's XI at the Scarborough Festival in September.\n\nGriffin was praised in The Cricketer magazine for \"the superb manner in which he has taken [his] misfortune\". A final attempt to analyse and perhaps correct his bowling action was made in the nets at Lord's, during the tourists' match against Middlesex in mid-July. In front of Bradman and McGlew, he bowled wearing a specially-designed surgical brace on his arm, but the experiment came to nothing.\n\nLate career, retirement, later life\n\nAfter the tour, Griffin was approached by a lawyer who offered to bring the issue to court, assuring the bowler that he would win if he brought a case against the authorities, but Griffin declined, not wishing, he said, \"to sully the great game further\". He returned to South Africa, and attempted to revive his cricket career there. He moved from Natal to Rhodesia, and played a few times for his new state, but this ended after he was repeatedly no-balled in a match at Salisbury, against North-Eastern Transvaal, in 1962\u201363. At the age of 23 he retired from first-class cricket. He continued his involvement with the game at club level and as a coach, while pursuing a new career in hotel management.\n\nGriffin died on 16 November 2006 at the age of 67, after collapsing while attending a dinner held at his old school, Durban High. In all first-class cricket he played 42 matches, taking 108 wickets for 2324 runs, averaging 21.51. With the bat he scored 895 runs, av. 17.90, with a highest score of 73. He held 19 catches. In his two Tests he took 8 wickets, averaging 24.00, and scored 25 runs, av. 6.25.\n\nAftermath\n\nNot everyone was convinced that Griffin threw rather than bowled the ball. The former England batsman Denis Compton wrote: \"I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw\". Against this, the South African commentator Charles Fortune was convinced that Griffin threw, as were his team-mates Waite and Adcock. Fortune questioned the wisdom of the selectors in sending Griffin to England: \"they chanced their arm\", he wrote. The England batsman Peter Walker, who played at Lord's, was unequivocal: \"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike [Smith]'s or my mind that he threw virtually every ball\".\n\nSome believed that Griffin had been deliberately scapegoated, as part of a conspiracy to ensure that Australia's suspect bowlers were excluded from the forthcoming 1961 tour of England. In support of the conspiracy theory the journalist Martin Chandler, in his analysis of the throwing controversy, writes that umpire Lee may have been instructed by Allen, during a rain break in England's innings in the Lord's Test, to take a firmer line against Griffin, who had largely escaped attention in the match at that point in time, but was afterwards called on six occasions in rapid succession. According to Griffin's later account, after the match Bradman came to the tourists' dressing room to offer sympathy, and claimed that Allen had ordered Buller to \"call Griffin out of the game\". Griffin asserted: \"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy. I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did\".\n\nIn the event, none of Australia's suspect quartet was selected for the 1961 tour. Burke retired from Test cricket after the 1958\u201359 series; Slater did not add to the one cap he gained during that series, and Rorke's international career had ended by December 1959. Meckiff played on until December 1963, when he was no-balled four times by the umpire Colin Egar during the first Test of a series against South Africa. He then retired from all forms of the game. In cricket generally, the throwing controversy rumbled on in low-key fashion, but did not re-emerge in Tests until 1995, when the Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled for throwing seven times in Melbourne. Analysis through modern technology, however, demonstrated that every bowler, on delivery of the ball, flexed his arm to some extent, and the Laws were changed to reflect this; a 15-degree elbow bend was thenceforth permitted. Had this rule been applied in Griffin's day, it might have saved him."}, {"url": "https://rugbyleagueopinions.com/wests-magpies-balmain-tigers-all-time-greatest-team-xiii/", "page_content": "Wests Tigers: All-Time Greatest XIII\n\nThe Wests Tigers were formed at the end of the 1999 NRL season as a joint venture between two foundation NSWRL clubs \u2013 the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies. Plenty of fans of both clubs did not support the decision at the time, and some still don\u2019t. The Tigers\u2019 number one supporter, the late great Laurie Nichols, died the week before the joint venture was due to play their first match. Maybe it was from a broken heart.\n\nStill, time heals many wounds. Both Balmain (11 premierships) and the Western Suburbs (4 premierships) had very proud histories in first grade. Since their formation, the Wests Tigers have won one premiership, when Scott Prince led a young team to a 2005 grand final victory over the Cowboys.\n\nComing up with the all-time greatest 13 from all that history is sure to spark some debates, especially among those who have never really accepted the forming of the joint venture.\n\nGiven the rich 20th century history of both the Balmain and Western Suburbs clubs, I\u2019ve only found a place for one modern Wests Tigers player. Robbie Farah, though, is a debatable omission.\n\nSome absolute legends from yesteryear have also missed out. From Balmain, the likes of fullback Keith Barnes, winger Larry Corowa, 1990s star Tim Brasher, and the seventh rugby league immortal Artie Beetson (who I previously named in the Roosters all-time greatest XIII, because he played more of his career there) missed out.\n\nMagpies greats who could count themselves unlucky include legendary five-eighths Vic Hey and Terry Lamb (though Lamb spent the bulk of his career at Canterbury), as well as halfback Tommy Raudonikis. Then there\u2019s the great Arthur Summons, another who I couldn\u2019t squeeze in. Together with the giant Norm Provan (a member of our St George all-time greatest XIII), he has been immortalised on the Provan-Summons trophy that is presented to modern day NRL premiers. The muddy \u2018Gladiator\u2019 photo of them embracing after the 1963 grand final captures the spirit of rugby league.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019ve chosen players who had longer careers, more success or were individually more influential in the teams they played in. The stats I\u2019ve listed for each player in the all-time greatest XIII below only include their performances for Balmain, the Magpies or the joint venture, not for other clubs or in representative matches.\n\nFullback: Garry Jack (Balmain Tigers)\n\n249 matches (1981-1995), 59 tries.\n\nGarry Jack was a tough-as-nails fullback who contributed heavily in both attack and defence. He claimed the Golden Boot award in 1986 and was instrumental to the success of the great Balmain teams of the late-1980s (arguably among the best club teams to never win a premiership). Ironically, Jack was initially signed by Western Suburbs and made his first grade debut for the Magpies, before forging a superb career over 14 seasons at the Tigers. He went on to represent New South Wales and Australia with distinction.\n\nWinger: Peter Dimond (Western Suburbs Magpies)\n\n155 matches (1958-1967), 84 tries.\n\nPeter Dimond represented Australia as a teenager while playing for Dapto, before signing with Western Suburbs at the age of 20. The powerful winger starred for the resurgent Magpies, playing in four grand finals against the legendary St George Dragons side. Revered as much for his toughness as his speed, Dimond continued his representative career for the majority of his ten seasons with the Magpies and retired as the club\u2019s all-time leading try-scorer.\n\nCentre: Charles Fraser (Balmain Tigers)\n\n190 matches (1910-26), 54 tries, 165 goals.\n\nCharles \u2018Chook\u2019 Fraser played an incredible 17 seasons with Balmain, winning six titles (including one as captain-coach in 1924). Remarkably, two of those premiership-winning teams went through the season undefeated! Fraser was the focal point of one of rugby league\u2019s greatest backlines and was the competition\u2019s leading point scorer on two occasions. He became Australia\u2019s youngest representative when he was selected to play for the Kangaroos at just 18 \u2013 a record that stood for nearly 80 years until it was broken by Brad Fittler \u2013 and went on to captain his country on the 1921-22 Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain.\n\nCentre: Harry Wells (Western Suburbs Magpies)\n\n86 matches (1956-61), 33 tries.\n\nHarry Wells was another player who represented Australia from the country, before spending six seasons with Western Suburbs where he continued his representative career. A big, blockbusting centre known for his sharp attacking skills, he was a key cog in Wests\u2019 resurgence, helping transform the Magpies from wooden spooners in 1955 to grand finalists in 1958. Wells captained the Magpies to the \u201958 decider, but unfortunately missed the 1961 final due to injury. He played in three World Cup campaigns (two while at the Magpies), where he formed a lethal centre partnership with Rugby League Immortal Reg Gasnier.\n\nReg and I just seemed to fall into a pattern where he knew what I was going to do and I knew what he was going to do. That\u2019s why we were so compatible\n\n\u2013 Harry Wells on his combination with Reg Gasnier\n\nWinger: Bobby Lulham (Balmain Tigers)\n\n85 matches (1947-53), 85 tries.\n\nBobby Lulham was a try-scoring freak for the Tigers over seven seasons and a member of their 1947 premiership-winning team. That year (Lulham\u2019s incredible debut season), he was the competition\u2019s leading try-scorer with 28 \u2013 a season tally that remains a Balmain first grade record. Lulham was fast and could step equally well off either foot, making him a constant attacking threat. Despite playing only 85 matches for the Tigers, he still holds the record as Balmain\u2019s most prolific try-scorer.\n\nFive-eighth: Benji Marshall (Wests Tigers)\n\n201 matches (2003-13), 76 tries, 402 goals.\n\nBenji Marshall was a breath of fresh air when he debuted for the Wests Tigers in 2003; his attacking flair generated a highlights reel that will surely be enjoyed by rugby league fans for decades to come. His most memorable moment was a break and flick pass in the 2005 grand final that led to a stunning try for Pat Richards. Marshall\u2019s speed, ball skills and ability to step often left defenders grasping at thin air.\n\nBenji\u2019s form with the Tigers saw him selected to play for his country at the age of 20. He went on to represent the Kiwis for the next eight years, including captaining them to an upset World Cup victory in 2008. Marshall was awarded the Golden Boot in 2010 and is considered one of New Zealand Rugby League\u2019s greatest ever players.\n\nBenji equals anybody I\u2019ve seen in terms of flair, and making something happen. He is a remarkable talent, born out of living on the edge. That\u2019s the way he is. He was made to be a footballer.\n\n\u2013 Wayne Bennett\n\nHalfback: Keith Holman (Western Suburbs Magpies)\n\n203 matches (1948-61), 70 tries.\n\nKeith Holman holds the record for the most first grade appearances for the Western Suburbs Magpies (203), a club he only joined after being rejected by both Souths and Manly. He subsequently became the Australian halfback for nine seasons due to his consistently brilliant form for Wests. Very physically fit and terrier-like in defence, he was nicknamed \u201cYappy\u201d for his constant talk on and off the field.\n\nSadly, Holman missed Wests\u2019 1952 premiership victory due to being on a Kangaroo Tour at the time of the grand final. He lost the two grand finals he played in during his fourteen seasons with the Magpies against the great St George team of that era.\n\nProp forward: Steve Roach (Balmain Tigers)\n\n186 matches, (1982-92), 12 tries.\n\nA tough, intimidating prop with a short fuse, Steve \u2018Blocker\u2019 Roach never took a backward step against anyone. He was a skilful ball player and a key member of the great Tigers\u2019 forward pack in the late 1980s. Roach controversially missed Balmain\u2019s 1988 grand final loss to Canterbury through suspension. He was also famously replaced by coach Warren Ryan with fifteen minutes to go in the Tigers\u2019 heart-breaking 1989 grand final loss to Canberra, a match regarded as one of the most thrilling grand finals of all time. Roach was a mainstay of New South Wales and Australian teams over the course of his career.\n\nHooker: Benny Elias (Balmain Tigers)\n\n234 matches (1982-1994), 36 tries, 33 field goals.\n\nBenny Elias was a creative and skilful dummy half who was pivotal to the Tigers\u2019 dominant forward pack in the late 1980s. He had a fierce rivalry with opposing hookers Mario Fenech (South Sydney) and Steve Walters (Canberra) throughout his career. Elias was voted the Rugby League Player of the Week in 1988 and played numerous State of Origin and Test matches.\n\nUnusually for a hooker, he kicked a lot of field goals in his career \u2013 but it is one that he missed that will never be forgotten by Balmain fans. His 1989 grand final attempt hit the cross bar in the dying minutes of the Tigers\u2019 dramatic loss to Canberra. Had it been an inch higher, Balmain would have won the premiership that many believe they deserved in that era.\n\nProp forward: Noel Kelly (Balmain Tigers)\n\n111 matches (1961-69), 6 tries.\n\nNoel \u2018Ned\u2019 Kelly was a tough, old school player who holds the dubious distinction of being sent off 17 times in his career. What sometimes gets lost with that statistic is the fact that he was also a brilliant player who dominated in an era where the game was very different to today. Initially making his name as a hooker and later as an outstanding prop forward, Kelly played in Wests\u2019 three consecutive grand finals in the early 1960s. He was selected for three Kangaroo Tours to Great Britain / France and, in 2008, was named in Australian Rugby League\u2019s Team of the Century.\n\nSecond row forward: Paul Sironen (Balmain Tigers)\n\n246 matches (1986-1998), 22 tries.\n\nPaul Sironen was a giant and mobile forward who holds the record for the most first grade games with Balmain. Always destined to be a star, \u2018Siro\u2019 burst on to the scene in 1986 and claimed the Dally M Rookie of the Year Award. His size and surprising speed made him a major attacking weapon for the Tigers throughout his career, always attracting the attention of numerous opposition defenders. He was rewarded for his Tigers\u2019 form with two Kangaroo Tours to Great Britain and France and 14 State of Origin appearances for New South Wales.\n\nSecond row forward: Kel O\u2019Shea (Western Suburbs Magpies)\n\n111 matches (1956-63), 30 tries.\n\nKel O\u2019Shea was another Wests player who represented Australia from the country prior to becoming a key signing for the club in the mid-1950s. His brilliant form continued at the Magpies, where he played in two grand finals (and was denied two others through injury). At representative level, the uncompromising O\u2019Shea built a deadly combination with club nemesis Norm Provan. O\u2019Shea played 20 tests for the Kangaroos and was a key member of Australia\u2019s victorious 1957 World Cup team.\n\nLock: Wayne Pearce (Balmain Tigers)\n\n193 matches (1980-90), 33 tries.\n\nWayne Pearce was captain of the great Balmain team of the mid-to-late 1980s and won the Rothman\u2019s Medal (the equivalent of today\u2019s Dally M Medal) for the best player in the competition in 1985. A great leader and a fitness fanatic, his work-rate was far superior to most other backrowers of his era. Pearce was a local junior who played with intense passion in his prized Balmain jersey, as well as for New South Wales and Australia.\n\nSo that\u2019s my opinion for the Wests Tigers\u2019 all-time greatest 13, taking into account the rich history of two foundation clubs and the joint venture. What are your thoughts and how do you think these greats would stack up against South Sydney\u2019s all-time greatest team?\n\n6"}, {"url": "https://makingthenut.com/20-of-the-best-wests-tigers-balmain-tigers-western-suburbs-magpies/", "page_content": "As we wait for season 2011 to get underway, the Making The Nut team will take a look back over the last 20 years to name the 20 best players at all sixteen teams. Merged teams will take account of both clubs pre-merger and the only rule is that a player must have played at least three years post-1990. A player's time at the club is the only time that is taken into account.\n\nHere, Matt Fisk breaks down his beloved Wests Tigers and its predecessors.\n\n20 .Pat Richards\n\nAlthough only spending two seasons at Concord, Richards clearly deserves to round out this list. He arrived at the Tigers after four years at the Eels and his height and pace soon made a positive impact. He is best remembered for a week of drama when an ankle injury threatened to rule him out of the 2005 grand final. However he made it on to the paddock and it culminated with arguably the greatest grand final try in premiership history. After Brett Hodgson fielded possession on his own tryline, the ball moved to Benji Marshall who tore down the turf at the Olympic Stadium before finding Richards with an immaculate flick pass who, in turn, fended off Rod Jensen to score. The big winger signed a two-year contract with Wigan in June of that same year and despite some last-minute wrangling to have him stay in Australia, Richards was gone from the Tigers for good. Since his move to England Richards has developed his goalkicking to the point where he has twice topped the Super League point scorers list and picked up the coveted Man of Steel in 2010. He also had a very successful World Cup tournament with Ireland in 2008, scoring 22 of his side\u2019s 34 points in their famous victory over Samoa.\n\n19. Darren Senter\n\nSenter was never afforded any representative honours greater than his City Origin jerseys but he had a long and productive career in rugby league. Captain of Balmain in 1999, Senter was ever-reliable during the formative years of the Wests Tigers joint venture and captained them proudly until his retirement in 2004. However he is not on this list purely because of his captaincy (McCracken and Buckets O\u2019Neill have both been overlooked); Senter was a wily and competitive hooker/backrower that played at 100% every week.\n\n18. Lote Tuqiri\n\nLote is a controversial selection considering he is only into his second season with the Wests Tigers but Tuqiri almost always delivers on the field and has the unique ability to get the turnstiles clicking over. After a distinguished career at both the Broncos and the ARU, Tuqiri surprised even his biggest fans by scoring 18 tries in the 2010 season and winning back his Kangaroos jersey. Not many wingers in the past 20 years would be a match for Lote in his current form, let alone when he was in his prime.\n\n17. Keith Galloway\n\nKeith is a popular front rower who remains on the cusp of representative selection. Touted as a future star from his early days in the 2002 Australian Schoolboys, Keith\u2019s development as a front row forward has followed the age old comparison to fine wine. He certainly is getting better with age and is now clearly regarded by Tim Sheens, Tigers team mates and fans as the most important prop in the club. Contracted to the club until 2013, big Keith may well become a NSW Blue in the not-too-distant future.\n\n16. Stephen Kearney\n\nOnly true rugby league trainspotters would know that Kearney started his career at the Magpies in the early 90s. A vital cog in the 1992 winning Presidents Cup grand final side (the last premiership of any kind by Western Suburbs or Balmain), Kearney was touted as a natural leader almost immediately. He captained his country at the age of 21 and the newly formed Auckland Warriors made him their target for their inaugural season in 1995. A great talent and a good advertisement for rugby league. Wests were worse-off for losing him at the end of 1994.\n\n15. John Skandalis\n\n\u201cSkando\u201d was a great clubman through and through. From the night he made his debut against Penrith (May 1996) in one of the most spiteful clashes ever seen at Campbelltown Sports Ground, Skandalis never took a backward step. Many fans lamented the fact he was consistently overlooked for Origin selection but even the player himself would admit he was not the most talented or skilful prop to ever play the game. He helped ease Wests Tigers\u2019 salary cap pressures by heading to Huddersfield in 2007 and remarkably made himself available to assist the club in 2009 and 2010 when injuries struck. Fittingly, he will be remembered in the history books as the first tryscorer for the joint venture.\n\n14. Todd Payten\n\nThe first 8 years of Todd\u2019s career was truly a roller coaster ride. Easing his way into the Canberra Raiders\u2019 top grade in 1996 he was playing finals football with monotonous regularity and higher representative honours were considered a formality. However he fell out of favour in Canberra, had a brief pitstop at Bondi and by 2004 he was granted a last-chance lifeline at the Wests Tigers. In the ensuing seven years he has become one of the most important leaders in the club and is now an NRL veteran with almost 250 games under his belt. In recent seasons he has learnt to curb his natural ball skills and increased his focus on the more traditional roles of a prop forward. The ability to keep his opponents in two minds has since led many coaches to describe him as one of the toughest forwards to defend against.\n\n13. Chris Heighington\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most popular players in the Wests Tigers squad, Chris has been one of the best performed players each and every year at the club since he arrived in 2003. A tough and mobile backrower with a definite larrikin streak in him, Heighington is one of those players everyone wants in their side. In a show of confidence he has declined the opportunity to represent England in order to continue his quest for a Blues jersey. The Central Coast Bears have sounded out the Umina junior for their inaugural season but it looks like Heighington will wear the Tigers jersey until he hangs up his boots.\n\n12. Chris Lawrence\n\nIf Jason Taylor paved the way for Campbelltown juniors to embrace the Magpies and Tigers, then Chris Lawrence is certainly taking advantage of the pathway. Just like the McGuiness boys, John Skandalis and Brett Hodgson, Lawrence is a local boy who takes pride his club. He is lightning fast, runs amazingly accurate lines and treats his body with the respect of a young Wayne Pearce. At Lang Park in 2006, Lawrence was the youngest Tiger to ever debut when he scored with almost his first touch of the game and in doing so, showed Karmichael Hunt a clean pair of heels. Since then he has scored at a rate of better than one try every two matches and even secured a try in his Test debut in Auckland last year. Selection in that match was a fine reward for an impressive 2010 season and if only the selectors picked him in the final over Willie Tonga, the Kangaroos may still be Four Nations champions. Still only 22, Lawrence has almost played 100 matches and is sure to be a regular fixture in the Tigers side for years to come. After working on several defensive lapses that plagued the start of his career, Lawrence is also a big chance of adding to his representative caps in the not-too-distant future. This left centre is deadly and definitely a chance of becoming a Tigers great.\n\n11. Jason Taylor\n\nBelieve it or not, this disgraced coach and rowdy cricket fan also played rugby league for the Western Suburbs Magpies. One of the first local juniors to emerge from the Campbelltown region, Taylor was a standout at St Greg\u2019s College in the 1989 Commonwealth Bank Cup and made his debut for the Magpies in the following season. After four years at a largely struggling club, Taylor chased the dollars being thrown around by North Sydney, the Northern Eagles and finally Parramatta. Despite failing to credit Wests for any of his development, Taylor deserves a spot on this list as he led the way for future Campbelltown juniors to embrace the Magpies. He was the architect behind the players BBQ that led to Peter Louis\u2019 sacking from North Sydney in 1999 and it was fitting of his character that he could not handle being the coach on the end of similar treatment by Souths in 2009. Goalkicking was his strength and he did have very good vision, even at a young age. Unfortunately he was blessed with neither size nor speed and his lack of loyalty in his 276-match career cost him any chance of a lasting legacy in the game.\n\n10. Scott Prince\n\nPrince was the 2005 Wests Tigers premiership captain and Clive Churchill Medallist. For that reason he has made this list but Prince is not remembered fondly by the Tigers faithful. After a turbulent career that threatened to fall off the rails on numerous occasions, Tim Sheens and the Tigers threw Prince a lifeline in 2004. The move was mutually beneficial for all parties and while Hodgson and Marshall supplied the brilliance in 2005, Scott Prince\u2019s controlling kicking game was equally as effective. He turned his back on the club only a year after the premiership success and has never reached any great heights since.\n\n9. Paul Langmack\n\nLangers burst onto the scene in the mid-1980s as a workaholic backrower and achieved plenty of success with the Bulldogs. In later years he moved to the Magpies and refined his game to arguably become the best ball-playing forward of the 1990s. Arriving at Campbelltown in 1991, Langmack immediately impressed Magpie fans when the success-plagued club competed in successive finals series. He also led the side to the 1996 finals as captain and in between, picked up the 1992 Rugby League Week player of the year award. Despite not appealing to representative selectors for much of his career, Langmack is one of the select few who have played 300+ first grade games and 137 of those were with the mighty Maggies. Alongside Andrew Leeds, Langmack stands as the premier Magpie of the 1990s.\n\n8. Ben Elias\n\nDespite his ability to polarise opinions, Benny Elias was a great rugby league hooker. Elias was part of the great Balmain pack of the 1980s that also included Wayne Pearce, Steve Roach and Paul Sironen but like Sirro, he was also one of the game\u2019s best players of the 1990s. He made his debut in 1982 and retired in 1994 after playing 234 first grade games but not before he turned the whole of Queensland (and most of NSW) against him. The Holy Cross junior was the ultimate competitor whose duels with Mario Fenech, the Walters brothers and even Wally Lewis were legendary. Despite never representing Australia again after 1990, Elias was a named man of the match three separate times in State of Origin (1990, 1992 and 1994). He also captained the Blues six times in his career and who will ever forget the image of a blood-soaked Backdoor Benny being embraced by his mum after the 1992 victory in Sydney? It would not surprise me if Robbie Farah based his game on that of Benny\u2019s as Elias\u2019 running game and vision were a pre-cursor to that of the modern-day dummy half.\n\n7. Paul Sironen\n\nPaul Sironen was one of the great rugby league second rowers and would have played at the highest level in any era. An absolute giant of a man, Sirro stood at almost two metres tall but his try in the 1989 grand final proved he was not short of pace. After playing college football in the USA, the former policeman joined the Balmain Tigers in 1986 and over the next 13 seasons played 246 games in total. Sironen also represented NSW 14 times, played 21 Tests for the Kangaroos and also captained the Tigers for the 1995 season. One of the most feared forwards in the past 20 years, Sirro will not be forgotten in a hurry.\n\n6. Tim Brasher\n\nTiger Tim burst onto the scene in the late 1980s as a fresh-faced Balmain junior and after playing as a winger or centre early in his career was soon regarded as the game\u2019s leading custodian. In his 14-year career, Brasher was a mainstay of the NSW Origin side and played 16 Tests for Australia, including the 1995 World Cup final in which he scored a try. While initially coming into the top grade as a player with pace and flair, Brasher\u2019s support play and defence developed over the years to the point where he was one of the game\u2019s stars in the mid-1990s. While he finished his career with stints at North Queensland and South Sydney, Brasher will always be regarded as a Tiger given that he played 185 of his 244 games at the club. He is clearly the last of the great local juniors to play for the Balmain Tigers prior to the 2000 merger.\n\n5. Gareth Ellis\n\nBoth the Balmain Tigers and Wests Magpies have a proud tradition of importing quality English stars. The likes of Ellery Hanley, Garry Schofield, Lee Crooks and Shaun Edwards are not eligible for this list but even if they were, Gareth Ellis would run a close second to Hanley as the best Englishmen to ever ply his trade down under. It certainly is a big call considering the quality of his countrymen over the years, but Ellis is a wonderful backrower. If Warren McDonnell is not remembered for anything else, he should be remembered as the recruitment manager who signed the highly-rated but relatively unknown (in this part of the world) backrower for the 2009 season. Since he made his NRL debut, Ellis has impressed all good judges of the game with his bone-shattering defence and strong running lines developed as a wiry centre back in his Wakefield Trinity days. He has been the Wests Tigers player of the year in both seasons at the club and has extended his contract until the end of the 2013 season. Given the dearth of quality players in England, it is no mean feat that it is widely accepted that Gareth would be a walk-up start into the Australian team if he was fortunate enough to have been born here. Sir Gareth of Ellis is a true warrior that would have excelled in any era of rugby league.\n\n4. Robbie Farah\n\nAs the current club captain and on the verge of cementing a spot in the NSW and Australian teams, Farah conceivably is in the infancy of what could become a decorated career. As a brash Canterbury Bulldogs junior, 18-year old Robbie Farah made the 2002 Lebanese side and went on to play seven first grade matches for the Tigers over the 2003-2004 seasons. He really hit the big time in 2005 and in the ensuing seasons has become one of the leading rakes in the game. A handy defender and ball distributor with a clever kicking game, Farah\u2019s strength is his ability to play the game at his pace as well as spotting flaws in the opposition\u2019s defensive line. He has failed to deliver in his infrequent representative appearances but this disappointing pattern looks set to end in 2011 after his impressive last-start for the Kangaroos in the 2010 Four Nations. Farah has come close to winning the Dally M award on two separate occasions only to be pipped by a solitary point. Expect the Tigers captain to once again challenge for more individual, representative and team honours in the next few years.\n\n3. Brett Hodgson\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that Hodgson enters this list on the tail of Andrew Leeds. He did the same thing at the Magpies in 1997 and certainly did a good job of learning his craft from one of the best. While he didn\u2019t experience many victories in his first three years of top grade rugby league, Hodgson did stand out as a courageous and crafty fullback with plenty of pace to burn. After moving to the Eels in 2000 and making a grand final and Origin series, Hodgson found himself back with the Tigers in 2004. He was awarded the Dally M fullback of the year in 2005 and was the league\u2019s top pointscorer. Consistent and brave performances made him the perfect Tigers captain and he was a regular favourite amongst fans and teammates alike. Hodgson had the ability to perform as a classic fullback but his ability to chime in at first receiver was a valuable string to his bow. After playing the last of his 224 first grade matches in 2008, Hodgson moved to the Old Dart and picked up the Super League\u2019s Man of Steel award in 2009.\n\n2. Andrew Leeds\n\nAndrew Leeds was one of the greatest Magpies to lace on a boot. After a respectable 14-Test career with the Wallabies he spent four modest seasons at Parramatta and Penrith before finding his way to Campbelltown in 1993. For the next seven years he was undoubtedly the best player in the black and white. It was a simpler time, when Fox Sports didn\u2019t broadcast every match of the week and as a result his performances were largely ignored by the wider rugby league community. His positional play and line running were second to none, he was an accomplished goal-kicker and his last ditch defence was something to behold. \u201cJumper\u201d was a true student of the game and despite his rather impressive academic accomplishments off the field, he still managed to appeal to team mates from all walks of life. It comes as no surprise to those that followed his football career that he continues to add value to the Wests Tigers in his role as physio and rehab manager. A more determined and classic fullback I\u2019m yet to see (and I saw a lot of Garry Jack). The true testament to his ability is that he has only been pipped in this list by a Golden Boot winner but has still beaten home two Man of Steel recipients, a Clive Churchill medallist and a two-time Dally M runner-up.\n\n1. Benji Marshall\n\nMany good judges of rugby league have recently anointed Benji as the game\u2019s best player. As we know, this title can be passed on to the next candidate rather quickly but it is a deserved honour and one that I do not expect Marshall to relinquish for several seasons yet. The mere fact that a boy with absolutely no rugby league experience less than 10 years ago, has now developed into the most exciting player ever to lace on a boot for the Magpies, Balmain Tigers or Wests Tigers is remarkable. Originally a touch footballer with only a passing interest in the greatest game of all, Marshall\u2019s talents were spotted and he was quickly offered a scholarship at Keebra Park High. Safely in the Tigers den, Marshall was unveiled against a weakened Knights outfit at Campbelltown in 2003 and immediately made the public sit back and take notice. He stood out in the Tigers\u2019 2004 World Sevens victory and showed glimpses of class in his first grade appearances later that year. It was in 2005 that Marshall truly lit up the NRL and the Tigers finally had a marquee player that fans from Leichhardt, Ashfield, Campbelltown and Concord could all call their own. The 2006-2008 years were tough for Benji due to long stretches on the sideline through injury; however his biggest fan, coach Sheens, never once wavered in his support. As Sheens predicted all along, it turned around, and 2009 was the year Benji matured as a footballer. Injury-free and confident, Marshall began to take more of a leadership role and was clearly showing pride in leading his side around the paddock. In 2010 he continued this rich vein of form in which he went within a whisker of a grand final appearance, led the Kiwis to a Four Nations crown and in doing so, did not miss a game all season. Benji is a leader, he is capable of playing off the cuff or following a gameplan to the letter, he can kick goals and field goals, he can score tries on his own or set up his support players. In short, he is the ultimate rugby league playmaker and has proved himself at the highest level. He currently holds the Golden Boot, he has won a premiership, a World Cup and captained his country to an improbable Four Nations victory. All this at the age of 26 and he is only getting better.\n\nPhoto by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images AsiaPac"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/geoff-griffin/", "page_content": "Geoffrey Merton \"Geoff\" Griffin (12 June 1939 \u2013 16 November 2006) was a cricketer who played two Tests for South Africa in 1960. In his second Test appearance in 1960 at Lord's, he became the first (and, as of November 2014, only) South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first and only cricketer to take a Test hat-trick at Lord's. He is best known for being no-balled for throwing in his second Test and the exhibition match that followed, and he never played Test cricket again.\n\nGriffin was born in Greytown in the former Natal Province and was educated at Durban High School. He was tall and blond, and excelled in many sports, playing hockey for Rhodesia and under-19s rugby for Natal. He was also Natal champion in the high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault.\n\nGriffin suffered an accident in childhood which rendered him unable to straighten his right arm. There was continuing controversy about bowlers \"throwing\" or \"chucking\" the ball (that is, flexing their elbow in the action of bowling the ball, which is contrary to the Laws of Cricket). The issue had been controversial since the editor of Wisden, Sydney Pardon, claimed that Australian fast bowler Ernest Jones was throwing in the tour of England in 1896, and then Jones and C. B. Fry were both no-balled in the Melbourne Test in 1897. The issue achieved renewed prominence following the Ashes series in Australia in 1958\u201359, when Australians Ian Meckiff and Gordon Rorke were suspected of throwing. Other fast bowlers, such as West Indies' Charlie Griffith and New Zealand's Gary Bartlett were also suspected. The MCC was determined to stamp out the problem before the Ashes series in England in 1961, and English umpires were instructed to strictly enforce the rule against throwing in 1960.\n\nGriffin made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in the 1957\u201358 South African domestic season, as a fast bowler. Despite being no-balled in South African provincial matches in the 1959\u201360 season, Griffin finished at the top of the averages, with 35 wickets at a bowling average of 12.23, and was selected to tour England in 1960, aged 20. Griffin was no-balled 8 times during the tour match against the MCC at Lord's in May 1960, the first time that a touring player was called for throwing, and no-balled again several times by various umpires in matches against the counties. His tried to change his action at Alf Gover's indoor school, and was not called once in the 42 overs that he bowled in the 1st Test at Edgbaston, although his pace was much reduced. In the search for quicker deliveries, he fell back into his old faults, and was called in a tour match against Hampshire.\n\nEnglish umpires Frank Lee and Syd Buller repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the 2nd Test, at Lord's, starting from his third over. After being no-balled 5 times on the first day and 6 times on the second day, he returned for a final bowling spell on Saturday 25 June and dismissed M. J. K. Smith with the last ball of one over, caught behind by John Waite for 99, and then bowled Peter Walker and Fred Trueman with the first two balls of his next over. This was the first Test cricket hat-trick claimed by a South African cricketer. England immediately declared their first innings for 362 with 8 wickets down.\n\nEngland quickly dismissed South Africa twice to win by an innings and 73 runs, just after lunch on the fourth day, Monday 27 June, with Brian Statham taking 6\u201362 and 5\u201334. A 20-over exhibition match was arranged to fill the period until the scheduled presentation of the players to the Queen at tea. Griffin was again repeatedly no-balled in the exhibition match for throwing, and was also no-balled for failing to notify the umpires that he was changing to bowl underarm to complete an over. Griffin later recounted that Donald Bradman came to the dressing room to console him, and let him know that the umpires were acting on order from MCC president Gubby Allen.\n\nGriffin remained on the tour as a batsman, but never played Test cricket again. Many spectators could see no difference between his \"legitimate\" deliveries, and the ones that were no-balled: many concluded that he threw every delivery. The public saw him as a martyr and scapegoat, and he was warmly applauded by the spectators at all of his subsequent tour matches. None of the controversial Australian bowlers from the 1958\u201359 Ashes series toured England in 1961.\n\nHe moved to play for Rhodesia, but his cricket career ended less than 2 years later, at the age of 23, after he was no-balled playing in a Currie Cup match against North Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury.\n\nIn retirement from cricket, he played club cricket, was as a cricket coach, and worked as a hotel manager for South African Breweries in Durban, at the Argyll, and then at the Congela Hotel. He married twice.\n\nGriffin died of a heart attack in Durban."}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2022/08/10/the-best-wests-tigers-players-who-never-played-representative-football/", "page_content": "As for previous articles in this series, I will attempt to put together a quality team for each NRL club made up solely of players since 1980 who never went beyond club level.

Davidson played for Balmain for most of the 1980s, at one point playing more than 20 matches for six consecutive seasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavidson appeared in four finals series for the club without ever reaching a grand final. In 1988, he scored a try in the club\u2019s playoff victory over Penrith to reach the finals, but missed their unlikely run to the grand final.\n\nAfter leaving the Tigers, Davidson spent two final seasons at Cronulla before retiring.

He also scored a try in the Tigers\u2019 World Club Challenge loss the following year.\n\nFitzhenry played six seasons for the Tigers before spending two years in England with Hull Kingston Rovers, and then returning for a swansong at Wests in 2010. The versatile player covered every position in the backline at some point, and even hooker over the course of his career. In 2020 he was made a life member of the club.\n\nAfter retiring Fitzhenry played and coached in country football, winning a premiership with South City in Group 9.

He played four finals for the club in the midst of their \u201cFibros\u201d period, reaching preliminary finals in 1978 and 1980. He played the fifth-most games for the club in its history and was inducted into the Wests Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nAfter leaving the Magpies, Smith played a couple of seasons with Cronulla in the mid-1980s.

During a fairly low-key era for the Tigers, Wigham scored more than 50 tries for the club and played in their 1977 and 1983 finals sides.\n\nHe was the club\u2019s top try-scorer in 1980 and 1982.

He topped the club\u2019s try-scoring list 1983 and played in finals series for the club, including a preliminary final in 1986 as they entered a very strong period.\n\nHe also captained the club in their 1985 finals campaign. He managed to play for both City and Country seconds without ever getting a first-team rep jersey.\n\nAfter leaving the Tigers, Bridge played three seasons at Easts but a combination of injuries and form limited him to 18 first grade games. He also spent a season in England with Oldham in 1986-87.\n\nAfter retiring, Bridge remained very active in country football, runs the Taree Bulls and is a member of the Group 3 Hall of Fame.\n\nHalfback: Michael Neil (145) \u2013 1983-1994. 68 wins 72 losses. 24 tries. 8 finals 5 wins\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMick Neil is an unsung hero of Balmain\u2019s last great period where they made back-to-back grand finals in 1988 and 1989. If he had been a yard and a half quicker he would be a premiership winner, having been famously ankle tapped by Mal Meninga to fall just short of the line in 1989.\n\nNeil played for both Wests and Balmain, for four and six seasons respectively, plus a couple for Illawarra towards the end of his career. The two grand final years were also Neil\u2019s best, playing over 23 games each season as the first-choice half or five-eighth.\n\nNeil\u2019s two seasons at Illawarra helped transform the club and they reached a preliminary final in 1992.

He appeared from the bench in the Tigers\u2019 consecutive grand finals in 1988 and 1989 and also played finals with the club in 1983, 1985 and 1986.\n\nHe is a little infamous as one of the replacements brought on by coach Warren Ryan late in the 1989 grand final, replacing stars Steve Roach and Paul Sironen.\n\nHardwick was a pretty decent footballer, but his hair transcended the game, with one of the best mullet and moustache combinations to ever grace the competition (winning a poll on nrl.com in 2020).\n\nHis is maybe only matched by teammate Kerry Hemsley, who appears in the front row here.

Despite losing the captaincy to Scott Prince after a stint on the sidelines due to injury, O\u2019Neill started in each game during the finals and scored a try in the club\u2019s semi-final win over Brisbane.\n\nAfter leaving the Tigers, O\u2019Neill signed off with a season each for Leeds and Hull Kingston Rovers in England. O\u2019Neill has turned to administration in retirement, being football manager for the Tigers and Parramatta.

He was still around five years later, playing second row in the 2010 finals.\n\nAt one point in 2004, Payten was being paid by three clubs, with his Wests Tigers contract being topped up by both Canberra and the Roosters.\n\nProp: Kerry Hemsley (139) \u2013 1980-1988. 71 wins 68 losses. 3 tries. 9 finals 5 wins\n\nAnother great moustache and mullet combination, Balmain 1980s hardman Kerry Hemsley. The Junee junior played nine seasons for the Tigers, with their 1988 grand final loss to Canterbury among his nine finals appearances for the club.\n\nHemsley was at the end of his career by then and only reclaimed his first grade spot for the finals after Steve Roach was suspended.\n\nHemsley represented the Riverina against a touring Great Britain side in 1979 was named The Daily Telegraph\u2019s player of the year in 1983. In amongst his Tigers career he also found time to play off seasons in France (with Le Pontet) and England (with Wigan).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Wigan Hemsley played from October 1983 to January 1984 before joining the Tigers, but was then given permission to fly back in May to appear in the Challenge Cup final. Wigan lost to Widnes, with Hemsley scoring a rare try. He only crossed three times in his NSWRL career.\n\nWhile in England he also played against a touring Queensland representative team, who spanked the England champions by 40-2. But that side did include such names as Wally Lewis (playing the centres!), Gene Miles and Greg Dowling.\n\nAfter leaving the Tigers, Hemsley played on in bush footy for nearly a decade, winning a Group 10 premiership with the Blayney Bears. He is a life member of the Tigers. And if you like a 1980s reference, Hemsley once described himself as \u201cbigger than Texas and meaner than J.R\u201d.\n\nHooker: Neil Whittaker (120) \u2013 1979-1985. 57 wins 61 losses. 11 tries. 1 final 1 loss\n\nBefore he was the NRL boss and more recently president of the North Sydney Men of League, Neil Whittaker was a durable hooker and club captain for Balmain during the early 1980s.\n\nWhittaker held down the hooking position at the Tigers from his debut in 1979 until the arrival of Ben Elias in the mid-1980s.\n\nAfter serving as chairman of Balmain, Whittaker became a key player in ending the Super League war coming in to lead the ARL in 1997 and then took the CEO position of the newly-formed NRL the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter leading the NRL through merger and rationalisation back to 14 clubs, Whittaker left the spotlight behind and moved into other senior business roles.

His greatest year may have been 1986 when Gale scored a try in each final as the Tigers reached the preliminary final.\n\nHe also topped the club\u2019s try-scoring list in 1987. He won the Panasonic Cup with the Tigers in 1985 and 1987. It was neck and neck between Gale and Gary Bridge for the five-eighth slot here.\n\nGale was something of a journeyman, also spending time with Wests, Easts, Norths and Canberra in a career spanning a decade. He also appeared from the bench in Canberra\u2019s 1991 grand final loss to Penrith, where he is part of history as it was Gale\u2019s short dropout that led to a famous Royce Simmons match-sealing try.\n\nAfter a cameo for Hull FC in 1987-88, Gale finished off his career with a full season there in 1992-93 and then played in the Riverina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTragically Gale passed away at just 39 years old from motor neurone disease.

To be fair, Edmed gave some value as he won the club\u2019s player of the year that season, playing 21 games.\n\nPrior to this Edmed had needed to work full-time while playing for the Tigers. Afterwards he had enough cash to buy a house outright and set himself up in a building business.\n\nAfter more than 150 career NRL appearances, Edmed spent a final season playing the English Super League for Sheffield Eagles.\n\nLike many front rowers, Edmed was not a noted try scorer and once went a tick under four years without troubling the scorebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Ayshford (104) \u2013 2009-2013. 51 wins 53 losses. 33 tries. 5 finals 2 wins\n\nBlake Ayshford forged an 11-year career in the NRL. He was a first-choice centre for the Tigers for five seasons from 2009 after being their player of the year in under 20s. Ayshford scored on debut in 2009 and was named their Rookie of the Year.

Geoff Griffin maintained to the end of his days that he was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful chucking conspiracy. Like that of McCarthy Griffin\u2019s cricket career did not last very long, and again in common with his predecessor he was undoubtedly treated badly. There was however one big difference between the two, in that unlike McCarthy Griffin almost certainly did throw.\n\nWhy should there have been a conspiracy is the first question that needs to be looked at. The flippant response to that is to point to conspiracy theories emerging in most situations of great controversy, but to be fair to Griffin when the ground opened up before him the game, in England at least, needed a scapegoat.\n\nA 19 year old Griffin had made his First Class debut in the 1957/58 season without tearing up any trees. His second campaign was much better and, at the same time, Peter May\u2019s England were touring Australia. Having started the season as favourites to retain The Ashes England had been soundly beaten, and blamed the defeat on the quartet who inspired Jack Fingleton to title his book on the series Four Chukkas to Australia. The alleged offenders were Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke.\n\nThe next Ashes series was due to be played in England in 1961, and the authorities did not want Australia bringing with them a group of illegal bowlers thus, so Griffin\u2019s argument would go, they resolved to adopt a zero tolerance attitude against South Africa in 1960. The reasoning was that by making it clear to Australia that, unlike on their own soil, offenders would be ruthlessly exposed, the selectors would be dissuaded from picking those with suspect actions. At this time the four mentioned in the preceding paragraph were by no means the only offenders in the Australian game.\n\nReturning to the 1958/59 South African domestic season it should not be forgotten that during that season Griffin was called for throwing twice by his own umpires. Des Fell called him in the match between Natal and Transvaal, and a couple of weeks later in an end of season trial Arthur Kidson called him as well.\n\nAnother Kidson, Hayward, as far as I can see unrelated to Arthur, was a South African umpire who went on to be one of that nation\u2019s very best and who later wrote an autobiography. Prior to the selection of the 1960 touring party Hayward Kidson had never stood in a game in which Griffin played. But in making that point he did add a telling observation; Bearing in mind the lack of a suitable definition, I would most likely have gone along with the majority of umpires in this country and done nothing anyway. Men more senior than I had passed him, but there were warnings which the South African Board should perhaps not have ignored.\n\nThe side to tour England was to be selected at the end of the 1959/60 domestic season and if the Board were in any way reluctant to select him Griffin spent the summer piling on the pressure. He ended the campaign with the remarkable tally of 35 wickets at 12.22, including 7-11 in the second innings of a bizarre match in which Border were dismissed for 16 and 18. The Board could not ignore form like that, so Griffin was picked. It should also be borne in mind that throughout that momentous season no umpire called him. He didn\u2019t encounter Arthur Kidson, but Fell was not troubled by Griffin\u2019s action in the 41 overs he bowled in a match against Rhodesia.\n\nLike a number of bowlers, Muttiah Muralitharan the foremost of them, Griffin did start out with a \u201cproblem\u201d, in that as a result of a bad break to his right arm in a childhood accident he could not straighten his elbow fully. Thus any square leg umpire would see a bent arm throughout his delivery. There was another factor with Griffin that exacerbated his difficulties. He had the classic open chested action of the thrower, with a front foot splayed outwards at the point of delivery.\n\nGriffin was left out of the side for the tour\u2019s opening First Class fixture against Worcestershire. There was some speculation that the identity of the umpires dictated that decision. One was a known hardliner, Syd Buller, and the other, Jack Crapp, had recently called Worcestershire\u2019s John Aldridge. To add fuel to that particular theory Aldridge was rested by the home side.\n\nThe South Africans next outing was against Derbyshire. Paul Gibb was not afraid to call a throw a throw but Griffin couldn\u2019t be hidden forever so he played. There were six calls from Gibb at square leg, but none of them directed at Griffin who seemed to satisfy most of the travelling press pack that his action was fair. The man called on this occasion, wholly unjustly in this writer\u2019s opinion, was Derbyshire\u2019s Harold Rhodes.\n\nThe next appearance against a county for Griffin was the game against Essex. This time the press did get on his case although the umpires did not. One newspaper, The People, was particularly trenchant in its criticism of Griffin\u2019s \u201cjerk\u201d. The only problem with that argument however was that on an experimental basis the word jerk had been removed from what was then Law 26 for the 1960 season.\n\nNearly all cricketers reminisce fondly about their first appearance at Lord\u2019s, although it was not to prove a happy hunting ground for Geoff Griffin after he was selected to play against the MCC in late May. The day was cold and damp and the start of play, before a disappointing crowd, was considerably delayed. Skipper Jackie McGlew won the toss and invited the home side to bat. There were four uneventful overs from Griffin. His fifth began with a call from John Langridge for dragging, and then half way through the over Frank Lee crossed to point. He immediately called Griffin. It was the first time a visiting cricketer had ever been called for throwing in England. McGlew immediately took his man out of the attack.\n\nShortly before tea Griffin was reintroduced to the attack from the other end. He then guaranteed his place at the forefront of the next day\u2019s Sunday Newspapers by being called by both umpires for the same delivery, by Lee for dragging and John Langridge for throwing. Langridge must have seen something different, because he had allowed Griffin to bowl unhindered in the game against Essex. Langridge called him again later in the game. One of the complaints that Griffin had, supported by many irrespective of their views on his basic action, was that all his deliveries were identical. Thus it should have been a case of all or nothing. Either everything he bowled was a no ball, or all were legal deliveries.\n\nThere was a meeting after the MCC match attended by South African manager Dudley Nourse, the umpires and MCC representatives. Nourse made a statement afterwards to the effect that he was entirely happy with the outcome of the meeting and that he believed that from then on English umpires would not have any further difficulty with Griffin. The press were critical and accused the MCC of condoning throwing. It may be that adverse reaction influenced what happened next, but Nourse\u2019s view proved to be well wide of the mark. Griffin was left out of the next game at Northampton, but was selected to play against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. He was called five times for throwing in the first innings, and three times in the second innings.\n\nIt was clear that by the end of the game Griffin, still not yet 21 and the baby of the South African team had, unsurprisingly, lost his direction and much of his pace. One thing he had however done, on McGlew\u2019s instructions, was bowled his fastest delivery immediately after being called. For many with dubious actions it is their quicker ball that offends. As all of Griffin\u2019s fastest got past the umpires that is something else that distinguishes his case from those of others who, at first glance, might appear similar.\n\nVery sensibly in the circumstances Griffin was packed off to Alf Gover\u2019s indoor school for help in sorting out his action. Gover thought the basic action was fine, and sought to modify it in such a way that at the point of delivery Griffin was in a position where he couldn\u2019t throw. He was back to join his teammates for the game against Glamorgan in which he bowled 18 overs without falling foul of the umpires. South African journalist Charles Fortune described his action as distinctly smoother.\n\nThe first Test followed the Glamorgan encounter and, in a 100 run defeat, Griffin took four wickets altogether and once more avoided censure. Langridge was one of the umpires on duty so, presumably, he too saw a difference. The second Test was, as usual, to be played at Lord\u2019s. In the meantime there were two more county games, against Somerset at Taunton and Hampshire at Southampton.\n\nThere was no Griffin at Taunton, but he did play at Southampton and, if he thought his troubles were over he was to be sorely disappointed. He was called once each by Jim Parks Snr and Harry Elliott in the first innings, and three times by Parks in the second innings as well as once more by Elliott. He had now been called by six different umpires and the South Africans had a difficult decision to make about whether he should be selected for the Lord\u2019s Test. The battle of wills was primarily between Nourse and Gubby Allen, the man who wanted to use Griffin as a stick with which to beat the Australian selectors.\n\nThe simple truth was that without Griffin there was no adequate foil for the South African spearhead Neil Adcock. So Griffin played at Lord\u2019s and South Africa bowled first. Griffin\u2019s first over was uneventful, and in the second he claimed the prized scalp of Colin Cowdrey. Just as he must have started to feel better about himself he then heard Lee call him twice from square leg in his third over. Never before had a bowler been called for throwing in a Test in England. At the close of a truncated day\u2019s play England were 114-2, and Griffin had been called five times altogether.\n\nPlay began on time next morning and England moved serenely on to 210-3 by lunch, losing only Kenny Barrington to Trevor Goddard\u2019s miserly left arm medium pace. Griffin did his share of bowling, and was not called at all, umpire Lee seeming to take less and less interest in him as the session wore on. His interest did however rise considerably after lunch when the new ball was taken and there were two more calls in Griffin\u2019s very first over with it.\n\nThis is another basis for the conspiracy theory. As ever there was nothing different about the way that Griffin bowled after lunch, other than having a new cherry in his hand, but there was a very substantial change in the way that Lee went about his duties. It is difficult to dismiss the idea that Allen had had words with him during the interval. There was a rain break during the afternoon session, and after it Lee called Griffin twice more. By 6.15 pm in the final session Griffin had been called six times in all by Lee for throwing and once by Buller for dragging. He had not taken a wicket all day and when, with England cruising as 347-5, Mike Smith on 99 edged the last ball of an over into the gloves of \u2018keeper John Waite most of the crowd did not know whether to feel sympathy for Smith or delight that the young bowler had finally got something to take from the game.\n\nThere was however much more for Griffin. With the first delivery of his next over he got through Peter Walker\u2019s defences and just clipped the bails. The new batsman was Fred Trueman and his reaction to the hat trick delivery was to take a mighty swing at it and lose his leg stump. It was the first ever Test hat trick at Lord\u2019s and the first by a South African anywhere. The crowd rose to applaud a young man they were growing to like. England reached the close at 362-8 and at that point Cowdrey declared. There was little play on the Saturday, which saw South Africa move to 34-1 in reply, but they then collapsed twice on the fourth day to lose by an innings before mid-afternoon. This committed the two sides to playing an exhibition match as a royal visit was due later so there had to be some cricket in play. The game involved no more than 20 overs per side and two overs per bowler, so it was a game that\u2019s only purpose was to entertain the crowd.\n\nEngland batted first and Griffin took the second over. For the first time on the tour Buller was at square leg for Griffin. The youngster ran in off five yards to deliver the first of his dozen deliveries. For the second Buller crossed to point and then back again to square leg for the third. He called that as well as the next two despite Griffin having cut his \u201crun up\u201d down to a couple of paces and the delivery itself to a gentle loosener. There was a discussion between McGlew and Buller as a result of which McGlew instructed Griffin, following an indication from Buller that it would be the only way he could complete the over, to bowl underarm. Even then Lee chose to no ball the first such delivery on the basis that Griffin, unsurprisingly, had forgotten to inform the batsman he would be changing his mode of delivery. With commendable restraint McGlew wrote later; My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce. Former England and Middlesex leg spinner turned writer Ian Peebles, who published an interesting book on the throwing controversy a few years later, said of the episode, this was the saddest moment I have ever experienced in cricket.\n\nFollowing that particular debacle there was to be no more bowling for Griffin on the tour. He played occasionally as a batsman, and indeed in his first game in that role he scored an unbeaten 65 against Lancashire, but that effort apart there were not too many more runs for him.\n\nThe tour was just about the end of Griffin\u2019s career, but not quite. An International Cavaliers XI arrived in South Africa for a month long tour a few days after the tourists got back. Griffin played twice against them, first for Natal and then for an invitation eleven. After the controversy in England Griffin was a big draw and the umpires, who included Fell, were firmly requested not call him. Howard Kidson stood in the second match and was content to follow orders. What would he have done if there were no such instructions? The answer to that one is as clear as mud. He first wrote I still had no clear definition of a throw although I knew a throw when I saw it, before adding cryptically, with Griffin I was left with a lingering impression that I had been observing something that certainly looked* like a throw.\n\nOne of the Cavaliers on that trip was Trueman who, interestingly, commented; On a dead wicket which wasn\u2019t helping anyone Griffin let one go faster than anything I\u2019ve ever bowled \u2013 it ripped the thumb clean off Norm O\u2019Neill\u2019s brand new batting glove. After the Cavaliers games Griffin moved to Rhodesia were he played a few matches over the next couple of seasons, but he stepped off a First Class cricket ground for the last time at the age of just 23 after being no balled seven times. He only bowled nine overs in what was a sad end to an unfulfilled career.\n\nSo did Griffin throw? In 1960 Richie Benaud wrote; He has a very strong wrist flick in the last moment of delivery but this is quite permissible under the new interpretation of law 26, Benaud was in a tricky position as a man who might have found himself skippering Meckiff, Rorke and Slater the following summer, and he made similar comments about Charlie Griffith before later doing a volte face with him.\n\nDenis Compton wrote; I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw. On the other hand Fortune believed that Griffin threw as, more tellingly, did Adcock and Waite. But for all that no one ever suggested that there was any malice in Griffin. For a fast bowler he was certainly a man with an equable temperament. His reaction to his hat trick was not significantly different to the outwardly phlegmatic response to being called. Trueman summed him up by saying; I would like to say what a really good sport Griffin has been about the whole throwing business. Geoff is a very nice lad, I think we were all sorry for him on that tour.\n\nFurther evidence to support Griffin\u2019s theory came the following year when none of the controversial Australian bowlers were chosen, despite all of them putting forward a decent case for selection in the previous domestic season. It may well be that Geoff Griffin\u2019s action did infringe the laws of the game, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that the treatment that he received at the hands of English umpires was truly appalling. His ordeal should never have been played out in the public eye in the manner that it was and the whole episode is one from which only Griffin himself emerges with any credit.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, when he might have been leading South Africa\u2019s attack with Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, Geoff Griffin was building an alternative career for himself as a hotelier in Rhodesia and was lost to the game of cricket. In due course he moved back to Natal where, at the age of 67, he died from a heart attack in 2006.\n\n*the emphasis is Kidson\u2019s, not that of the writer."}]}
