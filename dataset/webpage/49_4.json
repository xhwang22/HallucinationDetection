{"Honor\u00e9 III established the first public library in Monaco, and founded the first scientific society in the country.": [{"url": "https://monacodc.org/monhistory.html", "page_content": "HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince ancient times, Monaco has always been at the crossroads of history. Initially the Ligurians, the ancient people who first settled Monaco, were concerned with the strategic location of the Rock of Monaco. Evidence of the Ligurian occupation of Monaco was found in a cave in the Saint Martin\u2019s Gardens. Originally a mountain-dwelling people, they were known for their hard work and their frugality, two traits by which Monegasque citizens are known for today. Founded by the Phocaeans of Massalia during the 6th century, the colony of Monoikos became an important port of the Mediterranean coast. Monoikos, from Greek roughly translates to \"single house,\" enforcing the ideas of sovereignty, self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Ancient myths venerate Hercules as having passed through this area.. To this day there is evidence of an admiration of Hercules: the largest port is named Port Hercule. Julius Caesar stopped in Monoecus after the Gallic Wars on his way to campaign in Greece. After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Monaco was ravaged by Saracens and barbarian tribes. After the Saracens were expelled in 975, the depopulated area was reclaimed by the Ligurians. In 1215, construction began on a fortress atop the Rock of Monaco by a detachment of Genoese Ghibellines. With the intention of turning the Rock of Monaco into a military stronghold, the Ghibellines created a settlement around the base of the Rock to support the garrison. To draw in residents from Genoa and other surrounding cities, the Ghibellines offered land grants and tax exemptions to newcomers. Civil strife in Genoa between the Guelph and Ghibelline families resulted in many taking refuge in Monaco, among them the Guelph family. Son of Otto Canella, Consul of Genoa in 1133, Grimaldo began the House of Grimaldi, the future ruling family of Monaco. In 1297, Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi (\"Malizia\", translated from Italian as \"The Cunning\") disguised as a Franciscan monk alongside his cousin Rainier I and his men captured the fortress atop the Rock of Monaco. At his death in 1309, Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi was succeeded by his cousin, Rainier I. His son, Charles Grimaldi, who would come to be known as Charles I, is considered by historians to be the real founder of the Principality. He added the areas of Menton and Roquebrune, increasing the size of the Principality. Charles I had an important role in the court of the King of France. Rainier II never entered Monaco, and divided the land between his three sons, Ambrose, Antoine, and Jean. Jean I, who died in 1454, was succeeded by a son, Catalan. Catalan\u2019s daughter, Claudine, married a Grimaldi of the Antibes branch, Lambert. It was under his rule that Monaco was recognized as independent by King Charles VIII of France in 1489. Almost two centuries after Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi first captured the fortress atop the Rock of Monaco, the Grimaldi's had achieved indisputable sovereignty over the Principality. Repeated attempts by the Genoese to recapture the fortress proved unrewarding. Louis XII confirmed Monaco's independence, establishing an alliance between the Princes of Monaco and the King of France. Then, disputes with the French authorities ended in Monaco being placed under the protection of Spain. This resulted in many financial burdens for the Principality, including shouldering the costs of a garrison Spain placed in the fortress from 1524 for more than a century. Lambert Grimaldi d\u2019Antibes had three sons, Jean, Lucien, and Augustin. Lucien\u2019s son, Honor\u00e9 I had two sons, Charles II and Hercule, and enjoyed a peaceful reign towards the end of his lifetime. However, both of his sons ruled one after the other, neither for very long. Prior to this point, the ruler of Monaco was referred to as \u201cLord of Monaco\u201d. In 1612, Hercule\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 II, was first given the title of \"Prince of Monaco\", which became the official title of the ruler of Monaco and would be passed on to his successors. Honor\u00e9 II led Monaco through a brilliant period; his chief contribution was re-establishing Monaco's alliance with France, which was only realized after more than ten years of negotiations. In 1641, a treaty was signed granting Monaco the protection of France, and furthermore confirmed the sovereignty of Monaco its independence, rights and privileges. Honor\u00e9 II was given a French garrison to command, which he used to expel the occupying Spanish garrison that was still in the fortress. The Prince was received at the French Court and was awarded many honors and privileges. Honor\u00e9 II made additions to the Prince's Palace, as well as decorated the Palace with many paintings, tapestries, and valuable ornaments. Many visitors during this time marveled at the vast collection he had accrued. Despite a lack of resources, the people of Monaco lived rather well, enjoying extensive maritime commerce and profiting from the taxes imposed on ships on their way to Italy. However, the suppression of feudal rights, as was voted by the French Constituent Assembly seized all of the Prince's monetary possessions in 1789, placing the royal family in a grave financial predicament. In 1793, French Revolutionary forces captured Monaco, further exacerbating the situation of the royal family. The vast art collections and all of the possessions of the royal family were sold at auctions. The Palace was converted into a hospital and then into a home for the poor. The Prince's family was imprisoned, freed, and then several members of his family had to enter the French army in desperation. After Napoleon abdicated the throne in 1814, Monaco was returned to its previous state under the new rule of Honor\u00e9 IV. However, the Principality was re-established as a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained a protectorate until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin at the time of Italy\u2019s unification, Monaco was ceded to France. With unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, the Prince gave up his claim to the two towns (which made up 95% of the Principality at the time) in return for four million francs. Both the transfer of these two cities and Monaco's sovereignty were recognized by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. In spite of the four million franc indemnity, Monaco's reduced size and loss of the income it would have gained from Roquebrune and Menton prevented the Principality from escaping its difficult financial predicament. In 1856, Charles III of Monaco (Honore IV grandson) granted a concession to Napoleon Langlois and Albert Aubert to establish a sea-bathing facility for the treatment of various diseases, and to build a German-style casino in Monaco. The initial casino was opened in La Condamine in 1862, but was not a success; its present location in the area called \"Les Spelugues\" (The Caves) of Monte Carlo, came only after several relocations in the years that followed. The success of the casino grew slowly, largely due to the area's inaccessibility from much of Europe. The Societ\u00e9 des Bains de Mer (SBM) opened the famous Monte Carlo Casino in 1863. With an ideal location, Monaco provided an enchanting setting for hotels, the theater, and a casino. Even though it was difficult at the time to reach the Principality, the Casino proved to be a tremendous boon to their economy. The H\u00f4tel de Paris was established in 1864 by Charles III of Monaco adjacent to the casino. It is a hotel in the heart of Monte Carlo. It belongs to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, and is the first elite palace in Monaco. The hotel has 106 rooms divided into four groups based on type of view, decoration and luxury.[5] The Exclusive City View offers 20 rooms, the Superior Courtyard has 29 large rooms, the Exclusive Sea View 59 and the Exclusive Casino has six. Economic development was further spurred in 1868 with a railway link to France, resulting in remarkable numbers of visitors to the Principality. The Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo or Salle Garnier was built by the architect Charles Garnier as an exact replica in miniature of the Paris Opera House. The auditorium of the opera house is decorated in red and gold and has frescoes and sculptures all around the auditorium. It was inaugurated on January 25, 1879 with a performance by Sarah Bernhardt dressed as a nymph. The first opera performed there was Robert Planquette's Le Chevalier Gaston on 8 February 1879, and that was followed by three more in the first season. Albert I, previously devoted to scientific research in the fields of oceanography and paleontology, assumed the role of Prince of Monaco in 1889. With an outstanding reputation, a seat in the Academy of Sciences, and various discoveries which are too numerous to discuss, he established the Oceanographic Museum, which is one of the top centers for oceanography to this day. Jacques-Yves Cousteau was the Director of the Oceanographic Museum from 1957 to 1988. In 1911, Prince Albert I adopted the first Constitution of the Principality, separating the 3 forms of power: executive, legislature and judiciary originally held by the Prince.\n\nThe Prince exercises his sovereign authority in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws. The Prince represents the Principality in its dealings with foreign powers. The total or partial revision of the Constitution is subject to mutual agreement of the Prince and the National Council.\n\n- Legislative power is shared between the Head of State who has the legislative initiative and the National Council which votes on them.\n\n- The executive branch is under the authority of the Prince, the Government is exercised by a Minister of State who represents the Prince assisted by a Council of Government. The Minister of State and Government Counsellors are responsible to the Prince for the administration of the Principality.\n\n- In law, the judiciary is for the Prince. Present Constitution states that He delegates its full exercise to the courts, which administer justice in His name. From this principle flows the independence of the judiciary by the executive Part of the Treaty of Versailles in July 1918 provided for limited French protection over Monaco. This established that the Principality's international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests. Attempting to remain neutral during World War II, Prince Louis II\u2019s sympathies were strongly pro-French. Nevertheless, the Italian army invaded and occupied Monaco. After Mussolini's collapse in Italy, Monaco was also occupied by Nazi Germany. Prince Louis used the Monaco police to warn Jewish inhabitants of Monaco that they were marked to be arrested by the Gestapo, allowing them time to escape. Many Jewish people who lived in Monaco at the time were able to escape due to the assistance of Louis II and the Monegasque police. With the German army retreating from Monaco due to the Allied advance, an American contingent liberated the Principality. Following the death of his grandfather in 1949, Prince Rainier III succeeded the throne as the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. On April 19, 1956, Prince Rainier married the American Actress Grace Kelly. This event focused the world's attention on Monaco, as well as established permanent bonds linking the United States of America with Monaco. They had three children, H.S.H. Princess Caroline, H.S.H. Prince Albert II, and H.S.H. Princess Stephanie. Proclaimed in 1962, a new constitution provided for women's suffrage, abolished capital punishment, and established a Supreme Court of Monaco, guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Prince Rainier had an outstanding reign, turning Monaco into a thriving center of international finance and business, as well as maintaining its status as a premier luxury tourist destination. He oversaw the addition of the Fontvieille district; a district completely recovered from the sea which increased the Principality's surface area by 25%. He pioneered many innovative infrastructure improvements, as well as major projects such the Port Hercule transformation, which allows for more ships to dock there as well as large cruise ships, and the Grimaldi Forum Monaco, a futuristic conference and cultural center. The economy of the Principality increased dramatically as a result. Prince Rainier III established the Principality's status in the international community as well. In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became the 183rd member of the United Nations in 1993 with full voting rights. In 2002 a new treaty between France and Monaco established that if there were no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the Principality would remain an independent nation. In 2004 Monaco was admitted to the Council of Europe. In addition, Prince Rainier III offered His patronage and financial support to various social and humanitarian causes throughout the world. He staunchly supported the work of scientists in resolving environmental issues, and was a foremost supporter of various conservation practices. On April 6, 2005, Prince Rainer III died after a reign of 56 years. H.S.H Prince Albert II acceded to the Throne.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.monte-carlo.mc/en/general/important-dates/", "page_content": "Important dates\n\n10 June 1215\n\nMonaco is taken by the Genoese.

In order to attract more inhabitants, Fulco des Cassello grants great advantages to newcomers such as free land and tax exemptions.

A temple in the Babylonian town of Nippur, dating from the first half of the 3rd millennium bc, was found to have a number of rooms filled with clay tablets, suggesting a well-stocked archive or library. Similar collections of Assyrian clay tablets of the 2nd millennium bc were found at Tell el-Amarna in Egypt. Ashurbanipal (reigned 668\u2013c. 627 bc), the last of the great kings of Assyria, maintained an archive of some 25,000 tablets, comprising transcripts and texts systematically collected from temples throughout his kingdom.\n\nMany collections of records were destroyed in the course of wars or were purposely purged when rulers were replaced or when governments fell. In ancient China, for example, the emperor Shih huang-ti, a member of the Ch\u2019in dynasty and ruler of the first unified Chinese empire, ordered that historical records other than those of the Ch\u2019in be destroyed so that history might be seen to begin with his dynasty. Repression of history was lifted, however, under the Han dynasty, which succeeded the Ch\u2019in in 206 bc; works of antiquity were recovered, the writing of literature as well as record keeping were encouraged, and classification schemes were developed. Some favoured a seven-part classification, which included the Confucian classics, philosophy, rhymed work (both prose and poetry), military prose, scientific and occult writings, summaries, and medicine. A later system categorized writings into four types: the classics, history, philosophy, and miscellaneous works. The steady growth of libraries was facilitated by the entrenchment of the civil service system, founded in the 2nd century during the Han dynasty and lasting into the 20th century; this required applicants to memorize classics and to pass difficult examinations.\n\nGreece and Alexandria In the West the idea of book collecting, and hence of libraries as the word was understood for several centuries, had its origin in the classical world. Most of the larger Greek temples seem to have possessed libraries, even in quite early times; many certainly had archive repositories. The tragedian Euripides was known as a private collector of books, but the first important institutional libraries in Athens arose during the 4th century bc with the great schools of philosophy. Their texts were written on perishable materials such as papyrus and parchment, and much copying took place. The Stoics, having no property, owned no library; the schools of Plato and of the Epicureans did possess libraries, the influence of which lasted for many centuries. But the most famous collection was that of the Peripatetic school, founded by Aristotle and systematically organized by him with the intention of facilitating scientific research. A full edition of Aristotle\u2019s library was prepared from surviving texts by Andronicus of Rhodes and Tyrannion in Rome about 60 bc. The texts had reached Rome as war booty carried off by Sulla when he sacked Athens in 86 bc. Aristotle\u2019s library formed the basis, mainly by means of copies, of the library established at Alexandria, which became the greatest in antiquity. It was planned by Ptolemy I Soter in the 3rd century bc and brought into being by his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus with the collaboration of Demetrius of Phaleron, their adviser. The founders of this library apparently aimed to collect the whole body of Greek literature in the best available copies, arranged in systematic order so as to form the basis of published commentaries. Its collections of papyrus and vellum scrolls are said to have numbered hundreds of thousands. Situated in a temple of the Muses called the Mouseion, it was staffed by many famous Greek writers and scholars, including the grammarian and poet Callimachus (d. c. 240 bc), the astronomer and writer Eratosthenes (d. c. 194 bc), the philosopher Aristophanes of Byzantium (d. 180 bc), and Aristarchus of Samothrace (d. 145 bc), the foremost critical scholar of antiquity."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/honore-ii-monacos-first-ruler-formally-titled-sovereign-prince/", "page_content": "The history of Monaco has always been one of crafting an independent path while great power rivalries swirled around it. Between the reigns of Honor\u00e9 I in 1523 and Honor\u00e9 II just over one hundred years later it was the great rivalries between Spain and France through which Monaco had to ingeniously steer a course.\n\nThe reign of Honor\u00e9 II (1604\u20131662) in many ways could be considered a miracle against the turbulence of the age. Not only did he protect Monaco\u2019s independence, he secured additional formal recognition of it in the diplomatic arena with clarity on the title Prince (rather than Lord or Seigneur) and had the right to mint his own coinage since 1640.\n\nHonor\u00e9 II lulled his Spanish host-occupiers into believing their strategy of limiting his powers was working. They were happy to see him immerse himself in a role devoted to cultural pursuits and entertainment of foreign guests. Meanwhile the Spanish kept a tight rein on governance, protected by their occupying garrison on the Rock. They also limited the role of the Monaco Ruling Council much to the resentment of the Monegasque population. In the meantime Honor\u00e9 turned his custodianship in the cultural domain into a strategic victory for the Principality. Monaco became a magnet for poets, artists, sculptors and musicians. The Princely Palace joined Paris and Florence as a European centre of great culture and learning. Indeed, the quality of the art collection of Prince Honor\u00e9 became a topic of conversation across Europe.\n\nAnd another transformation took place out of what had been originally more a feature of the military fortifications on the Rock. The apartments for the Prince, previously enlarged and renovated by Honor\u00e9 I, became even more regal and palatial. And similarly with the Church of Saint Nicholas.\n\nWhile all the time lulling the Spanish occupiers into a false sense of security Honor\u00e9 was quietly planning his crowning achievement \u2014 to rid Monaco of the oppressive Spanish to whom it had become partially victim.\n\nTreaty of P\u00e9ronne\n\nWorking discreetly, Prince Honor\u00e9 II negotiated with Cardinal Richelieu of France, who represented King Louis XIII. Out of that came the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641) which stipulated that Monaco become a French protectorate. However, most importantly the independent status of the Prince was guaranteed. Monaco was also granted lands in France to compensate for inevitable losses that the break from Spain would entail.\n\nFrench troops were envisaged as garrisoning Monaco with their officers being directly answerable to the Prince of Monaco rather than to the French State. And just as importantly Monegasque independence was to be maintained.\n\nExpulsion of the Spanish\n\nOn November 17, 1641 Honor\u00e9 II put his plan to expel the Spanish garrison into effect. He quickly imprisoned those individuals known to be sympathetic to Spanish rule. Then that same evening he threw a sumptuous banquet for the Spanish troops and their commanders. The soldiers were given generous amounts of alcohol to subdue them and then, at a prearranged signal of a canon shot numerous Monegasques sprang on the Spanish. French troops came rushing out of hiding to finish them off and force them to surrender. Records report only 5 killed and 10 wounded before the Spanish garrison yielded. Monaco then officially expelled them and Honor\u00e9 relinquished his Spanish honorary title of Order of the Golden Fleece. As expected the Spanish confiscated all of the Prince\u2019s property in Spain and Monaco\u2019s Spanish-linked possessions in Italy.\n\nDuke of Valentinois\n\nThe French compensated Honor\u00e9 for the losses of land and titles. Louis XIII made Honor\u00e9 II the Duke of Valentinois, Count of Carlad\u00e8s, Baron of Buis and Calvinet as well as granting him the lands and title of St-R\u00e9my. The monarchs of France and Monaco became very close. Thus when Honor\u00e9 was approached by English Royalists to harbour a fleet in Monaco with the intention of wrestling power from Cromwell, Honor\u00e9 consulted with France\u2019s Cardinal Mazarin who was looking to ally with Cromwell against Spain. On Mazarin\u2019s advice he very diplomatically resisted.\n\nAn Enviable Legacy\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 II died on January 10, 1662 at the age of 64 deservedly very popular and with a legacy of numerous achievements. He had removed Monaco from being under the yolk of Spain. He created a new alliance with the increasingly powerful French while maintaining Monaco\u2019s independence. It also fell to him to help his subjects survive through a plague. Thanks to advice from monks in Nice on cleanliness and sanitation the plague abated. His cultural achievements flowed from a natural passion and the prestige he gained from them led him to be referred to as the \u00abLouis XIV of Monaco\u00bb. And the Sun King Louis XIV would stand as godfather to Honor\u00e9 II\u2019s grandson who was also named Louis, cementing relations with France that last to this very day."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/charles-iii-golden-pages-in-the-history-of-monaco-en/", "page_content": "Prince Charles III of Monaco was born 200 years ago, on december 8, 1818 in Paris, France, as Charles Honore Grimaldi. He was the only son to Prince Florestan I of Monaco and Princess Maria Caroline Gilbert de Lametz. Prince Charles III succeeded his father as sovereign Prince of Monaco ten years later on June 20, 1856. Charles III was not the very first Prince of Monaco. However, many things in the Principality began with him.\n\nThis monarch was the founder of diplomatic relations between Russia and Monaco, and he also signed an agreement for the construction of the first railroad through the Principality. He was the one who built the Monte Carlo area with its famous casino. It was under his reign that the first economic reforms in the Principality were introduced. Charles III thus ensured the future prosperity and wealth of this small state.\n\nIn 1856, Florestan I abdicated in favour of his son and heir Charles III. When he took over the Principality, the situation was not ideal. In prior years, the small country had to cope with global revolutionary unrest, in particular in neighboring France.\n\nThe prince\u2019s power was undermined, the economy was in decline, and few people were willing to visit Monaco or to even learn anything about it. Back then, there were hardly any roads in this mountainous region, never mind a railroad linking it to neighboring France. In addition, as a result of perpetual territorial disputes with France, the Principality did not control nearly 90% of its own territory. The populations of Menton and Roquebrune wished for independence and were rioting.\n\nThe rebellious cities were first promised, and then refused the protectorate of Sardinia. However, they did not give up and were still hoping to become independent. The reason why they fought for this so resolutely was due to the poverty that prevailed in the Principality. The new prince buckled down with renewed energy, as he had no intention of losing this battle.\n\nHe started by implementing economic reform to somehow patch the holes in the budget. For this purpose, the state introduced a sales tax for crossing the French border. But Monaco needed more than that. Charles closely followed international politics. He knew that in order for this small principality to survive, he needed to keep up with the latest trends.\n\nThat is when Napoleon III came to power in France and lifted the ban on gambling establishments spreading all across Europe. The Prince took notice of this change.\n\nIn the mean time, tired from the militant activity in Menton and Roquebrune, the Prince finally decided to pass these cities on to France. In 1861, a treaty was signed under which Menton and Roquebrune would become part of the French Republic. The Principality received a compensation of 4 million francs. And that was only the beginning.\n\nThe Prince then started to build up a relationship with yet another distant, but powerful country: Russia. In 1858, Charles established the first Monaco Order of St. Charles, while strengthening his friendship with the influential ruling Tsar of Russia, Alexander, who later became the first royal to receive this award, the highest state award in Monaco.\n\nIn 1877, Charles III appointed Jean Planchet to be the first diplomatic representative of Monaco in Saint Petersburg. This step proved to be very fruitful for both countries. During his mission as a Consul of Monaco to Russia, Jean Planchet contributed to the signing of a number of agreements with Russia, among them, the agreement on mutual legal and medical assistance for the citizens of both countries, and an act on criminal extradition.\n\nIn 1856, the Prince issued a decree to create a panel responsible for upgrading the coastal line, and later, the whole territory of the Principality. In response to this Ordinance, \u201cLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer\u201d was born.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon was overthrown in France. The ban on gambling houses in Europe returned. The Prince of Monaco then realized that this was his chance. He planned to legalize gambling and build his own casino.\n\nHis mother Caroline Grimaldi helped Charles carry out this difficult task. She managed to gain the support from the wife of a French businessman, Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, by persuading her that the Mediterranean climate would suit her perfectly. Charles III eventually convinced the famous Blanc brothers, casino owners first in Paris and then in Hamburg, to move to the Principality.\n\nIt was rumored that these brothers had sold their souls to the devil in order to learn the secrets of gambling. The Prince invited them to build a new casino in the area which is later renamed Monte Carlo or \u201cMount of Charles\u201d. This was the start of the golden age of the Principality.\n\nIn 1863, the Casino of Monaco opened its doors to the public. A large flow of visitors, for the most part the aristocracy, came to the Principality as the gambling houses were banned elsewhere. At the same time, the Prince was looking after infrastructure. He required a good road network to make access to Monaco easier. Archives say that 5 years afterwards, more than 150,000 tourists from different countries, including America, visited the Principality.\n\nOnce again, the energetic Prince upheld the expectations of his subjects. He signed a new agreement with France to build a Nice-Genoa railway, crossing the Principality. Charles could then afford it thanks to the 15% of the casino profits paid to him by Fran\u00e7ois Blanc, the first director of the Casino of Monaco and \u201cLa Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer\u201d.\n\nIn 1863, Charles III also approved the flag and coat of arms of Monaco.\n\nA year later, he signed a peace and friendship treaty with Tunisia and a customs treaty with France.\n\nDuring the reign of Charles III, Monaco established its own diocese, and so the Prince thus gave religious independence to the state.\n\nCharles also began to mint his own gold coins and issued the first Monaco stamps. Monte Carlo was growing rapidly. More and more buildings were constructed in the area after the Casino: the Hotel de Paris, the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, etc\u2026.Thanks to the income from the casino, Charles III liberated his subjects from taxation, which attracted additional foreign capital into the country.\n\nTowards the end of his life, the Prince rapidly lost his sight due to an old war injury and eventually went completely blind by the age of 60. He died at age 70, in Ch\u00e2teau de Marchais, in France.\n\nHis wife Countess Antoinette de Merode gave him a son who was to be the future Prince of Monaco, Albert I. He distinguished himself and the Principality thanks to his scientific achievements and later became known as a \u201cscientist prince\u201d. You can find more about Albert I in our section on the Grimaldi Royal family. Knowing more about Prince Charles III allows us to appreciate how much he accomplished and how much he transformed the growth and prosperity of Monaco, as well as how he forged a path for his later descendents."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/charles-i-the-first-ruler-to-establish-monaco-as-an-independent-state/", "page_content": "Charles I, Lord of Monaco is often seen as the founder of the Grimaldi dynasty. And he was the first ruler to establish Monaco as an independent state under Grimaldi rule.\n\nCharles I was the eldest son of Rainier I and his first wife, Salvatica del Carretto. Prior to coming to power, the Genoese seized control of the Rock on April 10, 1301 and Charles was forced to flee into exile. After their invasion, the Genoese occupied the Rock for 30 years until Charles attacked to reconquer it. A veteran seafaring adventurer and well established both in the French King\u2019s Court and the Lord of Provence, he swiftly took back the Rock and sent the Genoese fleeing.\n\nHaving established and fortified his base in Monaco, Charles then chased after Venetian treasure ships off the coast of Syria and Egypt. His raids were so effective that the Venetians complained to Pope Benedict XII. The Pope tried to intervene through King Robert of Naples (a loyal protector of Charles) who was also Lord of Provence. He is documented as admitting Monaco was formally outside the frontiers of his territory. This was an important historical moment as it was the first time, in response to the Pope\u2019s attempted intervention, that Monaco was cited as independent and not under any other state\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nCharles I was an important ally to the French Valois in their continuing fight against the English and King Edward III, known as the Hundred Years War. The Genoese too, ended their preoccupation with the feuding between the Guelfs and Ghibellines after a change in their Doge, and became allied with the Grimaldis. This formed a broader alliance with the French against the English. One of the main successes in their naval alliance was the taking of Portsmouth that had been left unguarded by the English fleet when it was away escorting transport vessels and English troops to Flanders. Charles Grimaldi from Monaco and his new ally, Anthony Doria of Genoa, were then encouraged by the Admiral of the French fleet to attack Southampton, which they did successfully. They made off with a treasure trove of loot before the English could send in reinforcements. They also met up with David Bruce, King Bruce II of Scotland, and escorted him safely to France. This was a golden period in terms of controlling the Channel for the Monegasques and the French, to the point where serious consideration was given to invading England. However, between infighting and lack of support from the Pope no serious steps were taken to follow through and the idea was abandoned.\n\nThen the tide turned and the English, under Edward III, took the upper hand against the French. The Genovese alliance fell apart and one faction turned on the French and even tried to set up a French state in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Charles I was occupied first helping the French against the Genoese and then allied with the French to harass the English fishing fleet who in times of war were the source of much manpower to the English naval forces.\n\nAs could be expected, Charles I was not in good graces with Edward III, as there had been excesses committed in the fighting with the English where ears and fingers were cut from victims and put on display in Calais. At one point when the French fleet looked like it was going to be decimated by the English, Charles had managed to get 20 galleys into the Channel in support of the French in campaigns in Chatereaux and Nantes. But severe weather and the English fleet eventually depleted his forces. Not to be outdone, Charles re-provisioned and put another fleet of 32 ships and 7,000 men together to confront the English naval forces and reinforce the French.\n\nBut the reinforcements were too late to stop the English invasion of France across the Channel and this set the stage for one of the strategic defeats in the power struggle with the English. A crushing defeat was suffered by the French at Crecy, where Charles I also fell victim. Crecy, 26 August 1346: a date to remember and a battle that went down in history. Charles I was on the front lines with the French, along with Anthony Doria leading the Genoese. Charles\u2019 forces were exhausted from marching. Worse, and a deciding factor in the battle, the crossbowmen\u2019s strings were wet, degrading the reach of their arrows which fell short of the English lines. Meanwhile, the English had kept their strings dry and the arrows of their longbow-men rang true, decimating the French ranks. Angered and desperate, the French King ordered his cavalry to charge, running over the Genoese infantry in the process. The English longbow-men mowed down the French cavalry with their arrows and wounding Charles in the process. The French forces were decimated and what remained fled, leaving Charles I for dead on the battlefield.\n\nAgainst all odds, Charles\u2019 tough physical constitution meant he did in fact survive. It was a blessing for Monaco as he spent the rest of his reign consolidating the expansions of Monaco\u2019s territory that he had negotiated with the Spinolas and the Lord of Provence. These included Menton and Roquebrune purchased from Nicholas Spinola; and Eze and Castillon purchased from the Lord of Provence. It is rumoured that Charles I bought Menton and Roquebrune with gold from the Southampton raid. These new additions remained in Monaco\u2019s expanded territory for more than 500 years, until 1861. Monaco had all she needed for her livelihood: ovens, mills, and an arsenal.\n\nAs for the succession that Charles I planned \u2014 a joint rule by two of his sons Gabriel and Rainier II together with his uncle was put in place after he died on 15 August 1357. But the new Genoese doge, Simone Boccanegra, elected by the popular party, laid siege to the fortress of the Rock once again and took control. However, it returned to Grimaldi rule in the 1417\u20131419 period.\n\nCharles I of Monaco had eight children, following his marriage to Lucchina Spinola, daughter of Lord Girardo Spinola of Dertonne, including Gabriel, Rainier and Louis. Eventually Louis would succeed his brothers. The Grimaldi dynasty would continue to rule Monaco with an expanded territory thanks to Charles I."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/the-house-of-grimaldi-prince-albert-i-explorer-scientist-reformer-and-pacifist/", "page_content": "The life of Prince Albert I is a fascinating history of exploration and adventure, as well as the promotion of peace. This piece examines his progression from a young dreamer to a leader.\n\n\u201cEurope will sort out its problems which are weakening it and devouring its resources, only with consensus and conflict solving.\u201d\n\nAlbert I\n\nThere is no greater philanthropist and explorer in the Grimaldi family than the great-grandfather of the ruling Prince of Monaco, Albert I. He got his nickname \u201cPrince of the Sea\u201d thanks to an incredible urge to explore the depths of the world\u2019s oceans throughout his many expeditions and his enormous contribution to the development of Oceanography.\n\nThe heir to Charles III was born on 13 November, 1848 in Paris. Little is known about his childhood. The calm adolescence of the young prince was also overshadowed by his later life, full of events and discoveries.\n\nPrince Explorer\n\nUp until he came of age, the future prince served in the Spanish Navy as a navigator. During the Franco-Prussian War, he joined the French Navy before even finishing his studies. Albert I repeatedly excelled in service and was awarded the French Legion Order of Honour. After that, he left the navy and devoted himself to oceanography and ocean studies. Not only was he spending time in the library, studying maps and ancient tomes (though he was doing that as well), he was also embarking on far away expeditions. The Prince has a total of 28 expeditions to the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to his credit. His research trips contributed to the discovery of hitherto unknown currents and depths.\n\nPrince travelled on board his four research ships \u2013\u201cSwallow\u201d, \u201cPrincess Alice\u201d, \u201cPrincess Alice II\u201d and \u201cSwallow II\u201d.\n\nAlbert was traditionally accompanied by a team of scientists: biologists, zoologists, botanists, geographers, and others. Later, the Prince released a book on the results of his expeditions. It was published under the title \u201cThe Navigator\u2019s path\u201d and was very popular.\n\nUnder the direction of Albert I, the first maps of the world\u2019s ocean depths were created. They were so precise and accurate that they served until 1944. Later maps were updated, but Prince Albert\u2019s version was still used as a basis.\n\nAnother discovery by the Prince during his sea expeditions is a small shelf around \u200b\u200bthe Azores archipelago, near Portugal. It was rich in fish and became a key point for fish production in Portugal, as advised by Prince Albert. The place was named \u201cPrincess Alice\u2019s shelf\u201d after the ship that carried out the expedition.\n\nDuring one of his travels, the prince and his research team also discovered a new kind of shrimp that was given the name of Albert I.\n\nThe four North Pole expeditions are recognised as the most dangerous undertaken by the Monaco ruler (in 1898 and 1899). Albert I dreamt of becoming a conqueror of the Arctic ever since his childhood, when he enthusiastically read adventure stories about conquering the boundless sea, dangerous ice and summits. The prince was able to make his dreams come true. He went on expeditions to Spitsbergen to learn more about the local flora and fauna. In honour of his Arctic travels, north-western Spitsbergen was called the \u201cLand of Albert I\u201d. From his polar travels he brought back to Monaco samples for his museum collection and legendary photos for the family album. A moustachioed Captain Albert I gazes into the snowy distance and writes in his diaries: \u201cI felt genuine happiness to see once again the severe melancholy of Arctic landscapes. At this point, the body and the soul harden in the grand battle and the mind becomes serene and clear as in the years of early youth.\u201d\n\nIn 1913 the Prince took a trip to the United States and visited New York, Chicago and Washington. He met a famous hunter of those times, William Cody, known as \u201cBuffalo Bill\u201d. The Prince\u2019s dream to go hunting in the Wild West was not a secret. Newspapers wrote that he wanted to \u201ckill a bear.\u201d Buffalo Bill honoured Albert I by organising a hunt together. The annals of this adventure state that the Prince managed to shoot an elk, a deer and even a bear.\n\nPrince Scientist\n\nBefore coming to power, Albert I could not live a month without setting off on his expeditions on the open sea. But once he ascended to the throne, he had to restrain his explorer\u2019s ardour.\n\nOn 10 September, 1889, after the death of his father Charles III, Albert I became the Prince of Monaco and had to return from the distant Atlantic waters to the solid ground to run the Principality. By that time he was already divorced from his first wife, Mary Victoria Hamilton.\n\nThe marriage could not have been called a happy one, as the young couple was practically forced to marry under family pressure only a month after their first meeting. The newlyweds were more than just incompatible.\n\nAlbert I thought his young wife frivolous and silly, he did not find in her an intelligent and like-minded companion who the educated prince was so looking forward to.\n\nAs to Mary Victoria Hamilton, Scottish by origin, she did not share her husband\u2019s love for dangerous adventures and travels and she did not even care for Monaco or the Mediterranean coast. Pregnant soon after their marriage, at the age of 19, Mary was accompanied by her mother to her ancestral estate in the city of Baden. On 12 July, 1870 she gave birth to Louis, son of Albert I and future heir to the throne of Monaco. As for their marriage, Albert I and Mary never reconciled or got along, so they were eventually divorced by the Roman Catholic Church in 1880. Their son, future Louis II, grew up in Baden. He was raised by his mother and did not see his father until the age of 11. That\u2019s when he came to Monaco to receive the necessary education to become a future ruler of the Principality.\n\nAlbert\u2019s heart stayed with the ocean. After ascending to the throne, he became closer to Professor Milne-Edwards, director of the Natural History Museum in Paris. Professor supported the Prince\u2019s idea of creating a \u201ctemple\u201d dedicated to the ocean, its history, flora, and fauna. Albert wanted to share all the knowledge and discoveries he had accumulated in the 28 expeditions prior to his taking the throne. As a result, the Monaco Oceanographic Museum was opened on 25 October, 1910. Up to this day it is known and recognised worldwide for its rich collections. Six months after opening, on 23 January, 1911, the Institute of Oceanography was opened in Paris, on the initiative of Prince Albert I.\n\nHowever, oceanography was not the only science that attacted the Prince\u2019s inquisitive mind. He was also interested in anthropology and palaeontology. The Anthropological Museum was thus opened in Paris in 1902. And a year later, the Institute of Human Palaeontology.\n\nThe Prince knew too well that he could not embark on any more long voyages, but his desire for exploring the sea depths and learning their secrets did not leave him. Albert I therefore sponsored more than 3,500 expeditions and built research ships mainly from the income of the Monte-Carlo casino.\n\nAll his discoveries were recognised by the world scientific community. In 1909 Prince Albert I was elected member of the British Academy of Sciences and in 1921 he received an honourary gold medal from the American Geographical Society where he was referred to as \u201cPrince Scientist.\u201d\n\nPrince Reformer\n\nThe Prince did not only gain world recognition through his scientific and research activity. Albert I also introduced significant changes to life in the Principality.\n\nTo begin with, in 1911 Albert I introduced a new constitution in Monaco. The country became a constitutional monarchy. Legislative power is now shared between the prince and the new National Council elected by a universal vote.\n\nThe population required that the Prince adopt the Constitution, threatening him with a coup d\u2019etat and establishing a republic like in the neighbouring France. Monaco residents were not happy with a strong French presence in their politics and economy. The unemployment rate in the country was high. The adoption of the Constitution allowed people to remain calm, and for the government to restore the economic situation in the state and preserve social peace in the small principality.\n\nThe second marriage brought Albert I additional financial support which he invested in the development of Monaco\u2019s cultural life. Maria Alice Heine, the young widow of the Duke of Richelieu, was fond of theatre, opera and ballet. However, as with the first marriage, this union did not last long. Although the couple never got divorced, they separated after a serious scandal.\n\nDuring these years the Prince constructed the Monaco Opera House where his wife invited the famous Diaghilev troupe to perform. Albert I also organised the first automobile race of the Monaco Grand Prix in the hope of attracting the world\u2019s attention and increasing the flow of tourists into the Principality.\n\nPrince Pacifist: \u201cI am fighting the Great War to end all wars!\u201d\n\nIn addition to his many interests, Prince Albert I was also an ardent supporter of peace. Before the start of the First World War, he was fervent in his efforts to persuade Wilhelm II not to engage in the war. Unfortunately, he did not succeed that time. As soon as the war was declared officially, Monaco announced its neutrality and unwillingness to take part in the hostilities. Although, indirectly Monaco was still on the side of the Allies (the united coalition opposed the German occupation). The Principality offered its spas for a free treatment of soldiers and combatants.\n\nFeeling compassion for people suffering torment under the German occupation, mainly in Belgium and northern France, Albert I turned once again to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany. He requested that he prevent his troops from mistreating the civil population in the conquered regions that surrendered without resistance. As a result of his active calls, Albert I rescued two French villages in the Alsace region, Sisson and Marche, from possible complete destruction by the Germans.\n\nIn continuation of his pacifist policy as a ruler of Monaco, in 1903 the Prince established the World Peace Institute in the Principality. This institution was definitely a forerunner of the later League of Nations, and then, the United Nations. The goal of the Peace Institute was identical to that of the future UN: preservation and maintenance of peace and conflict resolution on an international scale. Albert I, a fierce fighter for justice, closely followed the trial of Captain Dreyfus. He even wrote a public letter inviting him to live in his castle (after Emile Zola criticised the judicial system and claimed Dreyfus case was an error). This letter was published in all the newspapers.\n\nOn 26 September, 1922 Prince Albert I of Monaco died in Paris and the throne of Monaco passed to his son Louis II. Albert I has stayed in the memory of future generations as a Prince Explorer, Prince Scientist, Prince Reformer and Prince Pacifist. Prince Albert I of Monaco lived a life that was truly eclectic and he will continue to be known as inspiring leader in the Principality\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/Public-libraries", "page_content": "Public libraries are now acknowledged to be an indispensable part of community life as promoters of literacy, providers of a wide range of reading for all ages, and centres for community information services. Yet, although the practice of opening libraries to the public has been known from ancient times, it was not without considerable opposition that the idea became accepted, in the 19th century, that a library\u2019s provision was a legitimate charge on public funds. It required legislation to enable local authorities to devote funds to this cause.\n\nPublic libraries now provide well-stocked reference libraries and wide-ranging loan services based on systems of branch libraries. They are further supplemented by traveling libraries, which serve outlying districts. Special facilities may be provided for the old, the blind, the hearing-impaired, and others, and in many cases library services are organized for local schools, hospitals, and jails. In the case of very large municipalities, library provision may be on a grand scale, including a reference library, which has many of the features associated with large research libraries. The New York Public Library, for example, has rich collections in many research fields; and the Boston Public Library, the first of the great city public libraries in the United States (and the first to be supported by direct public taxation), has had from the first a twofold character as a library for scholarly research as well as for general reading. In the United Kingdom the first tax-supported public libraries were set up in 1850; they provide a highly significant part of the country\u2019s total national library service. The importance of public library activities has been recognized in many countries by legislation designed to ensure that good library services are available to all without charge.\n\nIn many cases public libraries build up collections that relate to local interests, often providing information for local industry and commerce. It is becoming more usual for public libraries to lend music scores, phonograph records, compact discs, and, in some countries\u2014notably Sweden and the United Kingdom\u2014original works of art for enjoyment, against a deposit, in the home.\n\nNot all countries provide public library services of an equally high standard, but there has been a tendency to recognize their value and to improve services where they exist or to introduce them where they do not. Public librarians work strenuously, through such organizations as the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), for such developments."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/rainier-i-the-first-lord-of-monaco/", "page_content": "In the first issue of HelloMonaco magazine, we introduced you to the founders of the Principality of Monaco, Otto Canella (Consul of the Republic of Genoa) and his youngest son, Grimaldo Canella. The story continues\u2026\n\nThanks to their status, the family became known as Grimaldi, bringing forth the legendary Francesco Grimaldi. He learned the nickname \u00abThe Sly\u00bb after deceivingly conquering the fortress, the mainstay of the Monaco princely family. Sadly, Francesco turned out to be childless.\n\nAfter his death, his first cousin, and step-son, Rainier I, became the first ruler of Monaco. This is where we continue the story\u2026\n\nNot many people today know what a legendary character Rainier I of Monaco used to be. He brought glory to the Grimaldi family thanks to his courageous sea and land campaigns. During the Fifth Crusade, Rainier I was the commander of the fleet that brought the Kings of Jerusalem and Hungary to Egypt.\n\nFrom the commander to the lord of Monaco\n\nRainier Grimaldi was born in 1267. He was the oldest son of a French priest, Lanfranco Grimaldi, and grandson of the Genoa Consul, Grimaldo. After the death of his father, his mother married Francesco Grimaldi. Rainier later became a top naval commander at the service of\n\nKing Charles II of Anjou. The glory of Rainier\u2019s fleet was phenomenal. His courage brought him fame all across the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 1297, as the legend goes, Rainier agreed to help his stepfather, Francesco Grimaldi, take the fortress on the rock from the Genoese. Their victory marked the start of the Grimaldi reign in Monaco. To this day, Monaco\u2019s Coat of Arms features two monks with swords, commemorating the legend of Grimaldi\u2019s warriors taking \u00abThe Rock\u00bb disguised as monks, hiding swords under their long robes. Rainier became the first lord of Monaco, Rainier I.\n\nAt the service of the French King\n\nAt the time, King Philip IV of France launched a massive and ambitious campaign against a long-time enemy, England. Many believe that the continental blockade was Napoleon\u2019s idea, but it was actually devised by Philip IV. The monarch made alliances all across the continent \u2013 from the Baltics to Sicily \u2013 to boycott English goods and leave the English island economically isolated. Although his policy worked, English King Edward I found a \u00abgap\u00bb in the French plan. It turned out that Flanders was a weak link, isolated by the policy along with England. Edward I thus made an alliance with the count of Flanders to monopolize trade between England and the continent. This quickly compromised many ports, especially along the French coast, which began to incur some serious losses.\n\nThe wealthy merchants became a potential threat to the ruling nobility in Flanders. French King, Philip IV, supported the lords, while Edward I was standing with the merchants. In 1302, it all resulted in a military clash and the defeat of the aristocrats led by Philip IV. The French monarch was forced to seek help. Remembering the services offered to Charles of Anjou, Philip IV turned to Rainier Grimaldi.\n\nThe Battle of Zierikzee\n\nRainier brought 16 armed galleys to the French coast and Philip IV engaged 20 of his own ships. Rainier was in charge of training the French soldiers for the battle with the English, whose fleet was considerably inferior to the French. The Dutch and Flemish allies of England, however, had an excellent naval flotilla and reputation.\n\nThe battle took place in August, 1304 at Zierikzee. Despite the superior enemy, the French fleet under Rainier\u2019s leadership won the battle, and captured the Flemish Admiral, Guy de Dampier. In gratitude, King Philip IV granted Rainier the title of Admiral General of France and presented him with the French city of Villeneuve, in Normandy.\n\nThe Rainier I family\n\nIn 1309, Rainier built a fortress known today as the Chateau Grimaldi in Cagnessur-Mer. He was then given the title of lord of Cagnes.\n\nThe Lord of Monaco was married twice. His first marriage was with Salvatica del Carretto, daughter of Giacomo del Carretto, Margrave of Finale (in Liguria). Salvatica gave Rainier four sons: Charles, Vinci Guerra, Salvaggia, and Luca, the future lord of Villefranche. Rainier\u2019s second wife was Andriola Grillo, but they had no children. Admiral Rainier died in 1314, and his son Charles I became the next Grimaldi ruler."}, {"url": "https://todayinhistory.org/11/08/benjamin-franklin-opens-first-library/", "page_content": "On November 8, 1731, Benjamin Franklin opened the first library in the North American colonies.
