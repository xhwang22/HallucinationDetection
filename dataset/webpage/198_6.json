He has\n\neight sisters, something he says has influenced his design\n\naesthetic. \"I love romanticism and sensuality, maybe because I come\n\nfrom a family with eight sisters,\" he told the *New York\n\nTimes* in 2007."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/fashion/burberry-riccardo-tisci.html", "page_content": "After months of speculation, Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci as its new chief creative officer.

He has dressed countless celebrities, including Michelle Obama, Cate Blanchett and Julia Roberts. Madonna sported his designs on red carpets (she wore a design with no derri\u00e8re to the Met Gala), at her concerts (Tisci created pieces for her 2008 \u201cSticky & Sweet\u201d tour) as well as at the Super Bowl (he outfitted her for her 2012 performance, above center). Beyonc\u00e9 wore his designs to the Met Gala for five years in a row, most notably a dress made entirely out of latex (above left) last year.

But the number of employees at Givenchy has more than tripled since Mr. Tisci joined the house in 2005, and sales revenue is believed to have grown to around 500 million euros ($539 million) annually. There are now 72 free-standing stores worldwide (compared with seven in 2005), with a Rome flagship set to open this year, and plans for a London store are underway for next year. Last week, LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury group, posted record revenue and profits for 2016, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe and a pickup in demand in Asia.\n\n\u201cRiccardo has accomplished everything a designer can do for a brand, clocking a very respectable tenure and creating a fully realized language for them,\u201d Ms. Fargo said.\n\nSo, why leave?\n\nMr. Tisci said in his statement, \u201cI now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions.\u201d But rumors have suggested he may be headed to Versace. It would mean going home to Italy, and to a brand whose unabashed Italian sex and power-woman aesthetic mirrors his own. And Mr. Tisci is close to Donatella Versace (he shocked fashion in 2015 when he featured Ms. Versace, at least nominally a rival designer, in a Givenchy ad campaign).\n\nBesides, the suggestion, briefly beloved of the industry, that a designer needs a timeout from the increasingly endless show seasons, which was posited when both Mr. Simons and Ms. Waight Keller left their posts, increasingly seems like smoke and mirrors. After Dior, Mr. Simons took an even bigger job at Calvin Klein, and Ms. Waight Keller is said to be moving to a different brand (Givenchy?)."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/from-the-archives-riccardo-tisci-givenchy", "page_content": "Legend has it that when the young Italian designer Riccardo Tisci interviewed for the top spot at Givenchy, he was the only candidate not to mention the founder\u2019s muse Audrey Hepburn, the petite actress known for a cool, ladylike perfection. Hepburn was, in short, the polar opposite of the fiery femme fatale Tisci has attracted to his Givenchy, since arriving at the LVMH label in 2005. \u201cMe, I like clothes very painted on the body\u2014really to the millimeter,\u201d the designer told Vogue in 2012.\n\nTicsi\u2019s flame has attracted such glittering divas as Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, drawn, one imagines, not just to the obvious sex appeal of Tisci\u2019s reveal/conceal dresses, but to their exquisite craftsmanship. Tisci, who designs ready-to-wear and couture, is known for taking traditional feminine and fragile furbelows, like fringe and beads and lace, and using them to express strength. His Catholic upbringing, on the other hand, might explain his tendency to the Gothic and his finely tuned sense of transgression.\n\nGirl power is a subject that Tisci is intimately acquainted with, having been raised, after his father\u2019s early death, by his mother and eight sisters. He has carried this knowledge, and his (Italian) love of family over into his work. Tisci\u2019s posse is creative, diverse, and inclusive\u2014and not just on paper. The designer cast his friend Lea T, who is transgender, in his shows and campaigns. This is but one example of Tisci\u2019s gift for keeping things \u201creal.\u201d He\u2019s a designer who forges genuine connections, to his friends and his clientele, as well as to the street. As the designer told Vogue: \u201cI like to get emotions out of things.\u201d Take a look at 12 years of his sensational work captured in the pages of the magazine."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/givenchy-announces-clare-waight-keller-as-creative-director/", "page_content": "PARIS, France \u2014 Givenchy has announced Clare Waight Keller as its new artistic director, replacing Riccardo Tisci, who had held the position since 2005. Tisci exited in January and is widely expected to move to Versace. Waight Keller is the second female designer to take the creative lead at an LVMH couture house, following in the footsteps of Maria Grazia Chiuri at Christian Dior. Prior to Tisci, the house has also previously had John Galliano, Lee Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald as creative directors.\n\nThe brand took to Instagram to break the news to its 7.7 million followers. As a teaser, an hour prior, it shared a photo of the label\u2019s founder, Hubert de Givenchy, as well as a quote, stating that \"true elegance comes with a natural gesture, an attitude in simplicity.\"\n\n\u201cHubert de Givenchy's confident style has always been an inspiration and I am very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this legendary house\u2019s history,\u201d said Waight Keller in a statement issued shortly after the Instagram announcement. \"I look forward to working with the teams and writing a new chapter in this beautiful story.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BRs5q_RAdXu\n\nThe former Chlo\u00e9 designer will report to Philippe Fortunato, CEO of Givenchy Couture, who said: \"I am very excited to see Clare bring her singular sense of elegance and modernity to Givenchy. By exploring our maison's 65-year heritage and the outstanding savoir-faire of its ateliers, I am convinced Clare will help Givenchy reach its full potential.\"\n\nBernard Arnault chairman and CEO of LVMH added: \"I believe her widespread expertise and vision will allow Givenchy to enter the next phase of its unique path. I am very much looking forward to her contribution to the maison's continued success.\"\n\nWaight Keller's appointment could mark a dramatic shift for the French brand, which has embraced hip-hop and celebrity culture under the leadership of Tisci. The fiery Italian-born designer became known for his high-octane embellished collections, and achieved notoriety for distinctive graphic sweatshirts, sneakers and sportswear-inspired garments, as well as close personal and professional relationships with celebrities including Madonna, Kanye West, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian West. Under his tenure, Givenchy also grew into a significant business, estimated to turn over more than \u20ac500 million in revenues, with an EBIT margin of 10 to 15 percent.\n\nWaight Keller, in contrast, is known for her calm and affable manner and interest in the arts. The British designer\u2019s success at Chlo\u00e9 was rooted in in her ability to deliver wearable, desirable garments \u2014 and perhaps most importantly, high-margin shoes and handbags \u2014 that moved at retail. Her talent for accessories will be welcome at Givenchy, which has not delivered a hit bag since the \u2018Nightingale\u2019 early in Tisci's tenure, and the role will see her return to designing menswear as well as womenswear.\n\nAlthough she has no experience in haute couture, Waight Keller will likely be drawn to the rich heritage of the house, which was founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952 and become known for linearly elegant couture favoured by Audrey Hepburn, Wallis Simpson and Jackie Kennedy.\n\nWaight Keller graduated from the Royal College of Art in London and moved to New York to work for Calvin Klein on graduation, subsequently overseeing the menswear design of Ralph Lauren's Purple Label. She was then tapped by Tom Ford to work at Gucci alongside Christopher Bailey and Francisco Costa as a senior designer, and remained at the brand until she was appointed creative director of Pringle of Scotland in 2005.\n\nWaight Keller will present her first collection for Givenchy in October in Paris, for Spring/Summer 2018.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n[ Clare Waight Keller Exiting Chlo\u00e9 ]\n\n[ Riccardo Tisci Leaving Givenchy ]"}, {"url": "https://hypebeast.com/hb100/2016/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci was appointed creative director of Givenchy back in 2005 and has remained at the helm of the brand since then. Tisci graduated from Central St. Martins in 1999, working for brands such as PUMA before working with Ruffo Research for three years. After this contract ran out in July 2004 he created his own eponymous line. The collection only lasted for a single season before catching the attention of Givenchy.\n\nTisci\u2019s work at Givenchy succeeded on several fronts, the first one being that, in comparison to the previous designers at Givenchy, his couture range was a success. Then he made the house a trailblazer by using Lea T, a transgender model for his Fall/Winter 2010 collection \u2013 a move widely unheard of for a house the size of Givenchy.\n\nIn addition to this, he also maintains regular collaborations with sportswear brands such as his ongoing collection with Nike. His influence has also seen Givenchy collaborate with Isetan to create a capsule collection and hire rappers such as Travi$ Scott to work his afterparties. His forward-thinking approach to design, brand collaboration and casting ensures that he\u2019ll be at the helm of Givenchy for years to come."}, {"url": "https://hypebeast.com/the-hypebeast-hundred-2015/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci\n\nCreative Director of Givenchy\n\nProfile Nationality Italian\n\nItalian Age 41\n\n41 Discipline Fashion\n\nRiccardo Tisci is the creative director of French fashion house Givenchy.
