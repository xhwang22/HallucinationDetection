Not because of performance, but because of injury.\n\nSteven Threet, who beat out Nick Sheridan for the job after the pair split time the first two games, didn't practice Sunday and is questionable for the Wolverines' matchup Saturday at No. 3-ranked Penn State.A five-game starter for Michigan (2-4), Threet suffered a bruised elbow in the first half of last weekend's loss to Toledo and is still feeling the effects of the injury, Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said.\n\n\"You don't know how long those things will linger,\" Rodriguez added Monday.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u2022 Michigan football eager to move on from Toledo loss\n\n\u2022\n\nMayo: Rodriguez will win at U-M with his recruits\n\n\u2022 Video: 'We've got to stay the course,' says Rich Rodriguez\n\n\u2022 Full Michigan football coverage\n\n\n\nThe coach said he won't make a determination about the position until he sees whether Threet can practice today or Wednesday. Rodriguez said he's optimistic the redshirt freshman will be able to play against Penn State.\n\nFor the year, Threet has completed 50.8 percent of his passes (67-of-132), with six touchdowns and three interceptions. In four games, Sheridan has completed 26 of 45 passes with one touchdown and five interceptions.\n\nInjury update\n\nBesides Threet, another player deemed questionable for the Penn State game is junior running back Brandon Minor.\n\nAfter suffering a rib injury while scoring the Wolverines' only touchdown against Toledo, Minor sat out the rest of the game. Postgame X-rays revealed nothing more than bruising, Rodriguez said, but Minor \"has to be able to protect himself (on the field). We'll see how that goes during the week.\" Minor is the team's third-leading rusher, with 86 yards. If Minor can't play, the team's top three tailbacks will be freshman starter Sam McGuffie, redshirt junior Kevin Grady and freshman Michael Shaw, who verbally committed to Penn State before deciding to attend Michigan.\n\nRodriguez said that three starters - defensive end Brandon Graham (leg infection), slot receiver Martavious Odoms (shoulder) and cornerback Donovan Warren (leg) - are expected to play Saturday. A trio of backups - wide receiver Junior Hemingway (mononucleosis), linebacker Austin Panter (shoulder) and running back Carlos Brown (foot) - will be out.\n\nFeagin may play\n\nAfter saying in early September that freshman quarterback Justin Feagin would redshirt this season, Rodriguez's plans have apparently changed. The coach said Monday that he's looking at using Feagin at a new position, slot receiver.\n\n\"I wish we would have gotten him in the game Saturday (against Toledo),\" Rodriguez said.\n\nSlot receiver is one of Michigan's thinnest positions, currently manned by Odoms and back-up Toney Clemons. But Rodriguez didn't rule out trying Feagin at quarterback, either, if necessary.\n\n\"Obviously, with Threet's situation we have some tough, physical games coming up,\" Rodriguez said. \"You have to have some quarterbacks ready. (Feagin) will take some reps at quarterback, too, but he's way behind in that regard. So it's more for him in the slot.\"\n\nIf Feagin does see action, he will be the 10th true freshman to play for the Wolverines this season.\n\nLopata feeling OK\n\nPunter Zoltan Mesko, who's also the holder on placekicks, said Michigan kicker K.C. Lopata is \"doing fine\" after he missed a 26-yard field-goal attempt at the end of the 13-10 loss to Toledo.\n\n\"He'll always be a great kicker,\" Mesko said of Lopata, who has made 15 of 19 career field-goal attempts. \"You just have to forget about something that happened in the past. You can't do anything about it, no regrets, so move on.\"\n\nMichigan State game time\n\nMichigan's Oct. 25 home game against No. 20 Michigan State is scheduled for a 3:30 p.m. telecast. The game will be shown on ABC.\n\nSquib kicks\n\nMichigan is 10-3 all-time against Penn State, and has won nine straight in the rivalry. ...

I love the guys that I've played with. Throughout my career I've had to make a lot of tough decisions, but this has been the toughest I've made so far.\"\n\nFormer Michigan quarterback Steven Threet has quit football after suffering four concussions in five years. File photo\n\nThe season-ending concussion against UCLA was the second of Threet's junior season at Arizona State. The first came on Oct. 23 at California. Previously, Threet suffered concussions his senior year at Adrian High School and in 2008 while playing at Michigan.\n\n\"Doctors have told him a fifth concussion could be debilitating,\" a source told ESPN.com. \"You don't want to be 35 years old and can't hold up a cup of coffee.\"\n\nThreet was recruited by Georgia Tech in 2007 as one of the top 10 quarterback prospects in the nation, but after the coaching staff that recruited him was ushered out, Threet transferred to Michigan.\n\nPer NCAA transfer rules, he sat out the 2007 season.\n\nAt the end of the season, Michigan coach Lloyd Carr retired, and Threet -- at 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds -- wasn\u2019t an ideal fit for new coach Rich Rodriguez\u2019s spread option offense. He stayed at Michigan anyway, and after Ryan Mallett transferred, wound up starting eight games during the 2008 season\n\nHe completed 102 of 200 passes for 1,105 yards with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions for the Wolverines, who finished 3-9.\n\nBy the next year, he had to weigh his long-term interests: stick it out at Michigan or find a pro-style offense elsewhere?\n\nAfter that season, Rodriguez recruited Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson to run his offense and Threet decided it was time to move on again. He chose Arizona State over Oregon State.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely difficult, having played, and knowing I was going to sit out another season,\u201d Threet told AnnArbor.com in September. \u201cWhen I had the chance to come down here on my visit and to see what was going on, it was just definitely something I wanted to be a part of.\u201d\n\nThreet completed 61.9 percent of his passes last season, throwing for 2,534 yards with 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions for the 6-6 Sun Devils.\n\nHe told the Arizona Republic that he's on schedule to graduate in May and still plans to work with the Sun Devils this season."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/10/threet_expects_to_play_for_wol.html", "page_content": "University of Michigan quarterback Steven Threet pointed to a spot on his right arm just above the elbow Monday.\n\n\"Basically from about here down, my whole hand tingles,\" he said, describing the sensation he felt in two recent games. \"It's not necessarily pain, because you can play through pain, but I can't grip a ball.\"\n\nThe tingling sensation, which first occurred when Threet was tackled out of bounds and landed on his elbow during the second quarter of an Oct. 11 loss to Toledo, caused him to miss the second half of that game. It also forced him from last Saturday's Penn State loss in the third quarter.\n\nIn both instances, Threet was replaced by Nick Sheridan, who combined to go 11-of-25 for 70 yards and two interceptions in the two relief appearances.\n\n\"It's very frustrating not being able to be on the field, fighting out there with the other 10 guys on offense,\" Threet said. \"Whether or not we're moving the ball, you still want to be out there.\"\n\nWith Michigan (2-5, 1-2 Big Ten) preparing to host Michigan State (6-2, 3-1), Threet intends to play. He'll practice this week, he said, and be ready to compete Saturday.\n\nIce, electrical stimulation and ultrasound are among the methods used by Michigan's training staff to help Threet recover from the injury, which he described as a bruised elbow. Despite being \"terrified of needles,\" Threet also received an injection during each of the last two games.\n\nThe shot at halftime of the Toledo game was to shrink the swelling, he said, and the one during the Penn State game was to reduce the pain.\n\n\"Any way I can get back on the field, I'm for it,\" Threet said, adding that team doctors and trainers did a \"great job of explaining what they're doing to me.\"\n\n\"They have my best interests at heart,\" he said. \"They're not going to put me in a bad situation.\"\n\nAn X-ray last week didn't show any breaks or bone chips, Threet said, only a bruise. Once the tingling dissipates, recovering his range of motion in the elbow is Threet's highest priority.\n\n\"Hopefully it won't be a chronic thing,\" Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said \"The elbow is a sensitive issue.\"\n\nIn the first half against Penn State, before the elbow was re-injured, Threet played well, rushing for 47 yards on 10 carries, and completing seven of 11 passes for 73 yards as the Wolverines staked out a 17-14 lead. Then in the third quarter, he got hit on back-to-back plays.\n\n\"I felt it starting to tingle on, I think it was second down. I tried to shake it a little bit,\" he said. \"On the next play, a guy hit it again.\"\n\nThough Threet returned for one series in the second half of the Penn State game, Sheridan took the bulk of the snaps, and completed three of nine passes for 5 yards.\n\nGrowing up, Threet attended quite a few Michigan-Michigan State games, and said he can't recall seeing the Wolverines lose. In fact, they haven't been beaten by the Spartans since 2001, and haven't lost to Michigan State in Ann Arbor since 1990.\n\nThis season, however, Michigan is in the midst of a three-game losing streak, and its quarterback can't wait to get back into the lineup and help lead the team.\n\n\"It's disappointing when you have to stand on the sideline and watch because, obviously, everybody wants to play,\" Threet said. \"I'm trying to work during the week to get healthy to the point that that doesn't happen anymore.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/11/rodriguez_threet_doubtful_for.html", "page_content": "In his Monday morning news conference, University of Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said that quarterback Steven Threet has a shoulder injury and is doubtful for Saturday's season finale at Ohio State.\n\nThreet has started eight times this season, but missed the Nov. 8 Purdue game because of a concussion.

After that third-down play, Threet walked over to the sideline, his arm hanging by his side.\n\n\"He lost complete feeling in it, couldn't throw,\" Michigan quarterback coach Rod Smith said. \"Sat him out a series, tried to rehab it over there, got the feeling back, then he got hit on it again.\"\n\nThreet, who declined comment after the game, actually left for two series, then returned for one, during which he was sacked on a third-and-5 play by defensive end Aaron Maybin, the Big Ten sack leader. Threet fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Koroma. The Nittany Lions, who scored 39 unanswered points in the game, converted Threet's fumble into a touchdown.\n\nAfter that, Sheridan re-entered the game for Michigan's final three series.\n\n\"Just trying to keep him healthy,\" Smith said of Threet. \"The kid's fighting, give him that.\"\n\nFor the game, Threet was 9-for-13 for 84 yards.

Still suffering symptoms nearly two and a half months later?\n\nNow a source tells ESPN.com's Bruce Feldman that Threet's career is likely over.\n\n\"Doctors have told him a fifth concussion could be debilitating,\" the source told Feldman. \"You don't want to be 35 years old and can't hold up a cup of coffee.\"\n\nUpdate: Threet confirmed the decision to retire to the Arizona Republic.\n\nThreet, a transfer from Michigan, will be a senior next year next fall. While he started 11 games in 2010, the general feeling around the program was that backup Brock Osweiler was the frontrunner to start in 2011, whether Threet was available or not, after Osweiler led the Sun Devils to wins in their final two games.\n\nOsweiler replaced Threet early in the UCLA game and threw for 380 yards and four touchdowns in a 55-34 win.

Osweiler completed 57 percent of his throws for 797 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nStill, Threet's loss is significant. For one, he might have staged a comeback this spring, and competition in itself likely would have been good for both Threet and Osweiler. Further, even if Threet didn't eclipse Osweiler, having an 11-game starter as a backup is a significant security blanket.\n\nThe Sun Devils QB situation is even more precarious because No. 3 Samson Szakacsy, who also had starting experience but suffered through recurrent arm problems throughout his career, retired this offseason to pursue other interests.\n\nThe good news is true freshman Michael Bercovici has already enrolled and will participate in spring practices, which may make him the frontrunner for the backup job.

Lewis has been a potent weapon for the Sun Devil offense this season. Lewis already has three 100-yard rushing games to his name, collecting them in consecutive weeks. This marks the first time since 2003 that an ASU running back has totaled three straight 100-yard games, and the sixth time since 1992. Against Portland State in the season opener, Lewis had 100-yards receiving on three catches. He is the first Sun Devils since George Montgomery in 1993 to collect a 100-yard receiving and rushing game in the same season. Lewis is a dangerous all-purpose threat, gaining 398 yards on the ground and 234 yards through the air. He has scored three rushing touchdowns and two receiving.\n\nKERRY THE LOAD: Senior Kerry\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/taylor_kerry00.html\">Kerry Taylor is turning in a standout senior season. Having already established a new career high in receptions, Taylor has made a team-leading 28 catches for 389 yards and two touchdowns. He has also tied his single game career high in receptions twice with six against both NAU and Wisconsin. Taylor also had six receptions at Oregon State on November 1, 2008. Taylor's previous career high for single season receptions was 27, set in 2008. He gained a career high 405 yards that season.\n\nHERE'S TO YOU, MR. ROBINSON: Junior Gerell\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/robinson_gerell00.html\"... Robinson had a breakout day against the Ducks, hauling in a team-leading seven catches for 94 yards, his first catches of the season. He established new career highs in both categories, topping his previous highs of six receptions and 68 yards. He recorded a career milestone in Corvallis against the Beavers, hauling in a 39-yard TD reception in the first quarter, the first touchdown of his career. He also led the team with his 73 yards on four receptions. He added his second career touchdown against Washington.\n\nSPREADING THE WEALTH: The 2010 Arizona State offense has many weapons, and through the first half of the season it is showing all of them off.

Of those 19, three are true freshmen (Lewis, Irabor, Onyeali).\n\nTHREE AND OUT: The 2009 ASU Defense was one of the top teams in the nation to force opposing offensives into three-and-out possessions. The Sun Devils averaged 3.75 three-and-outs a game, for a total of 45 in their 12 contests. The D picked that right back up in 2010, forcing opponents into 26 three-and-outs over the first seven weeks, in the top 17 in the nation for average per game.\n\nPUSH `EM BACK, PUSH `EM BACK: In 2009, the Sun Devil defense routinely made tackles for loss or for no gain. The defense finished 2009 with 120 plays that went for negative or no yards, totaling 292 yards lost for the offense. The Sun Devils were a negative play machine against Washington State on October 10, recording 26 Cougar plays to go for a loss or for no gain. The defense has continued that trend in 2010. Against Cal they forced 16 plays of negative or no gain for 40 yards in losses.\n\nRUN, SPARKY, RUN: Last season, the Sun Devil rushing game totaled 24 runs of 10 yards or more, including two of 50 or more. Through seven games in 2010, ASU has already surpassed that total. There have been 29 runs of 10 yards or more this season, including Deantre\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/lewis_deantre00.html\">D... Lewis' 53-yard touchdown run against Oregon.

Threet made his first career start for ASU against Portland State, and what a debut it was. The Michigan transfer, who started eight games for the Wolverines in 2008, was 14-21 for 239 yards and two scores in just under two and a half quarters. The 239 yards was the third highest total for a Sun Devil QB making his first ASU start since 1993. Only Rudy\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/carpenter_rudy00.html\">... Carpenter (401) and Sam\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/keller_sam00.html\">Sam Keller (370) threw for more, and they both played all four quarters. Threet's QB rating of 184.17 was the second highest, second only to Carpenter's 207.6. Threet's 239 yards in his first career action at ASU also set a new ASU record for most passing yards by a Sun Devil QB in his first ever game action at ASU.\n\nCAREER NIGHT FOR THREET: Quarterback Steven\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/threet_steven00.html\">S... Threet had a huge game against Northern Arizona, establishing new career highs in several categories. Threet threw for 391 yards and three touchdowns, both career highs. He also completed 33 passes to set a new career high. Against Oregon, Threet established a new high in attempts (50) and tied his career high with three touchdowns. His previous highs: 18-35 for 250 yards in Michigan's loss to Illinois on October 4, 2008. His previous career high in touchdown passes was two, which he had done three times, including the season opener against Portland State.\n\nNO SMALL CATCH: Wide receiver Brandon\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/smith_brandon00.html\">B... Smith caught a nine yard pass from Brock\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/osweiler_brock00.html\">... Osweiler in the fourth quarter against Portland State. While it may seem insignificant at first glance, it was anything but. It was Smith's first catch since October 25, 2008, a span of 17 games between receptions. During that time, he suffered a major knee injury, was granted a medical redshirt and graduated from Arizona State. After playing in 11 games in 2006, Smith appeared in just one from 2007 to 2009.\n\nSENIOR CLASS: ASU has just 13 seniors on its roster this year, its fewest since the 1985 squad had just 10, which was the year prior to ASU winning the Pac-10 title and the Rose Bowl. ASU's 2007 Pac-10 title team had 27 seniors, while its 1996 undefeated regular season and Pac-10 title squad had 22. The 1986 Pac-10 and Rose Bowl champion team had 18. The 2010 and 1985 Sun Devils are the only ASU teams to have a dozen or fewer seniors in the past 35 seasons (1976-2010). How odd is it to only have 13 seniors? Digest this...the St. John's BASKETBALL team is scheduled to have nine this year. The 13 is the smallest senior class in the Pac-10.\n\nRACKING UP YARDS: The Sun Devils ran for 242 yards in the season opener against Portland State, the most rushing yards since October 13, 2007 against Washington, when ASU, led by Ryan\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/torain_ryan00.html\">Ryan Torain, ran for 296 yards. ASU collected 210 yards on the ground against Oregon. The last time the Sun Devils rushed for over 200 yards in two games or more in a season was 2007, when they did it three times. They did it once last year (at Washington State), but did not do it in 2008.\n\nWEBER LOOKS TO CEMENT HIS LEGACY: Kicker Thomas\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/weber_thomas00.html\">Th... Weber looks to cement his legacy in the ASU record books during his senior season. Weber has been stellar throughout his Sun Devil career, connecting on 61-79 (77%) field goal attempts. He made 43 field goals during his first two seasons in Maroon and Gold, the most ever by a Sun Devil kicker over the first two years of his career. He broke the record held by Luis Zendejas, who had 40 field goals in his first two seasons. The winner of the 2007 Lou Groza Award, presented annually to the nation's top placekicker, a First-Team All-American by the Associated Press and a First-Team All-Pac-10 honoree, Weber was sensationally consistent during his freshman season, connecting on 24-of-25 field goals (96.0 pct.), with a long of 53 yards. A three-time Pac-10 Conference Special Teams Player of the Week in 2007, Weber set numerous Sun Devil records in only his first college season, including a record streak of 17 made field goal attempts to begin the year (also a nation-leading streak for the season) and a nation-high accuracy rating. A sharpshooter off the kicking tee and in the classroom, Weber has earned Academic All-Pac-10 honors three times, earning First Team in 2007, Second Team in 2008 and honorable mention last year. Weber has scored 301 points in his ASU career, fourth most in school history. He is second place all-time in school history for made field goals, passing Jesse\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/ainsworth_jesse00.html\"...

Smith was granted an extra year of eligibility for 2010 after missing all of 2009 with a knee injury. The 6-2 senior played in one game over the past three seasons, battling injuries off and on throughout his ASU career.

Cornerback Omar\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/bolden_omar00.html\">Omar Bolden was also granted an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA after missing the majority of last season with an injury.

Offensively, they are very physical and their offensive front is probably as good as I\u2019ve seen in college football in a long time. Their quarterback is the best in the country. Andrew Luck jumps out at you with the way he plays. The way they run the football and play-action pass is very consistent through every game. He has a lot of God-given talent. Their receivers are playing well and they are scoring points against everyone they play. Defensively is where I see the biggest difference from a year ago to today. They are really consistent and physical on defense. They do some different things, as they have a new coordinator. Playing very well in the secondary and a lot of those guys played last year. They have played well against everyone. Oregon scored points on them, but they score points against everyone. They\u2019re a solid football team. They lose one game to Oregon in Eugene and no one has been close to them except USC. They have pretty much dominated every football game this year. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to play a top-10 team at home and we are excited about that aspect of it.\u201d\n\nOn Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck:\n\n\u201cHe was awfully good coming out of high school. He was raised in a football family with his dad being an NFL quarterback at Houston. When you watch him in high school, I remember he was very well schooled coming out. Jim Harbaugh has done a tremendous job with him too. Jim Harbaugh said he was special from day one and he is exactly right. He\u2019s special. They redshirted him the one-year and he probably could of played. They had a plan for him and he is an exceptional player.\u201d\n\nOn Trevor\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hankins_trevor00.html\">...

He\u2019s improved a lot, but unfortunately with what we do offensively if you throw it in the wrong place then you are going to have some issues. He did that in the first half at USC, but he came back and played extremely well in the second half. He is getting better all the time. Once he has a year in the offense, I would say that about any quarterback in what we are doing. The second year is obviously going to be a heck of a lot better. It\u2019s a learning process for him. He made a lot of good plays, but some mistakes. That\u2019s the nature of the position. I like where he\u2019s at and where he is right now as he moves forward with the last few games we play and next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the nature of the quarterback sometimes. They are all very competitive and sometimes they try to make certain things happen when its not there. It\u2019s better to throw it away but that\u2019s the nature of a competitor. That\u2019s happened to him and hopefully he will learn from that and I think he will.\u201d\n\nOn the team\u2019s mood:\n\n\u201cSomber, very somber. When you go on the road against a program like that and you have a chance to win the football game and don\u2019t it\u2019s disheartening. I would be disappointed if they weren\u2019t somber and disappointed in the game. We had some chances and we fought back. We gave ourselves an opportunity at the end of the football game to win it. It\u2019s been the story of our year. We have had those opportunities a number of times. We haven\u2019t won one of those games and hopefully we can do that here shortly. They understand where we are at and what\u2019s left in our season. They have a lot of pride and good leadership. We have a great opportunity this week playing a top-10 team at home. They are disappointed and down like all of us were.\u201d\n\nOn kicking situation:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a guy who has been kicking here for four years. Obviously, he is not having a good year. The situation we have is we are redshirting a kicker that we believe will be our kicker of the future. To take him out of it right now would be insane. We are going to stay with Thomas\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/weber_thomas00.html\">Th... Weber and hopefully he makes some. He\u2019s disappointed and he\u2019s not going to blame anybody. When you change holders it has a little bit of an effect, but he just missed the kick.\u201d\n\nOn decisions to go for two or one:\n\n\u201cWhat we did Saturday was exactly what you needed to do. We don\u2019t just pull it out of our ears. We had to go for two the first time. It was a two possession game when we scored and you have to go for two sometimes. I decided to do that and I would do it again. The other situation, when they blocked the extra point, there was no reason to go for two. I don\u2019t even know what people would be thinking. We scored a touchdown and if we make it we are up five. They go down then they can\u2019t beat us with a field goal. If they go down and score a touchdown then it\u2019s seven and we can come back and kick a field goal to win it. If we don\u2019t then we are kicking to tie the game. We have a chart that tells you what to do, but that\u2019s not always right either. We made the right decisions, it\u2019s just that it was blocked and went for two.\u201d\n\nOn Vontaze Burfict\u2019s personal foul:\n\n\u201cHe just hit a guy late. They both came and hit each other and they threw the flag. It wasn\u2019t like he went looking for somebody to hit. It\u2019s just part of the game and we had four penalties in that football game. We haven\u2019t had anything like that in a long time. Obviously, it hurts and there is no question about it.\u201d\n\nOn the blocking of special teams:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s about accountability. We kick the ball a lot of times in that game and blocked it perfectly every time. Then a guy isn\u2019t accountable on what he\u2019s supposed to do and he flat misses the guy. That\u2019s what happened at Wisconsin too. It\u2019s accountability to do your job all the time regardless if you are playing three plays or seventy plays. You have to be accountable every time the ball is snapped. Obviously, we didn\u2019t block it correctly. It wasn\u2019t any magic thing they did. Our guard went down and dropped his head and the guy came right over the top of him.\u201d\n\nOn Brandon\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/magee_brandon00.html\">B... Magee:\n\n\u201cHe had a tremendous game Saturday. He is getting better and better all the time. He is playing the best we have at linebacker right now. He is making plays. He studies tape and he is having a heck of a year. You can see marked improvement because he spends a lot of time watching tape.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo learn the position, he is getting better and better, and having the opportunity to play all the time is beneficial. He is getting better the more he plays.\u201d\n\nOn Gerell\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/robinson_gerell00.html\"... Robinson:\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s played well this season. It\u2019s the most he\u2019s played so he is getting better all the time. He understands the position and he has made some big plays. He just has to be more consistent and he will as time goes on. He is a big target and we have to use him more.\u201d\n\nJunior quarterback Steven\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/threet_steven00.html\">S... Threet\n\nGeneral thoughts on Stanford:\n\n\u201cThey are obviously a very good team Their record shows that. I just started watching them today. They are very disciplined. They play very hard. It will be a great defense.\u201d\n\nThoughts on yourself this season:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is one word or on sentence to describe, there have been some good games, and some not so good games. We have had some difficult losses, some very close games we have been in. We, right now, just have to keep improving and keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nOn you personally and this season:\n\n\u201cToo much up and down, I would say. There have even been some good first half, bad second half, bad first half, good second half. Just too much up and down. I just need to play more consistent and help the team more.\u201d\n\nOn best game played this season:\n\n\u201cNot sure. I am not sure there is one game to really pinpoint.\u201d\n\nOn the interception for a touchdown:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put the team in that situation, any time you throw a pick six, the chances of winning the game are a lot less. It has to be corrected. I can\u2019t keep making that mistake.\u201d\n\nOn the learning to throw it away prospect:\n\n\u201cYes, there are times that I could throw the ball away, but hindsight is usually 20-20. It\u2019s easier to make the decisions after the fact. Even me looking back on it, I question \u2018hey maybe I should have thrown it away\u2019 but I have to work on that. Maybe even in practice, work on that a little bit more, and just get better in that aspect.\u201d\n\nOn consistency in first half as opposed to second half at USC:\n\n\u201cIt was just getting the ball and making the throws. There were some bad throws in the first half on first and second down, that put us in third and long, and then a couple on third down that we did not convert. Anytime you have that you\u2019re not going to get first downs and the defense is going to be on the field and getting tired and it puts them in a bad place.\u201d\n\nOn the running game:\n\n\u201cThe O-line and backs have been doing a great job, and receivers have been blocking downfield so the running game has been really good. It\u2019s something that we have been working on, and will continue to help the offense.\u201d\n\nOn the decision making process at the line of scrimmage being clear cut or not:\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of gray area. A lot of times you hand the ball off and then you\u2019re like, \u2018man I should have thrown that one\u2019. Then there are times you hand it off and get an eight-yard gain and could have thrown it and only got two yards. There is just a lot of gray area and you have to have a feel for it throughout the game. You have to watch the film and try to get a feel for how they are going to stop it. But until you get out on the field, you never really know what they are going to do.\u201d\n\nOn being one of the more challenging aspects of the position in-game:\n\n\u201cYea, its an aspect of it. I would say sometime the decisions are quick, but its part of the deal to run this offense.\u201d\n\nOn if coaches are still sending in two plays, a run and a pass play to choose from based on defense:\n\n\u201cThere are times when they do, but there are times throughout the week we have been game planning and see certain looks and we check to it, so it\u2019s different almost every week.\u201d\n\nOn being 100 percent health wise:\n\n\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t know if anyone is 100 percent, but I am good to go. Good to play.\u201d\n\nOn the qualities of this team to keep going:\n\n\u201cWe are obviously a competitive bunch, we fight hard every day in practice and continue to improve, and prepare well and get ready to go on Saturday. We battle back from being down this week and were not able to make it happen, but we just have to move on and get ready to go for Stanford.\u201d\n\nOn Gerell Robinson\u2019s play:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a good job, made a couple of plays for us that were in key situations getting the ball in the end zone, and has continued to improve and continue to work hard all year.\u201d\n\nOn bouncing back this week against a top-10 opponent:\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit and think about what could have been this past Saturday or earlier in year. We have a very good team coming in that is going to take all of our effort and all of our preparation.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com.au/college-football/news/story?id=4105440", "page_content": "Quarterback Steven Threet, a redshirt freshman who started eight games for Michigan last season, has decided to transfer to Arizona State.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Threet would sit out the 2009 season and have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nThreet also considered Oregon State but developed a relationship with the Arizona State coaching staff and had an excellent visit over the weekend.\n\nThreet wanted to fit into a pro-style offense after having been previously enrolled at both Georgia Tech and Michigan.

Adrian High School football coach Phil Jacobs was unaware of the decision when reached by phone Monday night.\n\nThreet, a 6-foot-6 pocket passer, will have to sit out the 2009 season because of NCAA?transfer rules. He will have two years of eligibility remaining and can begin playing for the Sun Devils in the 2010 season.\n\nLast fall as a redshirt freshman at Michigan, Threet appeared in 10 games and started eight. He threw for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns while completing 102 of 200 passes for the Wolverines. Threet was fourth on the team with 201 rushing yards and scored a pair of touchdowns on the ground.\n\nThreet began his career at Georgia Tech. After graduating early from Adrian, Threet enrolled at Georgia Tech during the winter semester of 2007 and competed in spring drills with the Yellow Jackets.

He addressed that and much more this week in a wide-ranging Q&A with 247Sports this week on campus, with Sanders and Colorado providing behind-the-scenes access to one of its summer football camps.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.\n\n247Sports: What have you seen so far from your new team?\n\nSanders: \"Want, determination, effort, camaraderie. It is a collection of men \u2014 some wanting a second chance. And some of them are just trying to get to the next level. But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/402490-arizona-state-football-qbs-brock-osweiler-or-steven-threet", "page_content": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThere is a general consensus in Tempe that success for the Sun Devils will ride on the shoulders of their quarterback. But the thing is, there is no clear vision of who will get the starting job after a very close, below-par, competition during the spring game in April.\n\nThe 2009 season did more than just upset fans. Head coach Dennis Erickson had named Danny Sullivan as starting quarterback, feeding the public with high expectations for the senior player. Let's just say that these expectations were far from being met.\n\nSullivan was not all to blame for the Sun Devils' offensive struggles, as the o-line was torn apart due to injuries. Add to the fact that his backups were a true freshman and an injury prone sophomore, Erickson was left with no great options for the starting quarterback position. The Sun Devils just did not have the star QB they wanted, and needed.\n\nNeedless to say, a high emphasis has been placed on the quarterback duel at Arizona State heading into the regular season. The offense, under the direction of newly appointed offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone, is likely to bring a more fast-paced style to the field in order to bring more success to whomever lands the starting gig.\n\nDennis Erickson decided that the decision for starting quarterback will have to wait until fall camp, as the two candidates are too close in competition to decide solely on their spring performances.\n\nSun Devil fans will be waiting anxiously to hear who will be leading the 2010 offense in hopes of bringing a winning season to Tempe, and their first bowl berth since 2007.\n\nLet's take a look at the top two candidates for the starting quarterback position.\n\nSteven Threet\n\nThreet transferred from Michigan following the 2008 season to Arizona State, sitting out the 2009 season per NCAA rules. ASU is Threet's third school, playing for Georgia Tech in 2007.\n\nHe undoubtedly has the most experience, playing in 11 games and starting eight of them for Michigan. After capping off the 2008 season with 1,105 yards for nine touchdowns and seven interceptions, he lead the Wolverines in total offense.\n\nThe 6'5\", 237-pound quarterback looked extremely consistent in spring scrimmages, although a lackluster performance shadowed everything else.\n\nThe fact is, Steven Threet came to ASU for one reason: to be the starting quarterback.\n\nIf the past has shown anything, it is that Dennis Erickson favors experience, and Threet has that. Having starting experience in some of most hostile stadiums in the Big-Ten will likely give Threet the extra push for the position.\n\nBrock Osweiler\n\nThe chant \"We want Brock\" could be heard echoing off the stadium walls during the 2009 season. The highly touted six-foot-eight quarterback from Montana has gained a lot of attention in Tempe.\n\nOsweiler, who played six games as a true freshman backup in 2009, made one career start at Oregon. Being thrown into the starting position in one of the most hostile stadiums in the country, he only completed five of ten passes with one interception and sack before sustaining an injury that sidelined him.\n\nHis time to shine came during a game against the visiting USC Trojans last November. After replacing Danny Sullivan halfway through the game, Osweiler brought an intensity to the field that had not been seen, bringing the Sun Devils back into contention. Completing 11 of 27 passes for 153 yards and the only ASU touchdown in the game, he showed great promise for the future of the program.\n\nBrock's size gives him a slight edge, showing that he can rush and break tackles in last year's USC game.\n\nOverall, Osweiler threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns under very limited playing time."}, {"url": "https://m.espn.com/ncf/story?storyId=6152158", "page_content": "Steven Threet, Arizona State's starting quarterback for most of the 2010 season, says he will not play football anymore.\n\nThreet, who will be a senior in 2011, has suffered four concussions, two of which occurred last season. Threet told The Arizona Republic on Wednesday that he's still experiencing symptoms from the last concussion and still has headaches and has trouble sleeping.\n\nThreet had a concussion Oct. 23 at California and another Nov. 26 against UCLA that ended his junior season.\n\n\"Doctors have told him a fifth concussion could be debilitating,\" a source told ESPN. \"You don't want to be 35 years old and can't hold up a cup of coffee.\"\n\nLast season, Threet completed 62 percent of his passes, throwing for 2,534 yards with 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions for the Sun Devils.

It was his first season of play since transferring from Michigan, where he was the Wolverines' starting quarterback in 2008.\n\nThe 6-5, 240-pound Threet, who is on schedule to graduate in December, will likely remain close to the program and help as a student assistant and work with the QBs, the source said.\n\nArizona State begins spring football in the last week of March.

He currently is a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff. He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach, Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season."}]}
