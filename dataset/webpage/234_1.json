Although some know it as May Day, a celebration of spring in the northern hemisphere, it is better known as International Workers Day. Here at ITDP, May 1 is the day when, exactly 35 years ago, ITDP founder Michael Replogle and a group of antiwar and mobility activists incorporated The Institute for Transportation & Development Policy. ITDP grew out of Bikes Not Bombs, then a humanitarian program to bring bikes to teachers and healthcare workers in Nicaragua, in defiance of the Reagan administration\u2019s bombing campaign. What started with 100 bikes, quickly grew to 10,000, and moved beyond Nicaragua to Haiti and Mozambique. In the following years, ITDP began to think bigger, with efforts to reform the transport policies of both the World Bank and the US government.\n\nIn this moment of global crisis, our city systems are being tested like never before. Amid the uncertainly, one thing is clear: our cities will change. We know this because cities have always been at the forefront of change, and always will be. It was Heraclitus, a resident of the ancient city of Ephesus, circa 500 BC, in what is now Turkey, who famously observed, \u201cThe only thing that is constant is change.\u201d 2500 years later, the sentiment is more relevant than ever. https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ITDP-Principios-FULL_1.mp4\n\nThe last 35 years have seen dramatic, fundamental change in cities around the world. In 1980, these city residents could not have imagined how different their cities would look in 35 years, just as we can\u2019t imagine our cities 35 years from now. In honor of our 35th anniversary, ITDP selected nine world cities, and compared population and transit growth then and now.\n\nSome cities have made incredible progress, providing quality transit options for more of their populations, while others have fallen behind. Some have embraced cycling, walking, and transit, while others are just starting to regulate private cars. What is clear, is that cities are shaped not by random acts of nature, but by the deliberate priorities, policies, and political will of decisive moments. We are in such a moment now. How these cities, and your own, will grow and change in the next 35 years is up to all of us.\n\nTo explore change over time, we took a snapshot of nine key cities 35 years ago and today, and looked at how their populations and transport systems have evolved. For better or worse, the change has been striking. ITDP has had partnerships with each of these cities, some with ITDP offices and decades of technical assistance, and others as best practice study tours and former winners of the Sustainable Transport Award.\n\nOur World\u2019s Cities: 1985 and Today\n\nPopulation Growth in Select Cities between 1985 and Today Click images to enlarge Over the past 35 years, the world\u2019s population has grown by more than 50% while urbanization has gone up over 30%. These trends, growing populations and growing cities, will not abate. In 35 years, our world and our cities have transformed. With so much growth, cities will have to harness tools to create livable cities. Urban population, calculated as urban and surrounding areas and administrative boundaries is shown for 9 select cities on this map. Some cities grew significantly. Dar es Salaam grew by 500% but because its population started below 1 million while other cities had populations in 1985 over 5 millions, it is still the smallest city by population.\n\nTransit Growth in Select Cities between 1985 and Today Click images to enlarge Kilometers of rapid transit have increased worldwide. While this is important growth, more can be done to serve urban residents with sustainable transportation options. The next 35 years need to be dedicated to the the expansion and construction of public transit systems to provide people with desperately needed sustainable mobility options. Kilometers in transit is defined as rapid transit that meets the definition of BRT basics in the BRT Standard. These criteria include, but are not limited to, grade separation, off-board fare purchase, less than 20 minute arrivals in both directions. Other systems like buses may have existed but did not meet the definition of rapid transit and thus were not included. Some cities did not even have rapid transit systems in 1985, which demonstrates their remarkable growth.\n\nRapid Transit to Resident Ratio\n\nOne of the most informative metrics is the Rapid Transit to Resident Ratio (RTR) which compares a city\u2019s urban population with the length of transit corridors on a dedicated right-of-way of rapid transit lines within the city. This includes BRT, buses in dedicated lanes, LRT and Metro that operates on a frequent basis, less than every 20 minutes between 6am and 10pm. What\u2019s interesting about RTR is that because it takes into account the population of a city, it shows a more accurate picture of service. While Guangzhou has more kilometers of rapid transit than London (see above), its population is much greater than that of London and so its RTR remains below that of London. London boasts the highest RTR of over 50, compared to every other city in this group. Dar es Salaam, Guangzhou, Jakarta, and Los Angeles had no kilometers of rapid transit and so had RTRs of zero in 1985. Increase in RTR is important, but there is progress still to be made.\n\nThen and Now: Nine Global Cities\n\nRio de Janeiro, home to 10 million people, has grown its BRT and public transit in recent years. Many projects were conceived to provide movement for attendees for major sporting events, the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics. Unfortunately, those advances made have not been maintained equally, and many services have declined. Read more about Rio de Janeiro\u2019s progress here.\n\nMexico City, home to 20 million people, has rebuilt since its major 1985 earthquake in ways not ideal for sustainable transport. However, recent investments in cycling and bikeshare, as well as more buses and bus routes have helped the city decrease its reliance on cars. Read more about Mexico City here.\n\nLos Angeles had zero kilometres of rapid transit in 1985. Today it remains a city dominated by car culture, and traffic. But political will is changing with increased awareness about climate change and air quality. Will Los Angeles break with decades of urban policy and embrace sustainable transportation? Read more about Los Angeles here.\n\nLondon had 381 kilometers of rapid transit in 1985, more than any other city in this list. Its solid foundation of public transit has allowed the city to enact car reducing policies, like congestion pricing and increase cycling infrastructure. London is an example of how decades of policy can build on one another.

While Jakarta has much to improve, the city is taking seriously the need for sustainable transport. To read more about Jakarta\u2019s progress and past, click here.\n\nGuangzhou, like the rest of China, has had an explosion of rapid transit in the past 35 years. However, automobile sales and infrastructure are on the rise for the growing middle class. Can China return to its place as Bicycle Kingdom? Read more about Guangzhou in 1985 and today here.\n\nDar es Salaam didn\u2019t even have 1 million residents in 1985 and today is home to over 6 million people and is one of the most rapidly growing cities in Africa. Dar es Salaam won the Sustainable Transport Award in 2016 for its BRT, one of the first in the region. Read more about Dar es Salaam here.\n\nIn Chennai the population has increased at about the same rate as its kilometers of rapid transit. While there is public transit available, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure remain weak. Chennai is home to millions of cars and motorcycles and will need more work to provide better mobility options to its residents. Read more about Chennai here.\n\nBuenos Aires experienced one of the most dramatic road transformations when it turned a 20 lane road in the middle of the city into a transit corridor with robust pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. While the city does have well functioning public transit systems, there is still more progress to make to serve its residents. Read more about Buenos Aires transformation here."}, {"url": "https://itdp.academia.edu/MichaelReplogle", "page_content": "This paper reviews typical techniques in use today for estimating the travel behavior effects of ...\n\nmore\n\nThis paper reviews typical techniques in use today for estimating the travel behavior effects of bicycle and pedestrian facilities and programs and other factors that influence use of non-motorized travel modes and offers suggestions for near-term advances in the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice. The principle approaches that have been used to evaluate the effects of transportation policies and infrastructure on bicycle and pedestrian travel include regression analysis, market-share diversion analysis and discrete choice analysis. In practice, inadequacies of both data and modeling frameworks have led to less than satisfactory performance for all of these methods in the American metropolitan planning context. Problems in evaluating the travel behavior effects of factors influencing walking and bicycling are compounded when conventional emission factor models are used to evaluate some of these strategies. In the past several years, some analysts have worked to develop indicators of bicycle Level of Service, bicycle friendliness, bicycle stress level, bicycle suitability of streets and the like. However, little of this work has been integrated with regional travel demand model development. The author suggests that an immediate priority should be for the demonstration of advanced state-of-the-art travel models with substantially greater inclusion of pedestrian/bicycle travel factors, working in one or more regions where data and agency interest can support rapid and efficient progress. He recommends two specific and inter-related areas of work as immediate high priorities for research, development and demonstration funding: Advanced Regional Models Integrating Non-Motorized Modes and Factors; and Quick-Response Models Sensitive to Pedestrian and Bicycle Travel Factors. Elaboration of these models is given."}, {"url": "https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/28380993/mr-michael-replogle-global-policy-director-and-founder-uncrd", "page_content": "Inappropriate\n\nYou have already flagged this document.\n\nThank you, for helping us keep this platform clean.\n\nThe editors will have a look at it as soon as possible."}], "ITDP is a global non-profit organization.": [{"url": "https://www.itdp.org/about/", "page_content": "\u201cAn advanced city is not a place where the poor move about in cars, rather it\u2019s where the rich use public transportation.\u201d\n\nEnrique Pe\u00f1alosa\n\nMayor of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, 1998-2001; 2015-2019\n\nITDP Board President, 2009-2015\n\nBetter Streets.

ITDP was created by sustainable transport advocates in the U.S. to counteract the export to developing countries of costly and environmentally damaging models of dependence on the private automobile. In its first ten years, ITDP successfully advocated for the redirection of lending activity by the World Bank and other multi-lateral institutions away from an exclusive focus on road projects and toward more multi-modal transport solutions.\n\nIn more recent years, we have focused on working with municipalities and non-governmental organizations in developing countries to implement projects that demonstrate how transport emissions, collisions, and road fatalities can be reduced, or how the basic mobility of the poor can be improved. ITDP\u2019s primary programs include the development of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, promoting the use of Transit-oriented Development (TOD), and planning facilities for bicycles and pedestrians. Further programs include traffic demand management (TDM), parking regulations, and the revitalization of city centers. Below is a brief history of ITDP and how our work has developed.\n\n\n\n2016 Global communities take note of successful projects. The Yichang BRT wins the ADB Best Performing Project and the Sustainable Transport Award, Chennai\u2019s NMT Policy and pedestrian projects earn it the international Sustainia Award, and several cities join India\u2019s Smart Cities initiative to invest in sustainable infrastructure for rapidly growing regions.\n\n\n\n2015 ITDP celebrates our 30th year advancing sustainable transport and livable cities. ITDP has worked in over 100 cities in more than 35 countries, improving quality of life for millions. ITDP welcomes new CEO Clayton Lane. In addition, ITDP is instrumental is bringing car-free days to Chennai and Coimbatore, India, and Vision Zero to Mexico City. New ITDP-led BRT systems in Yichang, China and Pune, India receive regional and international acclaim. In two of the most critical, high-level agreements, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Summit, advocacy by ITDP and our partners help cities, transport, and people achieved unprecedented recognition.\n\n\n\n2014 In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Transcarioca is awarded a BRT Standard Gold rating. Two additional gold-standard corridors open in Belo Horizonte. ITDP releases an updated version of the BRT Standard in 2014, refining and improving details on evaluating best practices. Chennai adopts India\u2019s first NMT policy, guaranteeing that 60% of the city\u2019s budget be dedicated to walking and cycling initiatives. Rio de Janeiro saw the delivery of 380 km of cycling and walking infrastructure, and Belo Horizonte made significant progress toward its 100km goal. S\u00e3o Paulo also gained an impressive 400km of pedestrian and cycling. Lanzhou, China launched a new bike share, complementing the city\u2019s recently opened BRT corridor.\n\n2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina, expands its BRT along the world\u2019s widest avenue, 9 de Julio. In Mexico City, Line 5 of the Metrob\u00fas BRT is the first corridor in the country to feature a complete street model, integrating green space, pedestrian and cycling-friendly measures. ITDP releases updated BRT and TOD Standards, as well as a Bike-Share Planning Guide. The BRT and TOD Standards define and refine best practices, and provide metrics for evaluation of specific projects. The Bike-Share Planning Guide tracks the growing bike-share trend and evaluates key aspects for creating successful systems moving forward.\n\n2012 ITDP releases the BRT Standard, the first tool of its kind to clearly define the essential features of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Rio de Janeiro opens its first true BRT corridor, TransOeste, which scores a gold ranking on the BRT Standard. The Lanzhou BRT opens in December, and is Asia\u2019s second-highest capacity BRT system, after Guangzhou. Mexico City\u2019s Metrobus opens its forth corridor this year, notable for its path through the historic center. At the Rio+ 20 Summit, ITDP and our partners are instrumental in winning a commitment from the eight largest multilateral development banks to direct $175 billion to sustainable transport over the next decade.\n\n2011 ITDP launches Our Cities Ourselves, a visioning, exhibition, and design program to help cities plan more sustainable transportation. 2011 sees OCO programs in cities around the world, including New York City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Ahmedabad, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro and Guangzhou. Buenos Aires opens its first line of BRT in May, with 12 km of dedicated lanes. The city also constructs more than 40 kilometers of bike lanes and opens a bike share system. In India, the Ahmedabad BRT grows to 50 kilometers with over 130,000 passengers per day.\n\n2010 In our 25th year, ITDP realizes a major goal in establishing a world class Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in each region where we work. On February 21, Guangzhou, China opens a 22.5km (14-mile) BRT. It is the first BRT to directly connect to a metro system, the first BRT system in China to include bike parking, and has the world\u2019s highest number of passengers, highest bus frequency, and the longest BRT stations. ITDP serves as the lead technical advisor to the city. In non-motorized transit, Mexico City\u2019s Ecobici bike-share system opens as the largest in Latin America, initially attracting 10,000 users and more than 2,000 trips daily.\n\n2009 Ahmedabad\u2019s Janmarg (\u2018The People\u2019s Way\u2019 in Hindi), BRT system opens. ITDP serves as a lead technical advisor to the city in developing the system. It is the first BRT integrated system in India. Rea Vaya BRT opens in Johannesburg, South Africa after a two-year planning and construction process. This innovative BRT connects the township of Soweto to the central business district, becoming the first real public transit system implemented since the end of apartheid. ITDP, together with local authorities, begins working with taxi operators to help transform the industry and launch BRT operating companies.\n\n2008 Amidst global financial concerns, investment in public transportation holds steady. Cities around the world commit to building BRT, bike lanes, and affordable, efficient housing. Plans to add bike lanes on major roads are advanced in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Harbin, Delhi, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bogot\u00e1. Ridership on TransJakarta increases to over 120,00 riders per day, and approximately 97 kilometers (60.3 miles).\n\n2007 ITDP releases the BRT Guide, providing detailed support and guidance on the creation of high quality BRTs. The guide is translated into Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese for international use. TransJakarta opens five new lines, dramatically increasing access and ridership through the city. Ahmedabad begins construction on the eagerly anticipated Janmarg BRT system.\n\n2006 With a renewed focus on city center revitalization, ITDP begins work with Sao Paulo and Mexico city to protect their Historic Centers through pedestrianization and traffic control. ITDP co-sponsors a conference with the National Urban Development Ministry in India, which leads to a new urban transport policy and qualifies BRT projects for government funding. This results in the approval of new BRT systems in Pune, Indore, Jaipur, and Bhopal.\n\n2005 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia win the first ever Sustainable Transport Award, recognizing leadership and vision in sustainable transportation and urban livability. Bogot\u00e1 continues to serve as a model for BRT implementation, bike path integration, and the establishment of public space. As TransJakarta expands, it more than triples its ridership, from an average of 30,000 passengers in its first year to nearly 100,000 by the end of 2005. ITDP research examines the link between transportation and healthcare in rural Africa.\n\n2004 In January, Jakarta, Indonesia unveils Asia\u2019s first Bogot\u00e1-inspired BRT system built outside of Latin America, TransJakarta. ITDP is a key technical advisor on the project. Implemented in an unprecedented 9 months, TransJakarta has new, enclosed stations, pre-paid ticketing, high levels of security, and comfortable, air-conditioned buses, revolutionizing perceptions of bus-based travel in the country.\n\n2003 As ITDP continues to grow and diversify program areas, progress is achieved on multiple issues around the world. BRT work begins in Cape Town; a pilot Traffic Demand Management project is implemented in Sao Paulo; Yogyakarta, Indonesia pedestrianizes the important commercial and cultural street, Malioboro Avenue; thousands of low-cost \u2018California Bikes\u2019 are brought to Senegal, Ghana, and South Africa; and brownfield cleanup and redevelopment continues in the Czech cities of Plzen, Sternberk, Olomouc and Brno.\n\n2002 ITDP grows presence in Asia, working with the cities of Guangzhou, China, and Jakarta, Indonesia, to develop BRT systems and funded in part by a United States Agency for International Development grant. ITDP launches the California Bike Coalition, an initiative to bring a high quality and affordable bicycles to rural households in Africa. In global policy, ITDP has achieved significant progress in our goal to shift the World Bank\u2019s Urban Transport Policy toward giving priority to non-motorized transport and improving public transit.\n\n2001 TransMilenio continues to expand and improve, moving approximately 550,000 people per day in its first year, making it the world\u2019s busiest BRT system. Building off TransMilenio\u2019s success, ITDP sponsors and organizes workshops and presentations on Bus Rapid Transit in over 15 cities, winning support for BRT projects in many and laying the groundwork for future projects. ITDP begins work replicating the success of the cycle rickshaw project in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and implementing pedestrian projects in Guangzhou, China.\n\n2000 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia opens the progressive TransMilenio BRT system, created and developed by then-Mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa and influenced by ITDP papers. It inspires the spread of BRT globally and catalyzes ITDP\u2019s work in promoting and providing technical support for BRT projects. ITDP\u2019s Indian Cycle Rickshaw Modernization Project successfully completes its mission, with more than 8000 modern cycle rickshaws improving lives across India. ITDP provides technical support to several institutions in Central and Eastern Europe to guide growth toward denser, mixed land use developments.\n\n1998 In 1998, ITDP coordinates the second General Assembly in Manila for Sustainable Transport Action Network for Asia and Pacific (SUSTRAN), a network of organizations dedicated to transport policies and investments that foster social equity, ecological sustainability, health, and safety. This conference initiates sustainable transport campaigns in Jakarta, Manila, New Delhi, Penang, and Calcutta. ITDP launches Afribike in South Africa, which helps distribute hundreds of bikes to poor communities and healthcare workers.\n\n1997 ITDP leads efforts to refocus guidelines of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) transport program, opening up millions of dollars for BRT and non-motorized transport projects around the world.\n\n1996 ITDP chairs a transport caucus at UN Habitat II in Istanbul, Turkey in June. Habitat II focus on the dual objectives of adequate shelter for all and sustainable cities. UN Habitat II also marks the first time official dialogue sessions with NGOs, including ITDP, are incorporated into the conference. ITDP Executive Director Walter Hook is the primary dissident to World Bank paper, \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019 which focuses on privatization as solution to poor quality transit and ignores motorization as an issue.\n\n1995 ITDP\u2019s review of a European Investment Bank (EIB) highway in Hungary helps initiate efforts to make EIB more accountable.\n\n1993 The Transportation Alternatives program, which works on multilateral policy reform, is launched. ITDP and allies, including the EPA, Friends of the Earth, and IIEC, convince the US Treasury to call on the World Bank to draft a formal transport policy consistent with environmental and poverty alleviation goals. ITDP establishes the \u2018Laboratwa Esperance\u2019 at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Deschapelles, Haiti. The facility trains local people to assemble, repair, design, and fabricate non-motorized vehicles for use in the hospital and community organizations in the area.\n\n1991 ITDP writes a seminal paper, Non-Motorized Vehicles in Asian Cities, for the World Bank\u2019s Asia Transport Sector Study, identifying strategies to protect and strengthen cycling in modernizing cities.\n\n1990 ITDP helps establish the Campaign for New Transportation Priorities (CNTP). CNTP is a coalition of 37 environmental, labor and citizen groups from across the United States working toward efficiency and environmental priorities in domestic transportation policies. ITDP & CNTP draft four transportation policy papers that play a key role in the creation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), a bill that passes in 1991.\n\n1989 ITDP reaches its goal of sending over 10,000 bicycles to Nicaragua, which are used to finance a new local bicycle assembly industry there. ITDP wins budget language in the U.S. Congress that helps spur U.S. bicycle programs, including convincing the Peace Corps to put its volunteers on bicycles rather than motorcycles.\n\n1986 ITDP releases a seminal paper by Michael Replogle entitled \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019, which laid out the fundamental principles of ITDP. ITDP organizes a new task force on non-motorized transportation in developing countries under the sponsorship of the Transportation Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Organizing annual meetings dedicated to promoting innovation and progress in transportation through research, this new task force soon grows into a full committee with a unique emphasis on integrating the economic, social, and environmental issues of the developing world into transportation planning."}, {"url": "http://www.itdp-china.org/news/?newid=55&lang=1", "page_content": "Asia Pacific Rail, the largest gathering of senior rail leaders in Asia focused on sustainable railway development in the Asian Pacific region, spoke with ITDP China\u2019s Deputy Country Director, Xianyuan Zhu, about transit-oriented development in China.\n\nThe growth of cities around the world has been characterized by unsustainable, car-dependent and transit-poor urban sprawl. To remedy this, transit-oriented development is a fast growing trend and approach that fosters a compact, walkable, mixed-use community centered around a transit station or within transit corridors. One such organization that champions for transit-oriented development is the Institute for Transportation & Development Policy (ITDP).\n\nWhat does ITDP do?\n\nITDP is a global non-profit that provides technical expertise to accelerate the growth of sustainable transport and urban development around the world. ITDP China works with city governments and agencies to provide technical support for the planning, design, and implementation of sustainable urban transportation and development demonstration projects and policies.\n\nWe focus on 5 areas: bus rapid transit (BRT), complete streets & greenways, transit oriented development (TOD), parking & TDM, new mobility and capacity building. ITDP played a lead role in planning, designing and implementing the award-winning Guangzhou BRT.\n\nWhat is the potential of transit-oriented development in China?\n\nBy 2030, China will have more than 200 cities with more than 1 million people. How these cities are planned and built will have major implications for the globe, as well as for their local environments. Cities that are growing may have their future largely decided by the next decade or two.\n\nBecause decisions about urban development have long range consequences \u2014 close to irreversible when it comes to the decision to expand over rural or natural land versus growing vertically, or to lay out a particular pattern of streets and subdivide large properties into plots of particular sizes and shapes\u2013 failing to shift towards TOD performance objectives in short order could result in hundreds of millions of additional urban dwellers locked into unsustainable and inequitable auto-dependent urban sprawl.\n\nAwareness of this situation is rising rapidly at high levels of international and national policy, hence an historic opportunity is opening. For example, in the 13th Five-Year Plan for City Public Transport Outline issued by China Ministry of Transport in July 2016, key issues highlighted included TOD implementation improvements, encouraging shared mobility and implementing congestion pricing as a way of city traffic management.\n\nCanal Park Walkway, Yichang, China Shanzhuang Lu BRT station\n\nWhat are the challenges of implementing transit-oriented development in China?\n\nVision.\n\nIn most of the world, cars and motorcycles remain symbols of achievement, freedom, and status, as much as instruments to rational purposes. Visions of a possible bright future of reduced ownership and use of private individual vehicles are not yet widespread. Many national governments incentivize motor vehicles purchases as a way to boost economic growth. Powerful industries promote the car-centric lifestyle through marketing, advertising, and other ways of shaping cultural and technical values. People who invest large sums in vehicles and structure their way of life around them become dependent and an entrenched opposition to change.\n\nPolicies, regulations and development approval process\n\nThe car-centric vision of development has become embedded in public policies and regulations over the years that make TOD not just difficult, but illegal (e.g. single-use zoning; low density, land coverage and units per plot limits; parking supply, building setbacks, and plot size minima). All levels and scales of policy and regulation are concerned, from local/municipal (e.g. land use zoning, low-intensity development, parking regulations and other elements of building codes) to regional (e.g. regional urban development and transport plans) and national (e.g. road design standards, funding streams, tax incentives, fuel subsidies, and social housing policies).\n\nInstitutions\n\nGovernmental and quasi-governmental institutions of city planning, public works, transportation, housing, and social work are weak and operate in isolated silos. Planning and decision-making are not aligned and fail to make happen compact and well integrated urban development. As large urban areas have spilled over municipal boundaries, jurisdictional fragmentation compounds with social and political differences, hampering the planning and management of an efficient common transport and land-use system.\n\nInvestment and Financing\n\nComplete TOD often entails high up-front costs for services and amenities with long-term social and environmental benefits but requiring advanced planning and implementation processes: new or improved transit service, quality district infrastructure of streets and paths, utilities, and local services requiring incentives or subsidies. Furthermore, low and moderate income housing units at price below market amount to forgone revenues that may require substitutions to balance the budget of TOD construction projects.\n\nXianyuan Zhu will be speaking more about TOD best practices and ITDP China assisted BRT projects at Asia Pacific Rail 2017 .

The goal of this group was and continues to be, to highlight best practices and showcase real-life examples of transportation projects in cities addressing climate change, equity, and resilience. Thus, the Sustainable Transport Award was born, along with its Committee and a process that continues to identify cities that are leading the field in sustainable urban development practices, prioritizing quality of life and the environment in their transport policy. The first winning city was Bogot\u00e1, thanks to their BRT system and urban cycling strategy.\n\nNow, seventeen years since the STA\u2019s founding, Bogot\u00e1 has won the Award once again, thanks to their swift adaptation to the unique mobility demands posed by the pandemic. In this way, Bogot\u00e1 has been a true model for vigilance, resilience, and responsiveness in the face of great change.\n\nWhat won Bogot\u00e1 the 2022 Sustainable Transport Award? Soon after the COVID-19 pandemic began, Bogot\u00e1 became one of the first cities in the world to create emergency bike lanes. 84 km were built, with 28 km becoming permanent and 46 km still in use today. On some of the city\u2019s main roads, bike use quadrupled as a result of the newly implemented cycling lanes. The COVID-19 changes were cemented with official policies, such as Acuerdo 804, which established biking as the priority means of transport in the city in future planning efforts. These policies built on previous goals formalized in the City\u2019s 2020-24 Strategic Plan, which included growing the number of cycle trips by 50% by 2024. The City also reconfigured street space to allow for better social distancing and pedestrianized streets that once only served cars. Over the course of one project, 17,000 square miles of street space were repurposed for pedestrian use.\n\nTo improve public and environmental health, the City of Bogot\u00e1 has assembled a fleet of 1,485 electric buses for its public transportation system\u2014placing the city among the three largest e-bus fleets outside of China. 350 buses have been deployed so far, and the switch will benefit low-income residents the most, whose neighborhoods have the most bus lines and highest air pollution levels in the city. Additionally, Bogot\u00e1 has begun a new program that provides exemptions to high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), those with more than 2 passengers, from the city\u2019s odd-even license restriction program. This program prevents half of the city\u2019s cars from driving in peak times, but by allowing HOV exemptions, the city aims to encourage carpooling and expects to reduce car travel by 2 million kilometers weekly. The City also improved road safety with traffic calming measures and speed management programs. The speed reduction on major roads brought a 21% decrease in traffic deaths in 2019 compared to the 2015-2018 average, and a 28% decrease in 2020. Bogot\u00e1 further focused safety efforts on some of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents: its schoolchildren. The City found that 58% of student trips are taken on foot, mostly by low-income children. At the same time, pedestrians younger than 15 years old were twice as likely to die in a traffic incident than adults. In response, Bogot\u00e1 began a Kids First program that targets students who commute on foot and those who commute via different transportation modes. Among other initiatives, Kids First created caravans for young commuters by foot and by bike, led by adult guides. Since it began, the program has helped more than 6,000 students get to class safely."}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.org/2021/11/08/itdp-launches-cycling-cities-campaign-at-cop26/", "page_content": "Share this\n\nITDP Launches Cycling Cities Campaign at COP26\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) officially launches its global Cycling Cities Campaign while at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, a Cohort City of the Campaign.\n\nThe Cycling Cities Campaign aims to provide governments, planners, advocates, and others the tools to make cycling a safe and affordable transportation option in cities worldwide. Composed of a global coalition of cities, civil society organizations, and private sector partners, ITDP\u2019s Cycling Cities Campaign calls for 25 million more people near safe cycle lanes by 2025.\n\nThe climate crisis cannot be solved without significantly reducing emissions from the transportation sector. World leaders in Glasgow, deliberating on various strategies to limit global warming, must prioritize sustainable transportation, and cycling in particular, as a serious emissions-reduction solution. Today, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is officially launching the Cycling Cities Campaign at the UNFCCC COP26 Conference in Glasgow. The event will highlight cities, like Glasgow, a member of the Cycling Cities Cohort, along with Merida, Mexico City, Jakarta, and Rio de Janeiro and 20 other cities that are on the vanguard of rethinking their streets to promote cycling and combat climate change.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, cycling re-emerged as a popular form of resilient transportation. Without the usual loud and dangerous car traffic, street space was reclaimed by people. The boom in cycling, which has continued to grow, reflects a very real appetite for safe, convenient alternatives to cars that has gone underserved for far too long. Every city that added cycle lanes\u2014even temporary ones\u2014during the pandemic saw more people cycling.\n\nResponding to this momentum and growing public and political support for cycling, ITDP is launching the global Cycling Cities Campaign. Cycling is one of the original zero emission forms of transport, contributing to better air quality and improved physical and mental health. Now is the time to take action to bring about these and other benefits for the climate and for people around the world.\n\nThe Cycling Cities campaign is dedicated to making cycling a viable transportation option for everyday trips in cities by providing an equitable and climate-friendly alternative to private vehicles. Safe, connected cycle lanes are critical to this vision, as are policies and educational campaigns that shift the perception of cycling. The campaign aims to bring safe cycle lanes to 25 million more people by 2025, and engage with at least 250 cities to improve infrastructure, prioritize funding, and build awareness to grow cycling.\n\nThroughout the past few months, ITDP has brought together a diverse coalition of 25 cities and more than 30 global and regional partners committed to elevating cycling at the city, national, and global levels. Cycling Cities include: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Bengaluru, India; Bogota, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cairo, Egypt; Fortaleza, Brazil; Glasgow, Scotland; Guadalajara, Mexico; Istanbul, Turkey; Jakarta, Indonesia; Kampala, Uganda; Kigali, Rwanda; Kisumu, Kenya; Kohima, India; Los Angeles, United States; Merida, Mexico; Mexico City, Mexico; New Town Kolkata, India; Pimpri Chinchwad, India; Rajkot, India; Recife, Brazil; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and Zapopan, Mexico.\n\nCouncilor Anna Richardson, Glasgow City Council Convener for Sustainability and Carbon Reduction mentioned, \u201cGlasgow is delighted to be one of the founding 25 cohort Cycling Cities. The vision of our city is that walking, wheeling and cycling will be the first and natural choice for everyday journeys for people of all ages and ability. In aiming for significant modal shift, we recognize the contribution that active travel can make toward the city achieving its goal of net zero carbon by 2030, as well as contributing to the wider outcomes for the city around health and wellbeing, inclusion and equality, and wealth and inclusive growth. Increasing cycling will absolutely reduce pollution and improve our air quality and will better support our city\u2019s contribution to a more sustainable planet.\u201d\n\nWith campaign cities at different stages in their cycling journeys, knowledge exchange and ideas sharing is a major element of this effort. Capacity-building, coordinated actions, and open data tracking supplement knowledge sharing to ensure Cycling Cities are successful in redesigning streets for people, not cars. ITDP CEO Heather Thompson mentioned, \u201cBuilding and transforming cities for people, not cars, has been a central pillar of ITDP\u2019s mission for more than 35 years. With our Cycling Cities Campaign, we are helping cities reach climate goals and provide their residents with an active, safe, and necessary alternative to driving. This campaign has been years in the making and I believe that the time to act is now.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.org/for-the-press/", "page_content": "Press Information\n\nITDP has eight offices on five continents, and has worked in more than 100 cities in 30 countries. We have expertise on a number of key issues in transport and urban development, including:\n\nTransport & Climate Change\n\nThe transport sector is one of the largest, and the fastest-growing source of CO2, and the largest source of black carbon, which is particularly damaging to respiratory health. Tackling climate change must include a fundamental rethinking of our priorities of public space and the movement of people in cities.\n\nInnovations in Technology & Transport\n\nTechnologies provide exciting new options for shaping the way we move around cities, but how we employ these tools can be advantageous or disastrous for our cities. With the right focus on expanding the reach of transport and reducing car ownership, we can improve access to our cities for billions.\n\nRoad Pricing\n\nFair pricing for road use based on demand and access is an essential tool for transport equity in our cities. Tolls, congestion pricing, and parking reform are all ways in which cities and regions can reduce traffic congestion and raise much-needed funds for improving transport.\n\nSustainable Urban Development for Road Safety\n\nITDP works to place greater emphasis on urban design for people and non-motorized transport. ITDP can speak to proper bike lane design, the needs of pedestrians, and the important of assuring safe and equitable transport for all.\n\nGender & Equity\n\nITDP works in cities around the world to increase access to urban spaces and transport for vulnerable populations, including women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and the urban poor.\n\nBikeshare, Dockless Bikeshare, and Scootershare\n\nUsing data from systems around the world, ITDP has evaluated what makes a successful system and can speak to bikeshare planning and design, business and financial models, and global trends.\n\nInternational Transport Policy\n\nITDP is an active participant in international discussions on climate and transport policy (e.g. GEF, Rio +20) and can speak to trends in the field and the importance of including sustainable transport in the global conversation."}, {"url": "https://www.iisd.org/articles/deep-dive/road-sustainable-transport", "page_content": "Transport is at the center of many economic and social development challenges, accounting for about 64% of global oil consumption, 27% of all energy use, and 23% of the world\u2019s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Rethinking and revamping transit in the post-COVID era by implementing structural changes would go a long way toward reinforcing some of the positive impacts on emission levels and air quality created by efforts to curb the pandemic.\n\nDeveloping a sustainable transport network to serve a city of 10 million people and a greater metropolitan area of more than 30 million might seem insurmountable. But the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, has undertaken this daunting task. In October 2020, it became the first Southeast Asian city to win the Sustainable Transport Award for its integrated public transportation system. Transjakarta, the city\u2019s bus rapid transit (BRT) system, reached a milestone of serving one million passengers per day in February 2020 (ITDP, 2020). Opened in 2004, Transjakarta is the longest BRT system in the world, spanning more than 250 km (155 miles), with dedicated bus lanes that carry passengers around the city (ICCT, 2020). It also connects to smaller vehicles, including local buses and informal microbuses, allowing the system to serve a larger region and more residential areas that are inaccessible by BRT alone.\n\nBRT systems provide metro-level services through dedicated lanes, with busways and stations typically aligned to the center of the road, off-board fare collection, and fast and frequent operations (ITDP, 2020). They are more reliable, convenient, and faster than regular bus services, and avoid traffic congestion and long lines to pay fares. But sustainable transport encompasses much more.\n\nTransport is a crucial driver of economic and social development. Transport infrastructure connects people to jobs, education, health care, and each other. Transport enables global trade. Rural roads, for example, can help prevent maternal deaths through timely access to medical care, boost girls\u2019 enrollment in school, and increase and diversify farmers\u2019 income by connecting them to markets (World Bank, 2019).\n\nAt the same time, transportation produces emissions that contribute to air pollution and climate change. Its infrastructure has serious impacts on ecosystems. Transport accounts for about 64% of global oil consumption, 27% of all energy use, and 23% of the world\u2019s energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Each year, almost 185,000 deaths can be directly attributed to vehicular pollution. More than 1.25 million people are killed and up to 50 million are injured on the world\u2019s roads every year (World Bank, 2019).\n\nTransport is at the center of many economic and social development challenges, but, as the Jakarta example illustrates, it can be more sustainable.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport defines sustainable transport as \u201cthe provision of services and infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods\u2014advancing economic and social development to benefit today\u2019s and future generations\u2014in a manner that is safe, affordable, accessible, efficient, and resilient, while minimizing carbon and other emissions and environmental impacts\u201d (HLAG-ST, 2016, p.10). Sustainable transport includes public transportation, such as electric buses and trains and BRT systems that can carry people far more efficiently than cars. Notably, while electric cars pollute less and reduce individual carbon footprints, they do not reduce congestion. They still \u201crequire roads and parking spaces, are susceptible to crashes, and contribute to a dispersed and unhealthy landscape\u201d (Blue, 2013). Other modes, such as cycling and walking, have the additional advantage of improving well-being through physical activity."}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.org/2015/05/26/the-role-of-transport-in-the-sustainable-development-goals/", "page_content": "The Role of Transport in the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nIn 2000, the United Nations established the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), putting forth a vision of how to solve the world biggest issues. In 2015, the MDGs are set to expire, and the global community is working hard to develop the next 15-year agreement to guide economic growth, ensure an environmentally sustainable development and end poverty. Negotiations are ongoing, as representatives from countries around the world and civil society develop a common set of goals with targets and indicators. ITDP has been part of this process since the beginning. The work will culminate in September, when the UN General Assembly convenes to approve the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and set a new global framework.\n\nThus far, the vision put forth by the Sustainable Development Goals is ambitious. Perhaps exceedingly so. But it is also the right understanding of the issues and scale required to make progress on the world\u2019s most pressing needs. The vision has been developed in one of the broadest consultative processes ever conducted by the UN. Because of this, there is hope that the high level agreement will have broad power, influencing lending patterns at development banks and guiding nations to consider how to achieve their goals. They will also help hold the global community accountable by setting indicators to measure how well countries are meeting these goals.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the new Goals?\n\nTransport Targets:\n\nSeven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals include one or more targets that addresses transport, both rural and urban. While some name transport directly, many of the targets incorporate transport by recognizing the importance of access in achieving advances in education, healthcare, and other critical needs. The most relevant targets for transport are:\n\nGoal 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\n\nGoal 2 Targets\n\n2.3. By 2030 double the agricultural productivity and the incomes from small scale food producers, particularly of women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment By 2030 double the agricultural productivity and the incomes from small scale food producers, particularly of women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment 2.a. Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development, and plant and livestock gene banks to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular in least developed countries\n\nGoal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\n\nGoal 3 Targets\n\n3.6. By 2030 halve global deaths from road traffic accidents By 2030 halve global deaths from road traffic accidents 3.9. By 2030 substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination\n\nGoal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\n\nGoal 7 Targets\n\n7.3. Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 7.a. By 2030 enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technologies, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technologies\n\nGoal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nGoal 9 Targets\n\n9.1. Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all 9.4. By 2030 upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities 9.a. Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS\n\nGoal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\n\nGoal 11 Targets\n\n11.2. By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons 11.6. By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality, municipal and other waste management 11.7. By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities 11.a. Support economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas into by strengthening national and regional development planning\n\nGoal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n\nGoal 12 Targets\n\n12.c. Rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities\n\nGoal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\n\nGoal 13 Targets\n\n13.2. Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning\n\nEncouragingly, in the framework for the Sustainable Development Goals, both cities and transport take prominent roles. This is a historic step, as transport had not been recognized in the previous MDGs. Of the seventeen goals recommended by the Open Working Group to the UN General Assembly, seven of them include specific targets that incorporate transport (including both rural and urban infrastructure. See sidebar for details). This elevation of transport recognizes it as a key tool in reducing emissions, improving equity, and reducing poverty. Another historic first is the inclusion of a goal on cities, recognizing the increasingly valuable part cities are playing in global development.\n\nWomen in Kampala, Uganda walk along the road. The SDGs should create safer environments for pedestrians. Credit: Carlos Pardo\n\nThese transport targets, and the indicators proposed to measure them, address the right issues and set reasonable paths for improvements. (An upcoming blog post will explore specific indicators in more detail). They reward cities with good public transit, encourage strong transit-oriented development, and push for expanded social equity around transportation. These accomplishments are a significant victory for the transport and urban planning community.\n\nNonetheless, the SDGs have some room for improvement. Where the goals fall short is the lack of inclusion of cycling and walking- key parts of the sustainable transport mix. Both are low to no impact on the environment, and have far reaching benefits. Walking is the form most often used by lower income people, including women and children who often lack access to a vehicle or money.\n\nLuckily, this omission can still be fixed. Adding language to target 11.2 about cycling and walking would ensure that these modes would be considered. One such option is the language proposed by Dario Hidalgo of EMBARQ. An indicator on road safety has already been proposed, and could also be used as a proxy to track investment in walking and cycling, as new investments have a direct influence on pedestrian and cyclist safety. To do this, data must be collected at the city level, not just at the state or national level.\n\nMoving forward, while fine-tuning on several indicators is advisable, the sustainable development goals are a major step forward in integrating transport with other global goals. By setting the stage with ambitious vision, the United Nations will allow world actors to pursue these ideals in a context with clearly articulated aims and institutional support for measuring and achieving improvements in these areas."}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.org/who-we-are/history-of-itdp/", "page_content": "Founded in 1985, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) has become a leading organization in the promotion of environmentally sustainable and equitable transportation policies and projects worldwide. ITDP was created by sustainable transport advocates in the U.S. to counteract the export to developing countries of costly and environmentally damaging models of dependence on the private automobile. In its first ten years, ITDP successfully advocated for the redirection of lending activity by the World Bank and other multi-lateral institutions away from an exclusive focus on road projects and toward more multi-modal transport solutions.\n\nIn more recent years, we have focused on working with municipalities and non-governmental organizations in developing countries to implement projects that demonstrate how transport emissions, collisions, and road fatalities can be reduced, or how the basic mobility of the poor can be improved. ITDP\u2019s primary programs include the development of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, promoting the use of Transit-oriented Development (TOD), and planning facilities for bicycles and pedestrians. Further programs include traffic demand management (TDM), parking regulations, and the revitalization of city centers. Below is a brief history of ITDP and how our work has developed.\n\n\n\n2016 Global communities take note of successful projects. The Yichang BRT wins the ADB Best Performing Project and the Sustainable Transport Award, Chennai\u2019s NMT Policy and pedestrian projects earn it the international Sustainia Award, and several cities join India\u2019s Smart Cities initiative to invest in sustainable infrastructure for rapidly growing regions.\n\n\n\n2015 ITDP celebrates our 30th year advancing sustainable transport and livable cities. ITDP has worked in over 100 cities in more than 35 countries, improving quality of life for millions. ITDP welcomes new CEO Clayton Lane. In addition, ITDP is instrumental is bringing car-free days to Chennai and Coimbatore, India, and Vision Zero to Mexico City. New ITDP-led BRT systems in Yichang, China and Pune, India receive regional and international acclaim. In two of the most critical, high-level agreements, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Summit, advocacy by ITDP and our partners help cities, transport, and people achieved unprecedented recognition.\n\n\n\n2014 In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Transcarioca is awarded a BRT Standard Gold rating. Two additional gold-standard corridors open in Belo Horizonte. ITDP releases an updated version of the BRT Standard in 2014, refining and improving details on evaluating best practices. Chennai adopts India\u2019s first NMT policy, guaranteeing that 60% of the city\u2019s budget be dedicated to walking and cycling initiatives. Rio de Janeiro saw the delivery of 380 km of cycling and walking infrastructure, and Belo Horizonte made significant progress toward its 100km goal. S\u00e3o Paulo also gained an impressive 400km of pedestrian and cycling. Lanzhou, China launched a new bike share, complementing the city\u2019s recently opened BRT corridor.\n\n2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina, expands its BRT along the world\u2019s widest avenue, 9 de Julio. In Mexico City, Line 5 of the Metrob\u00fas BRT is the first corridor in the country to feature a complete street model, integrating green space, pedestrian and cycling-friendly measures. ITDP releases updated BRT and TOD Standards, as well as a Bike-Share Planning Guide. The BRT and TOD Standards define and refine best practices, and provide metrics for evaluation of specific projects. The Bike-Share Planning Guide tracks the growing bike-share trend and evaluates key aspects for creating successful systems moving forward.\n\n2012 ITDP releases the BRT Standard, the first tool of its kind to clearly define the essential features of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Rio de Janeiro opens its first true BRT corridor, TransOeste, which scores a gold ranking on the BRT Standard. The Lanzhou BRT opens in December, and is Asia\u2019s second-highest capacity BRT system, after Guangzhou. Mexico City\u2019s Metrobus opens its forth corridor this year, notable for its path through the historic center. At the Rio+ 20 Summit, ITDP and our partners are instrumental in winning a commitment from the eight largest multilateral development banks to direct $175 billion to sustainable transport over the next decade.\n\n2011 ITDP launches Our Cities Ourselves, a visioning, exhibition, and design program to help cities plan more sustainable transportation. 2011 sees OCO programs in cities around the world, including New York City, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Ahmedabad, Johannesburg, Rio de Janeiro and Guangzhou. Buenos Aires opens its first line of BRT in May, with 12 km of dedicated lanes. The city also constructs more than 40 kilometers of bike lanes and opens a bike share system. In India, the Ahmedabad BRT grows to 50 kilometers with over 130,000 passengers per day.\n\n2010 In our 25th year, ITDP realizes a major goal in establishing a world class Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in each region where we work. On February 21, Guangzhou, China opens a 22.5km (14-mile) BRT. It is the first BRT to directly connect to a metro system, the first BRT system in China to include bike parking, and has the world\u2019s highest number of passengers, highest bus frequency, and the longest BRT stations. ITDP serves as the lead technical advisor to the city. In non-motorized transit, Mexico City\u2019s Ecobici bike-share system opens as the largest in Latin America, initially attracting 10,000 users and more than 2,000 trips daily.\n\n2009 Ahmedabad\u2019s Janmarg (\u2018The People\u2019s Way\u2019 in Hindi), BRT system opens. ITDP serves as a lead technical advisor to the city in developing the system. It is the first BRT integrated system in India. Rea Vaya BRT opens in Johannesburg, South Africa after a two-year planning and construction process. This innovative BRT connects the township of Soweto to the central business district, becoming the first real public transit system implemented since the end of apartheid. ITDP, together with local authorities, begins working with taxi operators to help transform the industry and launch BRT operating companies.\n\n2008 Amidst global financial concerns, investment in public transportation holds steady. Cities around the world commit to building BRT, bike lanes, and affordable, efficient housing. Plans to add bike lanes on major roads are advanced in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Harbin, Delhi, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bogot\u00e1. Ridership on TransJakarta increases to over 120,00 riders per day, and approximately 97 kilometers (60.3 miles).\n\n2007 ITDP releases the BRT Guide, providing detailed support and guidance on the creation of high quality BRTs. The guide is translated into Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese for international use. TransJakarta opens five new lines, dramatically increasing access and ridership through the city. Ahmedabad begins construction on the eagerly anticipated Janmarg BRT system.\n\n2006 With a renewed focus on city center revitalization, ITDP begins work with Sao Paulo and Mexico city to protect their Historic Centers through pedestrianization and traffic control. ITDP co-sponsors a conference with the National Urban Development Ministry in India, which leads to a new urban transport policy and qualifies BRT projects for government funding. This results in the approval of new BRT systems in Pune, Indore, Jaipur, and Bhopal.\n\n2005 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia win the first ever Sustainable Transport Award, recognizing leadership and vision in sustainable transportation and urban livability. Bogot\u00e1 continues to serve as a model for BRT implementation, bike path integration, and the establishment of public space. As TransJakarta expands, it more than triples its ridership, from an average of 30,000 passengers in its first year to nearly 100,000 by the end of 2005. ITDP research examines the link between transportation and healthcare in rural Africa.\n\n2004 In January, Jakarta, Indonesia unveils Asia\u2019s first Bogot\u00e1-inspired BRT system built outside of Latin America, TransJakarta. ITDP is a key technical advisor on the project. Implemented in an unprecedented 9 months, TransJakarta has new, enclosed stations, pre-paid ticketing, high levels of security, and comfortable, air-conditioned buses, revolutionizing perceptions of bus-based travel in the country.\n\n2003 As ITDP continues to grow and diversify program areas, progress is achieved on multiple issues around the world. BRT work begins in Cape Town; a pilot Traffic Demand Management project is implemented in Sao Paulo; Yogyakarta, Indonesia pedestrianizes the important commercial and cultural street, Malioboro Avenue; thousands of low-cost \u2018California Bikes\u2019 are brought to Senegal, Ghana, and South Africa; and brownfield cleanup and redevelopment continues in the Czech cities of Plzen, Sternberk, Olomouc and Brno.\n\n2002 ITDP grows presence in Asia, working with the cities of Guangzhou, China, and Jakarta, Indonesia, to develop BRT systems and funded in part by a United States Agency for International Development grant. ITDP launches the California Bike Coalition, an initiative to bring a high quality and affordable bicycles to rural households in Africa. In global policy, ITDP has achieved significant progress in our goal to shift the World Bank\u2019s Urban Transport Policy toward giving priority to non-motorized transport and improving public transit.\n\n2001 TransMilenio continues to expand and improve, moving approximately 550,000 people per day in its first year, making it the world\u2019s busiest BRT system. Building off TransMilenio\u2019s success, ITDP sponsors and organizes workshops and presentations on Bus Rapid Transit in over 15 cities, winning support for BRT projects in many and laying the groundwork for future projects. ITDP begins work replicating the success of the cycle rickshaw project in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and implementing pedestrian projects in Guangzhou, China.\n\n2000 Bogot\u00e1, Colombia opens the progressive TransMilenio BRT system, created and developed by then-Mayor Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa and influenced by ITDP papers. It inspires the spread of BRT globally and catalyzes ITDP\u2019s work in promoting and providing technical support for BRT projects. ITDP\u2019s Indian Cycle Rickshaw Modernization Project successfully completes its mission, with more than 8000 modern cycle rickshaws improving lives across India. ITDP provides technical support to several institutions in Central and Eastern Europe to guide growth toward denser, mixed land use developments.\n\n1998 In 1998, ITDP coordinates the second General Assembly in Manila for Sustainable Transport Action Network for Asia and Pacific (SUSTRAN), a network of organizations dedicated to transport policies and investments that foster social equity, ecological sustainability, health, and safety. This conference initiates sustainable transport campaigns in Jakarta, Manila, New Delhi, Penang, and Calcutta. ITDP launches Afribike in South Africa, which helps distribute hundreds of bikes to poor communities and healthcare workers.\n\n1997 ITDP leads efforts to refocus guidelines of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) transport program, opening up millions of dollars for BRT and non-motorized transport projects around the world.\n\n1996 ITDP chairs a transport caucus at UN Habitat II in Istanbul, Turkey in June. Habitat II focus on the dual objectives of adequate shelter for all and sustainable cities. UN Habitat II also marks the first time official dialogue sessions with NGOs, including ITDP, are incorporated into the conference. ITDP Executive Director Walter Hook is the primary dissident to World Bank paper, \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019 which focuses on privatization as solution to poor quality transit and ignores motorization as an issue.\n\n1995 ITDP\u2019s review of a European Investment Bank (EIB) highway in Hungary helps initiate efforts to make EIB more accountable.\n\n1993 The Transportation Alternatives program, which works on multilateral policy reform, is launched. ITDP and allies, including the EPA, Friends of the Earth, and IIEC, convince the US Treasury to call on the World Bank to draft a formal transport policy consistent with environmental and poverty alleviation goals. ITDP establishes the \u2018Laboratwa Esperance\u2019 at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Deschapelles, Haiti. The facility trains local people to assemble, repair, design, and fabricate non-motorized vehicles for use in the hospital and community organizations in the area.\n\n1991 ITDP writes a seminal paper, Non-Motorized Vehicles in Asian Cities, for the World Bank\u2019s Asia Transport Sector Study, identifying strategies to protect and strengthen cycling in modernizing cities.\n\n1990 ITDP helps establish the Campaign for New Transportation Priorities (CNTP). CNTP is a coalition of 37 environmental, labor and citizen groups from across the United States working toward efficiency and environmental priorities in domestic transportation policies. ITDP & CNTP draft four transportation policy papers that play a key role in the creation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), a bill that passes in 1991.\n\n1989 ITDP reaches its goal of sending over 10,000 bicycles to Nicaragua, which are used to finance a new local bicycle assembly industry there. ITDP wins budget language in the U.S. Congress that helps spur U.S. bicycle programs, including convincing the Peace Corps to put its volunteers on bicycles rather than motorcycles.\n\n1986 ITDP releases a seminal paper by Michael Replogle entitled \u2018Sustainable Transport\u2019, which laid out the fundamental principles of ITDP. ITDP organizes a new task force on non-motorized transportation in developing countries under the sponsorship of the Transportation Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Organizing annual meetings dedicated to promoting innovation and progress in transportation through research, this new task force soon grows into a full committee with a unique emphasis on integrating the economic, social, and environmental issues of the developing world into transportation planning."}, {"url": "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/five-transit-policies-cities-should-prioritize-to-become-more-sustainable/", "page_content": "Create a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\n\nLicense and Republishing\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum."}, {"url": "https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/31/jakarta-wins-global-2021-sustainable-transport-award-for-integrated-public-transportation.html", "page_content": "Share this article Whatsapp\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedin Alya Nurbaiti (The Jakarta Post) Jakarta \u25cf Sat, October 31, 2020 14:11 951 e22cd4161040e111d73a5626c4db8b80 1 City ITDP,anies-baswedan,Jakarta-administration,Jakarta-transportation,Jakarta-traffic,Transportation,jak-lingko,integrated-transportation-system,Sustainable-City,Sustainable-Transport-Award Free\n\nIndonesia\u2019s capital city Jakarta has come out as the winner of the global 2021 Sustainable Transport Award (STA) for its ambitious integrated public transportation programs. Indonesia is the first-ever Southeast Asian country to have received the prestigious award.\n\nEvery year, global nonprofit Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and the STA committee acknowledge a city that has implemented strategies to improve citizens' mobility, reduce air pollution and improve safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nJakarta was awarded an \u201chonorable mention\u201d for the 2019 STA last year for its efforts to develop the city-owned Transjakarta bus network.\n\nFor the award, Jakarta competed with other cities, including Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Bogota, Colombia; Auckland, New Zealand; Braga, Portugal; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Frankfurt, Germany; and Sao Paolo, Brazil.\n\nThe winner announcement was made during the Mobilize 2020 international sustainable transportation conference held virtually from Monday to Friday.\n\nThe city will be honored at a ceremony in Washington, DC, in January 2021.\n\nJakarta Governor Anies Baswedan announced the award in a tweet on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe present the award to all Jakartans. We are grateful for the global acknowledgement,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAlhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah!!\n\n\n\nTERBAIK DUNIA!!!\n\n\n\nYa, Jakarta terpilih sebagai KOTA TERBAIK DI DUNIA dalam SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT AWARD 2021.\n\n\n\nPada warga Jakarta, penghargaan ini dipersembahkan. Kita bersyukur dan bersyukur, atas pengakuan dunia ini, selamat untuk warga Jakarta! https://t.co/O5WEoSoQrc pic.twitter.com/dtui0Ekm9K \u2014 Anies Baswedan (@aniesbaswedan) October 31, 2020\n\nITDP Indonesia said in a statement on Saturday that the award was the result of an integrated system that included the city\u2019s angkot (public minivans) and the Transjakarta extensive network, as well as the launch of the MRT Jakarta and LRT Jakarta last year, all of which had helped in transforming the city\u2019s overall transportation system.\n\nRead also: Experts call for better public transportation integration in Greater Jakarta to lure more users\n\nLast year, Jakarta turned the Kendal tunnel beside Sudirman Station in Central Jakarta into one of the city\u2019s major transit point for six modes of public transportation: the MRT, the Commuter Line, the Railink airport train, Transjakarta bus services and the future LRT Jakarta and LRT Jabodebek.\n\nThe integration strategy was deemed successful under the city\u2019s flagship Jak Lingko payment scheme in which passengers can ride various modes of public transportation for one flat fare. The Transjakarta electric bus operational plan and the renovation of city-owned public transportation stations directly linked to Commuter Line railway stations also contributed to the success.\n\nMoreover, Jakarta has made massive changes to its pedestrian facilities in the past two years, building a 63-kilometer bicycle lane in 2019 and introducing a plan to add 500 km of bike lanes.\n\nAnies issued an instruction through Gubernatorial Regulation No. 51/2020 to establish pop-up bike lanes and prioritize pedestrians and cyclists during the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) imposed in the city as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSoutheast Asia ITDP director Faela Sufa said the STA celebrated cities that, despite their limitations, worked toward creating fair, affordable and inclusive transportation for all.\n\n\"Hopefully, this award can trigger Jakarta to continue making breakthroughs in implementing transportation policy that is environmentally friendly,\" Faela said in the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, ITDP CEO Heather Thompson said that the recent health crisis had prompted city leaders to rethink sustainable solutions for cities.\n\n\"We are very excited to celebrate Jakarta's victory next year. We hope this victory can inspire other cities in Indonesia and around the world,\" she said."}, {"url": "https://www.itdp.in/sustainable-transportation-solutions-for-the-future/", "page_content": "India is urbanising at an unprecedented rate. A third of the country\u2019s population\u2014an estimated 380 million people\u2014now lives in its cities. As they cope with this growth, cities are realising that traditional solutions like wider roads and flyovers will not provide a lasting solution to their transport problems. Instead, smart cities the world over are turning toward mass rapid transit systems to provide high quality, efficient mobility. These efforts are the focus of the latest episode of NDTV\u2019s special feature, \u201cSocial Innovations for the Future.\u201d The programme explores ways that India\u2019s best practice mass rapid transit solutions\u2014Ahmedabad\u2019s Janmarg BRT system and the Delhi metro\u2014are helping to tackle congestion, reduce pollution, and improve safety.\n\n\u201cThe best cities of the world typically have over 40 per cent of all trips by public transport\u201d observes Shreya Gadepalli, Regional Director with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) in the interview, calling for greater investment in public transport to ensure efficient, dependable, and accessible-to-all service. ITDP estimates that a smart city needs 30-35 km of rapid transit, 200-500 city buses and 80 km of walking and cycling infrastructure for every million urban residents. These infrastructure improvements should be paired with demand management practices, especially parking management, to control the use of personal motor vehicles. As India strives to create smart cities, budget allocations must give priority to walking, cycling, and public transport over personal motor vehicles.\n\nThis special feature also includes thoughts of Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, Union Minister of Urban Development, Government of India; Mr. Jagan Shah, Director of the National Institute of Urban Affairs; and Mr. O. P. Agarwal, Director General of the Institute of Urban Transport (India)."}, {"url": "https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cycling-better-mode-transport", "page_content": "Urban population in developing nations is projected to continue to grow, adding 2.5 billion people to the world\u2019s cities by 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. By then, more than half of the world\u2019s population will live in cities.\n\nA key step to managing rapid urbanization, reducing poverty and addressing equity and environmental issues amongst urban residents is to meet their needs for access to services and opportunities. Walking and cycling are more than low-carbon modes of transport that enhance urban quality and facilitate social cohesion. They are cheap, flexible, personal modes without which most people in low- and middle-income countries would be unable to participate in the economy and community, or access education, healthcare and other urban services.\n\nAccording to UN Environment\u2019s Global Report on walking and cycling published in 2016, up to 60 per cent of city trips are made by bike in Chinese cities while in African cities the share is closer to 5 per cent. Furthermore, in Malawi, a developing country in Eastern Africa, 80 to 90 per cent of people moving on rural roads are cyclists. Netherlands Travel Survey reported that 2016 saw a total of 4.5 billion bicycle trips, spanning a distance of 15.5 billion kilometres.\n\nThe Institute for Transportation and Development Policy\u2019s bikeshare planning guide reports that today, more than 600 cities worldwide have their own bike-share systems, and more programmes are starting every year. The largest systems are in China, in cities such as Hangzhou and Shanghai. In Paris, London and Washington, D.C., highly successful systems have helped to promote cycling as a viable and valued transport option.\n\nCycling leads to a longer and healthier life\n\nCycling has become popular for a variety of reasons. It helps to reduce the risk of diabetes, some forms of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and depression. Research from the United Kingdom found that cycling to work is linked with a 45 per cent lower risk of developing cancer, and a 46 per cent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, compared to commuting by car or public transport.\n\nThe health benefits of cycling daily rather than taking a car for short trips outweigh the risks of inhalation of air pollutants. Daily exercise prolongs life expectancy by approximately 3.4 years whereas inhalation of polluted air reduces life expectancy by 1 to 40 days. Regular cycling boosts physical fitness and is an efficient way to prevent obesity.\n\nCycling evokes positive feelings and is an easy exercise\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Transport Research Board\u2019s 92nd Annual Meeting reported that people who walk or cycle to work tend to be more satisfied, less stressed, more relaxed and experience greater freedom compared to people who drive their car to work.\n\nBicycle use therefore not only improves physical health, but also has a positive impact on mental health and subjective well-being. Academics have calculated that cycling prevents about 6,500 deaths each year and adds half a year to life expectancy in the Netherlands. These health benefits correspond to more than 3 per cent of the Dutch gross domestic product.\n\nIncreased bicycle use means lower greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSwitching from a car to a bicycle saves 150 g of CO 2 per kilometre. Each 7 km by bicycle will save an emission of 1 kilogram of CO 2 as compared to the same distance covered by car. In a five-year period, Dutch people avoided 1.41 million tonnes of CO 2 each year through cycling. This saving is equivalent to 54.4 million trees being planted each year. The climate value of cycling in the wards of Stone Town, Zanzibar was estimated to be 1,062.4 tonnes of CO 2 per year, which corresponds to US$20,994, if it were traded on the carbon markets. An amount approximately equivalent to 10 times the average income in the country.\n\nCycling saves money\n\nIn 2010, 7.4 per cent of European citizens used the bicycle as their preferred mode of transportation, which translates into 94 billion kilometres. The cumulative associated economic benefits of cycling in the European Union have been estimated to be at least US$232 billion.\n\nCycling is a cheap mode of transport. The annual costs of cycling range from US$200 to US$340. By comparison, the costs involved in driving a car range from US$2,800 to US$9,600 euros a year, based on an average annual mileage.\n\nCycling also scores well in terms of the social impact of a kilometre of urban travel by bicycle compared to such costs involved in a kilometre of travel by car or by bus: each kilometre of bicycle use yields a social benefit of US$0.77, whereas cars and buses cost society US$0.42 and US$0.33 per kilometre, respectively.\n\nThe 2018 Dutch Ministry of infrastructure and water management report indicates that the annual infrastructure costs per traveler, per kilometre are US$0.03 for bicycles, US$0.11 for cars, US$0.16 for buses, and US$0.20 for trains."}]}
