Good going forward, hard working and with good touch and distribution the teenager displayed all the raw ingredients to become a top quality full-back.\n\n\n\nInitially used from the bench, Caddis\u2019 was given a starting spot in the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Barcelona at Parkhead. Although he would be subbed that night the youngster did not look out of his depth in such illustrious company.\n\n\n\nWith Hinkel and Wilson already vying for the right-back berth Caddis may have to bide his time before he becomes a first team regular but the early signs are that he has the talent to ensure that even internationalists can\u2019t take a starting spot for granted.\n\n\n\nHe was a very good player but he just wasn\u2019t given sufficient opportunities to progress and many were sceptical that he would make it. Buying in was seen as better too often to taking a gamble on a youngster. Caddis may have been a good prospect but with Celtic messing up the league titles in 2008 & 2009 and then having multiple changes in managers, it doesn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s career let alone a developing youngster. Gordon Strachan in his last season & then Tony Mowbray were poor coaches during those spells.\n\nPaul Caddis was loaned out to Dundee United to gain first team experience in the January 2009 transfer window.\n\nHe returned to Celtic and featured in pre-season friendlies, this time under Neil Lennon. However, in Aug 2010 he made a transfer to Swindon after a successful \u00a3350,000 double bid for both himself and Simon Ferry. We hoped him the best.\n\nHe definitely had the making of a good player for Celtic, and some of the support were very much convinced that Celtic had missed out on a great player to be if the Club had held onto him and developed him.\n\n\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nA successful time at Swindon, he helped them to the league two title in England.\n\nHe then went onto have a long career with Birmingham over five seasons, and was a firm favourite. Made himself a hero by scoring a dramatic equaliser at the death in the last league match of Birmingham City\u2019s season in 2013/14 season to keep them up in their division.\n\nA proud moment came in 2016 when he finally made his debut for Scotland, a debut late in his career, albeit only playing a few minutes late on in the game after being subbed on in a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in a friendly.\n\nIn 2017, Paul Caddis signed for Blackburn Rovers, coincidentally under Tony Mowbray his former Celtic manager. He later moved to Bradford and then most memorably returning to Swindon where he (again) helped the club win the league two title. He wrapped up his playing career in 2022 but had ended his time in the senior game on the playing side in 2021.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c14 years ago I was involved the last time Celtic won the title at tannadice. Tonight is another chance of doing that. Tommy Burns looked down on us that night like he will tonight.

The capture of Caddis ended an eight-month pursuit by manager Danny Wilson, who had attempted to sign him during the previous transfer window in January, and again on loan before the season was out.\n\n\n\nAfter sitting out the first game of the season, Caddis made his Town debut in the Carling Cup against Leyton Orient, before making his league bow in a 2-2 draw at Hartlepool that Saturday, with Swindon coming back from two down to draw 2-2. Battling for the right-back berth with Kevin Amankwaah, Caddis remained in the side until the end of August, when he missed a goalless draw at Carlisle whilst on international duty. When he returned, initially he found himself dropped to the bench, before returning the following weekend for a win at Walsall in a central midfield role. At the beginning of August, Caddis played on the right-side of midfield at Dagenham - before his final under-21 appearance for Scotland again saw him dropped to the bench, though he soon returned. Wilson seemed to prefer Caddis in a midfield position - despite an injury to Amankwaah keeping him out of the side, youngster Nathan Thompson and Scott Cuthbert (usually a centre back) were both played at right-back, with Caddis in midfield or out of the side completely. After spending the whole of November on the bench - a period in which he was called up to the Scotland senior side for the first time - Caddis finally returned to a right-back role at the end of the month for an FA Cup tie at Crawley, and after giving a good performance, he kept this position right through until the end of January, when defeat at fellow relegation candidates Bristol Rovers prompted Wilson to make wholesale changes to his lineup. Two games later, Caddis was recalled - and he netted his first senior goal in a 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth, with a good solo effort.\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, Caddis was ever-present until the end of the season - and despite the Town slumping to the bottom of the table, the Scot was one of the more consistent performers - picking up the Supporters' Club Away Fans Player of the Year award. Over the close-season, new boss Paolo di Canio also hailed his consistency, and naming Caddis as one of his four 'leaders' on the pitch - di Canio also praised Caddis' versatility, hinting that he might utilise him further up the pitch in midfield. This proved not to be the case though - instead, Caddis was almost ever-present in the right back position, and he was joined on the right side by Matt Ritchie, who switched over from the left flank - and the two linked up superbly, the pairing arguably the most feared in League Two. After initially missing out on the captaincy to Oliver Risser, di Canio handed it to Caddis after injury to Risser early in September - when the Namibian returned though, di Canio announced that Caddis would retain the role for the rest of the season.\n\n\n\nThe Caddis and Ritchie partnership was crucial as Swindon climbed the League Two table after a poor start and also progressed in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy - Caddis himself getting in on the act with a couple of superb goals in December - the first an equaliser at Southend in the JPT which won the 'Ultimate Finish Award' for the best goal of the round, which was followed up the following Saturday with a superb forty yard run and low strike against Bristol Rovers. With the transfer window looming, Ipswich were rumoured to have made a double bid for both Caddis and Ritchie - a suggestion that chairman Jeremy Wray was quick to quash. Caddis netted his third goal in a month at the beginning of January with a curled free-kick against Wimbledon, then in February, Swindon reached the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final - Caddis stating that leading the Town out at Wembley would be one of the highlights of his football career.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't to be - after Caddis netted his fourth of the season from the penalty spot at Hereford, and a ten match winning run was brought to an end by local rivals Oxford, Caddis limped out just fifteen minutes into the Town's next match against Dagenham - and though initial scan results on an ankle injury suggested that it wasn't too serious, he suffered a setback after returning to light training. In total, Caddis missed eight games over almost six weeks - and though the Town recorded five victories and six clean sheets without him, his absence was notable, particularly for Matt Ritchie - without the support down the right flank, the Town's attacking play was missing a dimension - and also at Wembley, where the Town were defeated by Chesterfield.\n\n\n\nWhen Caddis did return in mid-April, he came back into a side on the brink of promotion - and a narrow victory over Plymouth in his first game left the Town needing just a point to confirm their ascent to League One. For a moment, it looked like it would be Caddis who sealed it - 1-0 down at Aldershot, the Town skipper netted an equaliser from the penalty spot in front of 1,200 travelling fans - only for the Shots to win the game. Promotion was eventually assured on the following Saturday, despite a 3-1 defeat at Gillingham - Caddis dedicating the promotion to the Town's 'amazing' support. As Swindon went on to seal the championship, Caddis was named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year alongside Matt Ritchie, before agreeing an extension to his contract until the end of the 2013/14 season.\n\n\n\nIncredibly though, Caddis had played his last game for Swindon. After featuring throughout the Town\u2019s pre-season campaign, di Canio stripped him of the captaincy the week before the new season started - accusing the Scot of \u201cnot being the same player\u201d after becoming a new father over the summer - and then left him out of the squad for the season\u2019s opening games. At the end of August, a deal was agreed to allow him to join Championship side Birmingham on a season long loan, with Adam Rooney moving in the opposite direction - but though Caddis initially impressed at St. Andrews, he was soon sidelined with a shoulder injury. When he returned to action sooner than anticipated, Caddis took a side-swipe at di Canio - stating that maybe it \u201cwas not so bad\u201d that he had fallen out with the Italian, as there would have been no chance that he could have got back to fitness so quickly at the County Ground, as the facilities at the Championship side were so much better. Di Canio soon retaliated, saying that he \u201ccan\u2019t accept stupid comments from a player who hasn\u2019t proved anything yet in football\u201d, suggesting that Caddis \u201cdidn\u2019t even know how to stretch\u201d when he had joined the club - soon after, it was revealed that di Canio had donated his image rights so that the club could benefit from treatment at an Italian rehabilitation center among the best in the world.\n\n\n\nBy the end of December, it seemed certain that Caddis would join the Blues on a permanent deal - but although a price was agreed, Birmingham pulled out of the deal as it was decided that they couldn\u2019t afford the fee - and a deal was still not in place by the time the defender\u2019s loan deal expired. By this time, a new board was in place at Swindon, di Canio had resigned and was replaced by Kevin MacDonald - the new supremo stating that he expected Caddis back for pre-season, and that he would not be sold on the cheap - Caddis himself seemed bemused at how his situation had worked out, having previously stated that he would \u201clove\u201d to stay at St. Andrews, he admitted that he had expected to have been transferred. Though Caddis started the pre-season campaign - even captaining the side at Forest Green Rovers - he found himself on the sidelines after a Swindon Advertiser interview in which he declared he didn\u2019t know what his future held, or which direction the club was trying to go in - as new bids from Birmingham and Blackpool in the region of \u00a3120,000 were rejected. After the season started, Caddis revealed details of a meeting with new Town chairman Jed McCrory in which he was told, as one of the club\u2019s highest earners, his wage would be an issue - going on to accuse the club of not playing him as they wanted him sold. He also stated that both Millwall and Birmingham had agreed to take on his contract on a loan deal - McCrory retorted by saying that he had been disappointed that Caddis had not agreed to return to Swindon to participate in the play-offs the previous season, and that the Scot had told him he wanted to play in the Championship and was looking for a new club. When a bid from Blackpool was eventually accepted, Caddis could not agree personal terms - the contract only marginally better than his Town deal, but dependent on the number of minutes he played. The saga finally came to an end at the beginning of September, when the Town accepted a bid of \u00a3150,000 from Birmingham, and Caddis moved to St. Andrews on a three-year deal.\n\n\n\nSix years later, Caddis was back in Town, training with the side but seemingly unlikely to get a contract to play, with manager Richie Wellens suggesting that Town\u2019s finances meant they couldn\u2019t make the Scot an offer after the signings of Gabriel Zakuani and Dion Donohue. In mid-November, Caddis signed a short term deal after Donohue departed.\n\n\n\nStill aged only 31, Caddis had played over 200 games across spells at Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn Rovers and Bradford since leaving, and his short hair had turned grey - perhaps he\u2019d been following Swindon in his absence. He was a different player to the one who had left Swindon; a little less pace and, perhaps partially due to not having Matt Ritchie to link up with, less of an attacking threat, but far more canny at managing a game and still able to cross brilliantly from the right.\n\n\n\nAfter a last minute substitute role at Salford, he started his first game back at the County Ground in November and almost made the perfect return, his curling left footed shot hitting the inside of the post and bouncing clear. Manager Richie Wellens shifted Rob Hunt over to the left back position to accommodate Caddis and the two would retain the full back positions through the rest of the shortened season. Caddis signed an extended contract through to the end of the 2020/21 season in January, and became the first player in Town\u2019s history to win League Two twice when Wellens\u2019 side were declared champions on a points-per-game ruling after the season had been suspended by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, in his second season back, Caddis added being relegated from League One to his list of things he\u2019d done in both spells at Town. He returned to pre-season training below ideal fitness levels and with Town often playing with wing backs, rather exposing his ageing legs, his performances tailed off. He made 28 appearances over the season, which was still the third highest amongst Town defenders in a deeply unsettled squad, and was far from the worst performer in an at times dreadful Town squad under boss John Sheridan.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the season, with his contract expiring, Caddis appeared as one of thirteen names on the released section of Town\u2019s retained and released list, with only a cursory \u201cthank you for your efforts\u201d by the club. It was the second sad departure for a man who played 139 times for Swindon over his two spells, scoring eight goals and being promoted twice.\n\n\n\nPLAYING RECORD: Season LEAGUE FA CUP LEAGUE CUP OTHER TOTAL Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls Played Gls '20/'21 24 (+2) 1 1 - - - 1 1 26 (+2) 2 '19/'20 18 (+1) - - - - - - - 18 (+1) - '13/'14 - - - - - - - - - - '12/'13 - - - - - - - - - - '11/'12 39 4 4 - 2 - 5 1 50 5 '10/'11 36 (+2) 1 1 (+1) - 1 - (+1) - 38 (+4) 1 TOTAL 117 (+5) 6 6 (+1) - 3 - 6 (+1) 2 132 (+7) 8\n\n\n\nTRANSFER INFORMATION: DATE IN/OUT TRANSFER DETAIL 2 AUG 2010 IN Celtic\n\nUndisclosed fee (double deal with Simon Ferry, believed to be a initial combined fee of \u00a3300,000, rising to a potential \u00a3600,000 depending on clauses) 31 AUG 2012 OUT Birmingham City\n\n(loan) 5 MAY 2013 IN Birmingham City\n\n(loan return) 2 SEP 2013 OUT Birmingham City\n\nUndisclosed fee (believed to be around \u00a3150,000) 15 NOV 2019 IN Bradford City\n\n(unattached) 14 MAY 2021 OUT (released)"}, {"url": "https://www.herefordfc.co.uk/news-paul-caddis-appointed-as-first-team-manager/", "page_content": "NEWS | Paul Caddis Appointed as First Team Manager\n\n20th April 2023 by Hereford FC - Club News\n\nWe are delighted to announce the appointment of Paul Caddis as our new first team manager. Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\n\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\n\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/scheme-star-struggling-job-daughter-21505414", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletter\n\nA review on the slick website of its \u00admakers describes The Scheme as \u201cthe most telling, revealing and compulsive documentary series in a decade\u201d.\n\nBut for the stars of the reality show surveying the impact 10 years since it was first shown, it\u2019s a very different story.\n\nWhatever plaudits it brought filmmakers Friel Keane, one of its stars has claimed it ruined her life.\n\nKay McCutcheon shot to fame on the 2010 Bafta Award-winning BBC series, which followed the lives of six families in the impoverished Onthank and Knockinlaw estates in Kilmarnock.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mail)\n\nBut the 47-year-old struggled to shake off the stigma of being a cast member and has found it difficult to hold down work since.\n\nFormer sandwich factory worker Kay, whose daughter Kendal, then six, ended up being bullied at school, said: \u201cThe Scheme showed people lying around, taking drugs, drinking, swearing and fighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never taken a drug in my whole life and I\u2019ve worked for a living.\n\n\u201cAfter the show, Kendal got hassle at school because she was \u2018the lassie from The Scheme\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found it hard to get jobs.

I had a job and I saved. I\u2019ve gone without so my family could have things. The Scheme totally ruined my life.\u201d\n\nAfter a slow start, the warts-and-all style of The Scheme quickly made it a word-of-mouth ratings hit.\n\nLegal difficulties meant episodes were frequently postponed but, at its height, it was watched by an incredible 840,000 viewers.\n\nIt attracted a storm of criticism though, and \u00adpoliticians accused the programme makers of exploiting vulnerable people.\n\nMum-of-two Kay appeared in the series alongside her pregnant daughter Candice, then 15, and daughter Kendal. Police were filmed visiting Kay\u2019s household several times \u2013 and she received a six-month suspended sentence for assaulting her neighbour.\n\nThe show also featured the Cunninghams, including father Gordon and mother Annie, alongside their daughter Kimberley and sons Chris and Brian.\n\nEx-Celtic player turned down producers\u2019 offer Former Celtic star Paul Caddis turned down a role on The Scheme, saying he would be \u201cabsolutely slaughtered\u201d\n\nif he took part. The footballer, left, who now plays for Swindon Town, was approached by makers to return to Onthank, where he grew up. Appearing on the Open Goal podcast, the 31-year-old, who was a free agent at the time of the interview, said series bosses wanted him to be the success story of The Scheme. Caddis has also played for Dundee United, Birmingham City, Bury, Blackburn Rovers and Bradford City.\n\nThe family faced a series of troubles, including Brian ending up in prison after a breach of the peace charge and Chris\u2019s trouble with drug dealers.\n\nOut-of-control James McMurray sparked outrage when he was seen shooting up heroin on the show. His tongue had turned blue after he swallowed 30 diazepam pills, washed down with super-strength lager.\n\nThe Cree family made an appearance as they worked to reopen the area\u2019s first community centre but struggled to raise the money to run it.\n\nThe documentary also followed the chaotic life of drug addict Marvin Baird, his dog Bullet and his ex Dayna McLaughlin.\n\nPrior to filming, Kay said she was approached by producers who she claims told her they were making a documentary series about people\u2019s lives in the Ayrshire town.\n\nShe agreed to take part and was later shown recorded footage of positive interactions between her and her daughter Kendal. But she was shocked when the scenes did not appear in the final broadcast.\n\nKay, who was not paid to appear, added: \u201cThey told me they were doing a show about life in Kilmarnock. They didn\u2019t mention they were going to be looking at how poor the estate was.\n\n\u201cI should never have agreed to go on. My dad had just died and I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\n\n(Image: UGC)\n\n\u201cBefore it was on TV, I was shown five minutes of film where I\u2019d been playing with my daughter. But that was cut from the show.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw it on television, I was so hurt. I\u2019d never go on it again no matter what I was offered. It just wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\nIn July 2011, former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson slammed the show, calling it \u201cpoverty pornography\u201d.\n\nThe programme makers have always denied allegations that the series exploited the residents of the estate.\n\nBut Kay added: \u201cYes, we had issues. There were people taking drugs, people with no money or jobs, people doing what they could and surviving. But that\u2019s true of everywhere, not just Kilmarnock.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t have much but everyone is friendly and we help each other out.\n\n\u201cThen the crew just packed up and left. The show was a big success but nothing changed for the people in Onthank. No good came of it.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Kay left the area because she grew tired of being associated with the show. She moved to nearby Galston but returned to\n\nOnthank after discovering her new house was a former murder scene.\n\nKay also claims her TV appearance led to unwanted advances from one male fan.\n\nShe said: \u201cAfter the show finished, I just wanted to get away.

Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d\n\nPaul Caddis has played more than 350 matches professionally at club level, while also represented his country in youth and senior competitions.\n\nDue to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the midfield. He played in every position for Celtic and Swindon Town, except striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis began his professional career at Celtic. Caddis broke into the first-team during the 2007/08 season but was never able to maintain a place in the starting lineup over the following years.\n\nDundee United took him on loan for the second half the 2008-09 campaign before being sold to English League One club Swindon Town, in August 2010.\n\nIn 2012-13, Caddis spent the season on loan at Birmingham City, and then joined the club permanently in September 2013 and scored the goal in stoppage time that prevented the team from being relegated from the Championship.\n\nIn January 2017, his contract with Birmingham was mutually terminated after three-and a half seasons.\n\nAfter a short stint with Bury in League One, he spent a year with Blackburn Rovers before spending seven months at Bradford City.\n\nHe returned to Swindon Town after a short spell with Bury in League One, played his final match in 2021 and announced his retirement one year later.\n\nCaddis captained Scotland\u2019s under-21 team, and played for them regularly. In 2016, he made his debut as a full-time international for Scotland.\n\nThis is what fans said as Hereford appoint the ex-Swindon, Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn, Bradford player as their new manager\u2026\n\n@BrummieHayden: Blues legend.
