Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_III,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco (Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor; 10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795) was a reigning prince of the small state of Monaco.

While he was spending his time increasing the recognition of the Principality in the courts of Europe, particularly the French and English courts, the Prince was faced with the failure of his industrialisation attempts, which were aimed at diversifying the Principality\u2019s resources, which were too seriously impacted by weather conditions.\n\nDue to France (whose support of the Prince\u2019s interests was feeble) being in an unfortunate situation, the borders between Monaco and the neighbouring States of Savoy were definitively established, in 1760, to the detriment of the Principality\u2019s legitimate plans.\n\nFinally, the last years of his reign were marked by the influence of French revolutionary ideas.

Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720, in Paris, France. He was the third of the nine children and the second but the eldest surviving of the six sons of Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. Honor\u00e9\u2019s maternal grandparents were Antonio I, Prince of Monaco and Marie of Lorraine. His paternal grandparents were the French nobles Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny, a Lieutenant General in the French army, (1644 \u2013 1725) and Charlotte de Goyon de Matignon, Countess of Thorigny (1657 \u2013 1721).\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had eight siblings but only three survived to adulthood:\n\nAntoine-Charles, Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon, (1717 \u2013 1718), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nathalie (1719 \u2013 1790), a nun at the Convent of the Visitation in Paris, France\n\nCharles, Count de Carlad\u00e9s and Count de Matignon (1722 \u2013 1749), unmarried, died from smallpox at the age of 27\n\nJacques (born and died 1723), died in infancy\n\nLouise Fran\u00e7oise, Mademoiselle des Baux (1724 \u2013 1729), died in childhood\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Charles, Count of Thorigny (1726 \u2013 1743), died in his teens\n\nCharles-Maurice, Count de Valentinois (1727 \u2013 1798), married Marie Christine Chr\u00e9tienne de Rouvrois, no children\n\nMarie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e9se, Mademoiselle d\u2019Estouteville (1728 \u2013 1743), died in her teens\n\nIn 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was officially proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the Principality of Monaco on 10 November 1733 at his coronation. The new prince resides in his luxurious Parisian hotel or sometimes even in Versailles Palace.\n\nAs a cousin of King Louis XV, he is related to the French royal family. In 1739 he was colonel of the Monaco regiment and took part with his regiment in the War of Austrian Succession.\n\nHe was wounded at the battle of Rocoux in 1746, then at the battle of Lawfeld the following year. In 1756, he promulgated a decree stipulating that the Monegasque throne would revert to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty would disappear.\n\nHe married Marie-Catherine Brignole (1737-1813) on July 5, 1757. He had two sons, Honor\u00e9 de Monaco (1758-1819), who became Honor\u00e9 IV in 1814 and Joseph de Monaco (1767-1816). French to the end of his fingernails, very present at the Court of France, he therefore governed the Monegasque principality like a Bourbon sovereign. In 1762, Honor\u00e9 III set up a navy for the principality, however this navy was under the control of the French navy. This Monegasque navy, requested by King Louis XV to Honor\u00e9 III, was to prevent British ships from trading with French harbours.\n\nIn 1789, the French Revolution broke out. Honor\u00e9 III refused to leave Paris and stayed with King Louis XVI. In 1791, he swore an oath to the French constitution. In 1792, the French monarchy is abolished and the king is imprisoned. As for Honor\u00e9 III, he refused to leave France for Monaco and also refused exile abroad, taking refuge in Blois. Not having emigrated, he is not dispossessed of his property in France. In July 1793, he was imprisoned in the Conciergerie jail in Paris while the Principality of Monaco was abolished by the revolutionaries and its territory annexed to France. With 59 years, the 59 years long reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco.\n\nIn January 1794, the former prince Honor\u00e9 Grimaldi was sentenced to life imprisonment for high treason. He died a year later, of a heart attack. In 1814, his eldest son will be restored as sovereign prince of Monaco, under the name of Honor\u00e9 IV.\n\nON SALE FROM OCTOBER THE 20th (AT 10AM) ON E-SHOP\n\nOF MONACO STAMPS AND COINS MUSEUM\n\nCoin is sold out at the mint\n\n2020 \u20ac2 proof coin, sold out in a single day at the Mint\n\nSources : Monaco \u2013 Numismag\u00a9"}], "Honor\u00e9 III died on 15 February 1795.": [{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_III,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco (Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor; 10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795) was a reigning prince of the small state of Monaco.

Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://en.gouv.mc/Government-Institutions/History-and-Heritage/Personalities/Honore-III", "page_content": "Possessed of a modern, well-informed outlook and sensitive to Enlightenment thought, Honor\u00e9 III (1720 - 1795) aspired to make Monaco a part of the ideas that were sweeping up the capitals of the time. While he was spending his time increasing the recognition of the Principality in the courts of Europe, particularly the French and English courts, the Prince was faced with the failure of his industrialisation attempts, which were aimed at diversifying the Principality\u2019s resources, which were too seriously impacted by weather conditions.\n\nDue to France (whose support of the Prince\u2019s interests was feeble) being in an unfortunate situation, the borders between Monaco and the neighbouring States of Savoy were definitively established, in 1760, to the detriment of the Principality\u2019s legitimate plans.\n\nFinally, the last years of his reign were marked by the influence of French revolutionary ideas. Though the demands of the people were not comparable with those of France, the \u201cClub of the defenders of liberty and equality\u201d managed to sow the seeds of sedition among the population, to the extent that the Prince was removed, and a \u201cfree and independent republic\u201d was quickly united to France at the beginning of 1793."}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Honor%C3%A9_III,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco\n\nHonor\u00e9 III (Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi; 10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795) ruled as Prince of Monaco and was Duke of Valentinois from 1731 to 1793 .

Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720, in Paris, France. He was the third of the nine children and the second but the eldest surviving of the six sons of Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. Honor\u00e9\u2019s maternal grandparents were Antonio I, Prince of Monaco and Marie of Lorraine. His paternal grandparents were the French nobles Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny, a Lieutenant General in the French army, (1644 \u2013 1725) and Charlotte de Goyon de Matignon, Countess of Thorigny (1657 \u2013 1721).\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had eight siblings but only three survived to adulthood:\n\nAntoine-Charles, Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon, (1717 \u2013 1718), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nathalie (1719 \u2013 1790), a nun at the Convent of the Visitation in Paris, France\n\nCharles, Count de Carlad\u00e9s and Count de Matignon (1722 \u2013 1749), unmarried, died from smallpox at the age of 27\n\nJacques (born and died 1723), died in infancy\n\nLouise Fran\u00e7oise, Mademoiselle des Baux (1724 \u2013 1729), died in childhood\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Charles, Count of Thorigny (1726 \u2013 1743), died in his teens\n\nCharles-Maurice, Count de Valentinois (1727 \u2013 1798), married Marie Christine Chr\u00e9tienne de Rouvrois, no children\n\nMarie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e9se, Mademoiselle d\u2019Estouteville (1728 \u2013 1743), died in her teens\n\nIn 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://news.mc/2023/05/26/the-last-prince-before-the-french-revolution/", "page_content": "PART 8 in our History of Monaco series\n\nIn the mid-eighteenth century, Honor\u00e9 III was the Prince of a small but independent country. Monaco\u2019s neutrality was especially evident in the fact that the monarch maintained good contacts with France (of course he was a Frenchman who had grown up in Paris) and England. He even visited King George III in London. While the Chevalier Antoine Grimaldi mainly interfered with local issues, Honor\u00e9 tried to play a role internationally. He also tried to convince the Vatican that Monaco should become its own diocese and not fall ecclesiastically under the bishops of Nice or Ventimiglia, but in this diplomatic mission he failed because nothing would change.\n\nMonaco in the eighteenth century was a small country of more than seven thousand inhabitants, of which the majority (four thousand) lived in Menton, while only thirteen hundred people lived in Monaco on the Rock or on the harbour. The population of Roquebrune was around five hundred. From an economic point of view, the country mainly relied on the cultivation of citrus fruits and olives, but tobacco was also grown while the ships that came to shelter in Monaco had to pay a considerable toll, which provided an additional source of income. Honor\u00e9 tried to stimulate entrepreneurship in his country by attracting foreign investors with tax advantages that would ensure the construction of workshops and factories (especially in the textile industry in Menton). One of the consequences of this development was that Monaco got its own printing house and from 1768 even its own newspaper \u2013 Courrier de Monaco. The infrastructure was improved, with a road built from Monaco to Menton in 1724 that was passable for carriages. Yet the Rock of Monaco was still isolated and only easily accessible from the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 spent a lot of time in Paris and Versailles. The real control of the country remained in the hands of the Chevalier. The Monegasques began to worry that Honor\u00e9 was not providing offspring. He was already 35 when it was really time for a serious partner. He did have an affair with Anna Balbi, the wife of the Marquis Giuseppe Brignole of Genoa, who was also France\u2019s ambassador to the port city. He eventually chose the daughter of his mistress, Maria-Catarina Brignole, when she was only eighteen. She fell in love with the Prince, who was almost twenty years older, but her father was not in favour of this proposed marriage, also because of the evil role that the Prince had played in his own marriage. Maria-Catarina begged her father for permission for the marriage and informed him in a letter: \u201cI promise that I will marry only the Prince of Monaco.\u201d Finally, the marriage was concluded by procuration on June 15, 1757 in Genoa. Then everything was prepared for a fairytale wedding in Monaco.\n\nMaria-Catarina was accompanied by many dignitaries from Genoa when she travelled by sea to Monaco, but once near the port a remarkable diplomatic problem arose. The Prince refused to pick up the bride from a ship while the Genoese refused to drop her off. The mother-in-law demanded that the Prince come and pick up his wife-to-be himself, but Honor\u00e9 did not feel like it because of the protocol that a monarch could not come to another. The Genoese delegation then sailed out to sea in protest, which seemed to jeopardize the marriage. The weather changed and the Genoese fleet waited on the high seas for the storm to subside. Then a solution was found, a happy medium, in the form of a bridge between shore and ship that was quickly built. At the center of this bridge, the bride and the Prince would meet. It was the start of a great wedding on the Rock, which took place on July 5, 1757.\n\nThe couple had two children, Honor\u00e9 and Joseph, but it would not be a particularly fruitful marriage and in 1771 there was even a divorce because she had an affair with the Prince of Cond\u00e9, whom she would marry in 1798. She moved to England and died at Wimbledon in 1813. She maintained very good contacts with the British royal family, which paid for her funeral.\n\nIn 1784, Honor\u00e9 III was given control of his empire as a divorced man after the death of the Chevalier. He had to guide Monaco through a turbulent time because in France everything would change after the storming of the Bastille in Paris (on July 14, 1789). Of course, Monaco could not stay away from the French Revolution. As a member of the French nobility the Prince was arrested by the French Revolutionary Guards as Honor\u00e9 Goyon on 21 July 1793 and placed in a prison but managed to escape the guillotine. He was eventually placed under house arrest at the H\u00f4tel Matignon and would die of a heart attack on 21 March 1795, as a lonely and also exhausted man. His life had turned out completely differently than he had anticipated, despite being the longest-serving monarch in Monaco\u2019s history.\n\nPHOTO: The watchtower on the Rock facing Genoa"}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iii-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco is the longest-reigning sovereign of Monaco but the French Revolution had dire consequences for his family and caused the Principality of Monaco to be annexed to France from 1793 until the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814. Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720, in Paris, France. He was the third of the nine children and the second but the eldest surviving of the six sons of Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. Honor\u00e9\u2019s maternal grandparents were Antonio I, Prince of Monaco and Marie of Lorraine. His paternal grandparents were the French nobles Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny, a Lieutenant General in the French army, (1644 \u2013 1725) and Charlotte de Goyon de Matignon, Countess of Thorigny (1657 \u2013 1721).\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had eight siblings but only three survived to adulthood:\n\nAntoine-Charles, Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon, (1717 \u2013 1718), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nathalie (1719 \u2013 1790), a nun at the Convent of the Visitation in Paris, France\n\nCharles, Count de Carlad\u00e9s and Count de Matignon (1722 \u2013 1749), unmarried, died from smallpox at the age of 27\n\nJacques (born and died 1723), died in infancy\n\nLouise Fran\u00e7oise, Mademoiselle des Baux (1724 \u2013 1729), died in childhood\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Charles, Count of Thorigny (1726 \u2013 1743), died in his teens\n\nCharles-Maurice, Count de Valentinois (1727 \u2013 1798), married Marie Christine Chr\u00e9tienne de Rouvrois, no children\n\nMarie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e9se, Mademoiselle d\u2019Estouteville (1728 \u2013 1743), died in her teens\n\nIn 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
