He worked at the University Settlement, teaching the poor of Edinburgh's slums. In 1891 Neilson immigrated with his family to Canada, where his brother had settled. After brief periods of teaching at Bryn Mawr College (1898 - 1900), Harvard (1900 - 1904), and Columbia (1904 - 1906), he was in 1906 appointed professor of English at Harvard, where he remained until 1917, when he accepted the presidency of Smith College. In 1904 he spent the summer in Offenburg in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. Neilson became an American citizen in 1905. At Harvard, Neilson won distinction as both teacher and scholar. He taught Chaucer, Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists, Milton, and various nineteenth-century authors. He joined President Charles W. Eliot as associate editor of the Harvard Classics (the 50-volume \"Five-Foot Bookshelf, \" 1909-1910), writing the notes and introductions. His edition of Shakespeare's Complete Dramatic and Poetic Works, revised with Prof. Charles J. Hill in 1942, is a standard and important one. During his career at Smith, he served as editor-in-chief of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, which appeared in 1934. Neilson hesitated for some time before accepting the Smith presidency. His two predecessors, L. Clark Seelye and Marion Le Roy Burton, had both been clergymen. Neilson had no desire to increase the size of the student body of Smith, fixed at 2, 000. He was, however, determined to provide college residences for all students, many of whom were living in private dormitories, a practice felt to be undemocratic. In the course of adding ten new dormitories he greatly enlarged the physical college and built two brick quadrangles on a tract adjacent to the old campus, which preserved the college's tradition of small dormitory units. He beautified the campus by planting and landscaping. In spite of his insistence that fund raising was not his province, Neilson not only balanced the budget, even during the depression, but through his great personal popularity brought sizable gifts to the college that significantly increased the endowment. He maintained a balanced faculty of men and women. Himself a teacher during the early years of his presidency, he brought to Smith many distinguished scholars and teachers from abroad as well as from the United States, with the result that he left the college well on a par with leading universities. He won the respect and loyalty of the faculty for his fairmindedness and devotion to academic freedom. Always a fighter for liberal causes, Neilson was violently opposed by the local community and by some of the Smith faculty for his defense of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. His compassion for the victims of Nazism led him to become a director of the National Refugee Service and co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. As the national and international situation grew more tense through the 1930's, he devoted his Monday chapel talks to attempts to make students more aware of the issues in national and international affairs. After his retirement in 1939, Neilson settled in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he had bought a remodeled farmhouse. He continued to spend part of the winters in Northampton, working on a history of Smith College, and he died there in 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. His ashes were buried on the Smith campus, appropriately in the midst of a natural garden he had planned on a hillside."}, {"url": "https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/4/resources/25", "page_content": "The William Allan Neilson Papers consist of 21.75 linear feet of correspondence, newspaper clippings, manuscripts, press releases, lecture notes, texts of speeches, photographs, and miscellaneous papers which document Neilson's life and career. While these papers contain material dating from Neilson's years at Smith College (1917-1939), his official correspondence as president of the college is stored separately in the College Archives' holdings of records of the Office of the President.\n\n\n\nThe papers document Neilson's personal life with extensive family material. His letters to his brother and sisters are particularly valuable. Among other things these letters present Neilson's view of life at Bryn Mawr College under M. Carey Thomas, his strong opinions on world politics, his experiences tutoring Helen Keller at Radcliffe College, and his first impressions of Smith College. This series of letters is especially strong for the years between Neilson's arrival at Harvard University for graduate study in 1895 and his marriage in 1905. In addition to the Neilson family correspondence there is extensive correspondence between the Neilson and Muser families plus diaries and writings of Elisabeth Muser Neilson, her parents, and her sister. Much of the Muser family material is in German.\n\n\n\nOther personal material such as photographs, correspondence, class notes, and student essays document Neilson's youth and education. His love of his native Scotland and his study of its language and literature are clearly in evidence in his University of Edinburgh essays.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence and miscellaneous papers, 1917-1946, document such day-to-day concerns as finances, family health, the running of the household, and travel arrangements.\n\n\n\nNeilson's career as professor and scholar of English and Scottish literature is represented by class notes and correspondence with students and colleagues which date primarily from his years at Harvard and Radcliffe. Smith College material includes a few notes for courses Neilson taught in the English department but consists primarily of documentation of the events and celebrations of his presidency such as his appointment, inauguration, tenth and twentieth anniversaries, and retirement. Other material documents Neilson's affiliation with scholarly organizations such as the Modern Language Association, the Scottish Text Society, and the Shakespeare Association of America. There are also texts and notes for speeches on Shakespeare and Burns. Neilson's scholarly publications are represented by a number of articles, an unfinished manuscript for a book on allegory, and proofs for a 1942 edition of Shakespeare's plays and poems. Correspondence and news clippings document other writing and editorial projects in different stages of the work. Two such projects of particular interest are the 'five foot shelf' series of Harvard Classics, which Neilson edited with Charles W. Eliot, and the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, for which Neilson was editor-in-chief.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his work as professor, administrator, and scholar, Neilson was much in demand for committee work. As a respected educator and administrator, his advice and support was continually sought by educational institutions and organizations. Correspondence documents Neilson's work as a member of various committees for Harvard University, his suggestions on the planning of the campus and curriculum of Bennington College, and his advice and endorsements for the New School for Social Research and a variety of organizations promoting adult education such as the Affiliated Schools for Workers, the Eliot Foundation for Adult Education, and the Committee on University Extension in the Connecticut Valley.\n\n\n\nNeilson was also well-known for his vigorous support of liberal causes of the day. His political activities are reflected in his involvement with a large number of organizations most of which worked for civil liberties, peace, aid to refugees, or improved foreign relations. This work is documented by correspondence with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foreign Policy Association, the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia, the National Refugee Service, various League of Nations organizations, and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace.\n\n\n\nAll of Neilson's interests and concerns are in evidence in his speeches and writings. Texts contained in the papers are a rich source for the study of life at Smith College, and trends in education and politics during Neilson's term as president of Smith (1917-1939). News clippings document the quite considerable attention paid to his views.\n\n\n\nNeilson was a renowned speaker who seldom prepared a text, preferring to talk from cursory notes made shortly before the speech was to be delivered. Because of this process the texts contained in the papers are almost exclusively transcriptions. Some of them were edited for publication, others remain more or less as they were delivered. The papers also contain some of Neilson's handwritten notes for speeches.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence, citations, and news clippings document Neilson's many awards and honors and a group of biographical articles gives an overview of Neilson's life and work. The papers also contain notes, typescripts, and correspondence for Margaret Farrand Thorp's 1956 biography Nelson of Smith."}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/25680249", "page_content": "Educator, editor and author.

WorldCat record id: 51231676\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson was born March 28, 1869, in Doune, Pertshire Scotland. He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy, graduating with honors in 1891. In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada, Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys.\n\nDeciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master, Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge, MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA. Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator. Harvard, Radcliffe, the Sorbonne, Columbia, Barnard, and the University of California all made use of Neilson's talents at one time or another.\n\nIt was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it. Before coming to Smith, Neilson made a name for himself both as a professor devoted to his students' learning (he was the only instructor of Helen Keller's who learned the manual sign language she used for communication) but also as a writer and an editor. Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry (1912)and The Facts about Shakespeare (1913). He also was the editor of Milton's Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare's Complete Works (1906).\n\nIn 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president's house would be built, with which the trustees complied.\n\nPerhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae alike. At Neilson's final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance:\n\nThe seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning. When the president stepped out he said, \"My dog thinks you're sheep,\" and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest: \"-but I think you're lambs!\"\n\nNeilson's accomplishments at Smith were many. When Neilson noticed that a majority of Smith students lived off campus he set about the task of purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus. After building the Great Quadrangle, purchasing Chapin House, Talbot House, Sessions House, and many others his goal was completed. During Neilson's 22-year term as president, the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall, Scott Gymnasium, Tryon Art Gallery, the Alumnae House, the Infirmary, and the President's house.\n\nNeilson also established the Junior Year in France, Junior Year in Italy, and the Junior Year in Spain Programs. Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934.\n\nFrom the guide to the Office of President William Allan Neilson Files RG 32., 1917-1939, (Smith College Archives)\n\n: Born in Doune, Perthshire, Scotland, March 28\n\n: Attended Montrose Academy\n\n: Studied at the University of Edinburgh, received M.A.\n\n: Immigrated with family to Canada\n\n: Resident English Master, Upper Canada College, Toronto\n\n: Graduate work in English, Harvard University, M.A. (1897), Ph.D. (1898)\n\n: Associate Professor of English Literature, Bryn Mawr College\n\n: Instructor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Professor of English, Columbia University\n\n: Became American citizen\n\n: Professor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Married Elisabeth Muser in Offenburg, Germany, June 25\n\n: Exchange Professor, University of Paris\n\n: President of Smith College\n\n: Trustee, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education Served intermittently on the College Entrance Examination Board\n\n: Initiated Special Honors program at Smith College\n\n: President, Modern Language Association\n\n: Editorial Board of G.C.

It ultimately led to his first major discovery in 1959: While working with Harvard mathematician William H. Bossert, Wilson discovered how ants communicate through the release of chemical signals called pheromones.\n\nLater, in 1990, Wilson and German behavioral biologist Bert H\u00f6lldobler published their Pulitzer-winning \u201cThe Ants,\u201d detailing the insects\u2019 anatomy, physiology, natural history, and social organization in a weighty volume that was both valued by entomologists and accessible to general readers.\n\n\u201cThis may sound silly, but to really understand the guy and appreciate him you\u2019d have to get into a conversation with him about ants,\u201d said James Hanken, a professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology in the MCZ, who knew Wilson for about 20 years. \u201cHe would just almost go to a different place. I got the impression that he remembered individually every ant that he\u2019d ever studied.\u201d\n\nAnother of Wilson\u2019s major works started in the early 1960s when he teamed up with mathematician and ecologist Robert MacArthur. Over the decade, the pair developed their theory on species equilibrium and island biogeography, which was published in the seminal 1967 book \u201cThe Theory of Island Biogeography.\u201d In it the pair sought to explain why different places have different numbers of species, and the book became a cornerstone of conservation biology and the study of biological diversity.\n\n\u201cThey provide a mathematical explanation for how many species islands can support, using some principles of population genetics and factors like the size of the island and the distance to the mainland,\u201d said Gonzalo Giribet, a professor in OEB and director of the MCZ. \u201cWith their formula they were able to accurately explain why certain islands had more species than others, as the island reached an equilibrium that takes into account immigration and extinction.\u201d\n\nWilson and a graduate student tested the theory by successfully calculating how many species would re-emerge on small mangrove islets in the Florida Keys that had been cleared by fumigation.\n\n\u201cI will always remember his going into the headquarters of the Everglades National Park and asking permission to exterminate all animal life on some of their small mangrove islands because he had a theory that they would return to an equilibrium number of animal species in a short time and he wanted to test it,\u201d said Bossert, who worked on this project as well. \u201cThey were so flabbergasted by the request that somehow they said, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat many consider to be Wilson\u2019s most important contributions to evolutionary biology came in 1975 when he published \u201cSociobiology: The New Synthesis.\u201d The work explored the genetic and evolutionary roots of animal behavior and argued that genes shaped human behavior. The ideas sparked controversy, and Wilson faced accusations that he was reviving debunked theories of biological determinism but his work was eventually largely vindicated."}, {"url": "https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/doctoral-programs/doctor-of-philosophy/student-bios/", "page_content": "In addition to their studies, doctoral candidates are involved in many aspects of the school.

Her research interests are in urbanization and crisis, the materialities and ecologies of the finance economy, depeasantization and labor. Her dissertation is a historical geographical project that studies the entangled ways in which agro-ecological change in the Nile Valley of Egypt and Sudan was constitutive of emergent urbanization processes in the Middle East during the second half of the twentieth century. Focusing on two sugarcane production regions in Egypt and Sudan, her dissertation studies the advent of regional \u2018Gulf-led\u2019 urbanization since the mid-1970s in relation to the consecutive global \u2018food regimes\u2019.\n\nSalma\u2019s research is supported by the Agha Khan program at Harvard University, the International Journal of Urban and Regional Research (IJURR), and Harvard University\u2019s Center for African Research.

Before starting her Ph.D. at Harvard university, she worked as an urban planner in Cairo in collaboration with several NGOs, international development organizations, governmental agencies and local municipalities.\n\n[email protected]\n\nKatarzyna (Kate) Balug is an historian and an artist. Her research explores feedback loops between techno-political change and subjectivity as mediated by artistic practice. Her dissertation studies the influence of aeronautics on visionary architecture at two pivotal moments in the history of human spaceflight: the 1783 launch of manned balloons, and the late 1960s Apollo space program. The dissertation frames these as cosmic events, during which a new picture of Earth emerged, and examines the renewed relevance of late 18th century paper architecture as a precedent for 1960s inflatable architecture. The project deploys recent studies of air in philosophy and literature, and leads to questions about the upcoming phases of inhabiting the Earth and resumed space exploration.\n\nKate\u2019s artistic practice intervenes in public space with momentary fictions that transform familiar situations and behaviors. She works with communities, from Peruvian villages, to Mexico City, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and Boston, to strengthen the sense of agency through the co-production of wonder.\n\nPast projects include a co-curated 2017 exhibition, The New Inflatable Moment, at Boston\u2019s BSA Space, which captured the utopian sensibilities of inflatable structures from the 18th to the 21st centuries.

She holds dual Master of Architecture and Master of Science in Historic Preservation degrees from the University of Pennsylvania School of Design where she won the William M. Mehlhorn Scholarship for Architectural Theory and Anthony Nicholas Brady Garvan Award for Outstanding Thesis for her examination of conflict between a collective desire to memorialize and a protective impulse to stigmatize, sanitize, or obliterate sites with traumatic or violent associations, such as sites with legacies of enslavement. She holds an undergraduate degree in fine arts from Yale University.\n\nPrior to her arrival at Harvard, Sarah was an architectural historian for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Her focus on lesser-known facets of New York\u2019s past led to publications about female reformers\u2019 creation of the first purpose-built kindergarten in Brooklyn, the adaptation of Civil War-era manufactories by Abstract Expressionist artists for use as studios, and Redemption-era racism through the lens of Tin Pan Alley\u2019s 1890s-1910s popular music businesses. These projects were urgent case studies in the material regulation of historic sites with cultural import, the latter of a confrontational \u201cnegative heritage\u201d site.\n\n[email protected]\n\nSabrina Osmany is a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence & Design Computation at Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design. Her research focuses on developing Deep Generative Models of Artificial Imagination. She is co-advised between Harvard and MIT working in collaboration with Isola lab at MIT-CSAIL.\n\nSabrina\u2019s research combines machine learning with cognitive linguistics, and cognitive neuroscience of human visuospatial reasoning, in an effort to lay the foundations for machines that are capable of human-like generative capacities such as imagination and creativity. Her work builds on models of Conceptual Exploration which integrates language as a fundamental component of the cognitive experience. Sabrina uses these language insights to train machines that can perform tasks such as abstract thinking, cross-modal reasoning, concept transfer and concept invention, which is the immanent frontier towards Artificial General Intelligence.\n\nSabrina\u2019s research draws from key insights from research on Mental Spaces suggesting how humans choose to represent concepts frames the choices they make during in subsequent spatial reasoning tasks. As such, representations instantiate frame consistent choice architectures. This means that representations can both reduce or expand the range of exploration of choice outcome. Nudging literature from Cognitive Psychology has shown that this phenomenon can be used for enhancing decision making in rational choice settings. Sabrina\u2019s work asks how it might also augment the human imagination and creative arts. This has bearings on the nature of agency and intentionality.\n\nGenerative Models enable an expansion in our conceptual agency, authority and imagination in the realm of the Arts but also New Ways of Thinking. By forecasting and generating Art Futures, and possible Future Worlds, Sabrina is currently developing generative models for applications in Neural Diversity and Brain Machine Interfaces.\n\nSabrina holds an M.P.S. from the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU where her research explored how human agency and intentionality are mediated by the design of interactive systems, focusing on the the development of intelligent virtual environments that sense, decode, and mediate human choice making behavior.\n\nIn collaboration with NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, Sabrina developed her thesis, the Human Avatar Project, an anatomical, 27 degree-of-freedom upper-limb simulation to aid Pesaran lab\u2019s research in brain-machine interfaces for robotic prosthetics.\n\nHer interactive work includes the development of a programming language in Urdu, a mobile app that uses computer vision to identify and connect with network devices, and a 120 ft. video installation at InterActiveCorp headquarters in New York City. She has exhibited Computational Art work internationally and maintains a vibrant artistic practice alongside her research.\n\nSabrina studied Philosophy at Bard College, completing a thesis, The Stature of Man in the Age of Creative Machines, which explored the cybernetic implications on of machines surpassing human creative intelligence. She is a mentor for OpenAI Scholars Program and currently serves on the board of the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at Bard College.

Their work focuses on racialized histories of urban design across the US and its empire, histories of activist planner-architects, and reparative and abolitionist models of urban design. Caroline\u2019s dissertation project explores the emergence of \u201cparticipatory planning\u201d in the mid-twentieth century. Through a focus on federally funded\u2014yet activist led\u2014community action programs in the US, Caroline\u2019s research examines how the Black Power movement, the War on Poverty, and models of community development originally designed to quell insurgency abroad, intersected to form the foundation of a now central paradigm of US urban planning practice. This work touches on issues of democratic social engineering, cold war imperialism, 20th century anti-racist urban uprisings, and struggles for self-determination across the US.\n\nIn addition to their dissertation, Caroline teaches and conducts research as part of the Urban Design and the Color Line project and has recently completed an anti-racist planning toolkit with the Highline Network and the Urban Institute (link), and a report for the Architectural League of NY on landscape and community-led, post-coal futures for Appalachia. They are a Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative doctoral fellow, having previously served as an Irving Innovation Fellow, and their work has been funded by the Graham Foundation, the Knight Foundation, the Warren Center for American Studies, the Canadian Center for Architecture, and the Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative. Caroline holds a Master of Architecture in Urban Design with Distinction from the GSD, where they were awarded both the Thesis Prize and Academic Excellence Award in Urban Design \u2013 additionally, Caroline holds a Bachelor of Architecture from Virginia Tech. Prior to coming to Harvard, Caroline spent five years in professional architectural practice \u2013 most of which was spent working for UNStudio in their Shanghai office, and less of which was spent practicing in Los Angeles where they were actively involved in the Occupy movement.\n\n[email protected]\n\nSam Tabory is a fourth-year PhD student. He studies the governance and negotiation of urban-regional systems transitions, paying attention to questions of scale, infrastructure, and boundary. He is interested in how transitions and alternative governance logics interact with evolving spatial and temporal understandings of crisis under conditions of global environmental change. His work considers how conventions of both growth and polity are implicated by such ideas of crisis. Trained both as a planner and a Latin Americanist, comparative and global perspectives inform his work. His interests are interdisciplinary and multi-scalar across planning, law, and urban science. An element of Sam\u2019s focus on transitions includes an interest in the speculative and propositional work of intervening in support of urban systems transitions.\n\nPrior to doctoral studies, Sam worked in urban science-policy engagement for a Sustainability Research Network supported by the US National Science Foundation and as a research associate with the global cities research team at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Professionally, he has contributed to reports commissioned by UN Environment, the World Bank, and NATO. His scholarly work has been published in Global Environmental Change.\n\nSam holds master\u2019s degrees in urban planning and Latin American studies from the University of Texas at Austin. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in Latin American studies from Tulane University.\n\n[email protected]\n\nDemetra Vogiatzaki is a historian of eighteenth-century architecture working on the intersection of virtual and material spaces in early modern Europe, with a particular focus in the French Enlightenment.

He tries to propose and test a method of embodying such connection with expandable CFD dataset and machine learning model implemented to first predict the air flow pattern inside a multi-room indoor space layout, and then optimize this space layout towards a better flow pattern, so as to form a design iteration loop. Xiaoshi is also interested in involving human preference in the design iteration and develop a human-AI interactive mechanism. Before entering his PhD track, Xiaoshi holds a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Tongji University in China, a Master of Science in architecture degree from Columbia University in New York, and a Master of Design degree from Harvard Graduate School of Design. Xiaoshi is currently based in China.\n\n[email protected]\n\nAngela Wheeler is a sixth-year PhD candidate and graduate associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
