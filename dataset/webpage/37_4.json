As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through a successful career in acting. She\u2019s also appeared in numerous other television shows and feature films throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors even well into her \u201870s, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhile virtually no information is available about Jeannine\u2019s early life, it is known that she developed an interest in acting at a young age. She started her career in the early 1960s, appearing in small or uncredited roles in projects such as \u201cFive Finger Exercise\u201d. In 1963, she was cast in the sitcom \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d in the role of Billie Jo Bradley, set in the Shady Rest Hotel run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters and her uncle. The series was created after the success of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the success of this show led to the spin-off entitled \u201cGreen Acres\u201d.\n\nShe stayed with the show until 1965, then decided to leave the series to pursue more film work, replaced by Gunila Hutton and later Meredith MacRae during the latter seasons. Jeannine then started to do film work in the late 1960s, appearing in \u201cThe Big Mouth\u201d as Bambi Berman, filmed in San Diego and featuring Frank De Vol as an on-screen narrator.\n\nThe 3 original Bradley Sisters\u2026Betty Jo {Linda Kaye Henning}, Bobbi Jo {Pat Woodell}, and Billie Jo {Jeannine Riley.} Posted by Debbie Spivey on Saturday, January 26, 2019\n\nCareer Prominence\n\nThe following year Riley was cast in \u201cFever Heat\u201d, which was directed by Russell S. Doughten and starring alongside Nick Adams and Norman Alden. In 1969 she was cast in the film \u201cThe Comic\u201d, co-written and co-produced by Carl Reiner and starring Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee and Mickey Rooney in a film inspired by the end of the silent film era.\n\nAfter that she returned to television, as she was cast in a regular role in the comedy variety series entitled \u201cHee Haw\u201d during the same year, which was set in fictional rural Kornfield Kounty, and inspired by \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d. The show centered on rural culture and country music, with hosts Buck Owens as well as Roy Clark, but would often feature scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer\u2019s daughters attire, who came to be known as the Hee Haw Honeys. She stayed with the show for three years, and then joined another show in \u201cDusty\u2019s Trail\u201d, in which she played Lulu McQueen, a western-theme take-off of Ginger Grant from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, also starring Forrest Tucker and Bob Denver.\n\nLater Career\n\nOver the next few years, Jeannine had small roles in television shows such as \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d, \u201cRoute 66\u201d, and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d She then featured in the film \u201cElectra Glide in Blue\u201d, which starred Robert Blake as a motorcycle cop alongside Billy \u201cGreen\u201d Bush, and based on the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle used by traffic police. During the same year, she had an uncredited role in \u201cThe Outfit\u201d, actually appearing as a prostitute in an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Stark under the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake.\n\nAs the years progressed, Jeannine took fewer roles; she was a part of the 1980s project entitled \u201cLone Star Bar & Grill\u201d as Arlene, and one of her last projects was the 1991 film entitled \u201cTimebomb\u201d, which starred Michael Biehn, Richard Jordan and Patsy Kensit.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Riley married Gary Groom in 1965 but their marriage ended in divorce in 1972. She married once more in 1974 to Irwin Radnitz but it was also a marriage that ended in divorce. There are no reported children from her marriages.\n\nSince retiring from acting work, very little information has been shared about her. One of the reasons is due to the fact that she does not have any accounts on major social media websites. In 2016, a book was released entitled \u201cX Child Stars: Where Are They Now\u201d, written by Kathy Garver and Fred Ascher, which contained a profile of her along with her career. Many sources speculate that since ending her acting career, she focused more on other endeavors, and likely another marriage and a family, but there is no evidence to confirm these speculations.\n\nFacts # Fact 1 Jeannine Riley and Steve Ihnat co-starred together in the play, \"The Fourposter\", put on by the Sherman Oaks Playhouse for two months, from mid-April to mid-August, 1953.

She appeared on the show\u2019s first two seasons which lasted up until the mid-1960s and then had memorable stints in a string of other productions, including Route 66, The Man From U.N.C.L, Fever heat, and The Comic.\n\nHowever, she probably stopped enjoying acting as she started to scale back on her appearances in the \u201990s and soon, she left the limelight completely. Her last film role was as Landlady in the 1991 film Timebomb. Since this role, Jeannine has not appeared in any film or does she plan to do so soon. However, her exit from the spotlight without officially announcing her retirement has many people wondering where she is now and what lead to her disappearance.\n\nJeannine Riley\u2019s Biography\n\nJeannine Riley was born in Madera, California USA, on 1st October 1940 and named Jeannine Brooke Riley. From the look of things, the actress must\u2019ve been one of the most enigmatic actresses in her time as there is no information about her. Not even her educational history, or childhood, despite the terrific fame she enjoyed during her active years in the film industry. The much that is known about her is that she began her acting career professionally in 1962 with a role in the Rosalind Russell drama Five Finger Exercise.\n\nShe followed the role up with an appearance in Father of the Bride, My Three Sons and Route 66. At age 23, she appeared in the suspense drama Strike Me Deadly with Gary Clarke and Steve Ihnat. She went on to work with Ihnat in The Fourposter \u2013 a stage play.\n\nAt this point, she had started to gradually climb the prestigious career ladder. Her performances in Wagon Train and The Virginian helped to solidify her position in the limelight and drew the interest of CBS. It also prepared a stage for her star-making role in Petticoat Junction (1963) as one of the daughters of Kate Bradley \u2013 played by Bea Benaderet. The role remains what she is known for to date.\n\nMeanwhile, she was not the first choice for the role. Sharon Tate was chosen for it but the actress lost the slot when she got involved in nude photoshoots, mostly because explicit contents were seen as somewhat a taboo at that time. Luckily, Jeannine was picked to replace Tate when her role was recast.\n\nAfter two seasons of the series, Jeannine Riley left and was replaced by Gunilla Hutton. Even after she left the show, life stayed kind to her acting career as she made more TV appearances including guest-starring on Ozzie and Harriet. She also played a part on the Smothers Brothers Show. In 1967, she secured roles in different films; The Big Mouth, The Wild, Gomer Pyle and a lot more.\n\nThe following year, she worked with Nick Adams in Fever Heat (1968), which is among the last films of the actor before his demise. After a few more acting works in the 1960s, her next appearance was in 1973 \u2013 in Electra Glide in Blue. At this point, Hollywood was beginning to accept nudity and Jeannine was willing to show some skin. Her nude scenes in the movie made her an instant star but Jeannine probably wanted something else as her presence on TV started to reduce following this role. In 1991, she left completely after starring in the film, Timebomb.\n\nHer Family\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Jeannine Riley doesn\u2019t let people into matters concerning her private life. So, nothing is known about her siblings, parents, or any other relative. It is, however, known that she has been married twice and none of her marriages survived the test of time. Her first marriage was to Gary Grom in 1965. It failed in 1972 and in less than two years after their divorce, Jeannine married Irwin Radnitz which ended in a similar manner. None of her marriages or past relationships produced a child and since then, her love life has been blurred from the public.\n\nRead Also: Who Was Ann Sothern?\n\nWhere Is Jeannine Riley Now?\n\nNobody is sure of what Jeannine has been up to since 1991 when she left the spotlight. She probably wants nothing more than people knowing less about her as she is not even active on social media either, making it very difficult to dig out anything about her. But there are rumors that she left the acting scene possibly to focus on her family while others have taken the view that she pursued a different career. Nonetheless, these rumors haven\u2019t been confirmed to-this-date. In this regard, her whereabouts remain a mystery."}, {"url": "https://doyouremember.com/157936/jeannine-riley-career-then-now", "page_content": "Billie Jo Bradley was a model of ambition and unbridled hope and awe in Petticoat Junction and none other than Jeannine Riley debuted the role in 1963. Two others would follow, but not before Riley left a permanent mark on the show and set the stage for seven seasons of Billie Jo greatness. But what about Riley herself? What trajectory did her career follow? In short, one her character would have been proud of.\n\nJeannine Riley was born on October 1, 1940, and grew up in California for much of her upbringing after her father left for the Army and her family planted roots in Madera. She learned acting and the ways of show business in the Pasadena Playhouse while also performing ballet. She started working on television and an uncredited role in the 1962 movie Five Finger Exercise before television work arose in greater succession. Early credits included Father of the Bride, My Three Sons, Route 66, and The Beauty Contest. Indeed, her easy, approachable grace helped pave the way for more and more prominence on TV not long into her career.\n\nWhy did Jeannine Riley leave \u2018Petticoat Junction\u2019?\n\nHer career had just begun in 1962 and still Jeannine Riley managed to turn some important heads. Namely, CBS producers noticed her while she acted in Wagon Train and The Virginian and as rural shows dominated televisions, they wanted Riley for their next big project: Petticoat Junction. With the rural purge still a decade away, the wholesome series joined the ranks of Beverly Hillbillies and The Andy Griffith Show as a recipe for success. Initially, actress and model Sharon Tate was slated to originate the role of Billie Jo, but after a nude photoshoot, she was deemed too risque for a series sponsored by Ivory Soap; Riley ended up winning the role of 300 other hopefuls.\n\nRiley channeled that easy charisma into her role and won hearts on-screen and off. But just like her character possessed endless aspirations, so too did Riley, and after two years she bowed out of the series to pursue a film career, as well as try out some other shows, including Gilligan\u2019s Island and Hee Haw. She did make it into movies as planned, such as The Big Mouth and Fever Heat. One of her most prominent roles came in 1973 as Lulu McQueen in Dusty\u2019s Trail, which saw Riley as a kind of Ginger Grant in a western reimagining of Gilligan\u2019s Island complete with Bob Denver himself and Lori Saunders.\n\nIt\u2019s about time to be a bolder woman\n\nRiley wanted to break away from roles that cast her on the basis of her looks alone but found this a difficult endeavor. New opportunities grew fewer. Her final film came with 1991\u2019s Timebomb, a science-fiction action movie starring Michael Biehn. She retired that same year but stays involved in the industry in other ways; the 2016 book X Child Stars: Where Are They Now? offers a look at her life and career. Her personal life included marriage first to Gary Groom from 1965 to 1972, then Irwin Radnitz in 1974 until they too divorced.\n\nWhile Riley is not reported to have any children, she has still used her life\u2019s experiences to guide the next generation. In typical Billie Jo fashion, she wants to see women be successful, something she herself is familiar with. In 2020, she penned the book The Bolder Woman: It\u2019s About Time, all about encouraging and instructing women on how they can follow their dreams at any age. \u201cCome along with me as I reveal how I overcame my own fear of aging and being labeled an old woman just because I\u2019d reached a certain number of years,\u201d Riley invites readers. \u201cYour many years of living has brought you this far, so why stop now?\u201d\n\nWe certainly hope Riley doesn\u2019t stop for a long time!"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Jeannine-Riley", "page_content": "Jeannine Riley (born October 1, 1940 in Madera, California, USA) is an American actress.\n\nContents\n\nRiley has appeared in guest roles on numerous television series (Route 66, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Wild Wild West) and a few feature films such as The Big Mouth (1967), Fever Heat (1968), The Comic (1969) and Electra Glide in Blue (1973).\n\nAlso made a guest appearance in an episode of The Virginian.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for her role as Billie Jo Bradley on the first two seasons of the CBS sitcom Petticoat Junction (1963\u20131965).

The series aired for six seasons altogether, the first five on the ABC-TV network from 1957 through 1962 and in its final year, 1962 to 1963, on CBS.\n\nSet in the San Fernando Valley of California, the series was filmed in Hollywood at Desilu studios.\n\nThe Real McCoys revolves around the lives of a family from the Appalachian Mountains who originally hailed from fictional Smokey Corners, West Virginia. The McCoys moved to California and became dirt farmers. The family consisted of Grandpa Amos McCoy (Walter Brennan); his grandson Luke (Richard Crenna), Luke's new bride Kate (Kathy Nolan), Luke's teenage sister Tallahassie \"Hassie\" (Lydia Reed), and his 11-year-old brother Little Luke (Michael Winkelman). The double-naming of the brothers was explained in the first episode by the elder Luke: Because their parents were so excited over the birth of the younger boy, \"they forgot all about me!\" Only Crenna was in every episode.\n\nFor its first three seasons, The Real McCoys, which followed The Donna Reed Show, was the lead-in program on the ABC Thursday lineup for The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired from 1957 to 1960. The Pat Boone series was succeeded in 1960 by Fred MacMurray and William Frawley in My Three Sons.\n\nAlthough the series had ranked in the Top 10 the entire time it was on ABC, The Real McCoys fell into disfavor after being sold to CBS. It was cancelled in the summer of 1963. Factors in the cancellation were the changes in the series (especially the departure of the character Kate McCoy, played by Kathy Nolan), its new Sunday evening time slot opposite NBC's Bonanza, and CBS's concentration on another rural show, The Beverly Hillbillies, which had become the No. 1 entry on television."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050053/reviews", "page_content": "8 /10\n\nA small part of a very large family named McCoy who hailed from the hills of West Virginia, put a down payment on a land in the Imperial Valley of Southern California and moved there and into our television sets for a considerable in the late fifties and early sixties. We know there was a whole lot more of them because occasionally some kinfolk came to visit.\n\n\n\nAfter a career with three Oscars under his belt and at that time he was the only one who had that many, you'd think Walter Brennan might want to slow up at the age of sixty three when he started that series. Not only did he keep up the grind of a weekly television series, but Brennan's movie career didn't slow down a might. You might remember he played a pretty substantial role in Rio Bravo and in How the West Was Won while The Real McCoys were still running.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the McCoys consisted of Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan as Luke and Kate, a pair of young marrieds. Kate married into the McCoys, but like Ethel Kennedy you'd think she was born into the clan instead. Kathleen was a wise old soul in her own way inside a beautiful young lady. She was the heart of the show, more than Brennan at times.\n\n\n\nRichard Crenna went on to a career that involved him playing a lot more than hayseeds like Luke McCoy. But he said many times that the real value of The Real McCoys for him was as an acting school. Just working with and watching Walter Brennan every week was more valuable than acting lessons with Stella Adler or the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\n\n\nTwo younger siblings came along with Luke, Kate, and Grandpa. There was Lydia Reed and Michael Winkelman as Hassee and Little Luke. I thought it a bit much to name a kid after Tallahassee because someone sent them a picture postcard from the place and they thought the name was so pretty. Lydia had enough teenage angst, settling from West Virginia into sophisticated southern California without that added to her woes. As for Little Luke, I guess the McCoy clan got squeamish on names after Tallahassee and stuck with one tried and true.\n\n\n\nTony Martinez, all barely five feet of him, played their Chicano farmhand, Pepino. The Chicano and hill cultures blended very well together. At the time Tony Martinez was considered to have a breakthrough part for Latinos. Pepino was always a cheerful guy, but a hardworking person of real dignity and was never demeaned in any way by the stories.\n\n\n\nAs I said other McCoys got in the cast. Jack Oakie did several episodes as Uncle Rightly McCoy when Brennan was on extended leave in a movie. And several episodes had the McCoys make a visit back to West Virginia where we ran into the real head of the clan, Great Grandma McCoy played by Jane Darwell. That's right, Jane was Amos's mother and in fact she was just about old enough in real life to be just that.\n\n\n\nThey should have canceled the show after Kathleen Nolan left or paid her what she wanted. A lot got taken out of the show when she left and Luke was left a widower.\n\n\n\nIn many ways the Real McCoys was a survival story about a family leaving one culture and trying and succeeding in making it in a different location with different ways. Maybe that's why The Real McCoys was as successful as it was. Isn't that what the American Dream is all about?"}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com/prime-video/actor/Jeannine-Riley/nm0727065/", "page_content": "Jeannine Riley\n\nBlonde bombshell Jeannine Brooke Riley was born in Madera, California on October 1, 1940 and started her movie and TV career in 1962 with an unbilled movie part in the Rosalind Russell drama Five Finger Exercise (1962) and roles on the TV shows \"Father of the Bride\" and \"Route 66,\" not to mention an episode of \"My Three Sons\" aptly entitled \"The Beauty Contest.\" The next year she co-starred with Gary Clarke and Steve Ihnat in the low-budget suspense drama Strike Me Deadly (1963); later that year she and Ihnat also appeared together in the stage play \"The Fourposter.\"\n\nWhile showing off her allure in western series \"Wagon Train\" and \"The Virginian,\" Jeannine came to the attention of CBS producers who were on a TV rural roll with the huge series hits \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". At the time, Hillbilly cast member Bea Benaderet (as Cousin Pearl) had just been given the green light to star in her own bucolic series, Petticoat Junction (1963), playing Kate Bradley, a hotel-owning widowed mother of three beautiful nubile daughters. The flirty role of daughter Billie Jo Bradley was at first given to actress Sharon Tate, but when word came out that she had posed nude in photo shoots, they were forced to dismiss her from the wholesome Ivory-Soap-sponsored series before scandal and controversy could cause damage. The part was recast and Jeannine won the role.\n\nThe actress was ideal as the Daisy Mae-like eldest daughter who attracted men like bees to honey, much to the envy of her impressionable younger sisters. Jeannine played the role for two years before both she and Pat Woodell (as sister Bobbie Jo) opted out of the series. While Jeannine wanted to move into film work, Woodell, who went on to marry and divorce Gary Clarke, Jeannine's film co-star in Strike Me Deadly (1963), desired a singing career. Jeannine and Pat were replaced in 1965 by Gunilla Hutton and Lori Saunders.\n\nWhile the actress continued on with TV guest roles on \"Ozzie and Harriet,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" and \"Occasional Wife,\" and as a on \"The sometimes-sexy foil on \"The Smothers Brothers Show,\" she found breaking away from her bombshell trappings too difficult and was soon appearing as sexpot Bambi Berman in the Jerry Lewis film vehicle The Big Mouth (1967), and in unsold pilots of Sheriff Who (1967) and Li'l Abner (1967); in this latter she finally got to play the voluptuous Daisy Mae character. Guest episodes of \"The Wild, Wild West\" and \"Gomer Pyle\" also showed a return to familiar territory.\n\nAfter starring with Nick Adams in one of his last films before his untimely death, the action drama Fever Heat (1968), Jeannine showed up in her first quality film showcase, albeit a smaller part, with The Comic (1969), a moving showcase for nimble Dick Van Dyke as a silent screen star. She found an even better role as dancer/barmaid babe Jolene opposite biker Robert Blake in the cult film Electra Glide in Blue (1973), sharing some potent nude scenes.\n\nBack in the country fold on series TV, she appeared in two seasons of the cornpone musical variety show Hee Haw (1969), in which she was featured as a Daisy Mae-like foil in silly skits. A couple years later she was cast in the \"Gilligan's Island\"-inspired TV western Dusty's Trail (1973) with Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker co-starring as Gilligan/Skipper-like characters; Jeannine's Lulu McQueen was a dead-on take on the pneumatic Ginger Grant role. Petticoat Junction (1963) co-star Lori Saunders co-starred in the series as innocent Betsy McGuire, a variation of the Mary Ann character. It lasted one season.\n\nSince then, however, the availability of parts has sharply declined; Jeannine's last credits were the films Lone Star Bar & Grill (1983) and Timebomb (1991)."}, {"url": "https://nostalgiacentral.com/television/tv-by-decade/tv-shows-1950s/real-mccoys/", "page_content": "1 9 5 7 \u2013 1 9 6 3 (USA)\n\n224 x 30 minute episodes\n\nThe Real McCoys was a family show with a twist.
