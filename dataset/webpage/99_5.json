Thondup was originally slated to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, and was trained as such till he was eleven, having been recognized as a reincarnated Rinpoche. In 1941, he was enthroned as the Maharaja Kumar, replacing his elder brother, Paljor, who died in a plane crash while serving as an officer in the Royal Indian Air Force.\n\nPalden Thondup married twice. His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html", "page_content": "Hope's loneliness and confusion grow over the years, and so does her spiritual quest. Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://jfk.artifacts.archives.gov/people/2239/queen-hope-cooke/objects", "page_content": "Queen Hope Cooke\n\nQueen of Sikkim\n\nCooke was born in San Francisco and spent much of her childhood in New York City.

His first wife, Samyo Kushoe Sandeki, was from the Tibetan aristocracy and died in 1957. Sandeki was a popular figure in Sikkim and was widely respected by the people. Palden met a young American socialite, Hope Cooke, in Darjeeling and married her in 1963. His coronation as the Maharaja took place on an astrologically determined auspicious date, 4 April 1965, although he had taken over as ruler on 2 December 1963 after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was a grand ceremony, covered by American and European media that were attracted by another American marrying royalty, following the wedding of Hollywood actress, Grace Kelly, with the ruling Prince of Monaco.\n\nAlso read: For over 10 years, this Sikkim man has kept a lake litter-free at 12,406 ft\n\nPalace intrigue\n\nHope Cooke was ambitious and allowed her naivet\u00e9 to overcome the reality of her position as an \u2018outsider\u2019. She was caught early in the web of palace intrigues and shallow politicking. When my wife and I made our first call on the Chogyal and Gyalmo (queen consort), our initial impression of Hope Cooke was of a young person who had adopted the outward poise of Tibetan aristocracy, reducing the soft tones in which Tibetan ladies expressed themselves to a mostly incomprehensible whisper. She obviously did not realize that she was not taken as seriously as she thought she was by senior courtiers. What is more, she was at the receiving end of Palden Thondup\u2019s favourite sister, Princess Pema Tsedeun, also known as Kukula. Kukula was urbane and politically savvier than her brother. There was an immediate clash of personalities between her and Hope Cooke, with each in her own way trying to exert her influence on the ruler.\n\nOur first meeting with the Chogyal\u2014whose request to be addressed as such and not Maharaja had been acceded to by the Indian government\u2014and the Gyalmo took place in an intimate private sitting room at the palace. It was just the four of us around cups of tea and cakes from Calcutta\u2019s Swiss bakery and cafe, Flurys, along with an array of Sikkimese snacks. The Chogyal was his charming self, ready to discuss everything including politics. It was clear to me that he was trying to gauge whether I would be useful to him in the games he indulged in, of sharpening differences between officials of the political office and the political officer.\n\nThe same attempt was also in play where the relations between the political officer and the divisional commander of the 17th Mountain Division, were concerned. Prior to the visit, I had discussed the call with my boss, N.B. Menon, who let me have his insight into the mind of the Chogyal and his ways. I had little difficulty in reading his motives and the ideas that lay behind them. He was intent on creating confusion that he could take advantage of, in order to achieve his political ambition.\n\nAlso read: The sordid underbelly of \u2018golden state\u2019 Sikkim \u2014 it\u2019s India\u2019s suicide capital\n\nI managed to convey, indirectly, that I would not be part of any political game-playing, suggesting that given the norms of protocolary behaviour as first secretary (I was yet to be promoted to that status), I would of course be in touch with his principal secretary, Jigdal Densappa, and the concerned officials at the Sikkim secretariat. Palden Thondup took the hint and soon thereafter arranged for Karma Topden, the son of his political confidante, Martem Topden, a senior politician and legislator from the Sikkim National Party, to be the one to interact with me on political issues. This was, of course, along with Jigdal Densappa, who was Karma\u2019s mentor.\n\nKarma Topden had been trained in intelligence and was part of the so-called Study Group that was the backup in both political and socio-economic spheres to serve the ruler\u2019s ambitions and interests. It was also the think-tank that advised the Chogyal on all matters related to India. Hope Cooke was involved in broader policy formulations that emerged out of the deliberations of the Study Group that had Jigdal as its administrative head. It was this group, along with a set of legal advisors, that fed the Chogyal\u2019s ambitions to the point where he tended to fail to realistically evaluate the possible.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the deliberations of this group, where Hope Cooke had taken the lead, was to resurrect the controversy surrounding the grant of Darjeeling to the East India Company, adding the twist of asking for its return from India. What lay behind this attempt was the supposition that by placing the Indian government under this kind of pressure, it could force Delhi to negotiate a fresh treaty with Sikkim where in return for a settlement on Darjeeling, Sikkim would ask to be treated as an independent state in a special relationship with India.\n\nAlso read: Coercion, not accommodation \u2014 India and China need a new compact for 3,488-km border\n\nExpanding ambition\n\nTo grant credence to this ambition, Hope Cooke published an article in 1967, putting forward the claim that all land within the territory of Sikkim belonged to the ruler in eternity and as such could only be held in trust till he sought its return. She demanded the return of Darjeeling and its surrounds to the kingdom of Sikkim,1 suggesting that this was what her husband was seeking by revoking the trust deed that had granted Darjeeling to the East India Company. This article contributed to the atmosphere of distrust between the Chogyal and the Indian government, and it was felt that Hope Cooke was a \u2018trojan horse\u2019 planted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Sikkim. It was also a wake-up call to the mandarins in South Block, both at the prime minister\u2019s office and the ministry of external affairs.\n\nThe Chogyal was informed in no uncertain terms that this attempt at muddying issues was unacceptable and that his wife was stepping into dangerous waters. Hope Cooke, of course, was also playing to the gallery. By bringing Darjeeling into the Sikkim\u2013India equation, she felt that both the Bhutia and the Gurkha elements of the Nepali population would ensure that they endorsed her husband and his will to get a revision of the Treaty of 1950. In this endeavour she was unsuccessful, as the bulk of the Nepali and many among the Bhutia hierarchy were suspicious of her. This was also part of the palace politics and intrigues let loose by Kukula against her sister-in-law, the Gyalmo.\n\nEven among the top Sikkimese bureaucracy, there were quite a few who resented Hope Cooke\u2019s attempts to interfere and put barriers in the way of their dealings with the palace on matters of administration and policy. This resentment was to reach a climax when a pliant Indian Civil Service officer, I.S. Chopra, was selected by Foreign Secretary T.N. Kaul to take over the post of the principal administrative officer in Gangtok. Chopra, falling under the blandishments of Palden Thondup, accepted the title of \u2018Sidelong\u2019, a Tibetan title equivalent to the designation of \u2018prime minister\u2019. He in turn bent before the Chogyal and Hope Cooke\u2019s wishes to the point where he pressurized the chief secretary to divert plan funds provided by India in favour of projects that benefitted the Bhutia interests adding to the feelings of alienation of the Nepali majority.\n\nI.S. Chopra was unfit for the job entrusted to him. He was protocol-conscious and attempted to undercut N.B. Menon, who may have been junior to him in the foreign service but was the senior interlocutor between Delhi and the Chogyal. P.N. Haksar as the principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had no confidence in Chopra, describing him as someone who had \u2018no loyalties to anything and least of all to his own country. But he was a friend of the Foreign Secretary (T.N.Kaul) and has always been a smooth operator. Having become the Dewan of Sikkim, he could not care less what happened to Indo-Sikkimese relations.\u2019"}, {"url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1964/10/03/royalty-3", "page_content": "The New Yorker, October 3, 1964 P. 45\n\nTalk.

By 1973, both the country and their marriage were crumbling; soon Sikkim was merged into India. Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980; Namgyal died of cancer in 1982.[3]\n\nCooke wrote an autobiography, Time Change (Simon & Schuster 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an urban historian. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published Seeing New York (Temple University Press 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (Daily News); and taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Birch Wathen, a New York City private school.[4]"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html", "page_content": "Hope's loneliness and confusion grow over the years, and so does her spiritual quest. Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Palden-Thondup-Namgyal/6000000021871287431", "page_content": "About Palden Thondup Namgyal\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palden_Thondup_Namgyal\n\nPalden Thondup Namgyal (May 23, 1923 \u2013 January 29, 1982) was the 12th and last Chogyal (king) of Sikkim.\n\nAt six, Namgyal became a student at St. Joseph's Convent in Kalimpong, but had to terminate his studies due to attacks of malaria. From age eight to eleven he studied under his uncle, Rimpoche Lhatsun, in order to be ordained a Buddhist monk; he was subsequently recognised as the reincarnated leader of both Phodong and Rumtek monasteries. He later continued his studies at Saint Joseph's College in Darjeeling and finally graduated from Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, in 1941.\n\nNamgyal served as adviser for internal affairs for his father, Sir Tashi Namgyal, the 11th Chogyal, and led the negotiating team which established Sikkim's relationship to India after independence in 1949. He married Sangey Deki in 1950, a daughter of an important Tibetan family, and together they had two sons and a daughter. Sangey Deki died in 1957.\n\nNamgyal married Hope Cooke in 1963, a twenty-two-year-old socialite from San Francisco in California; she was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers on the state of New York. The marriage brought worldwide media attention to Sikkim. The couple, who had two children, divorced in 1980.\n\nShortly after their marriage, his father died and Namgyal was crowned the new Chogyal on an astrologically favourable date in 1965. In 1975, as the result of a referendum, Sikkim became a state of India and the monarchy abolished.\n\nNamgyal was an amateur radio operator, call-sign AC3PT, and was a highly sought after contact on the airwaves. The international callbook listed his address as: P.T. Namgyal, The Palace, Gangtok, Sikkim.\n\nPalden died of cancer in New York City, in the United States on January 29, 1982. Upon his death, 31 members of the State Legislative Assembly offered khadas to the Chogyal as a mark of respect.\n\nHis son from his first marriage, Wangchuk Namgyal, was named the 13th Chogyal, but the position no longer confers any official authority."}, {"url": "https://www.gofugyourself.com/royal-wedding-rewind-palden-thondup-namgyal-of-sikkim-marries-american-hope-cooke-09-2020", "page_content": "This is a royal wedding I was totally unfamiliar with, and I appreciate the person who suggested we rewind to this event, because it\u2019s very interesting and also educational. Picture it: The year is 1963. The place is Sikkim, which is currently one of India\u2019s states but which was once a little more complicated. Per Wiki:\n\nSikkim is a state in northeastern India. It borders Tibet in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south. Sikkim is also close to India\u2019s Siliguri Corridor near Bangladesh. Sikkim is the least populous and second smallest among the Indian states. A part of the Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity, including alpine and subtropical climates, as well as being a host to Kangchenjunga, the highest peak in India and third highest on Earth\u2026.The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century. It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal. It became a princely state of British India in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with the Union of India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among Himalayan states. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal\u2019s palace. In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum was held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like marrying a prince and then getting deposed \u2014 as the rulers at the time of the deposition of said monarchy were our bride and groom here, Palden Thondup Namgyal and Hope Cooke. She took the kids and went to New York five months into her husband\u2019s subsequent house arrest and basically never came back. They were having issues anyway, as they both had had affairs and he also seems like he was somewhat difficult \u2014 at one point, he threw her record player out a window, and he had a drinking problem. He shortly thereafter ODed on barbiturates, but did not die, and they eventually got divorced in 1980. I STRONGLY recommend you read this New York Times review of her autobiography, which I now want to read, as it is eyebrow-raisingly interesting. Hope Cooke has led a life right out of a Judith Krantz novel. (She\u2019s still alive and kicking around Brooklyn \u2014 or at least she was as of 1993, per this ALSO very interesting New York Times piece about her walking tours.) (I mean, she is definitely still alive. She simply may have moved.)\n\nThe short background: Her family was awful; Her mother died when the plane she was piloting solo crashed (perhaps intentionally) and her father subsequently bailed, so Hope and her sister and a series of extremely mean governesses lived across the hallway from Hope\u2019s (also mean!) grandparents. She and the Crown Prince met and fell in love when she went on a summer trip to India at 19. They bonded, it is implied, because they were both sort of sad souls; he was a widower whose childhood was also fraught, in no small part because, as Wiki puts it, \u201chis plans to study science at Cambridge were dashed when his elder brother, the crown prince, a member of the Indian Air Force was killed in a plane crash in 1941.\u201d (Surely their shared history of family plane crash tragedy helped bond them, if nothing else.) After the wedding, she was embraced as \u2014 as the NYT puts it \u2014 the \u201cGrace Kelly of the Himalayas\u201d until the deposition of the monarchy, at which point Newsweek allegedly switched the metaphor to Marie Antoinette. (A burn that I\u2019ve read reported in various articles in other publications but couldn\u2019t find in its original source; I do feel confident that the turn of events upending the monarchy in Sikkim was probably not wholly about her spending.)\n\nThe Washington Post, in a very interesting piece dating from around the divorce, writes of the wedding:\n\nFrom the beginning, though, it was the oddness that danced a dark shadow over her chances for happiness. Bad enough that her husband waltzed his other conquests in front of her on their wedding day, worse still was her sister-in-law, the elegantly beautiful, haughty Cocoola, who remarked on the eve of her wedding how inauspicious it would be if anything were to break, and then broke a saucer, scattering the millet seed it contained, a bad sign in itself. \u201cWorse still,\u201d Cooke writes in her autobiography, \u201cTime Change,\u201d \u201cthe more I look[ed] at the brocade pattern of my wedding dress, the more it seem[ed] that it had been stitched with the wrong side exposed. In Sikkim, a sign of death. Still, she lit the butter lamps in front of the images of Buddha and Guru Padmasambhava and offered a long white scarf to her father-in-law while 12 ambassadors, including John Kenneth Galbraith, and half the world\u2019s press looked on. The wedding festivities lasted a week.\n\nYou can see that ritual with the scarf here:\n\nThere aren\u2019t a ton of photos of this wedding beyond these two, which is a shame, as it looks like it was a very interesting ceremony.
