He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. An India Scientist and administrator he became the 11th President of India. He studied Aerospace Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). He played a pivotal organizational, technical and political rile in India's Pokhran-ll nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. APJ Abdul Kalam was perhaps the most illustrious among the alumni of the Madras Institute of Technology. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He soon moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, India\u2019s first indigenously designed and produced satellite launch vehicle. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earned him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.\n\nIn 2002 India\u2019s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India\u2019s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country. In 2007, Kalam left office and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country\u2019s first woman president.\n\nKalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country\u2019s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997). He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974."}, {"url": "https://manavata.org/kalam/", "page_content": "Career as a scientist\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nKalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam\u2019s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.\n\nKalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a \u201cfizzle\u201d and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent\u201d. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \u201cKalam-Raju Tablet\u201d."}, {"url": "https://www.ciim.in/abdul-kalam-motivational-story/", "page_content": "Abdul Kalam Motivational Story\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam usually known Dr. A.

Abdul Kalam, was the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to 2007, he is one of the few presidents who have touched the hearts thats why during his term as President, he was popularly known as the People\u2019s President. In India he is highly respected as a scientist and as an engineer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on development of ballistic missile and space rocket technology.\n\nStories of extreme hardship, braving impossible odds and innumerable sacrifices, abound in the lives of nearly 90 percent of the students in the country. But among them, some perform exceptionally well. Their academic laurels are so brilliant, that at times their CV looks intimidating. And each one acknowledges that it\u2019s the right education that made them what they are today.\n\n\u2013 APJ Life Story \u2013\n\nSeveral months back, after finishing an interview with Dr APJ Kalam, and just before leaving his Rajaji Marg residence he made me repeat these three words in a schoolteacher\u2019s tone: perseverance, hard work and patience.\n\nThis, he said, was alone the path to progress. Later, much later, I realised, that those were the very words he\u2019s lived by all through his life. They are both philosophical and practical, quite like the world he grew up in as a boy in the island town of Rameswaran, in south India.\n\nHis father, a humble boat owner, Jainulabdeen, was a devout Muslim and a close friend of the Rameswaran temple priest. Kalam was brought up in a multi-religious, tolerant society; one with a progressive outlook. His father often quoted from the Quran to make the young Kalam see the world without fear. He had seven siblings, and a doting mother who, at times, made chappatis for Kalam, while the others were given rice as Kalam\u2019s day would start at four in the morning and end at 11 pm.\n\nHis father wasn\u2019t educated, but he wanted Kalam to study. Kalam would get up at 4 am, bathe, and then go for his mathematics class, which was taught by a teacher who took only five students in the whole session; and bathing before class was a condition he had laid to all his students. After his morning class, Kalam along with his cousin Samsuddin went around town distributing the newspaper. As the town had no electricity, kerosene lamps were lit at his home between 7 pm and 9 pm. But because Kalam studied until 11, his mother would save some for him for later use.\n\nBeing a bright student, Kalam always had the support of his schoolteachers. Schwarzt High School\u2019s Iyadurai Solomon often told Kalam that if he truly, intensely desired something, he would get it. \u201cThis made me fearless,\u201d said Dr Kalam. And outside school, Ahmed Jallaluddin, who later became his brother-in-law, and Samsuddin, encouraged Kalam to appreciate nature\u2019s wonders. So at once, while growing up, he was exposed to a religious and a practical way of looking at the world.\n\nThe flight of birds had fascinated him since he was a boy, but it was years later he realised that he wanted to fly aircrafts. After finishing school, he took up Physics at St Joseph\u2019s College, Trichi, but towards the end he was dissatisfied. When he discovered aeronautical engineering, he regretted having lost three precious years. But he was glad to have discovered Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy and F Scott Fitzgerald and other English poets in his college years.\n\nAt Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Chennai, where Kalam studied aeronautics, he learnt an important lesson: the value of time. He was leading a project on system design, when one day the principal walked into the class to see his work. He appeared dissatisfied and told Kalam that he wanted the project finished in the next two days; else his scholarship aid would be withdrawn. That unsettled Kalam; years of his father\u2019s hardships would come to naught.\n\nKalam worked without food and sleep. On the last day, his professor came to check on his progress. He was impressed and said: \u201cI was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline,\u201d recounted Dr Kalam.\n\nAlthough Kalam has led several projects in his professional life, he\u2019s treated each like his last. Such was his passion. No wonder, he\u2019s always led projects. His advisor, Major General R Swaminathan explained Kalam\u2019s success as a leader. \u201cHe has this unique capability of being a boss as well as a worker. He can take on any role with ease.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr Kalam\u2019s first major project SLV 3-failed the first time he was almost shattered. Also, around this time, Kalam\u2019s childhood mentor, Jallaluddin, died. \u201cA part of me too passed away\u2026\u201d said Dr Kalam. But he never thought of quitting after SLV-3. \u201cI knew that for success, we have to work hard and persevere.\u201d And so, SLV-3 was launched again, this time with success. He drew strength from philosophy, religion and literature to tide by his professional setbacks; also a life with few companions. In time, he also learnt to deal with professional jealousy and uncooperative team members.\n\nKalam played a pivotal organisational, technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear test in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. He is chancellor of Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (Thiruvanthapuram), a professor at Anna University (Chennai) and adjunct/visiting faculty at many other academic and research institutions across India.\n\nSuccess followed Dr Kalam. Prithvi, Agni, Akash, Trishul and Nag missiles were huge successes. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan and Bharat Ratna, and then he became the President of India; one of the few presidents who have touched the hearts of so many poor children in the country. Because he also came from a poor background, he knew the power of education in changing one\u2019s future.\n\nThere is this another story that describes his phenomenal leadership qualities-\n\nThere were about 70 scientists working on a very hectic project. All of them were really frustrated due to the pressure of work and the demands of their boss but everyone was loyal to him and did not think of quitting the job.\n\nOne day, one scientist came to his boss and told him \u2013 Sir, I have promised to my children that I will take them to the exhibition going on in our township. So I want to leave the office at 5 30 pm. His boss replied \u201cOK, You\u2019re permitted to leave the office early today\u201d. The Scientist started working. He continued his work after lunch. As usual he got involved to such an extent that he looked at his watch when he felt he was close to completion.\n\nThe time was 8.30 PM. Suddenly he remembered of the promise he had given to his children.\n\nHe looked for his boss, He was not there. Having told him in the morning itself, he closed everything and left for home.\n\nDeep within himself, he was feeling guilty for having disappointed his children. He reached home. Children were not there. His wife alone was sitting in the hall and reading magazines.\n\nThe situation was explosive, any talk would boomerang on him. His wife asked him \u201cWould you like to have coffee or shall I straight away serve dinner if you are hungry.\n\nThe man replied \u201cIf you would like to have coffee, I too will have but what about Children ??\u201d .Wife replied \u201cYou don\u2019t know?? , Your manager came here at 5.15 PM and has taken the children to the exhibition \u201c.\n\nWhat had really happened was \u2026.\n\nThe boss who granted him permission was observing him working seriously at 5.00 PM. He thought to himself, this person will not leave the work, but if he has promised his children they should enjoy the visit to exhibition. So he took the lead in taking them to exhibition The boss does not have to do it every time. But once it is done, loyalty is established.\n\n\n\nThat is why all the scientists at Thumba continued to work under their boss even though the stress was tremendous.\n\nBy the way, can you hazard a guess as to who the boss was ?\n\nHe was none other than Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam ."}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@engtuto1/one-of-the-most-inspiring-persons-in-the-world-dr-a-p-j-abdul-kalam-372a63b0e3e8", "page_content": "One of the most inspiring persons in the world- Dr. A.

He is currently a visiting professor at Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Indian Institute of Management Indore, honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, a professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University (Chennai), JSS University (Mysuru) and an adjunct/visiting faculty at many other academic and research institutions across India.\n\nKalam advocated plans to develop India into a developed nation by 2020 in his book India 2020. He has received several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian honour. Kalam is known for his motivational speeches and interaction with the student community in India. He launched his mission for the youth of the nation in 2011 called the What Can I Give Movement with a central theme to defeat corruption in India.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in a Tamil Muslim family to Jainulabudeen, a boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram District, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family\u2019s income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to financially contribute to his father\u2019s income. In his school years, he had average grades, but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics.

After completing his school education at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He then moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with the lack of progress and threatened revoking his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. He worked tirelessly on his project and met the deadline, impressing the Dean who later said, \u201cI [Dean] was putting you [Kalam] under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline\u201d.

In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society \u201cto recognise excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project\u201d.\n\nFrom his early struggles to get the proper education to his contributions to India\u2019s civilian space program and military missile development efforts, Dr Kalam\u2019s life story has been nothing short of a stirring journey. Dr Kalam\u2019s work in science with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) ranging to a span of four decades played a key role in putting India on the international map. APJ Abdul Kalam also excelled as an author, inspirational speaker, scientist, researcher and much more. Mr Kalam played a pivotal organisational, technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\n\nDr APJ Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2017, from a cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. The sudden death of Dr Kalam left the world at a standstill and thousands of people attended his funeral that was held in his hometown, Rameshwaram.\n\nFondly remembered as the \u2018People\u2019s President\u2019, he was honoured with prestigious awards such as Padma Vibhushan, India\u2019s second-highest civilian award, and Bharat Ratna, the country\u2019s highest civilian award. Kalam died on 27 July 2015 at IIM Shillong while delivering a lecture to students. His last words reportedly were to his long-time aide Srijan Pal Singh \u201cFunny guy!

He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nKalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam\u2019s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.\n\nKalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a \u201cfizzle\u201d and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent\u201d. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \u201cKalam-Raju Tablet\u201d."}, {"url": "https://blablawriting.net/a-p-j-abdul-kalam-political-views-essay", "page_content": "Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (Tamil: \u0b85\u0bb5\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0baa\u0b95\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b9c\u0bc8\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc0\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b85\u0baa\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd; born 15 October 1931 in Rameshwaram, Madras Presidency, British India), usually referred to as Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam , was the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to 2007,[2] he was elected during the tenure of the National Democratic Alliance (India) coalition government, under prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[3] During his term as President, he was popularly known as the People\u2019s President.[4][5] Before his term as India\u2019s president, he worked as an aeronautical engineer with DRDO and ISRO. He is popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on development of ballistic missile and space rocket technology.[6] In India he is highly respected as a scientist and as an engineer. Kalam played a pivotal organisational, technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear test in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[7] He is chancellor of Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (Thiruvanthapuram), a professor at Anna University (Chennai) and adjunct/visiting faculty at many other academic and research institutions across India.\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn his book India 2020 APJ Abdul Kalam strongly advocates an action plan to develop India into a knowledge superpower and into a developed nation by the year 2020. He regards his work on India\u2019s nuclear weapons program as a way to assert India\u2019s place as a future superpower. It has been reported that there is considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of books authored by him [8]. Kalam continues to take an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology. He has proposed a research programme for developing bio-implants. He is a supporter of Open source software over proprietary solutions and believes that the use of open source software on a large scale will bring the benefits of information technology to more people [9]. As an aerospace engineer\n\nAfter graduating in Physics from St. Joseph\u2019s College in Tiruchirapalli, Abdul Kalam graduated with a diploma in the mid-1950s from Madras Institute of Technology specializing in Aeronautical Engineering [10]. As the Project Director, he was heavily involved in the development of India\u2019s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). As Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), he also played a major part in developing many missiles of India including Agni and Prithvi. Although the entire project has been criticised for being overrun and mismanaged[11]. He was the Chief Scientific Adviser to Prime Minister and Secretary, Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period, and have been associated with Kalam although he was not directly involved with the nuclear programme at the time. Honours\n\nOn April 29, 2009, he became the first Asian to be bestowed the Hoover Medal, America\u2019s top engineering prize, for his outstanding contribution to public service. The citation said that he is being recognised for making state-of-the-art healthcare available to the common man at affordable prices, bringing quality medical care to rural areas by establishing a link between doctors and technocrats, using spin-offs of defence technology to create state-of-the-art medical equipment and launching tele-medicine projects connecting remote rural-based hospitals to the super-specialty hospital. A pre-eminent scientist, a gifted engineer, and a true visionary, he is also a humble humanitarian in every sense of the word, it added.[12] On 13 September 2009, he was a recipient of the International von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Wings Award.[13]\n\nThe Government of India has honoured him with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honours: the Padma Bhushan in 1981; Padma Vibhushan in 1990; and the Bharat Ratna in 1997 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Indian government. Kalam is the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna before being elected to the highest office, the other two being Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Zakir Hussain. He is also the first scientist and first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhavan. After his tenure as the president he is now a visiting guest professor at JSS University, Mysore. He has agreed to deliver a minimum of four lectures every year."}, {"url": "https://www.india.com/viral/apj-abdul-kalams-death-anniversary-twitter-fondly-remembers-missile-man-through-his-famous-quotes-3728535/", "page_content": "Home\n\nViral\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s Death Anniversary: Twitter Fondly Remembers Missile Man Through His Famous Quotes\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s Death Anniversary: Twitter Fondly Remembers Missile Man Through His Famous Quotes\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam's Death Anniversary: Twitterati flood the Internet with inspirational quotes and heartfelt messages as they remember India's first 'People's President'\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam (File Photo)\n\nFour years ago, his sudden demise sent the entire nation into grief but Dr Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam continues to be an inspiration even after death not only because of his immense contribution in the field of aeronautics, which earned him the title of \u201cmissile man\u201d but also for being India\u2019s first people\u2019s president.

P. J. Abdul Kalam\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/\u02c8\u00e6bd\u0259l k\u0259\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0m/ ( listen); 15 October 1931 3 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the \u00fbrst since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]\n\nKalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the \"People's President\",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.\n\nWhile delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national- level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family\u2019s meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.[19][20][21]\n\nIn his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and\n\nA.

R. Narayanan Succeeded by Pratibha Patil Personal details Born Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 Rameswaram, Madras Presidency, British India (present-day Tamil Nadu, India)\n\nThis was my \u00fbrst stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers4Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me. A P J Abdul Kalam[25]\n\nat DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's \u00fbrst Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had \u00fbrst started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][27] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV- III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's \u00fbrst nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant , which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[28] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[28] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these\n\nInstitutions Defence Research and Development Organisation Indian Space Research Organisation\n\nKalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati\n\nclassi\u00fbed aerospace projects.[28] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[28] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scienti\u00fbc adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[29] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[29] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[29][30]\n\nKalam served as the Chief Scienti\u00fbc Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][31] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[32] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a \"\u00fbzzle\" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[33] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[34]\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \"Kalam-Raju Stent\".[35][36] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \"Kalam-Raju Tablet\".[37]\n\nKalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.[38]\n\nOn 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[41][42] After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in o\u00fdce, leaving the \u00fbeld clear.[43] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:\n\nPresidency\n\ntenure.[54][55][56] Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.[57] Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row.[57][58] Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his \u00fbve-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.[57] Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[58] While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.[58] He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.[59]\n\nIn September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.[60][61][62][63]\n\nAt the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in o\u00fdce provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[64] However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[65] He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.[66][67]\n\nNearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[68][69][70] After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature.[71][72] The BJP potentially backed his nomination, saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.[73][74] A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.[75] Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.[76] On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:\n\nMany, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only re\u00fcects\n\ntheir love and affection for me and the aspiration of the people. I am\n\nreally overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I\n\nwant to thank them for the trust they have in me.[77]\n\nAfter leaving o\u00fdce, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[78] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[79]\n\nIn May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement , with a central theme of defeating corruption.[80][81]\n\nIn 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.[82] The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.[83]\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a \u00fcight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[84] At\n\nPost-presidency\n\nDeath\n\nKalam at Bijnor a week before his death\n\nPresident's demise.[87] Prime Minister Narendra Modi said \"Kalam's death is a great loss to the scienti\u00fbc community. He took India to great heights. He showed the way.\"[98] Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, said, \"our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self- reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly bene\u00fbted from his advice as president of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations to come.\"[99] ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague \"a great personality and a gentleman\", while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as \"a global leader\" for whom \"the downtrodden and poor people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation\", adding that his death left a vacuum which none could \u00fbll.[100][101]\n\nSouth Asian leaders expressed condolences and lauded the late statesman. The Bhutanese government ordered the country's \u00fcags to \u00fcy at half-staff to mourn Kalam's death and lit 1000 butter lamps in homage. Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay expressed deep sadness, saying Kalam \"was a leader greatly admired by all people, especially the youth of India who have referred to him as the people's President\".[102] Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam as \"a rare combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia\" and termed his death an \"irreparable loss to India and beyond\". Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said \"as a nuclear scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people\". Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam \"an inspirational \u00fbgure to millions of people,\" noting that \"we have a lot to learn from his life\". Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scienti\u00fbc contributions to India: \"Nepal has lost a good friend and I have lost an honoured and ideal personality.\" The President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif also expressed their grief and condolences on his death.[103][104][105] The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, also expressed his condolences. \"Dr. Kalam was a man of \u00fbrm conviction and indomitable spirit, and I saw him as an outstanding statesman of the world. His death is an irreparable loss not only to India but to the entire world.\"[106] Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen and Vice-President Ahmed Adeeb condoled Kalam's death, with Yameen naming him as a close friend of the Maldives who would continue to be an inspiration to Indians and generations of South Asians. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had made an o\u00fdcial visit to India during Kalam's presidency, termed his demise as a great loss to all of humankind.[107] The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, expressed condolences on behalf of the Myanmar government.[108] The Dalai Lama expressed his sadness and offered condolences and prayers, calling Kalam's death \"an irreparable loss\".[109]\n\nKathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, which Kalam had visited on numerous occasions, expressed \"deepest condolences ... as a respected scientist, he played a critical role in the development of the Indian space programme. As a committed educator, he inspired millions of young people to achieve their very best. And as a devoted leader, he gained support both at home and abroad, becoming known as 'the people's President'. I join our Indo3Canadian families, friends, and neighbours in mourning the passing of this respected leader.\"[110] United States President Barack Obama extended \"deepest condolences to the people of India on the passing of former Indian President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam\", and highlighted his achievements as a scientist and as a statesman, notably his role in strengthening US3India relations and increasing space co-operation between the two nations. \"Suitably named 'the People's President', Dr. Kalam's humility and dedication to public service served as an inspiration to millions of Indians and admirers around the world.\"[111] Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed sincere condolences and conveyed his sympathy and support \"to the near and dear ones of the deceased leader, to the government, and entire people of India\". He remarked on Kalam's outstanding \"personal contribution to the social, economic, scienti\u00fbc, and technical progress of India and in ensuring its national security,\" adding that Kalam would be remembered as a \"consistent exponent of closer friendly relations between our nations, who has done a lot for cementing mutually bene\u00fbcial Russian3Indian cooperation.\"[112] Other international leaders including former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and emir of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum4also paid tribute to Kalam.[113][114] In a special gesture, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki- moon visited the Permanent Mission of India to the UN and signed a condolence book. \"The outpouring of grief around the world is a testament of the respect and inspiration he has garnered during and after his presidency. The UN joins the people of India in sending our deepest condolences for this great statesman. May he rest in peace and eternity\", Ban wrote in his message.[115]\n\nMemorial\n\nThe Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial[116] was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017.[117][118] On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the\n\nwas one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: \"For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a \u00fbghting tool.\"[134]\n\nSyncretism\n\nOne component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India.[131][132][135][136] In addition to his faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt Sanskrit,[137][138] read the Bhagavad Gita[139][140] and he was a vegetarian.[141] Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an ancient Indian string instrument),[142] and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day.[132] In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that \"during the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country\".[135] Describing Kalam as a uni\u00fber of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, \"Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity\".[132] BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was \"the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity. This was most strikingly evident in the second-to-last book he published, presciently titled Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swami \".[136]\n\nPramukh Swami as Guru\n\nKalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders to help create a more prosperous, spiritual, and uni\u00fbed India was what initially led him to meet Pramukh Swami, the Hindu guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru.[129][131] The \u00fbrst of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001 in New Delhi, during which Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity.[143] Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions. One such incident occurred the day following the terrorist attack on BAPS' Akshardham, Gandhinagar complex in September 2002; Pramukh Swami prayed for, and sprinkled holy water upon, the sites of all of the deceased, including the terrorists, demonstrating the view that all human life is sacred. Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with\n\nPramukh Swamiji .[144] Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that \"[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit. No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am placed in my \u00fbnal position in eternity.\"[131][145] Following Kalam's death a month after his \u00fbnal book was released, co-author Arun Tiwari pointed to this passage as potentially prophetic and premonitory of Kalam's death.[146]\n\nIn his book India 2020 , Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a \"knowledge superpower\" and a developed nation by the year 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.[147]\n\nI have identi\u00fbed \u00fbve areas where India has a core competence for\n\nintegrated action: (1) agriculture and food processing; (2) education\n\nand healthcare; (3) information and communication technology; (4)\n\ninfrastructure, reliable and quality electric power, surface transport\n\nand infrastructure for all parts of the country; and (5) self-reliance in\n\ncritical technologies. These \u00fbve areas are closely inter-related and if\n\nadvanced in a coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and\n\nnational security.\n\nWritings\n\nA. P. J.
