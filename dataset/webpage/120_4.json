He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of the world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, from archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources. In the last analysis he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.[citation needed]"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137311290_7", "page_content": "Adiele Afigbo, \u201cThe Warrant Chief System in Eastern Nigeria, 1900-1929\u201d (Ph.D. thesis, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria, 1964).\n\nThe University of Nigeria, Nsukka was closed between 1967 and January 1970 due to the war.\n\nFor the compelling case Adiele Afigbo made for the establishment of a Pan-Igbo Center for Igbo Studies, and for the propagation of Igbo studies, see A. E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges.

His formal education began in 1944 at Methodist Central School, Ihube where he came under the influence of remarkably dedicated teachers, the most outstanding of whom was Mr. Oji Iheukumere, the head teacher, a native of Uzuakoli, in today's Abia State who was a noted church musician and disciplinarian. At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State.[citation needed] with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F. C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and Kenneth Onwuka Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \"made in Nigeria PhD\" at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students.[citation needed] Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his PhD With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.[1]\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the PhD, Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder \u2013 from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri.[citation needed] He has also was awarded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAfigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilised reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.[citation needed]\n\nAfigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasising in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.\n\nDeath\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, 9 March 2009 after a brief illness.[2]\n\nWorks\n\nThe Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972)\n\n1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972) Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981) The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987) Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) Image of the Igbo (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885\u20131950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola\n\nNigerian History Politics and Affairs (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Igbo History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Myth, History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nOttenberg, S., Farmers and Townspeople in A Changing Nigeria (Spectrum Books Ltd, Ibadan, 2005) pp. 32\u201333, 50, 54, 84,101\n\nNorthrup, D.

It treats the internal slave trade and the war against it in this region and period as themes separate from the institution of slavery in the same area and the campaign to root it out generally known as emancipation.For this reason, and because slavery and the effort at emancipation have received more attention from scholars, this work concentrates entirely on that aspect of the slave trade and its fortunes under British colonial rule commonly known as abolition. In reconstructing the story of this important and protracted campaign, Adiele Afigbo sheds light on a dark corner of social history that has largely been neglected by historians.

Thinking of pursuing further education as law, education, business, or a master's degree? A Bachelor of Arts degree may be the perfect fit for you.\n\nYou'll gain expertise in your chosen major as well as a breadth of knowledge in many subjects \u2013 and learn to apply age-old knowledge to today\u2019s most important problems. It\u2019s also the best way to become a free thinker and life-long learner.\n\nWhat is a BA degree?\n\nA Bachelor of Arts (BA) is a university degree that focuses on subjects within the liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, languages and culture, and fine arts. A bachelor\u2019s degree is usually the first degree you would earn at university upon completing high school and normally takes three to four years to complete. Many programs give you the flexibility to choose many of your courses to suit your interests.\n\nIt's one of the most frequently-awarded degrees. Similar degrees include Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Mathematics (BMath), and Bachelor of Environmental Studies (BES).\n\nWhat do you study in a Bachelor of Arts (BA)?\n\nMany BA programs are very flexible, allowing you to study a range of subjects (such as psychology, English, or economics) or to really focus on one or two subjects. You\u2019ll normally have a \"major\" or main subject of interest. A large portion of your courses will be in that subject, but you\u2019ll have the freedom to take courses in other subjects that help you build important skills like thinking critically and conducting research.\n\nIf you have several subjects you\u2019re passionate about, many programs allow you to choose two majors (a double major) and/or a minor \u2013 a subject requiring less courses than a major that still allows you to demonstrate a strong level of knowledge in that subject. If it sounds overwhelming, don't worry! You'll have an advisor who can help you select your courses and any minors or specializations you'd like to pursue.\n\nMany BA programs are very flexible, allowing you to study a range of subjects or to really focus on one or two subjects.\n\nWhat majors are in a Bachelor of Arts?\n\nAt Waterloo, most Arts majors are offered by the Faculty of Arts, but the Faculty of Health also offers three BA degrees.\n\nMajors can range from anthropology to women\u2019s studies, depending upon the university. You can view many other BA programs by visiting the Ontario Universities Info website.\n\nWhat can you do with a Bachelor of Arts degree?\n\nWith an Arts degree, you\u2019ll have a ticket into careers in business, theatre, education, recreation, tech, writing, history, design, and almost anything you can think of.\n\nArts graduates have become archeologists, interior designers, financial planners, and writers. They\u2019re CEOs, animation artists, political leaders, teachers, marketing directors, translators, Academy Award winners, music therapists, child care workers, intelligence officers, lawyers, nurses, poets, and stage managers. They\u2019ve gone on to do great things, both big and small, and so can you.\n\nThrough Waterloo\u2019s co-op program, you can explore potential jobs and gain experience. You can also take your degree onwards to law, med school, an MBA, or graduate school. You\u2019ve got the ticket to ride. Where will you go?\n\nI chose Arts because I loved the flexibility and the variety it would give me. I appreciated being able to start as an undeclared major in my first year so I could figure out what subjects I liked before I had to choose a major. In addition, I was able to do co-op and get hands-on experience in the workplace. Savannah, third-year Arts student\n\nCommon questions\n\nHow long is a BA program? It normally takes three or four years to complete a BA degree as a full-time student. Many universities also offer a part-time degree. How long it takes to complete a part-time degree depends on how many courses you take each term.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites? For many BA programs, you'll need a Grade 12 English or equivalent. However, admission requirements vary by program and by university and for more specialized programs, you'll need high school courses in other subjects. View Waterloo's admission requirements.\n\nWhat does Bachelor of Arts (Honours) mean? An honours degree, which normally takes four years to complete, requires more courses and a higher average than a general degree, which can be three or four years in length. At some universities, students \"graduate with honours,\" meaning they graduate with an impressively high grade point average.\n\nWhat is the abbreviation for an honours Bachelor of Arts? The common abbreviations are BA or HBA.\n\nWhat financial aid is available? If you're starting first year, you'll be eligible for a number of entrance scholarships. Once you're here, there are many upper-year scholarships, bursaries, and awards you can apply for.\n\nHow much does a BA cost?
