Turkish Football Championship started in 1924 and was the first national championship in Turkish football, although not played as an all-play-all tournament and not organized by Turkish Football Federation (TFF).\n\n\n\nIn 1937, the first national league was established named National Division. The inaugural season included eight teams and was won by Fenerbah\u00e7e. Eleventh editions of National Division, but is hasn't got the same official status as Turkish S\u00fcper Lig (formerly Milli Lig) because it wasn't accepted by TFF.\n\n\n\nThe country got its first TFF organized nation-wide championship in 1959, under the name \u201cMilli Lig\u201d. Only three cities were represented in the 1959 edition, Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, but it is considered the first national league season in Turkey, albeit a short one, one that started and ended in the same year, for the first and the last time.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e were the inaugural season's champions, even though Be\u015fikta\u015f consider themselves Turkey's first champions, for winning back-to-back titles in the so-called \u201cPresident's Cup\u201d that was organized the two seasons before \u201cMilli Lig\u201d was established, a short-lived competition that was used to decide the team that would represent Turkey in UEFA's European Cup.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e, Be\u015fikta\u015f, and of course Galatasaray, have been the league's dominant forces, backed by millions of fans and occasionally strong political figures, or/and powerful businessmen/companies. Even today, it looks hard to believe that a team outside Istanbul, Trabzonspor, managed to win the title an incredible six times in ten years, from the mid seventies to the mid eighties. Less, but still impressive, is the fact that Bursaspor as well managed to break the Istanbul powerhouses' monopoly in 2010.\n\nGiven how dominant the \u201cBig Three\u201d from Istanbul have been since the inaugural season of the league, it's no wonder that only five clubs have won the title.\n\nOne thing that has changed though since the late fifties, is how representative of the whole country the league has become. From three cities in 1959, the S\u00fcper Lig (called like that since the 2001-02 season) has evolved to feature clubs from many more cities, usually 12 or 13, with Istanbul, the country's by far most populous city, still home to almost half a dozen clubs every season.\n\nMoreover, it's Istanbul's \u201cBig Three\u201d the only clubs that have never missed a season in the top flight, competing for the title in 1959 and every year since then.\n\nRecords and titles-aside, the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig stands out for another reason; the first years of the 21st century some clubs realized that investing in a new, modern, football-specific stadium was the way to go. Fast forward to these days, most clubs competing in the top flight, but also several smaller ones playing in the second category, can proud themselves of having truly impressive homes, with new ones getting delivered year in year out, putting new Turkish cities on the football map.\n\nLeague system\n\nS\u00fcper Lig is the top level of the Turkish football league system. The second division is since 2001 known as TFF 1. Lig (former T\u00fcrkiye \u0130kinci Futbol Ligi; in English: Turkish Second Football League). An overview of the current national league system is presented in table 1.\n\nTable 1. Turkish football tiers Club Tier S\u00fcper Lig 1 TFF 1. Lig 2 TFF 2. Lig 3 TFF 3.

He scored 249 goals in 489 appearances, most of those playing for Galatasaray, but also Sakaryaspor and Bursaspor, in his late teens and early twenties, before moving to \u201cGalata\u201d in 1992, aged 21.\n\n\u015e\u00fck\u00fcr broke Tanju \u00c7olak's record of 240 goals in 2007. It's interesting to note though that \u00c7olak scored his 240 goals in just 282 matches, and he is the only Turkish player to have won the \u201cGolden Boot\u201d, for his 39-goal tally in 1987-88. \u201cBay Gol\u201d, \u201cMr Goal\u201d, as he was called during his time at Samsunspor, Galatasaray and Fenerbah\u00e7e, was obliged to retire aged just 31, in 1994, after only one season at Istanbulspor. Hard as it may be to believe, he was sent to prison for smuggling a luxury car into the country.\n\nPlayers with most appearances\n\n\u015e\u00fck\u00fcr is also third in league appearances, 489, five less than R\u0131za \u00c7al\u0131mbay. Both of them are looking at O\u011fuz \u00c7etin's back in the list. Having worn the jersey of Sakaryaspor and Fenerbah\u00e7e for most of his 19-year career, \u00c7etin retired in 2000, having played in 503 games.\n\nBiggest transfers\n\nThe biggest transfers with Turkish clubs have historically concerned departing player bought by European top clubs. Nevertheless, expensive transfer has also been done in the opposite direction. (Million is abbreviated by M.)\n\nTable 5. Most expensive player transfers year by year with Turkish clubs involved.

In addition, the fee for great part of all transfers remains undisclosed, which make a list like this most likely incomplete.\n\nBy Dimitris Basias\n\nS\u00fcper Lig timeline 1923 The Turkish Football Federation (T\u00fcrkiye Futbol Federasyonu; TFF) is founded.\n\n1937 National Division (predecessor to Milli Lig) is established.\n\n1959 Milli Lig (predecessor to S\u00fcper Lig) is established.\n\n2001 The league is renamed as S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00fcper_Lig\n\nhttps://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00fcper_Lig\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakan_\u015e\u00fck\u00fcr\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O\u011fuz_\u00c7etin\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanju_\u00c7olak\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_football_stadiums_in_Turkey\n\nhttps://www.transfermarkt.com/super-lig/transferrekorde/wettbewerb/TR1/plus\n\nhttp://www.tff.org/Default.aspx?pageID=487"}, {"url": "https://theanalyst.com/2022/02/big-three-struggling-in-super-lig/", "page_content": "Turkish S\u00fcper Lig: The Big Three\u2019s Big Fail\n\nLike the majority of Europe, Turkey\u2019s footballing story began in the late 19th century, but the official start of a professional league wasn\u2019t until 1959. Across the 63 seasons prior to 2021-22, there have only ever been six winners of the Turkish top-flight, while the opening 17 seasons only saw three winners of the competition: Fenerbah\u00e7e (8), Galatasaray (6) and Be\u015fikta\u015f (3).\n\nIt was not until 1974-75 that Trabzonspor entered the Turkish top-flight, but they managed to win their first title in the following season to become Turkey\u2019s fourth top-tier league winners. Following their maiden title, they went on to win five more in the 1970s and 80s with their last coming in 1983-84. It then took another 25 seasons for a new league title-winner in Turkey, with Bursaspor\u2019s 2009-10 victory, before the sixth different team to win the league were \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir in 2019-20.\n\n57 of the 63 Turkish S\u00fcper Lig champions have been one of the \u2018big three\u2019 (90%), with Galatasaray leading the way (22 titles), followed by Fenerbah\u00e7e (19) and Be\u015fikta\u015f (16).\n\nThis introduction should give you enough of an overview to understand the significance of Turkey\u2019s three biggest clubs, but in the case of 2021-22, none of those three are close to challenging for the title. Trabzonspor lead the way with a nine-point lead over second place Konyaspor, but the \u2018big three\u2019 all fall outside of the European qualification spots as it stands \u2013 the most worrying of those is 15th place Galatasaray, who find themselves 27 points off the top of the table.\n\nBased on three points for a win, Trabszonspor\u2019s current tally of 54 points from 23 games is their second-best performance at this season of a season, only falling short of their 1995-96 campaign (57 points) \u2013 a season that they eventually missed out on the title to Fenerbah\u00e7e by only two points.\n\nThis season, they took over the lead at the top of the table on Matchday nine and haven\u2019t moved since \u2013 whilst there\u2019s undoubtedly been a big slump by the three major clubs in Turkey, Trabzonspor\u2019s feats so far shouldn\u2019t be underplayed.\n\nPerformance on the pitch from attacking trio Anthony Nwakaeme (six goals, seven assists), Anastasios Bakasetas (eight goals, four assists) and Andreas Cornelius (11 goals, one assist) have been key to their title push, while they\u2019ve even been able to add Edin Vi\u0161\u0107a to their ranks in January following his five goals and eight assists for \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir so far in 2021-22.\n\nAt the moment, they look unstoppable, but the lack of challenge from the traditional \u2018big three\u2019 has aided this. Reigning champions Be\u015fikta\u015f and Galatasaray \u2013 who only lost out last season on goal difference to Be\u015fikta\u015f, have both been well below-par, while Fenerbah\u00e7e look set to complete a record eighth successive season without a league title.\n\nHow Far Have They Fallen?\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f\u2019s 36-point tally from 27 games so far this season is not one of the worst performances in club\u2019s history, but it is their lowest since 2010-11 at this stage of the campaign (35 points). Back in that campaign 11 years ago, they scored more often (36-35) and conceded less frequently, however (27-31).\n\nGalatasaray\u2019s situation is even more dire. This season has been their worst-ever in the three points for a win era, while their minus five goal difference is the second worst in club history.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s situation is similar to Be\u015fikta\u015f\u2019s, in that it\u2019s not their worst season, but far enough away from being one of their best. Only in nine previous seasons have they had 37 points or fewer after 23 games (based on three points for a win).\n\nAs a collective unit, the \u2018big three\u2019 have already lost 23 matches in 2021-22, equalling the competition record after 23 matchdays of a S\u00fcper Lig season from 2010-11. The record number of defeats by these clubs in an entire top-flight season stands at 30 \u2013 set in both 2010-11 and 1980-81, and that tally is now only seven away this season.\n\nAfter the broadcast fees generated by the league soared and the number of foreign players allowed increased, the competitive level of the Anatolian clubs has also been raised (all clubs except these three are often referred to as \u201cAnatolian clubs\u201d). The away performances of Be\u015fikta\u015f, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Galatasaray are also not like what they used to be.\n\n*All seasons based on three points for a win.\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Galatasaray, never had a lower points per game ratio outside Istanbul, than this season (1.04) in the three points per game era.\n\nThe current campaign has also witnessed another negative record for the \u2018big three\u2019, as they have conceded a combined 92 goals after 23 games each, something that has never happened before and eclipses the previous high of 86 in 2018-19.\n\nThis overall terrible performance by the \u2018big three\u2019 has led to them all sacking their managers during the season. Even by their well-known impatience with managers, this is a rare occurrence \u2013 this is only the second time that all three have changed their manager within the same season after 1975-76. Trabzonspor won the league title that season, which is more than a coincidence.\n\nThe Tinkermen\n\nAll three clubs have been hindered by a lack of consistency on the pitch. The \u2018big three\u2019 are the only three clubs to have made over 80 changes to their starting XI across the Turkish top-flight this season.\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e have made 86 changes across 23 matches \u2013 an average of nearly four per game (3.9) and just 10 fewer than they made in the whole of last season (96), while Besiktas (83 changes) and Galatasaray (81) follow close behind. It is Galatasaray that have used the most players of the \u2018big three\u2019 with 31 different players making a S\u00fcper Lig appearance in 2021-22 \u2013 a tally that only Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck (34) can beat.\n\nA Lack of Ability, or Luck?\n\nGalatasaray\u2019s awful season can be partly explained by their under-performance both in attack and defence. They have scored 28 goals from an xG of 39.8 and have conceded 33 goals from an xG conceded of 31 \u2013 and are the worst team in both categories for xG under-performance across the entire S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nOnly Alanyaspor (42.2 xG) have accumulated better goalscoring chances this season in the S\u00fcper Lig than Galatasaray, with their xG total of 39.8 above that of league-leaders Trabzonspor (38.5). The worrying issue for the 22-time Turkish champions is that their shot conversion rate (8%) has fallen below 11% for the first time in recorded history since detailed Opta analysis began on the league in 2014-15.\n\nWhilst their poor performance in front of goal is one major issue, losing points from leading positions is another. Galatasaray have dropped a league-high 21 points from winning in the S\u00fcper Lig this season so far \u2013 one more than Kayserispor (20) and only one fewer than the top three sides combined, with Trabzonspor, Alanyaspor and Konyaspor dropping just 22 between them.\n\nOf these 21 points lost, nine have come in their last three matches, with all three seeing Galatasaray lose from a winning position. In fact, across the whole 2021-22 season so far, they have spent a higher proportion of ball-in-play time in a winning position (22%) than they have a losing one (21%).\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s record from winning positions isn\u2019t much better \u2013 losing 14 points from leads themselves. Their relationship with goal scoring has been quite a story for too long now.\n\nSince 2014-15, only seven players have exceeded 10 goals in a league season for the club, with just two of those \u2013 Robin van Persie (16) in 2015-16 and Vedat Muriqi (15) in 2019-20 scoring at least 15 goals in a single campaign.\n\nFinishing chances has been a longer-term issue for the club in the league, with this their fourth successive season in which they have scored fewer non-penalty goals than their non-penalty expected goals total suggests they should have.\n\nSince 2018-19, Fenerbah\u00e7e have underperformed their non-penalty xG by an astonishing 33.7, scoring 184 goals (excluding penalties) from shots totalling 217.7 xG. This season\u2019s performance is, however, is slightly better than the previous three seasons (-2.2). Considering this difference, this can still go either way with 15 more games to play this season.\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f\u2019s xG performance, meanwhile, is causing them problems in front of their own goal more than it is in front of the opposition\u2019s.\n\nDespite having faced just 225 non-penalty shots in the league this season \u2013 the second-lowest tally \u2013 Be\u015fikta\u015f have conceded 28 times excluding penalty goals, a tally that is double that of league-leaders Trabzonspor.\n\nOpposition sides have converted a league-high 12.4% of their non-penalty shots against the reigning champions, which is exactly on the expected conversion rate of these chances based on the average xG of each shot faced (0.124). Only Hatayspor (0.13) and Altay (0.13) have given their opponents better quality non-penalty shots this season on average.\n\nThe Ending?\n\nSo, it looks as if Trabzonspor will end their 38-year wait for a top-flight Turkish title, at the end of this season, with their head coach Abdullah Avc\u0131 previously coming so close with Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir on more than one occasion.\n\nFor now, the battle the \u2018big three\u2019 face is one for European football in 2022-23, a battle that Galatasaray look to have already lost. Their focus is now more on surviving another season in the top-flight, with just a three-point cushion between them and 17th place Antalyaspor \u2013 a team that they have to face away on the final day of the season.\n\nLessons from 2021-22 need to be learnt by all three clubs, as unless they are, Trabzonspor could be building a squad to dominate for longer than just this season.\n\nEnjoy this?

Be\u015fikta\u015f, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Galatasaray all changed their managers within the same season for just the second top-flight season ever \u2013 both of those seeing Trabzonspor collect the title. Be\u015fikta\u015f finished the season out of top five for the first time since 1997-98, Galatasaray\u2019s 13th place finish is an all-time low and Fenerbah\u00e7e run without a title now stands at eight seasons.\n\nOur Turkish data experts at OptaCan look back at the season with their S\u00fcper Lig team of 2021-22.\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nU\u011furcan \u00c7ak\u0131r \u2013 Trabzonspor\n\nU\u011furcan \u00c7ak\u0131r was a busy man at Euro 2020 as Turkey exited the tournament in the group stage. The Turkish number one goalkeeper was the busiest at the tournament with a shot on target faced every 10 minutes on average. Despite his nation\u2019s poor performance at the tournament, he could hold his head high with his personal contribution, and it set him up for a successful 2021-22 domestic club campaign.\n\n\n\nTrabzonspor conceded 36 goals in the 2021/22 S\u00fcper Lig season, the joint-lowest number alongside \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir. \u00c7ak\u0131r was the biggest factor in this achievement, saving a league-high 79% of shots \u2013 this despite being one of the most unprotected in the competition as one of only six goalkeepers in the league to face at least 155 shots on target. Across goalkeepers in the top five European leagues in 2021-22, only Milan\u2019s Mike Maignan posted a higher saves to shots on target ratio of all 122 \u2018keepers to face at least 50 shots on target.\n\nThe 26-year-old made many critical saves throughout the season, but arguably the most important came in the Antalyaspor match where Trabzonspor declared their seventh championship. U\u011furcan, who prevented his team from falling behind with the penalty kick he saved from Fredy Ribeiro, took a giant step toward Trabzonspor\u2019s long awaited championship. Overall, he saved three penalties \u2013 only Okan Kocuk (four) made more \u2013 and kept 10 clean sheets.\n\nAcross the season, his saves prevented 11 goals based on Opta\u2019s expected goals on target (xGOT) model, with the quality of the shots on target faced expecting to produce 43 goals compared to the 32 actually conceded by \u00c7ak\u0131r (excluding own goals).\n\nRight-Back\n\nOnur Bulut \u2013 Kayserispor\n\nDespite having had a rough performance in the league throughout the season and being three places above the relegation zone, Kayserispor managed to reach the finals of the Turkish Cup and arguably exceeded expectations for the campaign overall. One of their standout players was defender Onur Bulut.\n\nHe was an attacking force from right-back, with his eight assists being his highest tally across his three professional seasons in the Turkish top-flight. All eight came from open play, while he also had the most assists via open play crosses in the S\u00fcper Lig in 2021-22 (6).\n\nOf full-backs in the S\u00fcper Lig last season, only Juanfran (404) had more ball carries than Bulut (403), with the Kayserispor right-back carrying the ball 4.7km \u2013 only three full-backs carried it further. However, no defender created as many chances (23) or assisted as many goals (7) as he did from ball carries, clearly showing the dynamism he brought to Kayserispor\u2019s attack.\n\nThis impressive performance by him will naturally attract the attention of the other teams. We do not know what the future holds for Bulut, who has a contract with Kayserispor until the end of 2023, but it\u2019s obvious that the 28-year-old full-back has the skills to attract possible suitors.\n\nCentre-Back\n\nKim Min-Jae \u2013 Fenerbah\u00e7e\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s 2021-22 S\u00fcper Lig season was a campaign of two halves. After struggling in the first half of the season, the Istanbul team gained significant momentum in the second half of the campaign with the hiring of Ismail Kartal, eventually rising to second place. Throughout the season of ups and downs, Kim Min-Jae was the only constant.\n\nThe South Korean joined the club at the start of 2021-22, with this being his first season in European club football. There were fears that he might take time to adapt, but the 25-year-old was quick to allay those fears with strong performances right from the start of his S\u00fcper Lig career.\n\nHis duel success rate of 61.5% was well above the S\u00fcper Lig average for a defender in 2021-22 (55.4%), as was his aerial duel success ratio (62.4% vs. 57.0%), while his passing accuracy of 89% was also above the league average of 81.5% despite being only one of six defenders to play at least 2,000 minutes and average at least 60 passes per 90 minutes (61.3).\n\nThe 26-year-old defender, who will represent South Korea in the 2022 World Cup, will pique the interest of major clubs if he maintains his form in the tournament. This investment aroused some doubts when Fenerbah\u00e7e recruited a player who had no experience in European football at the beginning of the year. However, it became clear after only one season that club will receive the return on this investment, either on the field or financially.\n\nCentre-Back\n\nAbd\u00fclkerim Bardak\u00e7\u0131 \u2013 Konyaspor\n\nKonyaspor enjoyed a great season in the 2021-22 S\u00fcper Lig, with a third-place finish to equal their previous best position in 2015-16. Much of their success came from defensive solidarity, with Abd\u00fclkerim Bardak\u00e7\u0131 a key reason for them competing in European competition for the first time since 2017-18, next season.\n\nThey finished the season with a league-high 13 clean sheets, while only four clubs allowed their opponents a higher expected goals total than Konyaspor in 2021-22 (48.7).\n\nAbd\u00fclkerim Bardak\u00e7\u0131 finished the season as the defender with the most recoveries in the S\u00fcper Lig (220), while the 27-year-old centre-back was also the Konyaspor player with the most clearances (116), aerial duels won (80), and only trailed Amir Hadziahmetovic (208) in total duels won (186) across the whole league.\n\nOne of his most important contributions to the side is his ability to bring the ball out from defence. Of defenders to play at least 1,500 minutes in the 2021-22 S\u00fcper Lig, Bardak\u00e7\u0131 was one of only six players to average at least 120m of progressive carrying per 90 minutes (124.4m), while his average carry distance of 12.5m was more than any of those other five.\n\nBardak\u00e7\u0131 was also a huge threat going forward at set plays. The centre-back scored four headed goals \u2013 only four players in the league scored more \u2013 while he also featured in the top four players for headed shots (25) and headed shots on target (10). Overall, no player attempted more shots from set-piece situations (excluding penalties) than the Konyaspor defender (12).\n\nAfter an impressive performance in the 2021-22 season, he\u2019ll showcase his talents on the European stage next season. If he can keep up the performance levels of last season, the future will be very bright for both him and his team.\n\nLeft-Back\n\nTayfur Bing\u00f6l \u2013 Alanyaspor\n\nOnly top two clubs Fenerbah\u00e7e (73) and Trabzonspor (69) scored more goals than Alanyaspor (67) in the 2021-22 S\u00fcper Lig. One of the most important contributors to their goal tally was left-back Tayfur Bing\u00f6l, who played the part of Swiss-army-knife in the side across the campaign, filling in across various positions on the pitch for his club.\n\nWith 13 goal involvements (three goals, 10 assists), Bing\u00f6l had the best season of his career so far. That tally also meant that he was the third most involved in goals on his team, after only Efecan Karaca (12 goals, five assists) and Emre Akbaba (10 goals, four assists). Not bad for a full-back.\n\nNine of his 10 assists came from open play \u2013 only four players across the competition had more, none of them defenders.\n\nUnder the tutelage of exciting young coach Francesco Farioli, the full-back assisted more goals from open play than any other player after his coach\u2019s arrival on December 31 2021 (eight).\n\nAlanyaspor and Bing\u00f6l could be going places in 2022-23. They were unlucky last season to finish a point outside the European qualification spots, but they look set to be a force to be reckoned with next term.\n\nRight Midfield\n\nEdin Visca \u2013 Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir/Trabzonspor\n\nEdin Visca, who first stepped into the S\u00fcper Lig in the 2011-12 season with Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, has been one of the most eye-catching names in the league for both his stability and his effectiveness on the pitch during the 10 years in the competition.\n\nIn recent seasons, Visca has been one of the highest performing players in the S\u00fcper Lig. This title win with Trabzonspor was his second in the Turkish top-flight after a 2019-20 victory with \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehirm while he won the S\u00fcper Lig Player of the Season award in 2019 and finished the top assister in three consecutive seasons (2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20). He nearly added 2021-22 to that list with 12 assists, but he was beaten to the assist-leader title by Mat\u00edas Vargas (13).\n\nVisca did lead the league rankings for open play chances created (83) and total chances created (111), while he finished 19 ahead of Rachid Ghezzai in the league ranking of open play chances and secondary chances created, combined (113).\n\nIn the short time he spent in the Trabzonspor jersey, he also managed to be a key part of moments that will be remembered for many years. The champions defeated Galatasaray after coming from behind in January (2-1), and Visca became the hero of one of the signature moments of the season, thanks to his late winning goal.\n\nIn the possible scenario where Anthony Nwakaeme leaves Trabzonspor this summer, Visca will likely become the player that manager Abdullah Avc\u0131 will have to trust the most.\n\nCentre Midfield\n\nLucas Biglia \u2013 Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck\n\nFatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck was promoted to the S\u00fcper Lig in the 2020-21 season and performed above expectations, but coach Francesco Farioli was dismissed midway through December and 17 matches into the season.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Volkan Demirel as coach they were forced to switch their playing style quite dramatically \u2013 one of the players to make sure that transition was smooth was central midfielder Lucas Biglia.\n\nBiglia didn\u2019t have much of an impact in terms of scoring contribution (one goal, four assists) across his 33 appearances, but he did the dirty work that enabled his side to perform.\n\nOnly Obinna Nwobodo (111) made more tackles than Biglia (100), while the experienced Argentine won an above league average 57% of duels. In addition to this, across the defensive and middle thirds of the pitch combined, the 36-year-old won possession from opponents a league-high 284 times.\n\nThe Istanbul club will want to start a new chapter in 2022-23 season however, but it will not be an easy task to fill the absence of Biglia, whose contract expired this summer.\n\nCentre Midfield\n\nAlexandru Maxim \u2013 Gaziantep FK\n\nThe 2021-22 season was a tough one to evaluate for Gaziantep FK. They won the third-most points in home games (40), but their away form was terrible \u2013 they collected just six points in 19 away games, which was the lowest tally in the S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, one player that managed to stay at a consistent level throughout the season was their midfielder, Alexandru Maxim.\n\nWith 14 goals, he was the highest scoring midfielder in the league across 2021-22, while only three players had more goal involvements in the S\u00fcper Lig than he did (21 \u2013 14 goals, seven assists). True, eight of his goals were from the penalty spot \u2013 the most in the competition \u2013 but he was consistent in these situations with a 100% success rate. The last player to attempt at least eight penalties and score every one of them in a S\u00fcper Lig season was Maxim himself in 2020-21 (8/8).\n\nHowever, his offensive production is not limited to set pieces. Among the midfielders, he was the player with the second most successful take-ons in the opposition half (67) behind only Fousseni Diabate (69), while he was also the player to create the most chances after successful take-ons (6).\n\nOverall, his 90 chances created in 2021-22 was the third most in the S\u00fcper Lig behind only Edin Visca (111) and Mat\u00edas Vargas (97), while his passes had an expected assists total of 8.3 \u2013 the fourth-most in the competition. All this for a player in the heart of midfield for the 15th best team in the league in 2021-22.\n\nLeft Midfield\n\nAnthony Nwakaeme \u2013 Trabzonspor\n\nTrabzonspor\u2019s first S\u00fcper Lig title in 38 years came thanks to some exceptional performances from standout players \u2013 winger Anthony Nwakaeme was undoubtedly one of those.\n\nHe was the only player to post double figures for both goals (13) and assists (10) \u2013 only the second time he\u2019s managed this in Turkey, after 2018-19 \u2013 while his 23 goal involvements were only exceeded by Umut Bozok (27).\n\nEven the underlying numbers stress how well his season went. No player in the 2021-22 season had a higher non-penalty expected goals and expected assists total combined (18.8) than Nwakaeme, showing how important his attacking influence was in Trabzonspor\u2019s title win.\n\nMuch of his threat came from his direct running at opponents, with a league-high six assists and 27 of chances created coming following ball carries, while overall he was involved in 47 shots following carries (20 shots attempted).\n\nAcross the season, he was involved in 162 open play sequences leading to a shot \u2013 only three players managed to be more crucial to their side, none at Trabzonspor: Kerem Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu (172), Haris Hajradinovic (167) and Efecan Karaca (167). Of those 162, 72 saw him attempt the shot (44.4%), while he was the creator of the shot on 50 occasions and involved in the build-up in the other 40.\n\nIt is unclear which team he will play for next year, whose contract with Trabzonspor has expired. However, it is a fact that the 33-year-old player managed to leave an indelible mark on the fans of Trabzonspor for many years, regardless of his next stop.\n\nStriker\n\nUmut Bozok \u2013 Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa\n\nIn the 17th week of the 2021-22 S\u00fcper Lig, Kasmpa\u015fa were at the bottom of the league standings. Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa board, who wanted to stop the rot, brought in Sami U\u011furlu as coach \u2013 they didn\u2019t look back.\n\nFollowing his appointment, only Fenerbah\u00e7e (46) won more points in the league, while they collected the same tally as champions Trabzonspor (42). The biggest reason for this was the performance of star striker Umut Bozok, who finished the season as the S\u00fcper Lig top scorer with 20 goals.\n\nAfter a frustrating two-year spell at French side Lorient, Bozok made the loan move to Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa in July 2021. Although born in France, the striker is of Turkish descent \u2013 despite this, 2021-22 was his first-ever season in Turkey\u2026and what a season.\n\nScoring in a league-high 18 different matches, not only was he named Gol Kral\u0131 (the Turkish league top scorer), but he also led the league in goal involvements (27) with an additional seven assists.\n\nHe was lethal in front of goal, converting 24.7% of shots \u2013 the highest ratio of players with 60 or more shots, while he outperformed his expected goals total by just over four goals.\n\nKas\u0131mpa\u015fa picked up the option of Umut Bozok\u2019s contract, but it\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019ll play next season. They\u2019ll be hoping to keep him for 2022-23, as it became clear how effective a weapon he could be in the S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nStriker\n\nAndreas Cornelius \u2013 Trabzonspor\n\nTrabzonspor have enjoyed a successful relationship with Scandinavian strikers in recent seasons. 2019-20 saw Norwegian striker Alexander S\u00f8rloth top the league scoring charts with 24 goals and now they\u2019ve got another hotshot from the region.\n\n2021-22 saw Danish forward Andreas Cornelius arrive at the club following three years of loan deals in Bordeaux (2018-19) and at Parma (2019-20 and 2020-21). The move paid dividends for Trabzonspor, as his 15 goals helped them to win the title. That tally of 17 across all competitions was his highest in a season since scoring 21 with Copenhagen in 2016-17.\n\nNone of his 15 goals came from the penalty spot \u2013 only Ayoub El Kaabi (17) scored more non-penalty goals in the S\u00fcper Lig across 2021-22. Since 2007-08, when Opta started detailed analysis of the league, no other Trabzonspor player has scored more goals without scoring a penalty in a single season (level with G\u00f6khan \u00dcnal in 2008-09).\n\nIt was also only El Kaabi (16) who scored more goals from inside the box than Cornelius (15) in 2021-22, while of players to play 1,500 minutes or more, only Serdar Dursun (0.68) and Aleksandar Pesic (0.56) managed a higher non-penalty xG/90 than the Dane (0.54). He also got in great positions \u2013 of the 39 players to attempt 50 or more non-penalty shots, only two had a higher xG per shot average than Cornelius (0.19) \u2013 Pesic (0.21) and Stefano Okaka (0.21).\n\nCoach\n\nAbdullah Avc\u0131 \u2013 Trabzonspor\n\nAbdullah Avc\u0131 is one of the most successful coaches in the S\u00fcper Lig in recent years. Between 2015 and 2019, he achieved five successive top five finishes in the competition, but the prestigious S\u00fcper Lig title kept evading him.\n\nThe experienced manager took over Trabzonspor in the middle of the 2020-21 season, and he sent a clear message to his opponents while entering the new 2021/22 campaign with his successful performance as coach, losing just three of their 32 matches (W18 D11). Starting last season in dominant fashion helped the cause, with Trabzonspor not losing across their opening 15 matches and sitting at the top of the league (W12 D3).\n\nIn a season where he secured his first top-flight title as a coach, Avc\u0131 the fourth quickest man to reach 200 wins in the competition, doing so behind only the legendary trio of Fatih Terim (336) Mustafa Denizli (361), \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f (380). Overall, he\u2019s now won 41 of his 70 league games in charge of Trabzonspor, with his 59%-win ratio behind only \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f (60%) of people to have coached the club for 25 or more games in the competition.\n\nTrabzonspor will enter the next season as one of the biggest contenders for the championship. Avc\u0131 will hope to become just the fifth Turkish coach in S\u00fcper Lig history to win back-to-back championships after Fatih Terim, \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f, Ahmet Suat Yaz\u0131c\u0131, and G\u00fcnd\u00fcz K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7. Considering the situation that Trabzonspor are in, it seems that this is not a distant possibility.\n\nEnjoy this?

It is organized by the Turkish Football Federation and is contested by 18 teams each season. The league has been in operation since 1959, and its current format was established in the 1959-1960 season. The team that finishes at the top of the league table at the end of the season is declared the champion. The bottom three teams are relegated to the TFF First League, which is the second tier of Turkish football.\n\nHistory\n\nThe S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, was first established in 1959 and is the top professional football league in Turkey. The league was founded after the dissolution of the National Division, which was the top level of football in the country prior to the establishment of the S\u00fcper Lig. The inaugural season of the league featured 16 teams and was contested in a round-robin format, with Galatasaray winning the first championship.\n\nThe league has undergone several format changes over the years. In the early years, it featured as few as 14 teams and as many as 18. In the 1980s, the league adopted a playoff format, which was in place until the 1989-1990 season. In the 1990s, the league returned to a round-robin format. Since the 1999-2000 season, the league has featured 18 teams.\n\nThe league has also undergone sponsorship changes over the years. The league has been known by different names, including the Milli Lig (National League), the T\u00fcrkiye Profesyonel 1. Futbol Ligi (Turkish Professional Football League 1), and the PTT 1. Lig (PTT First League). The league is currently known as the S\u00fcper Lig, which has been its name since the 2005-2006 season.\n\nThe league has seen many legendary Turkish football club and players, Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas, Trabzonspor among the most successful teams, who have won the majority of the championships.\n\nCompetition format\n\nThe S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, is a professional football league that is contested by 18 teams each season. The league operates on a system of promotion and relegation, with the top three teams at the end of the season being promoted to the S\u00fcper Lig, and the bottom three teams being relegated to the TFF First League.\n\nThe league follows a double round-robin format, which means that each team plays every other team in the league twice, once at home and once away. The team that finishes at the top of the league table at the end of the season is declared the champion.\n\nThe teams are ranked in the league table based on the following criteria:\n\nTotal number of points Goal difference Number of goals scored Head-to-head results between tied teams Number of wins Number of away wins Number of away goals Fair play\n\nIf at the end of the season, two or more teams are tied on points, the teams will be separated based on the criteria listed above. If the teams are still tied, a playoff will be held to determine the final standings.\n\nThe champion team of the league earns the right to represent Turkey in the UEFA Champions League the next season and the runner-up will be in the UEFA Europa League. The last three teams in the league table will be relegated to the TFF First League, and will be replaced by the top three teams from that league.\n\nUEFA ranking\n\nThe UEFA ranking is a ranking system for football clubs that is used by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to determine the seedings for the draw for various competitions, such as the Champions League and Europa League. The ranking takes into account the results of teams in UEFA competitions over a five-year period.\n\nThe ranking is determined by a points system, with teams earning points for their results in various competitions. The Champions League and Europa League have different point scales, but in general, the more successful a team is in the competition, the more points they will earn. The teams are also awarded bonus points based on the strength of their opponents, as well as the round in which they were eliminated.\n\nThere is a coefficient for each country, which is calculated by dividing the sum of all clubs\u2019 points by the number of clubs which have participated in the European competitions. Points from the current season are valued more heavily than points from previous seasons.\n\nTurkey\u2019s coefficient rank is 6th as of 2021 , which means that the nation\u2019s clubs would get more spots for UEFA competitions, such as champions league and europa league, comparing to the countries with lower ranking. Also it means that the champion of the league will directly get placed in the group stage of the Champions League and the Runner-up will be in Europa League group stage.\n\nS\u00fcper Lig Clubs\n\nThe S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, is contested by 18 clubs each season. Some of the more notable clubs include:\n\nGalatasaray: One of the most successful clubs in Turkey, with 22 S\u00fcper Lig titles, 18 Turkish Cups and 16 Turkish Super Cups. They are the record holder of the Turkish Football league. Fenerbah\u00e7e: Another one of the most successful clubs in Turkey, Fenerbah\u00e7e has won 19 S\u00fcper Lig titles, 6 Turkish Cups and 13 Turkish Super Cups. Be\u015fikta\u015f: One of the three major Istanbul-based clubs, Be\u015fikta\u015f has won 15 S\u00fcper Lig titles, 13 Turkish Cups and 9 Turkish Super Cups. Trabzonspor: Based in the city of Trabzon, Trabzonspor has won 6 S\u00fcper Lig titles, 2 Turkish Cups and 4 Turkish Super Cups. Bursaspor: Based in Bursa, Bursaspor has won 1 S\u00fcper Lig title and 2 Turkish Cups. Medipol Ba\u015fak\u015fehir: Also a relatively recent addition to the league, but since their promotion to the top tier in 2014, Medipol Ba\u015fak\u015fehir has become a regular contender for the title, winning their first championship in 2020-2021.\n\nThese clubs are considered the traditional powerhouses in Turkish Football, and their matches between them known as \u201cDerby\u2019s\u201d which are the most exciting, popular and watched matches in the league. However, the league is relatively competitive and there are other clubs that are also competitive and have a large fan base.\n\nChampions\n\nThe S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, is the top professional football league in Turkey. The team that finishes at the top of the league table at the end of the season is declared the champion. Since its establishment in 1959, several teams have been crowned champion of the Turkish Super League.\n\nGalatasaray is the most successful team with 22 championships, followed by Fenerbah\u00e7e with 19, Be\u015fikta\u015f with 15. Trabzonspor with 6 and Bursaspor with 1 are the other teams who have won the S\u00fcper Lig title. Medipol Ba\u015fak\u015fehir with 1 has also won in recent history.\n\nThe champions of the league are awarded with the \u201cParmak K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131\u201d (Red finger) which is a trophy awarded to the team that wins the league championship.\n\nPlayer Records\n\nThe S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, is the top professional football league in Turkey, Many players have made a name for themselves in the league over the years, and several of them hold records for their performances.\n\nSome notable records include:\n\nMost goals in a single season: Metin Oktay, who scored 38 goals for Galatasaray during the 1959-1960 season. Most goals in a career: Tanju \u00c7olak, with 252 goals for various teams in the league Most appearances: R\u0131dvan Dilmen, with 609 appearances for various teams in the league Most S\u00fcper Lig titles as a player: Taffarel, with 7 Super league titles, 3 with Galatasaray, 2 with Fenerbahce and 2 with Galatasaray Most S\u00fcper Lig titles as a coach: Fatih Terim, with 8 Super league titles, 4 with Galatasaray and 4 with Be\u015fikta\u015f\n\nThese records are the ones that stand out the most, but there are many other records that are notable and are kept by the Turkish Football Federation.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that many of the players and coaches mentioned above are considered as the legends of Turkish Football.\n\nOfficial match ball\n\nThe official match ball of the S\u00fcper Lig, also known as the Turkish Super League, is supplied by the official ball supplier of the league.\n\nAs of 2021, the official match ball is Adidas Tango ball. It is a high-quality ball, used for professional matches and has been manufactured to meet the requirements of professional players and teams. The ball is made with a high-quality PU material and has been designed to provide optimal performance and control during the match. The ball usually feature the logo of the league and the supplier on it.\n\nAdidas is one of the most well-known and reputable sportswear and equipment manufacturers in the world, and they have been the official match ball supplier of the S\u00fcper Lig for many years. The league and the federation have a sponsorship agreement with Adidas, that\u2019s why the match ball provided by them.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that different leagues and tournaments can have different official match balls, even though the manufacturer is the same, as it depends on the agreement between the league and the supplier.\n\nRead More: Hdsportsontv"}, {"url": "https://worldfootballindex.com/2022/02/fatih-terim-the-emperors-gala/", "page_content": "By Steve Johnson.\n\nWith Galatasaray losing their opening four games under new manager Dom\u00e8nec Torrent and slipping to 15th in the S\u00fcper Lig table, it is hard not to reflect on his predecessor, the legendary Fatih Terim, and his immense success with the club spanning fourteen seasons over four spells in charge of the club.\n\nA former defender who spent eleven years at the Ali Sami Yen from 1974 to 1985, Terim won three Turkish cups and one Turkish Super Cup, his time with Galatasaray also coincided with his run in the national team where he scored three goals in 51 appearances.\n\nHis playing style as a sweeper was, according to former Yugoslavia and Turkey national manager Abdullah Gegic, \u2018Beckenbauer-like\u2019. The German was another sweeper who also had some impressive success with coaching after hanging up his boots.\n\nFatih Terim would go on to prove his football credentials managing the Turkish national team himself, as well as amassing a club record 17 trophies in 14 seasons with Galatasaray, including eight league titles, three Turkish cups, and most surprisingly a UEFA Cup win, won on penalties at the expense of Arsenal, making him by far the most successful manager in the club\u2019s history.\n\nTaking over from Graeme Souness after Euro 96, Terim was quick to clear out the former managers remaining foreign contingent of Dean Saunders, Ulrich Van Gobbel and a young Brad Friedel.\n\nIn their place came Adrian Ilie, Iulian Filipescu, Gheorghe Hagi, to play alongside Umit Devala and Bulent Kormuz and goal machine \u2018the bull of the Bosphorus Hakan Sukur.\n\nExperience was added in subsequent seasons with the likes of Gic\u0103 Popescu, Claudio Taffarel, and Hakan Sas, all helping to cement four straight league titles, the first of which was won with only two losses in the whole league campaign with the team finishing eight points clear of fierce city rivals Besiktas.\n\nAfter a brief and ultimately unsuccessful stint in Italy \u2014 \u2013 where he still gained many plaudits \u2014 Terim returned to a club struggling with financial issues.\n\nDespite recognisable names like Abel Xavier, Haim Revivo, Elvir Baljic, and Frank de Boer strengthening the side, league results declined from a distant second place to Besiktas, to a disastrous sixth-place finish. Terim resigned in March of his second season and after a sabbatical went on to manage Turkey again.\n\nAppointed for a third stint the club won two back to back league titles at a canter, as well as bringing in some household names: the likes of Emmanuel Eboue, Fernando Muslera, John Elmander, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ujfalu\u0161i, Felipe Melo, Albert Riera, in the first season; with Didier Drogba, Wesley Sneijder and Hamit Altintop all arriving in the subsequent season. Terim was unceremoniously let go after rejecting a two-year contract extension to his current deal.\n\nReplacing Igor Tudor for his final tenure, Terim\u2019s return heralded two consecutive league titles, albeit with the points gap to second places very much reduced from previous seasons. A sixth-place finish and a second-place finish followed before Terim was finally sacked with the club languishing in mid-table obscurity in the present season. He posted a photo on Twitter of both his first and final signatures for the club.\n\nGalatasaray\u2019daki ilk imzam ve son imzam\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Iqf4FUOxRP \u2014 Fatih Terim (@fatihterim) January 13, 2022\n\nNot surprisingly, Terim has gained the nickname the \u2018Emperor\u2019, and this is in large part down to his impressive win rate at Gala with 335 victories from 584 matches, as well as his legacy of a semi-final placing in the 2008 European championships.\n\nWith fans already calling for him to be elected club president, it would be foolish to think that his lengthy association with the club has truly come to an end."}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/zh/news/2022-uber-cup-semi-final-wrap-up", "page_content": "\u8eab\u4e3a\u536b\u5195\u51a0\u519b\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u57282022\u5e74\u5c24\u4f2f\u676f\u8d5b\u573a\u4e0a\u7ee7\u7eed\u9ad8\u6b4c\u731b\u8fdb\u3002\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u534a\u51b3\u8d5b\u4e89\u593a\u4e2d\uff0c\u9648\u96e8\u83f2\u3001\u201c\u51e1\u5c18\u201d\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4f55\u51b0\u5a07\u5148\u540e\u51fb\u8d25\u4e1c\u9053\u4e3b\u6cf0\u56fd\u961f\u7684\u7403\u5458/\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u4ee53-0\u7684\u603b\u6bd4\u5206\u633a\u8fdb\u51b3\u8d5b\u3002 \u672c\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff0c\u9648\u96e8\u83f2\u518d\u5ea6\u6253\u5934\u9635\uff0c\u5bf9\u624b\u662f\u6cf0\u56fd\u5973\u5355\u540d\u5c06\u56e0\u8fbe\u519c\u3002\u53cc\u65b9\u6b64\u524d\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7fbd\u8054\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6709\u8fc715\u6b21\u4ea4\u950b\uff0c\u5965\u8fd0\u51a0\u519b\u9648\u96e8\u83f2\u4ee513\u80dc2\u8d1f\u5360\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u516d\u8fde\u80dc\u3002\u9996\u5c40\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff0c\u56e0\u8fbe\u519c\u7387\u5148\u53d1\u529b\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u9648\u96e8\u83f2\u6c89\u7740\u5e94\u6218\u9010\u6e10\u5360\u636e\u4e3b\u52a8\uff0c21-18\u5148\u4e0b\u4e00\u57ce\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c40\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u9664\u5f00\u5c40\u9636\u6bb5\u6bd4\u5206\u80f6\u7740\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u540e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5c31\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u8fb9\u5012\u3002\u9648\u96e8\u83f221-12\u62ff\u4e0b\u6b21\u5c40\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u5148\u5f971\u5206\u3002\n\n\u9648\u96e8\u83f2\u53d1\u7403\u77ac\u95f4 (2018 Getty Images)\n\n\u5973\u53cc\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5965\u8fd0\u4e9a\u519b\u9648\u6e05\u6668/\u8d3e\u4e00\u51e1\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u9635\u57fa\u8482\u54c8\u62c9\u5e93\u5c14/\u666e\u62c9\u743c\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6cf0\u56fd\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u201c\u51e1\u5c18\u201d\u7ec4\u5408\u4fdd\u630112\u8fde\u80dc\u3002 \u4f46\u662f\u672c\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6cf0\u56fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u9996\u5c40\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6253\u51fa\u4e86\u6c14\u52bf\u3002\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4e86\u5f00\u5c40\u7684\u80f6\u7740\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u8fde\u7eed\u780d\u5206\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u5927\u6bd4\u5206\u9886\u5148\u3002\u201c\u51e1\u5c18\u201d\u7ec4\u5408\u867d\u7136\u987d\u5f3a\u7684\u633d\u6551\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c40\u70b9\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6d4e\u4e8e\u4e8b\uff0c21-17\u6cf0\u56fd\u7ec4\u5408\u62d4\u5f97\u5934\u7b79\u3002 \u6b21\u5c40\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u201c\u51e1\u5c18\u201d\u7ec4\u5408\u9010\u6e10\u8fdb\u5165\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e2d\u5c40\u8fc7\u540e\u8fde\u7eed\u5f97\u5206\u62c9\u5927\u5206\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee521-13\u6273\u5e73\u3002\u51b3\u80dc\u5c40\u4e2d\uff0c\u201c\u51e1\u5c18\u201d\u5f00\u5c40\u5f3a\u52bf\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\u53cc\u65b9\u4e92\u6709\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ec4\u540813-12\u9886\u5148\u540e\u8fde\u5f975\u5206\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u4ee521-15\u62ff\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u603b\u6bd4\u52062-0\u9886\u5148\u3002\n\n\u4f55\u51b0\u5a07 (2018 Getty Images)\n\n\u4e8c\u5355\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7531\u4f55\u51b0\u5a07\u5bf9\u9635\u674e\u7f8e\u5999\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u6b64\u524d11\u6b21\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7fbd\u8054\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4ea4\u950b\uff0c\u4f55\u51b0\u5a079\u80dc2\u8d1f\u9886\u5148\u3002\u53cc\u65b9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e24\u6b21\u4ea4\u624b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u80dc\u4e00\u573a\u3002\u672c\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u674e\u7f8e\u5999\u867d\u7136\u6253\u5f97\u4e3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f55\u51b0\u5a07\u603b\u80fd\u591f\u627e\u5230\u7834\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6280\u9ad8\u4e00\u7b79\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u540d\u5c06\u4ee5\u4e24\u4e2a21-15\u51fb\u8d25\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u4ee53-0\u9501\u5b9a\u672c\u5c4a\u5c24\u4f2f\u676f\u51b3\u8d5b\u5e2d\u4f4d\u3002\u51b3\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u961f\u5c06\u548c\u97e9\u56fd\u961f\u4e89\u593a\u51a0\u519b\u3002\n\n\u5b89\u6d17\u83b9\uff1a\u6211\u7ed9\u81ea\u5df1\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u538b\u529b"}]}
