Stearns was an NALP Trailblazer and received NALP\u2019s Educator of the Year award in 2019.\n\n\n\nStearns earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from Penn State and his master\u2019s degree at North Carolina State University. Before becoming a professor at Penn State in 1989, Stearns worked as a landscape architect for the New York State Department of Transportation and for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service in North Carolina \u2014 as well as operating his own landscape design/build firm in Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nWhen he joined the Penn State faculty, he was the inaugural professor and program coordinator of the landscape contracting program at the university. Matt Owens, the financial advisor for Edward Jones and a former student of Stearns, says he was focused on teaching experiential, hands-on learning.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe focused his curriculum around doing projects that benefited the community first,\u201d Owens says. \u201cI would say even family-based projects, and then other campus-related projects.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis students participated in 39 hands-on projects to create or improve landscaped spaces on campus and in the surrounding community. Stearns also co-organized annual visits to landscape companies, nurseries and public gardens in the mid-Atlantic region.\n\n\n\nOwens says Penn State\u2019s landscape contracting program has been known as one of the best in the country and credits this to Stearns.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe had so much to do with improving the level of professionalism in the industry,\u201d Owens says.\n\n\n\nA number of big names in the industry in the 90s were recruiting Penn State grads thanks to the program, and Edward Anewalt, LIC, president of Anewalt\u2019s Landscape Contracting based in Bernville, Pennsylvania, says everyone in his graduating class was spoken for before graduating.\n\n\n\n\u201cDan forged these relationships, not just with the students, but with the industry and absolutely partnered up students with industry,\u201d Anewalt says.\n\n\n\nHowever, Stearns wouldn\u2019t tell a student to pick one company over another.\n\n\u201cJust like teaching, he never gave the answer, but he would help you understand how to get to the answer,\u201d Anewalt says.\n\nAnewalt was a nontraditional student and had to commute two and half hours to Penn State. He says Stearns allowing this enabled Anewalt to earn his degree. He says Stearns was very generous with his time when it came to students and always had an open-door policy.\n\n\u201cEven if he had his head down and he was doing something, if you knocked on his door, Dan would say, \u2018Ed, what can I do for you?\u2019\u201d Anewalt says. \u201cHe never said, \u2018Can you come back?\u2019 He always made time.\u201d\n\nAnewalt says his devotion to helping students succeed was phenomenal. The students who sought Stearns out quickly recognized they\u2019d gain not only educational wisdom, life wisdom as well.\n\n\n\nOwens says Stearns was able to take a huge university like Penn State and boil it down to a family atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an aura around that program that breeds success,\u201d Owens says.\n\n\n\nOne of Stearns\u2019s goals was to have 1,000 landscape contracting graduates. However, he was offered an early retirement in 2017 and was torn because he still wanted to see that goal reached.\n\n\n\nWhen Stearns was diagnosed with stage four metastatic melanoma, he informed close friends like Anewalt and Owens. Anewalt says he got to visit Stearns in October and shared with him a number of projects he was working on to keep his mind off of what he was dealing with.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there was something that made Dan very pleased was to know that his students learned from him and more importantly applied what they learned,\u201d Anewalt says. \u201cThat was the return on Dan\u2019s investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nStearns valued his family most in life, followed by the success of his students.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe really challenged people to learn,\u201d Owens says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a hard guy, but he made you want to go the extra mile to do it right. The professionalism was just so amazing, and he just made it seem so effortless.\u201d\n\n\n\nA fond memory that both Owens and Anewalt have of Stearns is when they nominated him for the Educator of the Year award. The award was to be presented at the closing ceremonies of the National Collegiate Landscape Competition at Colorado State University that year.\n\n\n\nStearns had been teaching during his retirement as his replacement professor, Margaret Hoffman, had health complications.

For the fall of 2020, only 17 percent of the University\u2019s population came from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nIn this sense, UMass has always been and remains a predominantly white institution (PWI).\n\nThis is a short history of Black presence on the UMass Amherst campus.\n\nAccording to the University archives, Massachusetts Agricultural College (UMass\u2019 former name), was predominately male and from Massachusetts up until the early 1900s.\n\nThough there was little racial and gender diversity, the archives note that there were neither \u201cany formal policies barring the admission of women or people of color\u201d at the time.\n\nDuring this period at the turn of the twentieth century, the archives report that the campus community was frequently rattled with debate over civil liberties. Some students in 1901 traveled to hear Booker T. Washington speak in Northampton on \u201cThe colored race and its relation to the productive industries of the country.\u201d The College Signal had reported that \u201cAll seemed well and pleased with the lecture.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, writers at Aggie Life, the student newspaper which preceded the Signal, published racist ideas, and wrote that Black people were \u201ccontent to live in squalor, ignorance, and immorality\u201d and \u201cimprovident, depraved, and strenuously resist any attempts at education.\u201d\n\nThis was the divided campus environment when the first Black student arrived on campus at MAC in 1897 \u2013 George Ruffin Bridgeforth.\n\nBridgeforth was born in Athens, Georgia. When he enrolled as a freshman at MAC, he was nearly 24 years old.\n\n\u201cAs far as can be determined, African American students lived in the dorms and boarding houses side by side with their white classmates, one some occasions sharing quarters. As a group, these pioneering students participated fully in the life of the college \u2013 with the noteworthy exception of fraternities \u2013 and they made their mark in both athletics and academics,\u201d according to University archives.\n\nDuring his time at UMass, Bridgeforth was selected as the Sergeant at Arms for the sophomore class, on the rope pull team, a member of the College Shakespearean Club, played on the football team, made corporal in Co. A of the Cadet Battalion and was president of the YMCA. As a junior, he also won second prize in the Flint Oratorical competition.\n\nAfter graduation, Bridgeforth pursued a career in education, landing his first job in the Agricultural Department at Tuskegee College. Also at Tuskegee at the time were Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver.\n\nHe later left Tuskegee and accepted a new position as President of the Kansas Industrial and Educational Institute in Topeka in May of 1918. During his time there, Bridgeforth worked to establish a hospital and nursing school.\n\nThe University archives state that, for the next decade after Bridgeforth\u2019s arrival, about one more Black student came to MAC in each new class of 25-75 total students.\n\nOther first students from the time include William Lane Hood \u201903, William W. Peebles \u201803 and William H. Craighead, who is thought to be the first ever Black captain of a sports team at a PWI.\n\nThe archives list nine first Black students. Of their achievements, they write \u201csix of the nine taught at an Historically Black College or University \u2013 two becoming presidents \u2013 and of the other three, one became a dental surgeon and another was a County Extension agent teaching African American farmers in Virginia.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear who the first Black woman to attend UMass was.\n\nIt was not until almost 60 years later that Black students began increasing in enrollment.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court delivered its landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education Topkea, declaring racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Though UMass already had no policies barring Black enrollment, this decision did spur the integration of the University.\n\nAccording to a Status Report written by the Afro-American Studies department in 1980, when the 1954 decision was delivered, many white southern state universities tried to find ways around this ruling to continue to keep Black students out. One tactic they used was offering scholarships to Black students to instead attend universities in the north.\n\n\u201cTuition and fees, living expenses and books \u2014 all paid to keep black residents out of Southern \u2018white\u2019 state schools,\u201d according to the document.\n\nUMass was one of the Universities where these scholarships were accepted. More than 10 years after Brown v. Board, however, Black students were still greatly underrepresented on campus. In 1965, the document states, about 50 out of the 18,000 students on campus were Black. Most of them were also graduate students.\n\nAccording to the Fall 2010 edition of the UMass Magazine, in the 1960s, UMass had fewer Black students on campus than the universities in Mississippi or Alabama and had more students from Asia and Africa than Black students from Massachusetts.\n\nThe students who attended the University between 1960 and 1970 were dubbed the \u201cBlack Pioneers\u201d by Cheryl Evans \u201968. Evans undertook a project in 2018 to collect and document the stories of these students.\n\nIn her own interview, Evans recalled first arriving at UMass in 1964 for freshman orientation and not seeing any other Black student.\n\n\u201cIt was like being transported to another planet,\u201d she said in the interview.\n\nHer entire freshman class only had 12 Black students, six men and six women, and she recalls feeling invisible to the rest of the University.\n\n\u201cI remember going to one of those freshman mixes, I think they called them, and standing there and people going by and dancing and I just felt, like, \u2018this big.\u2019 I realized the experience they\u2019re having\u2026I wasn\u2019t included,\u201d she said.\n\nEvans also talked about not having places in town to get her hair done or be able to buy pantyhose or makeup for her skin color. She would have to take the bus back to her home in Medford to get her hair done properly.\n\nAfter realizing this lack of Black representation on campus, Evans decided to organize some of the other Black students around 1965.\n\n\u201cI could have passed through here with no ripples at all, or, [said] \u2018something has to change, I can\u2019t leave this like this.\u2019 And so that became I\u2019ll call it, the \u2018additional degree,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nDuring her time organizing at UMass, Evans gained the nickname \u201cLittle General\u201d for her small statue but commanding nature.\n\nA full video self-recorded by Evans reflecting on her time at UMass can be found here.\n\nThe Black organization first started as the \u2018Carver Club,\u2019 \u201cbecause Carver was neutral enough to not scare anybody,\u201d Evans said.\n\nLater on, Evans was elected to the Student Government Association as a representative from Arnold House. After learning about the process of becoming a Registered Student Organization, she helped establish the Carver Club as the new \u201cStudent Afro-American Association,\u201d the first Black student organization on campus and was elected its first president.\n\nEvans remembers that around the years of 1966 and 1967, she and some members of the Association met with the Dean of Students at the time with a proposal to recruit more Black students.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for any money. We said we would do the recruiting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Dean replied saying that the administration would think about it.\n\nAround the same time, five Black faculty members \u2014 Randolph W. \u201cBill\u201d Bromery, Lawrence A. Johnston, William Julius Wilson, Edwin Driver and William Darity \u2014 began on an initiative to increase Black enrollment and support at UMass.\n\nReflecting on the period before the 1968 push for recruitment, the Status Report cites that \u201cAlmost any discussion of recruitment of Afro-American students, whether at meetings or parties, eventually led to the question of their qualifications for college work.\u201d It continues, \u201cWe noted, also, that \u2018lack of qualifications\u2019 all too often implied the inability to learn rather than poor high school preparation for college. We recognize the latter as justification for concern but in no way as a reason for the University to avoid what was clearly its moral, if not necessarily legal, duty.\u201d\n\nFor faculty members, it became clear that it was necessary to create a system to support prospective Black students\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cThose of us who had received our secondary schooling in the North knew how Black students were kept out of academic tracks, the courses they were discouraged from taking, the career counselors who attempted to lower Black pupils\u2019 ambitions, even the teacher who literally wept before her class, apologizing for the Black youngster\u2019s sitting before her and explaining that \u2018Negroes simply can\u2019t grasp the material, but state law requires me to teach them,\u2019\u201d wrote the faculty in the Status Report.\n\nTo address these needs, University faculty wrote a grant proposal for the creation of the Committee for the Collegiate Education of Black Students. CCEBS was meant to recruit and retain Black students and provide them with economic and academic assistance such as orientation, counseling and tutoring.\n\nAccording to an article from the Journal of African American Studies, the Ford Foundation accepted the grant to underwrite the education of Black students at UMass and provided the program $1 million in the two year period between 1968 and 1969. Other funding came from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the U.S. Office of Education, the UMass Student Senate and UMass alumni.\n\nAfter the creation of CCEBS, the Committee worked to increase the enrollment of Black students on campus, according to the UMass Magazine. In 1968, they presented the University with a list of 120 potential students to admit, of whom they hoped half would be accepted.\n\nInitially, the University only wanted to accept two or three of the 120. Yet, the five professors on the Committee did not back down. They threatened to resign if the University did not meet their demands.\n\nAfter this, the University agreed to accept all 121 students \u2013 51 men and 70 women.\n\n\u201cThe graduates from that first-year cohort would outnumber the full roster of Black graduates in the previous 105 years of the university\u2019s history,\u201d says the Magazine.\n\nAccording to the Journal of African American Studies, with the help CCEBS, the enrollment of Black students then rose to around 500 by 1970.\n\nOne of the students from the 1968 CCEBS class was Anita Anderson, who was also interviewed as part of the Black Pioneers project.\n\nOf her time at UMass, Anderson said that what most stands out to her was \u201cthe community that we built.\u201d She said that she had study partners and it felt as though students were helping one another.\n\nAnderson said that when she arrived on campus as a music major, she learned that she \u201cwasn\u2019t equipped for the difficulty of classical music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just was not disciplined at 17,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore departing UMass in her sophomore year to pursue a singing career in Los Angeles, Anderson was a vocalist in a band on campus.\n\nOf the environment between students on campus, she said \u201cThere was a lot of people judging each other by the color of their skin but I wasn\u2019t into that\u2026I\u2019m not saying I never experienced prejudice because I did experience it, but that was a select few people \u2013 kids that were raised that way. I always believed you could teach hate, but if you don\u2019t teach it you won\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Bromery became the first Black chancellor at UMass and was known as a \u201cchampion of diversity\u201d who continued to push for the expansion of educational opportunities for Black students and also helped acquire the W.E.B. DuBois papers.\n\nMore oral histories and documents about the Black Pioneers can be found here.\n\nThough the University administration was mainly open to the recruitment of Black students, the issue was met with some hostility from faculty and other students.\n\n\u201cThe administration, they were much more progressive I think than the faculty,\u201d recalled Professor Emeritus Ernie Allen, who joined the faculty at UMass in 1972.\n\nAs a faculty member during the time that this first wave of Black students was on campus, Allen remembers that Black students would sometime boycott classes after hearing professors make racist remarks about people of African descent.\n\nStill, he acknowledges that there was \u201ctremendous support\u201d from some faculty and department, such as the English and history departments.\n\n\u201cThere was also a fair amount of hostility, I think, on the part of the regular counselors, that sort of thing. They would sometimes advise Black, white students not to take African American studies courses, you know, because they would face a hostile environment,\u201d added Allen.\n\nMuch of the student hostility towards Black students, the Status Report documents, came from \u201cfraternity row.\u201d\n\nThe document reports that one day in the spring of 1969, a group of fraternity boys chased several Black students to their dorm in Mills House, later renamed and transformed into the New Africa House.\n\n\u201cWhen the students secured themselves behind a locked door, the fraternity gang left, vowing to gather an even larger number and return to \u2018do battle.\u2019 Barricading themselves in the house, the Black students went through the halls knocking on doors, announcing that when the fraternity gang returned, the students housed in Mills were \u2018either with them or against them\u2019 and if they were not \u201cwith them\u201d they should leave the dorm. It was easier to fight, they felt, if all their foes were in one place. Uninvolved white students left the building. Meanwhile, more Black students joined those in the house and what began as a defense tactic on the part of harassed Black students was blown into a full-fledged building take-over reminiscent of those taking place over the nation \u2014 demands and all,\u201d documents the Status Report.\n\nAudio news coverage of the takeover at Mills House can be found here.\n\nOther attacks on Black students, Allen remembers, came during riots after the World Series.\n\nMuch like the traditions that remain today at UMass, whenever the Boston Red Sox won the World Series, students would erupt in riot to celebrate the victory. Allen said, however, that some of them would turn into anti-Black rallies.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of, if you will, racial hostility in the country and that\u2019s something that was reflected on campus as well. And to a very large extent, only the bravest white students would show up to Black classes, you know classes where the majority of students in that particular class were would be African American,\u201d added Allen.\n\nHe emphasized that there seemed to be fear towards the Black students on the part of white students.\n\nProfessor John Bracey, who came to UMass in 1973, recalls that in his classes students usually sat segregated from one another.\n\n\u201cKids would tell me that their parents would want them to drop the class because they didn\u2019t want an African American professor,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cThe contrast that I guess I\u2019m trying to make here is that, if there was a march on campus by Black students and that sort of thing, white students generally stayed away,\u201d said Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s very common today to have white students in large numbers join [protests]. That was not the case back in the 60s \u2014 there was a certain kind of fear of the New Africa house and what went on there.\u201d\n\nThe Status Report also noted that there was an \u201coverwhelming curiosity by the town and campus communities\u201d of the new class of students in around 1968.\n\n\u201cAll too often, they were made to feel they were experimental animals in a laboratory,\u201d the professors wrote.\n\nThe press would pry into their lives to get information about their lives, adjustments, successes and failures. It is unclear how large a part Daily Collegian reporters played in this at the time.\n\nAs a response to the fact that Daily Collegian was also not writing about the needs and interest of Black students, Black students created their own newspaper in 1969, titled Nummo News.\n\nAccording to the UMass Amherst Black Alumni Network Facebook page, \u201cWe focused on issues and stories that affected and were pertinent to students of color. We were committed to the newspaper because we felt that these issues and stories might not otherwise be covered in the Collegian.\u201d\n\nDuring their time at UMass, this first wave of Black students also developed a close relationship with Black professors in the Afro-American Studies department.\n\nIn the early years, the University still did not have the proper procedures and networks set in place to properly support Black students on campus.\n\n\u201cIn other words, they didn\u2019t know what to do with Black students when they had problems with, you know, issues on campus and that sort of thing. So, a lot of a lot of things defaulted to the Black faculty on campus,\u201d recalls Allen.\n\n\u201cSo, we ended up\u2026being I\u2019d say, the guardians of the students,\u201d he added, emphasizing that this was all \u201cdone willingly.\u201d\n\nThe Status Report also documents some tension between Black students and faculty, as students\u2019 \u201cattempts to organize were frequently discouraged by some Black faculty members and staff members of CCEBS who feared such union among the students would result in white hostility to the program.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe students, however, viewed us with the same suspicion they did white people. Hurt but understanding and not discouraged, we Black faculty and graduate students continued to deal with the task of helping those students through what could only seem to them a tortuous maze of contradictions. We recognized their sense of powerlessness as the same powerlessness felt by those who lectured them not to rock the boat,\u201d the faculty writers continued.\n\nThe distance between faculty members and students grew over time, however.\n\n\u201cWe started out as a period to be like older brothers and sisters of the students, and now we\u2019re more like, you know, your father. As time went on, and then you become the grandparents of the students,\u201d Allen said.\n\nAllen noted that the Fine Arts Center as a hub for Black art was \u201ca very important area of development\u201d during the 1970s.\n\nFrederick C. Tillis, who ran the FAC at the time, had connections to \u201cluminaries of the artistic world,\u201d according to Allen, and had them preform at UMass. Some included Ella Fitzgerald, the Alvin Ailey dance group and Miles Davey.\n\nThe department also brought in artists like Archie Shepp and Max Roach to teach.\n\n\u201cThis transformed the whole cultural aspect of Amherst and it had repercussions on the four colleges as well\u2026they would put their resources towards bringing Black artists to the Valley, not just UMass,\u201d says Allen.\n\n\u201cSo, it was quite incredible time, you know, from a cultural standpoint. And unbeknownst to us\u2026 it transformed what Amherst is. I mean you wouldn\u2019t recognize the old Amherst, having been here because of the kind of support that you have, you know, culturally,\u201d he continued.\n\nThis month, UMass announced the creation of a Black Presence Initiative to further explore and document the experiences of Black students at UMass.\n\nThe initiative is being spearheaded by the Office of Equity and Inclusion and aims to \u201cdocument the authentic lived and living experiences of Black community members, as well as create a space for celebrating our campus history.\u201d\n\nIn addition to conducting interviews with Black alumni and posting them on the forthcoming website, the initiative is also seeking to create a virtual tour of campus to \u201cexplore buildings, landscapes and spaces that defined Black life at UMass Amherst to facilitate understanding by the larger campus community.\u201d\n\nThe initiative is also honoring Bracey with a graduate scholarship created in his honor.\n\nOf the Black Presence Initiative, Bracey, who is focusing on the historical side in conducting interviews and documenting experiences, said, \u201cThe Black Presence is about the impact of Black people on this campus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the broader goal is more transformative than that, you know that knowledge is transformative. And accumulation of knowledge is that people\u2019s stories is transformed,\u201d he continued. \u201cBlackness in the world you live, in the world I live in, is a marker of being misunderstood.\u201d\n\nBracey also noted that the project is about showing different ways to live in the world and opening up the range of human behavior.\n\n\u201cPart of the Black Presence is to say, \u2018if you let us in the door, we can do the work.\u2019 And if you see us here, we\u2019re doing the work. We can do whatever you can do,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any other university that\u2019s actually doing that because they\u2019d be afraid of the content, you know. But I have carte blanche to let people talk about whatever they want. That\u2019s why they talk. You know, it\u2019s not \u2018tell me the good stuff\u2019 it\u2019s, \u2018what was your experience like?\u2019 because the story is how do you overcame obstacles not how they breezed through the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of them breezed through the place.\u201d\n\nMore information about the Black Presence Initiative can be found here. A website with interviews with Black alumni documenting their experiences is expected to be available this summer.\n\nIrina Costache can be reached at [email protected].
