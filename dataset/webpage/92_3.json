Among these were the anti-Romantic movement in Germany, with its emphasis on the common man as an artistic subject; Auguste Comte \u2019s Positivist philosophy, in which sociology\u2019s importance as the scientific study of society was emphasized; the rise of professional journalism , with its accurate and dispassionate recording of current events; and the development of photography , with its capability of mechanically reproducing visual appearances with extreme accuracy. All these developments stimulated interest in accurately recording contemporary life and society.\n\nRealism was not consciously adopted as an aesthetic program until the mid-19th century in France, however. Indeed, realism may be viewed as a major trend in French novels and paintings between 1850 and 1880. One of the first appearances of the term realism was in the Mercure fran\u00e7ais du XIX e si\u00e8cle in 1826, in which the word is used to describe a doctrine based not upon imitating past artistic achievements but upon the truthful and accurate depiction of the models that nature and contemporary life offer the artist. The French proponents of realism were agreed in their rejection of the artificiality of both the Classicism and Romanticism of the academies and on the necessity for contemporaneity in an effective work of art. They attempted to portray the lives, appearances, problems, customs, and mores of the middle and lower classes, of the unexceptional, the ordinary, the humble, and the unadorned. Indeed, they conscientiously set themselves to reproducing all the hitherto-ignored aspects of contemporary life and society\u2014its mental attitudes, physical settings, and material conditions.\n\nGustave Courbet was the first artist to self-consciously proclaim and practice the realist aesthetic. After his huge canvas The Studio (1854\u201355) was rejected by the Exposition Universelle of 1855, the artist displayed it and other works under the label \u201cRealism, G. Courbet\u201d in a specially constructed pavilion. Courbet was strongly opposed to idealization in his art, and he urged other artists to instead make the commonplace and contemporary the focus of their art. He viewed the frank portrayal of scenes from everyday life as a truly democratic art. Such paintings as his Burial at Ornans (1849) and the Stone Breakers (1849), which he had exhibited in the Salon of 1850\u201351, had already shocked the public and critics by the frank and unadorned factuality with which they depicted humble peasants and labourers. The fact that Courbet did not glorify his peasants but presented them boldly and starkly created a violent reaction in the art world.\n\nThe style and subject matter of Courbet\u2019s work were built on ground already broken by the painters of the Barbizon School. Th\u00e9odore Rousseau, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, and others in the early 1830s settled in the French village of Barbizon with the aim of faithfully reproducing the local character of the landscape. Though each Barbizon painter had his own style and specific interests, they all emphasized in their works the simple and ordinary rather than the grandiose and monumental aspects of nature. They turned away from melodramatic picturesqueness and painted solid, detailed forms that were the result of close observation. In such works as The Winnower (1848), Millet was one of the first artists to portray peasant labourers with a grandeur and monumentality hitherto reserved for more important persons.\n\nAnother major French artist often associated with the realist tradition, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, drew satirical caricatures of French society and politics. He found his working-class heroes and heroines and his villainous lawyers and politicians in the slums and streets of Paris. Like Courbet, he was an ardent democrat, and he used his skill as a caricaturist directly in the service of political aims. Daumier used energetic linear style, boldly accentuated realistic detail, and an almost sculptural treatment of form to criticize the immorality and ugliness he saw in French society.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

There, Winslow Homer\u2019s powerful and expressive paintings of marine subjects and Thomas Eakins\u2019s portraits, boating scenes, and other works are frank, unsentimental, and acutely observed records of contemporary life.\n\nRealism was a distinct current in 20th-century art and usually stemmed either from artists\u2019 desire to present more honest, searching, and unidealized views of everyday life or from their attempts to use art as a vehicle for social and political criticism. The rough, sketchy, almost journalistic scenes of seamy urban life by the group of American painters known as The Eight fall into the former category. The German art movement known as the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity), on the other hand, worked in a realist style to express the cynicism and disillusionment of the post-World War I period in Germany. The Depression-era movement known as Social Realism adopted a similarly harsh and direct realism in its depictions of the injustices and evils of American society during that period.\n\nSocialist Realism, which was the officially sponsored Marxist aesthetic in the Soviet Union from the early 1930s until that country\u2019s dissolution in 1991, actually had little to do with realism, though it purported to be a faithful and objective mirror of life. Its \u201ctruthfulness\u201d was required to serve the ideology and the propagandistic needs of the state. Socialist Realism generally used techniques of naturalistic idealization to create portraits of dauntless workers and engineers who were strikingly alike in both their heroic positivism and their lack of lifelike credibility."}, {"url": "https://sicilyinsideandout.com/2014/01/16/literary-islands-vitaliano-brancati/", "page_content": "I stumbled upon Vitaliano Brancati quite by accident in a bookstore at Messina. I was attracted by the title of one his books, I discovered after he was quite a prolific novelist and later his most famous novel Il Bel Antonio was developed into a movie starring Marcello Mastroianni, which became a classic of Italian cinema.\n\nBeing an opera fan I liked the idea of a pseudo-Don Giovanni being set in Sicily. Taking the novella home I discovered a rich caricature of the Sicilian male taken to strange extremes yet which has a core honesty that goes beyond any form of realism.\n\nThe main character, Giovanni Percolla is a master of the aristocratic Sicilian art of doing nothing, he sleeps a lot, chases after women with a voracious sexual appetite and lives at home with his two spinster sisters who spoil him terribly.\n\nBrancati has created a rich grotesque baroque caricature, Giovanni\u2019s world is dysfunctional and his sisters are as absurd as our Sicilian Don Giovanni is. The sisters claim to be war widows as statically so many young men died during the war that one of them was bound to have been their husband if they had married.\n\nEverything changes when Giovanni falls in love gets married to Ninetta and he tries to get ahead in life by moving up North to Milan where he works more, sleeps less and adopts a bizarre routine of taking cold showers to develop strength and immunity.\n\nThe couple returns to Sicily after failing to adapt to life in Northern Italy. Socially they have been rejected and ostracized by the northerners and they are demoralized by the literal and metaphorical coldness of the North.\n\nGiovanni suffers a physical and mental collapse due to the lack of sleep and returns to the opened arms of Sicily a pale, sickly and haggard shadow of himself.\n\nTheir return to the bosom of Sicily at first seems a defeat, yet after reviving himself with beautiful Sicilian slumber and sunshine he returns to a blessed routine of comfort.\n\nA part cautionary tale, satire and caricature Don Giovanni in Sicily is masterfully written and is one of the most succinct, beautifully written Sicilian novellas I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nBrowsing Amazon there is a translation of Don Giovanni in Sicily but it only has one review so I\u2019m not sure of the quality of the translation. I suggest browsing around the likes of AbeBooks to see if there is another translation which looks better.\n\n(Images: Thanks to Google)"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/vitaliano-brancati/", "page_content": "Vitaliano Brancati ([vita\u02c8lja\u02d0no bra\u014b\u02c8ka\u02d0ti]; 24 July 1907 \u2013 25 September 1954) was an Italian novelist, dramatist, poet and screenwriter.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Pachino, Syracuse, Brancati studied in Catania, where he graduated in letters and where he spent the most part of his life. While he started writing at young age and at 25 years old he was already the author of six books, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and which were later rejected by the same Brancati, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In search of a cause. Brancati got his first and probably major success in 1941, with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicilia, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament.\n\nIn 1944 he wrote the novel Gli anni perduti (\"The Lost Years\"), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli stivali (\"Old Man in Boots\"), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of the Italian fascism which won the Vendemmia Award and which was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years by Luigi Zampa. In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with one another well-known novel, Il bell'Antonio (\"The Handsome Antonio\").\n\nHe died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery.
