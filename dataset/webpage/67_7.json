(digital file no. LC-DIG-hec-28851)\n\n(1881\u20131953). American lawyer and political leader Anthony Joseph Dimond was a champion of Alaskan statehood. He also stressed the importance of the Alaska Highway, which, when completed, was the only land route to connect Alaska with the mainland United States (through Canada).\n\nDimond was born on November 30, 1881, in Palatine Bridge, New York. After teaching from 1900 to 1903, he moved to Alaska in 1904 to work as a prospector and miner. Dimond also studied law, and in 1913 he was admitted to the bar and began practicing in Valdez, Alaska. Later that year he became the U.S. commissioner at Chisana, Alaska, where he worked with gold miners and their claims. In 1917 Dimond became the special assistant to the U.S. attorney in Valdez.\n\nDimond served as mayor of Valdez for nine years, from 1920 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1932. From 1923 to 1926 and from 1929 to 1932 he was a member of the Alaska Territorial Senate. In 1933 Dimond was elected as the Alaskan representative to the U.S. Congress, and he was reelected five successive times. Although he worked tirelessly for Alaskan statehood, the feat would not be accomplished until 1959, after his death. Dimond left Congress in 1945 to become a district court judge in Anchorage, Alaska. He died there on May 28, 1953."}, {"url": "https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/12264", "page_content": "University of Alaska-Fairbanks\n\nElmer E.

His first acts were to introduce a Statehood Bill, which was ignored, to urge construction of the Alaska Highway, and to advise that fortifications be built in Fairbanks and Anchorage.\n\nDimond ended forty years of public service as a Federal Judge for the Third Judicial District of Alaska.

That is actually not the case; although the 9th Circuit has jurisdiction over Hawaii, Derrick Watson is a part of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii.\n\nStill, if the Trump administration is to appeal Watson\u2019s decision, they will have to return to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the court that decided last month not to reinstitute the travel ban. So who are the judges who make up this 9th Circuit, and where do they all fall politically?\n\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is the largest appellate court in the United States. It is so large, in fact, that Republican Senator Jeff Flake recently introduced a bill, the Judicial Administration and Improvement Act of 2017, which has the express purpose of breaking the court into two. Congress has been attempting to break up the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals since the 1990s.\n\nA total of 29 judges make up the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, although four of those seats are currently vacant. Of the 25 currently-active judges, there are 10 Clinton appointees, six George W. Bush appointees, seven Barack Obama appointees, one Ronald Reagan appointee, and one Jimmy Carter appointee.\n\nOn Wednesday, five judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, all George W. Bush appointees, voiced support for President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying that the president has the authority to suspend immigration as Trump did. Those judges were Alex Kozinski, Jay Bybee, Consuelo Callahan, Carlos Bea and Sandra Ikuta.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the judges who are currently active on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\nSidney Runyan Thomas \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1996. In 2014, he became the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit. Thomas was one of President Barack Obama\u2019s possible choices to replace John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court, but Obama ended up picking Elena Kagan instead. Stephen Reinhardt \u2013 A Jimmy Carter appointee who assumed office in 1980. Reinhardt is known for being extremely liberal. \u201cI was a liberal from a very young age,\u201d he told California Lawyer. \u201cI think I was born that way.\u201d His decisions are reversed by the Supreme Court at a higher rate than most other judges. Alex Kozinski \u2013 A Ronald Reagan appointee who assumed office in 1985. In 1993, he reached a notable decision in an intellectual property case in which Wheel of Fortune\u2018s Vana White sued Samsung for parodying her likeness in a TV ad. Kozinski said, \u201cOverprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it. Creativity is impossible without a rich public domain.\u201d In another case, in which Mattel sued MCA Records over the song \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d Kozinski wrote, \u201cThe parties are advised to chill.\u201d Susan P. Graber \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1998. In 2013, she ruled that a California law prohibiting mental health professionals from engaging in gay conversion therapy is constitutional, writing, \u201cWithout a doubt, protecting the well-being of minors is a legitimate state interest,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times. M. Margaret McKeown \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1998. One notable decision of hers came in 2007 when she said the display of a cross at a nature reserve was unconstitutional because it was akin to the federal government endorsing a religion. This decision was reversed by the Supreme Court. Kim McLane Wardlaw \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1998. Before serving on the 9th Circuit, Wardlaw volunteered for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and she was also a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in 1992. William A. Fletcher \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1998. He authored the decision of Demers v. Austin, which said that academic faculty members are protected by the First Amendment; the plaintiff in that case was a professor who was criticizing his school\u2019s administration and who was punished for doing so. Ronald M. Gould \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 1999. In 2002, he removed an injunction against a rule prohibiting the building of new roads in underdeveloped areas of national forests, according to The Recorder. He has been described as a moderate. Richard A. Paez \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 2000. When Clinton nominated Paez, Jeff Sessions, who is now the U.S. attorney general but was then a senator, lead a campaign against him. Sessions took issue with Paez having accepted a plea agreement allowing John Huang, a central figure in the 1996 campaign finance controversy, to avoid going to jail, according to The New York Times. Marsha S. Berzon \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 2000. In 2009, she ruled that a San Francisco resolution which condemned the Vatican for its position on same-sex marriage was constitutional, saying that it would be a difference case if the resolution condemned the Vatican for its teaching on something like transubstantiation. Richard C. Tallman \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 2000. However, Tallman himself is a Republican. He is also a judge on the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a court which reviews denials of FISA warrants. Johnnie B. Rawlinson \u2013 A Bill Clinton appointee who assumed office in 2000. She is the first African-American woman to serve on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2014, she ruled in favor of keeping protections intact for the delta smelt, an endangered species of fish. Jay Bybee \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2001. He previously served as assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, and he authored the 2002 torture memos which said that enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding are legal. Consuelo Mar\u00eda Callahan \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2003. She was floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee to replace Sandra Day O\u2019Connor in 2005, but Bush ultimately selected Samuel Alito. Carlos T. Bea \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2003. He is from Spain and was almost deported for allegedly dodging the draft during the Korean War, but a judge ruled in his favor. He later became a nationalized citizen. Above the Law refers to him as \u201crefreshingly conservative, on a famously (or infamously) liberal court.\u201d Milan D. Smith, Jr. \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2006. He has authored the most opinions of any judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In United States v. Henry, he upheld the conviction of a man who had made a homemade machine gun, saying that this is not protected by the Second Amendment because machine guns are \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d that law abiding citizens don\u2019t usually have. Sandra Segal Ikuta \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2006. She wrote the opinion in United States v. Baldrich, a case involving a man who plead guilty to six counts of robbery and who argued that the court violated his right to due process because it did not disclose a probation officer\u2019s confidential sentencing recommendation, according to Ninth Circuit Blog. The court ruled against the defendant. N. Randy Smith \u2013 A George W. Bush appointee who assumed office in 2007. He wrote the dissent in Perry v. Brown, the case in which the 9th Circuit found that California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Mary H. Murguia \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2011. In 2011, she acquitted Elton Simpson, who had allegedly lied to the FBI about intending to travel to Somalia to commit acts of terror. She felt that there was not enough evidence of Simpson\u2019s intentions. He later attacked an art exhibit featuring cartoon images of Mohammad in Texas. Morgan Christen \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2012. She previously served as a Planned Parenthood board member in the 1990s, and her nomination was opposed by some pro-choice advocacy groups. However, she was confirmed by the Senate in a 95 to 3 vote. Jacqueline Nguyen \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2012. She is the first Asian-American woman to serve as a federal appellate judge. She was floated as a possible pick to replace Antonin Scalia, but Barack Obama ended up nominating Merrick Garland. Paul J. Watford \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2012. He authored the opinion in City of Los Angeles v. Patel, a case in which the court ruled against a city ordinance in which police could conduct unannounced investigations of hotel registries without a warrant. He was also floated as a possible Supreme Court nominee of Barack Obama\u2019s in 2012. Andrew D. Hurwitz \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2012. In Citizen Publishing Co. v. Miller ex rel Elleithee, he ruled that a newspaper that ran an ad calling for the murder of Muslims was protected by the First Amendment. John B. Owens \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2014. He earned some attention in 2016 for referencing the HBO series Game of Thrones during a decision. In the case of Flores v. City of San Gabriel, he wrote that the court\u2019s interpretation of a part of the Fair Labor Standards Act was \u201cvery close to a qyburnian resurrection of [a rejected case law] standard,\u201d according to Above the Law. Michelle Friedland \u2013 A Barack Obama appointee who assumed office in 2014. She was one of three judges who in February 2017 rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to lift the restraining order against the first travel ban.\n\nIn addition, there are 19 Ninth Circuit judges who have senior status: Alfred Theodore Goodwin, J.

He served as chief judge of the court from 2014 until 2021, bringing several technological innovations to the court, according to a statement from the Ninth Circut.\n\nThose innovations include the streaming of oral arguments on YouTube, which occurred even before the Covid-19 pandemic rendered the platform a more indispensable tool for the court.\n\nThomas wrote 406 precedential opinions during his stint on the federal circuit, hearing approximately 11,500 appeals over the course of his 26-year career.\n\nPart of the chief justice's duties include organizing and presiding over the court\u2019s en banc process, sometimes rife with internal court politics, but Thomas was routinely praised for his evenhanded approach. Court colleagues have commended his ability to straddle ideological factions in the politically divided Ninth Circuit.\n\nA native of Bozeman, Montana, he began as a private attorney in Billings, where he also taught law at the Rocky Mountain College.\n\nThomas wrote the opinions in several groundbreaking cases, including siding with the Sierra Club in 2020 in holding that the Department of Defense was in error when it appropriated funds for the construction of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall despite Congress\u2019s open refusal to fund it.\n\nThomas held the move violated the Appropriations Clause, but his decision was effectively reversed by a 5-4 decision at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOne of his most cited opinions involved the case of Ahilan Nadarajah, a native of Sri Lanka who was held indefinitely at the discretion of U.S. attorney general on suspicion of terrorism. In 2006, Thomas issued a writ of mandate releasing Nadarajah while finding that the government exceeded its statutory authority in detaining him for five years without a trial.\n\nThe opinion has been cited at least 175 times.\n\nOn April 10, 2010, The Associated Press reported that then-President Barak Obama interviewed Thomas at the White House, likely in consideration for the Supreme Court that eventually went to Elena Kagan.\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Mary Murguia of Phoenix replaced Thomas as chief judge. In doing so, Murguia became the second woman and first Latina to hold the position.\n\nThomas became the third to take senior status on the Ninth Circuit in 2022, following U.S. Circuit Judges Andrew Hurwitz and Margaret McKeown in January. The retirement will give the Biden administration further opportunity to stock the federal judiciary with preferred nominees while control of the U.S. Senate and the nominating process is still in Democratic hands.\n\nTo date, Biden has nominated more jurists to the federal bench than any other president since Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\nThe United States Senate has confirmed 56 Article III judges during Biden\u2019s stint in the White House, with 15 judges appointed to the courts of appeals. Twenty-seven nominations await Senate action, including the anticipated confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nBiden has so far appointed Judges Lucy Koh, Jennifer Sung, Gabriel Sanchez and Holly Thomas to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit is approved for 29 judgeships and currently has three vacancies.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/us/reagan-nominates-anthony-kennedy-to-supreme-court.html", "page_content": "''I'm delighted with this nomination,'' he replied with a slight smile.\n\nSenators from both parties said they would reserve judgment and examine the new nominee's record closely. But beneath the studiously noncommittal responses was a general expectation that Judge Kennedy would be confirmed, as well as collective relief that another bruising battle could probably be avoided.\n\nStill the moment was a bitter one for a number of conservatives, both on and off Capitol Hill. They viewed Mr. Reagan as abandoning one of the principal goals of his Presidency, that of changing the direction of the Supreme Court. Biden Pledges Cooperation\n\nKey Democrats said that confirmation hearings would almost certainly not begin until January.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., said: ''I'm glad the President has made his choice. We will get the process under way and move as rapidly as is prudent. We want to conduct the committee's review with both thoroughness and dispatch.''\n\nJudge Kennedy, a 51-year-old Harvard Law School graduate, was named in 1975 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which covers California and several other Western states.\n\nIn writing nearly 500 opinions, he has earned a reputation as a careful judge of basically conservative leanings who approaches legal problems case by case and has apparently never evinced a desire to change the modern course of constitutional law. Some scholars who have studied his record say his approach is similar to that of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., whose retirement last June created the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
