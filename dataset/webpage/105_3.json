The first in her family to graduate from university, Ameer has earned a bachelor of health studies, graduating summa cum laude, and is the recipient of the Murray G. Ross Award.\n\nThe award, which is typically presented during spring convocation, recognizes one student for outstanding academic excellence and significant contributions to the University and campus life. It is considered one of York University\u2019s highest honours for a graduating student.\n\nAmeer, who specialized in health-care management, says she feels honoured to win the award and \u201cbe part of an extraordinary group of students who previously won.\u201d And though it was her own dedication to academia and university life that earned her the recognition, she credits her mentors \u2013 Lynda Van Dreumel (undergraduate program director, School of Health Policy and Management); Professor Ellen Schraa (School of Health Policy and Management); and York University President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda L. Lenton \u2013 for their guidance throughout her undergraduate journey.\n\nShe describes her academic experience at York as one rich with hands-on learning and experiential education (EE) opportunities. During her years of study within the School of Health Policy and Management, she contributed to the development of course designs and potential placements for a practicum course. She also provided advice on ways to increase EE initiatives and suggested opportunities that would enrich the Health Studies program.\n\nHer academic performance is notable, and in her first year Ameer was admitted to the Golden Key International Honours Society for ranking among the top 15 per cent of students in the Faculty of Health. She has earned a place on the Dean\u2019s Honour Roll every year, and in her final year was named the top graduating student in the Health Studies program based on her academic achievements and contributions made to improving undergraduate student life on campus.\n\nAmeer is a recipient of the Canadian International Model United Nations (UN) Organization Award for the best health policy recommendations in the World Health Organization committee, and the Outstanding Delegate Award for her debate performance at the Ryerson Model United Nations Conference in 2018. York has recognized her with the York University Continuing Student Scholarship for academic achievements, as well as the Calumet and Stong College Leadership Award for contributions to the Faculty of Health.\n\n\u201cMy passion for social impact and helping others inspired me to pursue a degree in health studies,\u201d she says, adding that combined with her interest in business leadership, health-care management felt like the right fit. In her fourth year, she completed a practicum at the Toronto Grace Hospital in downtown Toronto, where she worked on a research project to improve family and patient experience.\n\nAlso heavily involved in extracurricular and leadership opportunities on campus, Ameer contributed to campus life through several student clubs and organizations. In her second year, she served as president of Doctors without Borders and as vice-president of York\u2019s Model United Nations team. During the past two years, she worked closely with the University, serving as a president\u2019s ambassador, student-alumni ambassador and student representative on York\u2019s Marketing Committee. She was also selected to represent Canada at the United Nations Youth Assembly taking place at the UN headquarters in New York City.\n\n\u201cMy extracurricular activities allowed me to create a connection between what I was learning in the classroom and real-world events,\u201d says Ameer. \u201cIn my second year, I took a health policy course, while at the same time volunteering with the Heart and Stroke Foundation to persuade legislators to implement a value-added tax on all vaping products in Ontario. My extracurriculars helped shape my academic success, as I developed a new way of thinking about course material. I understood how my coursework directly impacted everyday decisions in health care and solutions that could be created to address challenges.\u201d\n\nAmeer says her most valuable learning experience at York didn\u2019t take place in lecture hall, but instead at a place that represents the future of the University: the grounds for the Markham Centre Campus. In October 2020, she was invited as the student representative for the campus groundbreaking ceremony, where she was asked to speak.\n\n\u201cI was given the opportunity to present what the Markham Campus means to the student body and the future of York University,\u201d she says. \u201cI was truly humbled to share the platform with the President of York University, Rhonda Lenton, along with several cabinet ministers from the federal and provincial governments. Throughout my undergraduate degree I developed an interest in law and politics, so being able to share the platform with politicians made me realize that one day I could become a politician myself.\u201d\n\nThe experience had a great impact on Ameer, and she plans to attend law school and run for public office in the future, as well as contribute time as a volunteer to non-profit organizations and community groups to further her interest in social justice.\n\n\u201cYork University is a second home for me and holds a special place in my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cThe community is so tightly knit, where everyone wants to help one another and become changemakers in their field. We are a close family who have each other\u2019s backs and are willing to step up when it is time for action.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/49722/did-i-get-or-take-my-degree-from-or-in-the-university-of-somewhere", "page_content": "Firstly, a master's degree is not proper and therefore does not require capitalization, but personally I've seen several highly professional institutions spell it both ways.\n\nSeeing as how all three of those sentences are grammatically sound, it's more a question of etiquette or regional custom.

Ross Award. Named after York\u2019s founding president and adjudicated by the Senate Committee on Admissions, Recruitment & Student Assistance (SCARSA), the medal recognizes academic distinction and notable contributions to campus life. It is the highest honour given to a graduating undergraduate student at York.\n\nAbove: Sky Fairchild-Waller. Photo by Andrea de Keijzer\n\nIn a letter to Fairchild-Waller notifying and congratulating him on the award, SCARSA Chair Tony Fang wrote: \u201cThe selection committee was impressed both by your academic excellence and by your outstanding record of leadership, mentorship and outreach, both within the University and in the community\u2026. You are an exemplary role model for students at York University.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was elated when I received notice of the award,\u201d said Fairchild-Waller. \u201cTo be selected out of thousands of graduating students is such an honour. I\u2019m especially proud to be recognized as a student from the Faculty of Fine Arts.\u201d\n\nEnumerating Fairchild-Waller\u2019s many merits, Faculty of Fine Arts Dean Barbara Sellers-Young, Dance Department Chair Mary Jane Warner and Lynda Tam, director of academic affairs in the Faculty of Fine Arts, applauded the selection committee\u2019s choice.\n\n\u201cA glance at Sky\u2019s resum\u00e9 shows his extensive engagement as an artist, scholar and leader,\u201d said Sellers-Young. \u201cA Fellow of Winters College, Canadian delegate at The New Humanism Symposium at Harvard University, choreographer for a project at Toronto\u2019s Alternative Arts & Fashion Week, performer in Constance Cooke\u2019s film Stalls, assistant curator for the Tubman Institute\u2019s Performing Diaspora series \u2014 these are just a few of the credits that illustrate his many talents and his leadership ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cSky is a wonderful student who truly enjoys learning and pushes himself to excel in everything he undertakes, both in academic settings and extracurricular activities,\u201d said Warner. \u201cHe clearly enjoys intellectual challenges and is an active participant in every course he takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSky is a natural communicator; he conveys enthusiasm and the empowering sense that, with commitment and energy, anything is possible,\u201d said Tam. \u201cHe\u2019s been an integral part of planning and participation in the Fine Arts Senior Mentoring Program, which pairs exceptional upper-level students with first-year students looking for guidance in their transition to university life. He was also a Fine Arts student ambassador and, in this capacity, was on the front line of Faculty recruitment initiatives.\u201d\n\nFairchild-Waller\u2019s other contributions include serving as a student senator on the York University Senate; Fine Arts councillor for the York Federation of Students; council speaker and vice-president of academic & university affairs for the Creative Arts Student Association; and member of the Undergraduate Committee and the Chair\u2019s Advisory Committee in the Department of Dance. Outside of York, he\u2019s been active as an alumni representative for the National Ballet School of Canada and as a student member of the Society of Dance History Scholars and the Canadian Alliance of Dance Artists.\n\nRecent artistic achievements include choreographic commissions for Oak Bay Dance in his hometown of Victoria, BC, for the New England School of Dance, and for a dance film for Brazilian artist Carla Zaccagnini\u2019s North American premiere solo exhibition and residency at the Art Gallery of York University. He was also commissioned to choreograph for the Canadian premiere of Disney\u2019s High School Musical 2 On Stage! in which he performed the lead role of Ryan Evans. The show, held at the Toronto Centre for the Arts last March, sold out months before opening and was extended twice due to popular demand.\n\nWhen asked what were his most significant experiences and influences at York, Fairchild-Waller hesitated, saying it was too difficult to choose.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t single out one experience as being the most influential,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all complemented my studies so much. I know I did gain substantial insight from being involved with multiple levels of University governance, from the Department of Dance to the Faculty of Fine Arts to the University as a whole. I\u2019m so grateful for the variety of experiences that were available to me during my time at York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned something from virtually everyone I\u2019ve met here; in that sense, everyone is a mentor. It\u2019s commonly understood that the people you go to school with will be the people you work with after graduation, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing these relationships in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nThis summer brings Fairchild-Waller the opportunity to build new relationships. He has been chosen as one of three young artists representing Ontario in the National Artist Program, a two-week mentorship residency at the 2009 Canada Summer Games taking place August 15 to 29 in Charlottetown, P.E.I. Together with 36 other youth from across the country, he will be working with and learning from 30 professional artists, and will perform in the opening and closing ceremonies, pep rallies and community festivals throughout the games.\n\nYork dance alumna Marlene Stirrett-Matson (BFA Spec. Hons. \u201983, MA \u201902), the manager of the National Artist Program for Team Ontario, will be a valuable mentor and sounding board for Fairchild-Waller during the experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure of starting to work with Sky and the other artists, so I am definitely getting to know this remarkable young man,\u201d said Stirrett-Matson. \u201cI hope he has an exciting, challenging and richly creative experience, learning, collaborating and sharing with professional mentors and artists from across the country.\u201d\n\nTo track Fairchild-Waller at the games, look for artist updates on the Team Ontario daily newsletter.\n\nAfter the games, Fairchild-Waller plans to continue studies in the Faculty of Fine Arts at York. He\u2019ll be returning this fall to complete the final year of his second undergraduate degree, in cultural studies."}, {"url": "https://educationnewscanada.com/article/education/level/university/1/907968/health-studies-graduate-recognized-with-murray-g-ross-award.html", "page_content": "Sorry, this is not allowed\n\n\n\nYou have requested a Web page or resource that you aren't allowed to access.

Like Peter Shor was saying, it's not wrong to say that you took your master's degree in somewhere but you may have to use caution repeating prepositions.\n\ne.g. I took my master's degree in astrophysics in the University of Somewhere\n\nUsing in twice is potentially awkward in situations where you may need to elaborate on your area of study.\n\nTo answer your question, all of those examples are grammatically strong and should get the message across appropriately anywhere you go.\n\nOn an editorial note, however, there are some ways to bypass this dilemma by opting for more colorful words:\n\nI (received, earned, attained) a master's degree after (studying in/at, attending, graduating from) the University of Somewhere.\n\nPlay it right and you'll sound like a Nobel Laureate, but all of your sentences will work well; none of them is really noticeably better, even on paper."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/your-course/graduation-and-what-next/cambridge-ma", "page_content": "In most UK universities, the Master of Arts is a degree awarded by examination. At Cambridge, the MA is conferred by right on holders of the BA degree of the University and on certain other senior members and is not available as a postgraduate qualification.\n\nPossession of the MA, or any other Cambridge masters degree or doctorate, confers membership of the University Senate. This gives the right to:\n\nparticipate in Discussions (part of the University's decision-making process)\n\nvote in the election of a new Chancellor or High Steward\n\nborrow books from the University Library\n\nMany colleges also offer their senior members the opportunity to dine at High Table on a certain number of occasions each year.\n\nThis method of conferment of the MA also exists at the universities of Oxford and Dublin.\n\nGetting your MA\n\nA Bachelor of Arts may be admitted to Master of Arts not less than six years from the end of his or her first term of residence, provided that a supplicat for the latter degree may only be entered after the former degree has been conferred.\n\nThis removes the previous requirement for the B.A. Degree to be held for two years before the M.A. can be conferred.\n\nSomeone who qualified for the BA but has never had it conferred cannot be entered for the MA, even if the necessary time has passed since the end of their first term of residence, unless and until the BA has been conferred on them.\n\nFurther details are available from your college, which will usually inform you when you become eligible.\n\nThe MA may also be conferred, under Statute B.II.2, on Heads and Fellows of Colleges and on University Officers who are not Cambridge graduates after (except in the case of Heads and Professors) three years in post.\n\nDegrees by Incorporation\n\nGraduates of the Universities of Oxford or Dublin who hold a post in the University of Cambridge or in a Cambridge College have the privilege of being admitted to an equivalent Cambridge degree 'by incorporation' under Statute B.II.2.

We do not always have hard-and-fast rules to rely on; some areas are open to interpretation. This is evident in the area of capitalization of academic degrees as you will see from the different approaches of two of the leading American English reference books:\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) recommends that names of degrees, fellowships, and the like are lowercased when referred to generically, but to capitalize the name of a degree when it is displayed on a resume, business card, diploma, alumni directory, or anywhere it looks like a title rather than a description. Proper nouns, of course, should still be capitalized.\n\nExamples:\n\nOrlando is pursuing a bachelor of science in civil engineering.\n\nOrlando is pursuing a bachelor of arts in English.\n\nHe introduced Jennifer Miller, Master of Fine Arts.\n\nHe introduced Master of Fine Arts Jennifer Miller.\n\nThe Associated Press Stylebook (AP) recommends no capitals when referring to degrees in general terms (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctorate, associate degree) but always capitalizing specific degrees (Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science). AP is in agreement with CMOS that the field of study be written in lower case except when it contains a proper noun.\n\nExamples:\n\nOrlando is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in civil engineering.\n\nOrlando is pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in English.\n\nOrlando is thinking about getting a master\u2019s degree.\n\nHe introduced Jennifer Miller, Master of Fine Arts.\n\nOur recommendation is to pick your resource and then be consistent.\n\nThere is agreement, however, that abbreviations of academic degrees are to be capitalized. CMOS recommends omitting periods unless required for tradition or consistency (BA, BS, MA, MS, PhD), but AP prefers retaining the periods (B.A., B.S., M.A., M.S., Ph.D.).\n\nPop Quiz\n\nThe keynote speaker tonight will be Juris Doctor/juris doctor Michael Abercrombie.

These include the wider education sector (particularly with secondary schools), linguistic and cultural groups, creative, theatrical and performing groups, embassies, government, business organisations, historical organisations, international organisations, and industrial and professional groups or organisations.\n\nM\u0101ori and Indigenous Studies, for example, have direct links to the Waitangi Tribunal, the Royal Society and the Waikato District Health Board to name a few.

History has close links with the New Zealand Historical Association and English with Creative New Zealand and the Fulbright Foundation.\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nOur subjects equip MA graduates for specific careers. For instance, a M\u0101ori and Indigenous Studies graduate might become a director or producer, a public relations and marketing executive, a cultural advisor, a social policy planner, or a researcher. A Screen and Media Studies MA graduate might become a media relations adviser, a media research executive, a professional fundraiser, a public affairs specialist, a public relations consultant or a journalist. History, M\u0101ori and Indigenous Studies or Pacific and Indigenous Studies MA graduates might become historians, museum curators, heritage researchers or work in community development (for instance, with tribal authorities).
