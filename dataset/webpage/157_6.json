West of Ontario, the territory now called Manitoba was part of Rupert\u2019s Land. It was split between First Nations, European settlers, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (HBC) and a M\u00e9tis population (people of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry). The Assiniboine, Dakota, Cree and the Dene peoples had occupied the land for 12,000 to 15,000 years. The Ojibwa had arrived about 300 years ago.\n\nBeginning in 1670, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company controlled the vast territory of Rupert\u2019s Land. It included all of modern-day Manitoba. The company tried to limit white settlement in the region to maintain its fur trade monopoly. But after 1812, European migrants began arriving in earnest. Many settled in land granted by the British Crown to Lord Selkirk, at the forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in what is now Winnipeg. (See also The Forks.) It became known as the Red River Colony.\n\nMap of 1817 showing Lord Selkirk's Grant of 116,000 square miles known as Assiniboia, including the forts.\n\nTransfer of Rupert\u2019s Land (1869\u201370)\n\nThe United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. This prompted fears in the Canadian and British governments that the US would try to take control of all the territory west and north of the Dominion of Canada, including Rupert\u2019s Land. Determined that Rupert\u2019s Land should be Canadian, the government of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, with help from Britain, purchased the territory from the HBC. No residents of the area \u2014 including the First Nations, M\u00e9tis and European settlers \u2014 were consulted about the transfer to Canada.\n\nThe HBC signed the deed of transfer surrendering its territory to the British Crown on 19 November 1869. The Crown, in turn, ceded the land to Canada. However, because of the political disruption of the Red River Resistance, the transfer did not come into effect until 15 July 1870.\n\nFathers of Confederation\n\nThe Fathers of Confederation are the men who attended one or more of the conferences at Charlottetown, Quebec and London. William McDougall, Manitoba\u2019s first lieutenant-governor, is considered a Father of Confederation for Manitoba.\n\nA journalist and politician from Ontario, McDougall was a proponent of Confederation. He firmly believed that the only way out of the political impasse between Canada West and Canada East, and the only way to prevent Canada from becoming irrelevant in North America, was a union of the British colonies and expansion westward. He attended all three Confederation conferences \u2014 Charlottetown, Quebec and London.\n\nMcDougall was minister of public works in Sir John A. Macdonald\u2019s government (1867). He introduced the resolution that led to the government\u2019s purchase of Rupert's Land. He was also present in London to negotiate the acquisition of Rupert\u2019s Land in 1868. On 28 September 1869, McDougall was named lieutenant-governor of Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory. He held that title until 12 May 1870 when Manitoba became a province.\n\nWilliam McDougall, June 1872.\n\nOn 30 October 1869, McDougall and his entourage entered the North-Western Territory via the United States. The convoy was turned back by the National Committee of the M\u00e9tis of Red River on 2 November before McDougall could establish his authority at Fort Garry. The M\u00e9tis were angered that McDougall had sent a team of land surveyors to the Territory before a deal with the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company had been brokered. This was one of a series of events that precipitated the Red River Resistance.\n\n\n\nMcDougall then became a vocal opponent to the admission of Manitoba to Confederation. He argued that it did not possess a large enough population. Louis Riel is considered a founder of Manitoba. But he is not officially recognized as a Father of Confederation. His inclusion as one is the subject of much debate.\n\nPortrait of Louis Riel, 1873.\n\nRed River Resistance (1869\u201370)\n\nMany Indigenous people opposed the transfer of Rupert\u2019s Land to the new Canadian government. But the stiffest resistance came from the M\u00e9tis of the Red River Colony. They feared the loss of their land, their Roman Catholic religion, and their culture under Canadian control. In 1869, under Louis Riel, the M\u00e9tis declared their own provisional government. It announced that it would negotiate the colony\u2019s terms of entry into Confederation. A group of Protestants from Ontario, including Thomas Scott, disagreed with Riel\u2019s group. Scott was court-martialed by Riel and executed by firing squad. (See Red River Resistance.)\n\nAfter a long standoff followed by lengthy negotiations in Ottawa, the resistance came to an end. The Red River colonists agreed to enter Confederation. Four successive lists of rights were drafted by the provisional government; the final version became the basis of the Manitoba Act of 1870 (the federal legislation that created Manitoba). The final list demanded that Manitoba be admitted into Confederation as a province, not a territory; that the lieutenant governor of the new province speak both English and French; and that members of the provisional government not face legal consequences for their actions in the Resistance. Nevertheless, Riel feared prosecution for his execution of Thomas Scott. He fled to the US as British and Canadian troops arrived in the area.\n\nRiel's (centre) first provisional government, 1869.\n\nManitoba Act (1870)\n\nThe Manitoba Act received royal assent and became law on 12 May 1870. The Act gave Canada the lands it wanted; it created Manitoba as a \u201cpostage stamp-sized\u201d province around the Red River Valley, amid the vast expanse of the North-West Territories. It granted the M\u00e9tis title to their lands on the Assiniboine and Red Rivers.\n\nThe Manitoba Act essentially established a M\u00e9tis province. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald thought the creation of a new province was premature. With its small population and size, it could not support itself financially.\n\nDespite Macdonald's reluctance, Manitoba entered Canada as a province. English and French-language rights were safeguarded in the new legislature and the courts. Protestant and Roman Catholic educational rights were protected, but the right to education in either English or French was not. Ottawa agreed to pay subsidies to the new provincial government; roughly 1,400,000 acres of land were set aside for the M\u00e9tis; and the province received four seats in the federal Parliament \u2014 strong representation considering the small population.\n\nUnlike in other provinces at the time, the federal government retained control of Manitoba\u2019s natural resources. Unallocated land was especially important; it would be sold to support the building of a Pacific railway. (See Canadian Pacific Railway.) The railway became an important hub for immigration. The new province of Manitoba thus entered Confederation as a province unlike the original four. Its creation revealed Ottawa\u2019s desire to control western development and access to resources.\n\nSir John Alexander Macdonald, lawyer, businessman and the first prime minister of Canada.\n\nNorth-West Resistance (1885)\n\nBy the late 1870s, the Plains Indigenous nations of the West \u2014 the Cree, Siksika, Kainai, Piikani, and Saulteaux \u2014 were facing disaster. The great bison herds had disappeared, pushing people to near starvation. Much of their land had also been signed away in treaties. In 1880, Cree chief Mistahimaskwa (Big Bear) and Siksika chief Isapo-muxika (Crowfoot) founded the Blackfoot Confederacy to try to solve their people\u2019s grievances.\n\nMeanwhile the M\u00e9tis people \u2014 still feeling vulnerable after the Red River Resistance \u2014 had grievances of their own. Their old life as fur traders and carriers for the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company was disappearing, along with the bison on which they too depended. They were also waiting, without much help from the distant federal government, for reassurance that title to their homesteads and farms would be guaranteed. Poor harvests in 1883 and 1884 added to the province\u2019s problems, along with an unsympathetic Dominion government back East.\n\nIn the summer of 1884, Louis Riel returned from exile in the US. That fall, he urged M\u00e9tis and non-M\u00e9tis settlers alike to sign a petition. On 8 March 1885, the M\u00e9tis passed a 10-point \u201cRevolutionary Bill of Rights.\u201d It asserted M\u00e9tis land claims and made demands of the Canadian government.\n\nGroup photograph in the square of the North-West Mounted Police Barracks in Regina, Saskatchewan, with Poundmaker (lower right) and Big Bear (second from left), 1885.\n\nThat March, armed resistors formed a provisional government and named Riel president. The M\u00e9tis-led forces occupied Duck Lake near Batoche, in present-day Saskatchewan. On 26 March, 100 North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) constables and citizen volunteers went to Duck Lake. The M\u00e9tis and Indigenous resistance met the police outside the village. In the clash, 12 NWMP constables and six resistance fighters were killed.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian government sent 3,000 soldiers to join the 2,000 already stationed in the West. They ran into staunch resistance from forces such as Big Bear\u2019s. He objected to Canada\u2019s plans to move his people onto a reserve. His warriors launched small-scale attacks on priests, an Indian agent and a trader, killing several people. The two sides fought again in the Battle of Batoche; Cree chief Poundmaker led the Indigenous forces to victory.\n\nCanadian forces pressed on, capturing Batoche in May. Riel surrendered on 15 May. The resistance\u2019s last act played out on 3 June at Loon Lake, with a small skirmish between the two sides. On 26 May, Poundmaker and other Indigenous leaders surrendered to Canadian troops. Riel was executed on 16 November 1885, followed by Cree leader Wandering Spirit on 27 November. The North-West Resistance was finished.\n\nA Louis Riel sculpture, a Canadian folk hero and founder of the Province of Manitoba.\n\nLand Rights and Numbered Treaties\n\nCanada mismanaged its promise to guarantee the M\u00e9tis rights to their land. After Manitoba entered Confederation, an influx of settlers from Ontario threatened to overwhelm the previous inhabitants.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government signed a series of Numbered Treaties with First Nations in Manitoba and other parts of the West. These treaties separately spelled out each First Nations\u2019 constitutional relationship to the Crown. The treaties provided the federal government with land for industrial development and White settlement. The terms of agreement of the treaties are controversial and contested. (Hayden King, the director of the Centre of Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University, has argued that First Nations view the treaties as sharing agreements, while Canada views them as land surrenders.) The Numbered Treaties continue to this day to have legal and socioeconomic impacts on Indigenous communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration and Boundaries\n\nBetween 1876 and 1881, some 40,000 migrants from Ontario settled in Manitoba. They pushed north past established boundaries and greatly expanded the new province. Settlers from Iceland, as well as Mennonite migrants and others populated the area.\n\nIn 1881, after years of political wrangling with the federal government, the province\u2019s boundaries were extended to their present western position; they were also extended farther east, and north to 53\u00b0 N lat. The current boundaries of the province were set in 1912.

Jones Chris Garforth\n\nGwyn E. Jones is Senior Lecturer, Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Department, and Chris Garforth is Senior Lecturer and Head of the Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Department, both at The University of Reading, United Kingdom.\n\nAgricultural extension work has a venerable, albeit largely unrecorded, history. It is a significant social innovation, an important force in agricultural change, which has been created and recreated, adapted and developed over the centuries. Its evolution extends over nearly four thousand years, although its modem forms are largely a product of the past two centuries. Today, the organizations and personnel engaged in agricultural extension encompass a diverse range of socially sanctioned and legitimate activities which seek to enlarge and improve the abilities of farm people to adopt more appropriate and often new practices and to adjust to changing conditions and societal needs.\n\nThe use of the word \"extension\" derives from an educational development in England during the second half of the nineteenth century. Around 1850, discussions began in the two ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge about how they could serve the educational needs, near to their homes, of the rapidly growing populations in the industrial, urban area. It was not until 1867 that a first practical attempt was made in what was designated \"university extension,\" but the activity developed quickly to become a well-established movement before the end of the century. Initially, most of the lectures given were on literary and social topics, but by the 1890s agricultural subjects were being covered by peripatetic lecturers in rural areas (Jones, 1994). The growth and success of this work in Britain influenced the initiation of similar activity elsewhere, especially in the United States. There, in many states, comparable out-of-college lectures were becoming established by the 1890s (True, 1900, 1928). During the first two decades of this century, the extramural work of the land-grant colleges, concerned with serving the needs of farm families, was to expand dramatically and become formally organized; but the use of the term \"extension\" continued and has persisted as the designation for the work.\n\nThe overt use of the notion of \"extending\" relevant and useful information to the adult population at large, however, predates the university extension movement. Earlier in the nineteenth century, a British politician, Lord Henry Brougham, an influential advocate of formal eduction for the poor and of mass adult education, founded the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in 1826. Its objective was \"imparting useful information to all classes of the community, particularly to such as are unable to avail themselves of experienced teachers, or may prefer learning by themselves.\" The society sought to do this largely through producing low-priced publications and establishing local committees throughout the country \"for extending the object of the Society\" (Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge 1827). During its twenty years' existence, agricultural topics were well covered in the society's publications. Similar, albeit short-lived, societies were also established before 1840 in several other European countries, India, China, Malaysia, and the United States (in Virginia) (Grobel, 1933; Smith, 1972).\n\nThe dissemination of relevant information and advice to farmers, however, has a long if chequered history prior to the emergence of modem forms of agricultural extension in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe first known example was in Mesopotamia (roughly, present-day Iraq) around 1800 B.C. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets of the time on which were inscribed advice on watering crops and getting rid of rats - important for mitigating any potential loss of taxation revenue from farmers (Ahmed, 1982, as quoted in Bne Saad, 1990). Some hieroglyphs on Egyptian columns also gave advice on avoiding crop damage and loss of life from the Nile's floods. An important advance was the beginning of agricultural writings. Though few have survived, the earliest were written during the ancient Greek and Phoenician civilizations, but some of them were adapted by Roman writers. From the second century B.C. to the fourth century A.D., several important Latin texts were written, frequently drawing on practical farming experience, which aimed to help Roman landowners to maintain and improve then-estates and their revenues (White, 1970, 1977).\n\nAt around the same period in imperial China, early forms of advancing and disseminating agricultural information also began. That landowners and their tenants should improve their production was a matter of concern to the state since, from the sixth century B.C. onwards, it relied heavily on land taxes for its revenues. The support of relevant agricultural research and the dissemination of information and advice had certainly begun by the late Han Dynasty (25-220 A.D.). The oldest fully surviving Chinese agricultural treatise, Essential Techniques/or the Peasantry, dating from 535 A.D., aimed to show landowners how to improve their estate management through the advice they gave to their tenants. The Sung and Yuan Dynasties (960-1368) with their firm local government administrations were notable in organizing and promoting agricultural research, extension work, and the teaching of agriculture and sericulture, much facilitated by the invention of woodblock printing, which allowed agricultural treatises and practical handbooks to be widely distributed. Similar activities continued during the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Chi'ing (1644-1912) Dynasties, driven not only by the growing population and periodic threats of famine, but also by the state's recognition of the importance of well-coordinated extension work on agricultural recommendations if the most benefit was to be achieved (Perkins, 1969; Elvin, 1973; Bray, 1984; Delman, 1991).\n\nApart from the importance of farmers and agriculture in the society and economy concerned, several conditions appear to be necessary for the initiation and organized development of agricultural extension work.\n\nThe prime condition is that information has been assembled, systematized, and made available on good or progressive or new agricultural practices suited to a particular environment, and is based on either (or both) the accumulation of experience or findings from research (however rudimentary). Second, this information is used, among other things, to educate professional agriculturists who may further enlarge or refine this body of knowledge or become active promoters and disseminators of it. Third, an appropriate administrative or organizational structure exists by and within which the dissemination activities may be established and conducted. Fourth, there is a legislative or some other official mandate or influential proponent which prescribes or enables that agricultural extension work is desirable and must occur. Fifth, there are invariably a variety of antecedents which have attempted protoforms of agricultural information and advice dissemination. In addition, the incidence of critical situations, such as famine, crop failure, soil exhaustion, or altered economic conditions or relationships, may create an immediate cause for initiating the organization of extension work. All or several of these conditions have been present in the evolution of modem forms of agricultural extension.\n\nThe direct antecedents of organized agricultural research and dissemination of its results which occurred in nineteenth century Europe and North America can be traced back to the \"renaissance\" which began in the fourteenth century. Between 1300 and 1700, European society became transformed from its medieval feudal forms into recognizably modem social systems. It was a period of complex, multistranded development. Along with the growth of national states and European exploration and \"discovery\" of the rest of the world was the \"new learning.\" This involved not only a fresh appreciation of rediscovered classical writings and art forms, but also many novel ideas and activities, a spirit of humanism, and rational enquiry. All of this was considerably facilitated by the invention of printing using movable type, usually attributed to Gutenberg around 1450, and the rapid diffusion over Europe of the printing press, for whose output there existed a ready market.\n\nThe earliest known renaissance agricultural text was written in Latin by Pietro de Crescenzi in 1304 and was translated into Italian and French. This became the first book on agriculture to be printed in the mid-fifteenth century. Others soon followed, often based on the old Latin texts or on the collected wisdom of farmers and their families. A well-known example, a compendium of helpful advice in simple verse and a bestseller in Tudor England, was Thomas Tusser's A hundredth goode pointes of husbandrie, published in 1557 and expanded in 1573 to five hundred good points with as many on \"goode housewiferie\" (Tusser, 1580). Less popular, but of greater significance, were Francis Bacon's writings early in the next century based on his observations and scientific experiments on his estate north of London - the beginnings of the application of science and scientific method to agriculture (Russell, 1966).\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, throughout much of Europe, progressive landowners (frequently aristocrats) and their agents and a few similarly minded farmers were being known as \"improvers.\" These, along with some \"men of science,\" were the main proponents of agricultural clubs or societies. At their regular meetings and demonstrations, locally and regionally, landowners and leading farmers exchanged ideas and information and discussed farming improvements. Two main forces underlay the movement. First, many landowners were eager to learn of ways to improve their estates and the production capabilities of their tenants so as to increase the value of their estates and their rental incomes. Secondly, progress was being made towards modern science and its application to agriculture, especially in agricultural chemistry and plant physiology (Russell, 1966). These societies sought to alter radically the traditional modes of farming by initiating experiments, arranging demonstrations, disseminating information, and advocating the adoption of innovations. It was considered almost a duty by their elite membership to make their initiatives and activities known to \"the generality\" of farmers through publishing their proceedings and reporting their meetings in newspapers (Hudson, 1972). Although such agricultural societies initially spread slowly - the first had been formed at Rezzato near Milan in 1548 (Coletti, 1900) - they had become common throughout much of Europe by 1800, and a small number had been established by that year in the young United States and eastern Canada.\n\nIt is not possible, here, to enter into detail on the interactions between a growing scientific knowledge of agriculture and its application in practice, the many examples of increasingly widespread agricultural improvement, and the numerous personalities involved in Europe and North America during the century or so after 1750. Reference must, however, be made to one figure whose ideas and activities were of pivotal significance to the developments of the time, and later. This was Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg (1771-1844), who in 1799 purchased the estate of Wylhof, which he renamed Hofwyl, near Bern in Switzerland (Gray, 1952; Guggisberg, 1953). Over the next decade or so, he established agricultural schools at Hofwyl for the children of peasants and of the poor and for the aristocracy and their agents. Although not the first agricultural schools in Europe, those of von Fellenberg became a model for many more which were established before 1850, especially in Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, thus assuring a cadre of trained agriculturists.\n\nAt Hofwyl, von Fellenberg also established an experimental-cum-model farm to test and develop suitable husbandry practices and technology. He publicised the work at this veritable \"educational colony\" through a journal and agricultural festivals (shows) at Hofwyl and by welcoming a large number of visitors from all over Europe and maintaining a voluminous correspondence with these and others. Many of his visitors became active proselytes of his methods, recognizing their practical value in disseminating useful information on agriculture - and other topics. One such notable visitor was Lord Henry Brougham, referred to earlier, who became the main publicist of von Fellenberg's work in Britain and whose Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge was an early form of organized \"extension.\"\n\nBy the 1820s, most of the elements for creating modem forms of agricultural extension were in being, although each was to develop considerably during the nineteenth century. A crucial missing element, however, was an effective means by which the \"generality\" of farmers could be directly given information, advice, and encouragement. This required itinerant agriculturists who could meet farmers in their home localities, give instructional talks and demonstrations, advocate superior or new practices, and have discussions with the farmers. The notion of \"itinerancy\" was not new: since late medieval times, tradesmen and proto-professional men had travelled through rural areas to serve their clients. The first examples of itinerant agricultural lecturers-cum-instructors were in parts of New England and New York in the 1820s (True, 1928) and in France, where a first migratory agricultural teacher was appointed in the Gironde in 1837, followed by nine more in various areas of the country in succeeding years (Boulet n.d.). During the 1840s, further sporadic developments also occurred in the United States, particularly in New York, Ohio, and Maryland (True, 1928), while in W\u00fcrttemberg, in southwest Germany, a pasture specialist (Wiesenbaumeister) together with a staff of eighteen technicians was employed by the state agricultural society to advise farmers, landowners, and town administrations on land drainage, irrigation, and improved pasture management (CLVS, 1845).\n\nIn Europe, agricultural science was evolving rapidly by the 1840s, with notable strides being made in Germany by Justus von Liebig at Giessen, and with the establishment of agricultural experiments at Rothamsted in England in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes and Henry Gilbert. Agricultural societies and their shows were flourishing. Numerous publications and periodicals were aimed at farmers. Agricultural schools, if not commonplace, had been established in most European countries. Thus a small minority of younger landowners and farmers had received a formal education in their calling, while purposely trained agriculturists were available to be engaged as estate agents or teachers. Many of the more progressive landowners employed agents to travel around their estates to urge improved methods on their tenants. The main element necessary to create modern agricultural extension services was for legitimate authorities to establish the necessary organizations - and the germ of this had already been present in France, Germany, and the United States.\n\nThe first agricultural extension service of a modem kind came into existence as the result of a crisis and the initiative of the occupant of a high office of authority. The crisis was the outbreak of potato blight in Europe in 1845. In Ireland its effects were particularly severe because the predominantly peasant population relied on potatoes in their diet, and \"the potato famine\" persisted until 1851. The new British viceroy appointed to Ireland in 1847, the Earl of Clarendon, soon after his arrival in Dublin wrote a letter (Jones, 1982) to the president of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland (founded in 1841), which acted as the central society for numerous local agricultural societies. This letter, no less than an official directive, urged the society to appoint itinerant lecturers to travel around the most distressed districts to inform and show small farmers, in simple terms, how to improve their cultivation and how to grow nutritious root crops other than potatoes. \"Lord Clarendon's practical instructors in husbandry,\" as they became known, were centrally appointed, deployed, and paid and reported weekly to the society in Dublin, with some local control of their activities being exercised by the major landowners in their areas. Over the four years of its existence, the scheme was funded to about half its total cost by landowners and charitable donations, with the remainder coming from government-controlled funds (Jones, 1979, 1981).\n\nThe potato famine also led to consideration being given in W\u00fcrttemberg to employing itinerant farm advisers, but the proposal failed to gain approval (R. B\u00fchler, personal communication). However, from the mid-1850s, first in W\u00fcrttemberg, Hesse, and western Prussia, itinerant agricultural teachers (Wanderlehrer) began to be appointed under the auspices of central agricultural societies. After some ten years, the system grew rapidly, influenced in part by the crisis among vine growers resulting from the devastation caused by phylloxera aphid infestations, and became formalized (Jones, 1981). Normally, the Wanderlehrer spent the summer half of the year travelling around their districts giving talks, demonstrations, and advice to farmers; during the remainder of the year they taught farmers' sons at winter agricultural schools. Although officially they were part of the activities of the agricultural associations, their work was in all cases supported heavily by state funds, and their advice was free to farmers. When the system was adopted in the kingdom of Bavaria in 1896, it was as an integral part of the state civil service; the extension workers were grandly titled Royal Agricultural Teachers (K\u00f6nigliche Landwirtschafts-lehrer) (Maier-Bode, 1910).\n\nBy the close of the nineteenth century, agricultural extension systems modelled to a considerable extent on the German Wanderlehrer had spread: to Denmark from 1870 onwards; to the Netherlands, where a few extension workers (wandelleraren) had been appointed by agricultural societies in the late 1840s and 1850s, but had then disappeared before being revived as a government system in the 1890s; to Italy, where the first itinerant agricultural teacher (cattedra ambulante di agricoltura) was appointed in 1886 at Rovigo, near the estuary of the River Po, with many others following in the next decade and funded largely by public donations, the church, and the banks; to Switzerland; to much of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; and to Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, in France the first national, wholly state-funded agricultural extension service was established in 1879. The few itinerant agriculturalists appointed before 1848 (referred to earlier) had continued, but they served in only a very small minority of the country's departements. In 1874, the minister of public instruction in the reforming Third Republic issued a circular letter strongly commending the system and advocating its extension (J. d'Agric. Prat., 1874, p. 257-258). This resulted in an additional thirty-three itinerant agricultural teachers being appointed by departements over the next five years, and a law passed in 1879 officially instituted the office of a department-level itinerant agricultural teacher (professeur departmental d'agriculture). This law was given practical effect by a decree in 1880 and an explanatory ministerial circular early in 1881 (Min. de l'Agric., 1882, p. 8-9). From then on, each professeur was a state-appointed civil servant. His duties included giving agricultural instruction to trainee primary school teachers. Mainly, however, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, he was to be \"nomadic\" within his departement, \"to keep farmers informed regarding modem discoveries and new inventions which could be applied economically and with advantage,\" \"to be a populariser (vulgarisateur) of progress,\" \"to carry enlightenment into the heart of the countryside.\" The number of these extension workers grew rapidly, and by the end of the 1880s the whole of France was being served (Jones, 1981).\n\nThe growth of agricultural education and extension work in continental Europe was to have a strong impact on the emergence of comparable activity in the United Kingdom. An official commission on technical education in the early 1880s included a detailed review of the European developments (Jenkins, 1884). At the end of the decade, a cluster of enactment's, which established county-based local government, created a board of agriculture, promoted technical (including agricultural) education, and allocated funds for the purpose, enabled agricultural extension work to be initiated. It was to be part of the services provided by the local government authorities. They either employed their own agricultural officer or more commonly sponsored lectures and travelling schools on agriculture (especially dairying) as part of the university extension system. This meant drawing on the staffs of the agricultural departments which were being created in new institutions of higher education. Government funds were available to support these activities, but funding also had to be provided by the local county authorities (Jones, 1994). By the turn of the century, such work existed throughout Great Britain.\n\nThis system and its underlying legislation, however, did not apply to Ireland (then entirely a part of the United Kingdom). There, agricultural extension work became established in 1900 as a result of the initiative of Horace Plunkett, well known for his advocacy of agricultural cooperation. An official committee in 1896, chaired by Plunkett, reviewed the developments in Europe and North America (Report, Recess Committee, 1896) and set out to adapt the various systems to suit Irish conditions. In 1900, a Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction was established in Dublin, governed by a board of representative Irishmen. This initiated itinerant agricultural instruction, organized within each county as in Britain and similarly resourced partly from local and partly from central funds. A vague recollection existed of Lord Clarendon's \"practical instructors\" half a century earlier, and the title \"itinerant instructors\" was applied to the new extension workers, who were expected to provide information and advice, each to be \"the guide, philosopher and friend of the existing farmers\" (Plunkett, 1901-02, p. 26).\n\nMany visitors and several official delegations from North America to Europe, particularly from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, reported back on the progress in agricultural research and education, including the itinerant teachers. In the United States and eastern Canada, agricultural societies had become common during the first half of the century and, usually supported by their state or provincial legislatures, some had at times sponsored itinerant lecturers in agriculture. However, two other developments after 1850 were of more significance to the evolution of agricultural extension in the United States. First was the Morrill Act of 1862, signed by President Lincoln during the Civil War, which was seminal in the creation of state colleges \"of agriculture and the mechanic arts\" in the northern United States; its land-grant provisions enabled the states to establish and fund their colleges. Second was the beginning at about the same time of the farmers' institute movement. These institutes organized one-or two-day (and later longer) meetings, which became popular after 1860, arranged by and for farmers.\n\nBoth developments had been widely discussed during the previous decade, and their growth over the next half century was closely interwoven. The visiting speakers at the institutes were largely professors at the state colleges of agriculture, and both depended on the formal support of their state legislatures and of farmers, especially through their agricultural societies (True, 1895, 1928; Kile, 1921). Over the next forty years, these activities were influenced also by the university extension movement in Britain and the growing interest in adult self-improvement (inspired, for example, by the Chautauqua adult education institution in New York State). By 1890, when the second Morrill Act granted federal funds for the establishment of agricultural colleges in the remainder of the United States, the farmers' institutes had spread throughout and become a national institution with federal support and supervision, further stimulated by the formal establishment of experimental work at the state colleges of agriculture under the 1887 Hatch Act. A comparable development of farmers' institutes began in Ontario, Canada, in 1885. These were financially supported by the provincial legislature and spread rapidly with lecturers mainly from the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph (founded in 1874). A somewhat similar system began in Prince Edward Island (Province of Ontario, 1900; Blackburn & Vist, 1984).\n\nThus, by the end of the last century, a system of agricultural extension work had become well established in a large part of North America. In the United States, the colleges and their leading professors, including several notable proponents of more practical extension work, progressively took over the initiation and organization of the activity. This culminated in 1914 with the passage of the Smith-Lever Act, establishing the Cooperative Extension Service - a tripartite cooperation of federal, state, and local county governments, with the state college as the extension agency - \"in order to aid in diffusing among the people of the United States useful and practical information on subjects relating to agriculture and home economics, and to encourage the application of the same.\"\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, extension work also became established along the wide coastal belts of southern and eastern Australia. Several agricultural (\"show\") societies were formed in the second half of the nineteenth century, although their effect was slight, but as the state administrations became more organized, departments of agriculture were established in the 1870s and 1880s with the aim of developing the potential of their territories. They recognized the importance of agricultural education, influenced by British, Irish, and some American examples whose activities were widely reported in the Australian press. Before the end of the century, under specific state legislation, the departments of agriculture had established agricultural colleges and experimental work in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland (Black, 1976).\n\nAssociated with this development was the official appointment in these states of the first itinerant agricultural instructors in the late 1880s. At the same time, because of the potential importance of milk products, travelling dairy schools were begun, while state exhibitions, especially the Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne in 1888, showed what was possible and gave considerable impetus to farming improvements. The few \"government experts,\" some from the United Kingdom or the United States, grew in number during the 1890s and the first decade of this century, developing the range of the extension work. Its impact and that of the agricultural colleges in their early years was probably slight, but the basis had been laid for further development (Logan, 1984).\n\nAgricultural extension work had also started before 1900 in Japan. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, new administrative structures and various modernizing policies were adopted. Two agricultural colleges were established in the mid-1870s, staffed by Western (mainly European) teachers. At these colleges and government farms, experimental work was conducted and new practices were tested and developed. At the same time, agricultural fairs and exhibitions were begun, and progressive Japanese farmers gave talks and demonstrations at them. These led to the development of many agricultural societies from 1881 onwards, a \"movement\" formalized by legislation in 1899. In 1885, the government also initiated, at national and prefectural levels, a system of appointing experienced farmers as itinerant agricultural lecturers (because the Western \"experts\" knew little about rice husbandry). Supported by the work at government experiment stations, established from 1893, these farmers formed the basis of agricultural extension work. This activity, including the establishment of demonstration farms, was allocated in 1903 to the numerous agricultural societies which, with state funds, appointed agricultural technicians. In 1910, the 1899 law was strengthened; thereafter, farmers were required to belong to a village agricultural society which was linked to a national network and hierarchy of societies, and farmers were compelled to adopt the technical guidance and recommendations of the societies' extension workers - what became known as \"forced extension\" (Tajima, 1991; Ministry of Agriculture, 1993).\n\nThe development and organization of agricultural extension work was not entirely confined to temperate countries. In a variety of ways, it had also begun in tropical areas, especially in colonial territories. The European colonial powers looked to their overseas territories as a source of tropical agricultural products.\n\nDespite a long connection with some of the colonial areas, the Europeans remained largely ignorant of many tropical agricultural plants. The solution was to establish experimental and demonstration \"botanical gardens.\" The earliest was opened in 1821 at Peradeniya, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), and two others were established in the country later in the nineteenth century. Smaller ones were also created in several Caribbean islands and some West African territories. During the early years of this century, some of these developed considerably, although others were short-lived. Those which succeeded provided important sources of agricultural knowledge and innovation and formed the basis for an interest in agricultural societies and agricultural instruction. Some attempts were also undertaken to improve \"native agriculture.\" This was often associated with the creation, as part of the administration, of departments of agriculture and the appointment of professional agriculturists as directors of agriculture.\n\nA central department of agriculture was established in India after the 1866 Orissa famine, and the government of India soon after resolved to establish departments in each province. However, it was 1905 before a central government directive ordered every province to appoint a full time director of agriculture who should organize agricultural research and demonstration farms with staff who could advise farmers (Mook, 1982). The first British colony to appoint a director of agriculture was Zanzibar in 1896. Of more significance, however, was the creation in 1898 of the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies, with headquarters in Barbados. Before 1914, such departments of agriculture had been created in several African and Southeast Asian territories, as well as in several Caribbean islands (Masefield, 1950). In Sri Lanka, a few agricultural instructors had been appointed about 1880 to work alongside government agents. When in 1904 the Ceylon Agricultural Society was formed to promote experimental work, it also began an agricultural extension service with the objective of reaching native cultivators (Arasasingham, 1981).Along with school gardens (Willis, 1922), the extension workers were considered an effective way of demonstrating improved cultivation practices to villagers. Similar developments also occurred in the Caribbean.\n\nIn most tropical African territories, the European interaction with native agriculture was minimal before 1914. The \"scramble for Africa\" had been mainly in the late nineteenth century, and the young departments of agriculture, where they existed, were largely involved in administrative duties. Before 1914, however, agricultural instruction was given in most government-assisted schools and at four agricultural stations in Ghana (the Gold Coast) (Lucas, 1913). In addition, missionaries often undertook agricultural education, with demonstration and improvement activities, alongside their religious work. The church farms (fermes-chapelles) begun in 1895 by Jesuits in the then Belgian Congo (de Failly, 1970) were copied by missionaries of other persuasions in many other areas.\n\nIn the early years of this century, extension services were in their formative stage; they were relatively small in scale and limited in the scope of their work and contact with farmers, and their organization was often somewhat haphazard even though based on legislation. They were organized predominantly either by central or local governments, or by agricultural colleges, usually in close association with experiment stations, or by farmers' organizations (agricultural societies, cooperatives, farmers' unions, or chambers of agriculture), or combinations of these parent bodies. As the century has progressed, the organizations have matured. Changes have often occurred to their parent affiliations, government funding has become relatively more important, their objectives have become broader, especially in \"the North,\" and the extension workers have become better trained and more professional. In addition, several other kinds of organizations have developed comparable work: agriculture-related commercial companies; agricultural commodity marketing boards, concerned to assure the supply and quality of their specific product; agricultural development projects, many of considerable territorial scale; and a variety of nongovernmental organizations (especially religious and charitable) involved in agricultural and rural development.\n\nAs agricultural extension organizations have grown and changed, they have invariably become more bureaucratic with distinct hierarchical structures. The work of dispersed extension workers had to be administered and controlled so that one or more levels of intermediary structure (for example, district, region) have been created between the field-level agents and their headquarters. Thus the management of extension activities has become a major preoccupation, and many organizations have been open to the criticism of being top heavy and top-down in their approach. However, with funding derived largely from national revenues (or international donors), senior managers have necessarily had to account for and justify their organization's activities. This has been equally pronounced in the North as in the South where, after colonial territories gained their independence, extension work has commonly been rein-vented and staffed by nationals under the aegis of their new administrations (usually ministries of agriculture).\n\nDuring the past quarter century, the work of extension services has often become more diversified. In the less developed countries, the main focus remains on agricultural (mainly food) production, but there has been a growing recognition of the need to reach, influence, and benefit the multitudes of small, resource-poor farmers. Strong efforts have been made in this direction, notably through the training and visit system. Among the commercial farmers of the North, a major problem has become surplus production, with farmers facing economic and policy pressures to restrict it. Associated with intensive production methods, many issues and problems regarding environmental deterioration and livestock welfare have also arisen. Thus these have become important aspects of extension work, particularly socioeconomic guidance which focusses both on means by which farmers might maintain their income levels from their resources (for example, introduction of novel crops or livestock and involvement in various rural enterprises) and on the ways of assuring the longer term welfare of farmers and their families. Agricultural extension services are thus adding a strong social dimension to their activities.\n\nAgricultural extension has now become recognised as an essential mechanism for delivering information and advice as an \"input\" into modem farming. Since commercial farmers can derive direct financial benefits from these inputs, there is a trend towards the privatization of the extension organizations, often as parastatal or quasigovernmental agencies, with farmers being required to pay for services which they had previously received free of charge. This trend is strong in the North, and there are examples of it beginning in the South.\n\nThe pace of change in the organization, functions, strategies, and approaches of agricultural extension is clearly accelerating.\n\nThe need for agricultural and rural information and advisory services is likely to intensify in the foreseeable future. In much of the world, agriculture faces the challenge of keeping pace with rapidly increasing population with few reserves of potentially cultivable land. Farmers will have to become more efficient and specialized.\n\nFrom government perspectives, whatever priority is given to production, extension will remain a key policy tool for promoting ecologically and socially sustainable farming practices.\n\nSome of the most promising recent developments in extension methodology have occurred where the key agenda is environmental or is concerned with equity, for example in the need for the joint management of forests by professionals and local forest users and in integrated pest management. A consistent theme running through the innovative approaches being used, such as participatory rural appraisal (Chambers, 1993), is a fundamental change in what are the respective roles of extension agent and clients. The agent is no longer seen as the expert who has all the useful information and technical solutions; the clients' own knowledge and ingenuity, individually and collectively, are recognized as a major resource; solutions to local problems are to be developed in partnership between agent and clients. Since the scale at which extension support is required is thus often larger than the individual farm, extension workers need new skills of negotiation, conflict resolution, and the nurturing of emerging community organizations (Garforth, 1993; Smith, 1994).\n\nThe future is also likely to witness a reversal of recent trends towards bureaucratization within hierarchical extension services and a reduction in their levels of public funding. Moreover, a rapid increase can be expected in the use of information technology in support of extension. The forces for change in these areas (see Rivera & Gustafson, 1991) will come from four main directions.\n\nEconomic and Policy Climate\n\nWith the collapse during the past decade of socialist forms of economic organization, the (dominant) role of the public sector in national economies has become questionable, with a strengthening trend to reduce levels of public spending. Thus government extension services and those which are largely publicly financed are, and will continue to be, under pressure to become more efficient, to reduce their expenditure and staff, and to pass on (some of) the costs of provision to their clients who directly benefit financially. This is particularly the case in countries where the farm population forms a small minority and agricultural production is in surplus. The case is weaker, but not absent, in less developed countries where farming households form a high proportion of the total population and where increasing food production is still important. Thus charging clients for services is likely to become more widespread, while governments will find it attractive to contract out the operation of services to the private or the voluntary sector.\n\nSocial Context in Rural Areas\n\nIn the future, rural populations will undoubtedly be progressively better educated, while their exposure to the mass media will continue to reduce their isolation and detachment from information, ideas, and an awareness of their situation within a national and international context. However, this exposure will not reduce the need for extension. Rather, given the changing demands on agricultural producers from population growth, increasing urbanization, legislative changes, and market requirements, the more knowledgeable farming population will require different kinds of extension services. Social and economic trends within rural areas will therefore necessitate more highly trained, specialized, and technically competent workers, who also know where to obtain relevant information and problem solutions and various provision and organizational forms (Moris, 1991; Hayward, 1990) to replace monolithic government extension agencies. These agencies will need to recognize and serve different types of clients defined not in terms of \"adopter categories\" but of access to markets, degree of commercialization, and relative dependence on agriculture for family income and welfare.\n\nSystems Knowledge\n\nA recognition of the locale-specific nature of farming systems and the agricultural information systems which support them is an important source of the pressure towards the debureaucratization and devolution of extension services. This recognition also implies that extension workers and farmers be jointly involved in the verification and adaptation of new technology, and thus that the extension workers respect farmers as experimenters, developers, and adapters of technology and devote more energy on communication within their local areas. The devolution of extension services to become local organizations is a reasonable corollary of this. Developments in mass media technology, already apparent over a decade ago (Garforth, 1986), will continue to support this localization of extension effort.\n\nInformation Technology\n\nThe continuing rapid development of telecommunications and computer-based information technology (IT) is probably the biggest factor for change in extension, one which will facilitate and reinforce other changes. There are many possibilities for the potential applications of the technology in agricultural extension (FAO, 1993; Zijp, 1994). IT will bring new information services to rural areas over which farmers, as users, will have much greater control than over current information channels. Even if every farmer does not have a computer terminal, these could become readily available at local information resource centres, with computers carrying expert systems to help farmers to make decisions. However, it will not make extension workers redundant. Rather, they will be able to concentrate on tasks and services where human interaction is essential - in helping farmers individually and in small groups to diagnose problems, to interpret data, and to apply their meaning (Leeuwis, 1993).\n\nThe future will call for more able, more independent, more client-oriented extension workers. The emphasis will be on the quality of interaction between agent and client rather than on the movement of \"messages\" through a hierarchical system.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability will be seen as virtues rather than aberrations. Paradoxically, these trends will bring us full circle to the early manifestations of modem extension in Europe. The itinerant agricultural teachers, unencumbered by large bureaucracies and tall hierarchies, will find their modem counterparts in the computer-carrying extension workers who are at ease helping farmers to identify the information they need in order to realize the potential of their farming operations. Looking back, we can regard the period from 1970 to 1995 as a necessary but expensive stage in the evolution of extension systems, after which extension agents were able to settle down to their main task - bringing together the expertise of farmers and the best available scientific knowledge to develop farms and local agricultural economies.\n\nAhmed, A.

Most of the total cultivated area lies in the plains to the east of the Beijing-Guangzhou railway. The only idle land is found in the mountains and in the saline lands of the northeast. Main food crops include winter wheat, millet, kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum), soybeans, barley, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, rice, and green lentils. Wheat is by far the most important, in both acreage and production, Henan ranking at the top in output among the provinces. Rice occupies only a small percentage of the crop area; its yield per acre, however, is almost three times as great as that of wheat. Fruit growing has received considerable impetus in recent years, partly for its own sake and partly for soil conservation, particularly in the idle sandy lands of the northeast and on mountain slopes. Dates, persimmons, apples, and pears are the main fruits, with walnuts and chestnuts also grown. Henan produces draft animals of good quality, particularly yellow oxen and donkeys. Hogs are the most important food animals, and goats and sheep are mainly raised in the western mountains. The chief industrial crops are cotton, tobacco, vegetable oils, and silk. Cotton is widely grown on about half the acreage available for farming, with its main concentration north of the Huang He around Anyang and Xinxiang. Tobacco growing, introduced into Henan in 1916, increased enormously after 1949; Henan is now one of China\u2019s largest tobacco producers. Vegetable oils are important, with Henan one of China\u2019s largest producers of sesame, grown mainly in the east and south. Ramie, the most important of the leafy fibres, is grown in eastern Henan in the Huai River valley. Henan is one of the oldest centres of sericulture (silkworm raising) in China. The industry dates to the Dong (Eastern) Han dynasty (25\u2013220 ce). Both mulberry leaf culture and oak tree culture for silkworms flourished between the two World Wars but suffered severely during the Sino-Japanese War (1937\u201345). After 1949 there was a revival on the slopes of the Funiu Mountains, and the province became an important exporter of silk. Henan suffers severely at times from locusts, which winter in the arid, sandy, alkaline soils beside the Huang He. Extended and improved cultivation in these areas has helped control the pest.\n\nResources and power Henan is rich in a wide variety of minerals, and these have provided the base for developing the province\u2019s industries. Both bituminous and anthracite coal are found along the slopes of the Taihang Mountains, and big reserves of good coking coal in thick, easily mined seams are found in the Funiu Mountains between Huchang and Pingdingshan. Iron ore is found at Ruyang on the Ru River in the Xiong\u2019er Mountains, as well as some pyrite, bauxite, and mica. Large coal mines at Jiaozuo supply the fast-growing industries of Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang but are still inadequate. The vast coalfield at Pingdingshan in central Henan is one of the largest in China. In addition, large proven reserves of low-sulfur petroleum and natural gas are extracted at the Zhongyuan complex of oil fields in the northeast. There also are deposits of lead, molybdenum, gold, and silver. Henan is a significant producer of energy, with thermal plants in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang linked by a power line. An ultrahigh-voltage transmission system, one of the largest in China when it was completed in the early 1980s, transports electricity from the Pingdingshan area to Wuhan in Hubei province. Hydroelectricity is of growing importance. In addition to the Sanmen facility, there is the even larger Xiaolangdi station on the Huang He north of Luoyang.\n\nManufacturing Although before 1949 there was little industrial development in Henan, from 1950 industrialization was both rapid and extensive. Much of the early development tapped Henan\u2019s rich coal seams in the northwest. Subsequently, a comprehensive system of industrial production was enacted, with engineering, nonferrous metallurgical, and textile industries as its pillars. The province is a national leader in lead, aluminum, and glass production. Luoyang was chosen as the site for China\u2019s first tractor factory, opened in 1958. Since then its output has burgeoned, and Luoyang has become a heavy industry centre. Zhengzhou lies in the heart of the cotton-growing area and is now the centre of the textile industry. Kaifeng, imperial capital of the Song emperors, declined after the 11th century\u2014especially when the Huang He dikes were broken by rebel forces and the region was flooded in 1642. Although it eventually was restored, it remained marginalized until large chemical-fertilizer works and a tractor-accessories plant led to its revival in the 20th century. Xinxiang, the most important city of northern Henan, is the hub of the region\u2019s railway network as well as a centre of diversified manufacturing. Emphasis has shifted over the years from heavy to light manufactures. There has been a growth in the production of consumer goods such as cigarettes, electronic products, bicycles, household appliances, textiles, and tableware. In addition, regional handicraft products\u2014including lacquerware, jade carvings, tin pots, ink slabs, and tricolour glazed pottery horses (imitations of the ceramic horses produced during the Tang dynasty\u2014are all well-known throughout the country."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john.cameron/3727528", "page_content": "John Cameron\n\ntheologian\n\n1579 (age 45) Glasgow, Scotland\n\nHe then returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was nominated one of the students of divinity who were maintained at the expense of the church, and who for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any Protestant seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons of Calignon, chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at Paris, and two at Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg. In this university, on the 4th of April 1608, he gave a public proof of his ability by maintaining a series of theses, De triplici Dei cum Homine Foedere, which were printed among his works. The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was appointed the colleague of Dr Primrose; and when Francis Gomarus was removed to Leiden, Cameron, in 1618, was appointed professor of divinity at Saumur, the principal seminary of the French Protestants. In 1620 the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged Cameron to seek refuge for himself and family in England. For a short time he read private lectures on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of the university of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed from his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterian- ism. Cameron was prepared to accept Episcopacy, and was cordially disliked for his adherence to the doctrine of passive obedience. He resigned his office in less than a year. He returned to France, and lived at Saumur. After an interval of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at Montauban.

Companies often strike benefit agreements that can provide jobs, training, contracts and housing to a community, among other measures.\n\nBaines, who has previously worked in the oilpatch, described in an interview with CBC News how those benefit agreements are similar to buying a First Nation's support, since compensation is given only if the First Nation provides its backing.\n\nHe said companies are basically asking the community to \"bury their concerns.\"\n\nBaines described how Indigenous consultation in the past was usually summarized in the last chapter of a regulatory application about a new project and would say \"we talked to them.\"\n\nThe agreement with YQT is different, he said, since \"we're inviting them to the table and saying we want you at that table, we want your input, we want you to say yes or no.\"\n\n\"It's a big change, and so we know it's going to put pressure on industry peers.

I worked as closely as I could with agronomists and soil conservation guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe country was still being opened up at 50,000 hectares a year in those days. I recall vividly the 1982 drought and 1983 flood. The rain of the 1983 flood started on the same day as the Emerald B&S recovery. We had about 200 inebriated youth in town for the next four weeks as you couldn\u2019t go north, south, east or west.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said the driving force behind the adoption of no-till farming in CQ was the need to contain the soil erosion problem that was rampant throughout the area at the time.\n\n\u201cCover was and is king. You just have to have sufficient crops to generate soil cover to capture water efficiently and make it available for the next crop, particularly in the high intensity summer storm environments in Central Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Cameron said in the early 1980s one of the challenges of convincing growers to adopt the new system of farming was that it required a massive change in thinking away from established practices.\n\n\u201cPeople would tell you: \u201cYou have to aerate the soil, mate\u201d. That was a big thing. So, it was an intergenerational change for people to change the farming system and trust it could be done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt often meant not only management change but machinery change. One of the other impediments was the cost of glyphosate back then. That reduced over time.\n\n\u201cThe other major change was tramlining. We really needed the massive technology shift that was afforded by self-steer tractors and GPS positioning to enable farmers to accurately map in the paddock and not over spray or under spray and leave massive gaps. That has been a huge enabling technology for no-till.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron, said no-till ultimately became a huge success story, not only in CQ but throughout Australia, because conservation methodologies and responsible resource management methodologies married with high production outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the width and time of sowing windows, we have increased rain capture, water use efficiency and yield. It has ticked all the boxes while protecting the resource base,\u201d he said.\n\nFarming challenges ahead\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Cameron said Australia\u2019s farming sector faced challenges on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cOne is herbicide resistance and our ability to efficiently sustain the system that now underpins farming across the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is a dry climate and we are absolutely reliant on our ability to capture water, moreso than most climates, so climate change and temperature changes are going to make it a lot harder for us than they are for some of our competitors.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said another looming challenge related to soil carbon levels and plant nutrient supply.\n\n\u201cI see a storm coming with the issues we are seeing with climate change, coupled with a lot of the free lunches from nitrogen available through soil organic carbon that are now used and gone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOrganic carbon, particularly with the profile of release that it had, really buffered our systems for nitrogen demand across a range of outcomes. We have lost a lot of that nitrogen buffering capacity.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we are starting to see widespread need for phosphate fertilisers, particularly deep applied P in the northern region.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning when you couple those two things with the greater difficulty of sustaining fallow efficiency through good weed control due to herbicide resistance or the increasing dominance of weeds that are hard to kill with the current suite of herbicides.\n\n\u201cThat poses an enormous challenge for the next generation of researchers, agronomists and farmers.\u201d\n\nPrecision ag adoption\n\nMr Cameron said Australian farmers had been at the forefront of applying some of the latest precision and automation technologies, but had been slow to take up others.\n\n\u201cIn the short to medium term we have seen rapid adoption of global positioning for driving tractors and precision placement of seeds. The adoption of GPS-based systems has made the apparent size of paddocks shrink which has meant massive savings on input costs and efficiencies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have seen a lack of adoption of some of the more data-driven processes that see more variable rate approaches.\n\n\u201cThere are some early adopters who have been mapping soil and yields for years and putting the two together to fertilise with higher rates where there are deeper soils and higher yield expectations. That makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201cBut, across the board, the percentage of land area that is taking up those variable rate challenges has been below expectations.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said from studies on what drove adoption, one of the outcomes was that if there are no barriers to technology adoption and a big bottom line benefit there was massive early adoption.\n\nBut as you start winding back either the bottom line benefit or increased the barriers to adoption, although there might still be significant profitability, adoption levels declined.\n\n\u201cThat seems to have been the case with some of the more advanced aspects of variable rate technology at this point,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn impediment has been the low speed of data transfer speed in Australia, which I think that may be part of the answer, but also part of the excuse, to explain the lower levels of adoption.\u201d\n\nAg communications specialist\n\nIn establishing ICAN in 1995, Mr Cameron saw the opportunity to pitch a proposal to the GRDC for a more streamlined and structured system of relaying research findings to the wider agricultural communities.\n\nThe GRDC accepted the proposal and the successful formula of the now widely-attended GRDC updates was born.\n\nThe program started with five, one-day updates targeted at agronomists in the northern region and expanded the next year to both agronomist- and grower-targeted updates.\n\nToday, the updates are a high-priority fixture on the calendars of agronomists and farmers throughout the north.\n\nMr Cameron has become the widely-recognised figure at the helm, using his skills as a grains communications specialist to bridge the gap between industry research developments and on-farm adoption.\n\n\u201cThere is all this money spent on generating good information and data and our key conduit to get this to the grower networks is via the agronomists who are working hand in hand with those individuals on a paddock by paddock basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is in information overload, so it is a real filtering job. Their role is to filter which information is appropriate to their growers and to help those growers implement profitable outcomes on their properties.\u201d\n\nCOVID forces switch to webinars\n\nWith COVID-19 restrictions coming into force in 2020, Mr Cameron said the updates program in the latter half of this year was too difficult to run as face-to-face events, so the decision was made to run them all as webinars.\n\n\u201cWe selected a subset of 23 issues to run as webinars to replace the nine updates held at venues throughout NSW and Queensland,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of the webinar format, we now have a subset of people who, for a range of reasons, don\u2019t come to the live updates. So, the plan for next year is to keep the live updates first and foremost, but out of the 16 one-day updates next year we are going to drop two of those and use that budget to run a number of webinars.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron said he expected to still be operating in a COVID-19 environment into the first half of next year, so the three, major, two-day updates scheduled for Wagga Wagga, Dubbo and Goondiwindi would be conducted under a revised format.\n\n\u201cWe will be running a two-day agenda at Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, but instead of having multiple concurrent sessions with people moving around we will try to minimise movement by running one general plenary session. There will be two separate cohorts of growers and agronomists at those venues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause Goondiwindi is on the NSW-Queensland border, there is still the risk of border closure, so we have cancelled the Goondiwindi update and, instead, will run two, one-day updates at Narrabri in northern NSW and Dalby in southern Queensland. The rest of the one-day updates scheduled are going ahead as normal.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron is a fellow of the Australian Institute of Agriculture and the 2011 recipient of the GRDC Seed of Light Award.\n\nIn his spare time he enjoys getting away from it all through his passion for hiking and fishing.\n\nGrain Central: Get our free cropping news straight to your inbox \u2013 Click here"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/natural-law", "page_content": "Early formulations of the concept of natural law\n\nThere have been several disagreements over the meaning of natural law and its relation to positive law. Aristotle (384\u2013322 bce) held that what was \u201cjust by nature\u201d was not always the same as what was \u201cjust by law,\u201d that there was a natural justice valid everywhere with the same force and \u201cnot existing by people\u2019s thinking this or that,\u201d and that appeal could be made to it from positive law. However, he drew his examples of natural law primarily from his observation of the Greeks in their city-states, who subordinated women to men, slaves to citizens, and \u201cbarbarians\u201d to Hellenes. In contrast, the Stoics conceived of an entirely egalitarian law of nature in conformity with the logos (reason) inherent in the human mind. Roman jurists paid lip service to this notion, which was reflected in the writings of St. Paul (c. 10\u201367 ce), who described a law \u201cwritten in the hearts\u201d of the Gentiles (Romans 2:14\u201315).\n\nSt. Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) embraced Paul\u2019s notion and developed the idea of man\u2019s having lived freely under natural law before his fall and subsequent bondage under sin and positive law. In the 12th century Gratian, an Italian monk and father of the study of canon law, equated natural law with divine law\u2014that is, with the revealed law of the Old and New Testaments, in particular the Christian version of the Golden Rule.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1224/25\u20131274) propounded an influential systematization, maintaining that, though the eternal law of divine reason is unknowable to us in its perfection as it exists in God\u2019s mind, it is known to us in part not only by revelation but also by the operations of our reason. The law of nature, which is \u201cnothing else than the participation of the eternal law in the rational creature,\u201d thus comprises those precepts that humankind is able to formulate\u2014namely, the preservation of one\u2019s own good, the fulfillment of \u201cthose inclinations which nature has taught to all animals,\u201d and the pursuit of the knowledge of God.

The Pool was the first farmer's co-operative on the Canadian Prairies.\n\nDuring the first years of operation, companies like Alberta Pacific Grain and United Grain Growers agreed to process the first Pool deliveries through their own facilities. In 1925, the Pool built its first three grain elevators at Leo, Naco and Esther, along the CNR line, which ran from Warden, Alberta, to Biggar, Saskatchewan. Only Esther's elevator remains standing today. In the late 1920s, the Alberta Wheat Pool attempted to purchase United Grain Growers but failed. Instead, the company began to build more elevators and terminals. In 1930 the Pool opened its first BC elevator in Dawson Creek, and ended up building a total of 13 elevators (12 wooden and 1 concrete) in that province.\n\nBy 1965, the Pool owned and operated 538 country elevators, and it took over 400 more from the Federal Grain Company Ltd. in 1972, thus becoming the second largest co-operative in Western Canada.\n\nIn 1996 the sales of the Alberta Wheat Pool amounted to $2.1 billion (including grain purchased for and delivered to the Canadian Wheat Board); its assets were $625 million, and it had 1366 employees. The shares were held by 57 000 co-operative members.\n\nIn 1998, the Alberta Wheat Pool and the Manitoba Pool merged to form Agricore Cooperative Limited. In 2001, United Grain Growers was combined with Agricore to form Agricore United, a publicly traded company. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (another former farmer co-operative, which became a publicly traded company in 1996) took over Agricore United to form Viterra, and the head offices were moved from Calgary, Alberta, to Regina, Saskatchewan. This ended the companies' existence as farmers' co-operatives.\n\nFor nearly a century, the Alberta Wheat Pool elevators have been part of the province's cultural landscape. Of the hundreds of elevators that used to belong to the Pool, less than 50 remain standing today. Many of these are owned by farmers while a few have been saved as museums, showcasing a part of Alberta's agricultural past."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/grain-elevators", "page_content": "Southern Alberta (photo by Richard Harrington).

PreviousNext\n\nBackground\n\nAs the first step in a grain trading process that moves the grain from producer to worldwide markets, the grain elevator was a strictly utilitarian building, designed to receive, store and ship grain in bulk. However, in 1923 French architect Le Corbusier hailed the elevator's stark simplicity and unadorned geometric shape as the ultimate example of form following function. In his book, Towards a New Architecture, he wrote, \u201cgrain elevators and factories, the magnificent first-fruits of the new age.\u201d\n\nThe logistical problem of getting producers' grain into railway boxcars was first addressed by farmers shovelling their grain into two-bushel sacks, which they then transported to a loading platform along the rail line. There, they emptied the sacks into a waiting boxcar, a back-breaking and time-consuming job. The industry needed a means of storing and shipping grain quickly, and small, one-storey wood frame warehouses erected by farmers were inefficient. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) demanded larger, vertical warehouses that could take advantage of the fluidity of grain, especially when acted upon by gravity. To elevate the grain a mechanism known as the \"leg\" was devised, an endless belt with cups or scoops attached. It was the leg that gave grain elevators their name and determined their shape.\n\nBy offering free land rental the railway encouraged private companies to build standard 25,000-bushel elevators complete with a leg driven by a steam or gasoline engine as well as equipment to clean grain. The hundreds of standard grain elevators built to these specifications ensured the uniformity of the cultural landscape.\n\nCanadian flour milling companies were the first businesses to respond to the railway's offer. As settlement spread quickly westward, other companies \u2014 many of them American, such as the National Elevator Company and Searle Grain Company \u2014 negotiated with either the CPR, the Canadian Northern Railway or the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway to build elevators along a line of railway. The National Elevator Company built only along CPR lines while Searle built along those of the Canadian Northern Railway. As the number of these \"line\" companies and their elevators grew, producers suspected collusion between the railway and elevator companies. In 1906, the Grain Growers' Grain Company (later called United Grain Growers) was quickly followed by farmer co-operatives in Saskatchewan and Alberta, which undertook the construction of their own elevators. With the formation of these pools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta by 1924, the number of elevators took another leap forward. (See also Grain Growers\u2019 Associations.)\n\nBuilding a Traditional Elevator\n\nAll elevators, despite variations in shape and bushel capacity, shared three architectural elements: the elevator, the driveway and the office/engine room. Grain companies drew up building plans, but often contracted out the construction.\n\nBuilding the framed cupola and driveway once elevator is completed (courtesy Provincial Museum of Alberta, PN98. 3.3/photographer Gerrit Top).\n\nA dozen men might be needed to build an elevator. The crew would arrive on site prepared to stay a month or more. Its first job was to lay the cement foundation pads, followed by the walls. Because grain can weigh up to 60 pounds a bushel it was extremely important that the elevator be made strong enough to withstand the lateral pressure placed on the bin walls.\n\nThe crew's last job was to paint the entire structure. Until the late 1960s all elevators were painted CPR red except those that were metal clad. Afterwards, companies chose corporate colours to identify their elevators.\n\nWhat Goes On Inside an Elevator\n\nThis diagram shows a cross-section of a grain elevator. Refer to the text for an explanation (courtesy Provincial Museum of Alberta).\n\n1: Grain trucks are driven onto a receiving scale in the driveway.\n\n2: The grain is dumped into the pit, or boot.\n\n3: The agent selects a bin and starts the motor that powers the leg.\n\n4: As the grain is carried over the head of the leg it is dumped into the distributor. The agent directs it to the appropriate bin spout that sends the grain into a pre-selected bin.\n\n5: To ship grain, the agent opens a bin so the grain runs into the back pit. The grain is then re-elevated and deposited into an overhead bin. From there it is dumped into the garner and hopper scale for weighing. The grain is then lowered into the back pit from where it is re-elevated and dropped into the car spout.\n\nTypes of Elevators\n\nDespite the CPR's demand for standard elevators, there was considerable variation in profile, height and storage capacity of the earliest elevators, especially in Manitoba. William Hespeler, in Niverville, Manitoba, constructed the first grain elevator, a wooden, silo-like building, in 1879. A more familiar form made its appearance in 1881 in Gretna, Manitoba, when Ogilvie Milling Company built a wooden, square, 25,000-bushel elevator. While companies like Ogilvie preferred an elevator with a pyramidal roof and a centrally located pyramidal-roofed cupola, others opted for an offset cupola. Others chose a gable roof with a gable-roofed cupola. By the 1920s, most companies were building the standard, or traditional, 30,000 to 40 000-bushel elevator with a gable roof and a gable-roofed cupola. Elevators were typically 24 m high or higher. No other building dominated the skyline as did the elevator.\n\nCrib annex, Camrose, Alta (courtesy Provincial Museum of Alberta, PN98.65.10/photographer: Sylvia Engen).\n\nAnnexes, permanent and temporary, were built to add storage capacity. Rectangular wood crib annexes, usually with a gable roof, were designed as permanent facilities. Most were constructed as separate buildings but, in the late 1920s, some were adjoined to the elevator. Early crib annexes held approximately 30,000 to 35,000 bushels; those built in the 1950s held 60,000 bushels. Another permanent type of annex was the twin elevator, an older, smaller elevator that was moved alongside a newer, larger elevator. Many older elevators escaped demolition by being twinned in this way.\n\nThe balloon annex, which appeared in the 1920s, was designed as a temporary facility. A one-storey wood frame building, it was not as sturdy as a crib annex, and tended to sag after a time \u2014 hence the term \"balloon.\" Also temporary was the loxstave annex, which was built during the Second World War. Its octagonal structure was also not as strong as other annex types and has largely disappeared from the landscape.\n\nA traditional elevator with metal bin annexes, Elk Island, Alta (courtesy Provincial Museum of Alberta, PN98.105.23/photographer Gordon Lariviere).\n\nA more recent annex type is the metal bin. Typically holding 30,000 bushels, bins became common in the 1970s. Not compartmentalized as are other annexes, metal bins are most cost effective for large volumes of a single type and quality of grain.\n\nSite Development\n\nElevators were constantly upgraded as new technologies were introduced. Original gasoline engines were replaced with electrical equipment; truck-dumping mechanisms were improved; larger scales and larger and longer movable loading spouts to facilitate the loading of freight cars were installed; wooden legs were replaced with metal ones; and new driveways to accommodate longer trucks were constructed.\n\nA town's \u201cRailway Avenue\u201d boasted an architectural landscape that included a row of elevators, railway stations, water towers, pump houses, stockyards and freight-loading ramps. All were indicative of a way of life that revolved around prairie rail transportation.\n\nNew Designs\n\nConsolidation of delivery points in the late 1950s made the construction of larger facilities necessary. Wood composite elevators incorporated annexes for a capacity of about 175,000 bushels. Their familiar design ensured that they blended into their communities. They were built until the mid-1980s.\n\nVegreville, Alta (courtesy: Provincial Museum of Alberta, PN98.27.30/photographer Parke Dobson).\n\nThe first major change in elevator design came in the late 1970s. Experimenting with new designs and new materials, the Alberta Wheat Pool constructed a 170,000-bushel, pre-cast concrete \"Buffalo slope\" elevator at Magrath, Alberta, in 1979, followed in 1982 by a \"Buffalo 2000\" built at Lyalta. A 90,000-bushel steel elevator with two steel bins of 30,000 bushels each was built at Etzikom, Alberta, in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, grain companies concentrated on building concrete silos designed as high capacity terminals. Handling close to 50,000 tonnes, these behemoths can load a freight car in less than 10 minutes, ensuring that an entire train of 52 cars can be loaded in a single day. This capability means that the terminals have to be built far beyond town limits.\n\nContemporary Issues\n\nOnce rising above the horizon every 12 to 16 kilometres the grain elevator is fast disappearing. As early as the 1930s, falling farm incomes led to rural depopulation. In the 1950s, rising expectations, improved roads and mechanized farm equipment accelerated this trend. Although the rail network and the primary elevator system remained stable, fewer people working larger farms meant that many small branch lines became unprofitable. Rail companies sought permission to abandon them. Deregulation of the railways and the demise of the Crow Rate in 1996 have led to major rail line abandonments. Amalgamation of grain companies and \"saw-offs\" (the sale or swap of elevators to mutual maximum advantage) have also reduced the number of elevators. Demolition firms hired by grain companies use track hoes and occasionally explosives to bring down the elevators.\n\nBleak though the prognosis might be for the survival of the traditional grain elevator, not all elevators will disappear. Prior to the 1990s a number were sold to producers for personal storage. Companies re-adapted others to bulk fertilizer storage. Today, heritage groups seek to preserve elevators. For example, in Inglis, Manitoba, the federal government has designated a row of five elevators a National Historic Site."}, {"url": "https://www.amdigital.co.uk/insights/news/the-alberta-wheat-pool", "page_content": "In early 1920\u2019s Canada, grain farmers were suffering the effects of a significant collapse in the price of wheat. In 1919, wheat was selling at a healthy price of $2.31 per bushel, but by 1922 it had plummeted to just 77 cents. Many farmers considered the price crash as a direct result of the withdrawal of the federal wheat board, a compulsory government grain marketing agency that operated from 1919 to 1922.\n\n\n\nUnrewarding toil and a diminishing faith in administrative organisation prompted an enterprising response. Farmers and agriculturalists (most notably Aaron Sapiro, an American cooperative activist and major leader of the subsequent farmer\u2019s movement) envisaged the potential benefit of forming a producer-owned cooperative, spurred partially by the dallying efforts of the United Farmers of Alberta. The UFA had declared that it would organize a wheat pool, but not in time for the 1923 harvest. For the exasperated farmers and associated workforce, this was simply not good enough. In a bid to embarrass the UFA and to rally the workforce, Sapiro captivated audiences with his spirited message:\n\n\n\n\u201cI have seen these movements in cooperation and it will go. I never saw a province so ripe for it. Do this, men, and you are making the greatest contribution toward world freedom and in the right handling of the greatest commodity that has ever been!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHorse-drawn Carts Transport Grain from Alberta Wheat Pool Elevators in 1923\n\nThe subsequent formation of the Alberta Wheat Pool allowed farmers to collectively negotiate pricing with grain purchasers, thus raising prices significantly. By pooling all of their harvests and accounts, each farmer received the same returns and had the weight of the pool behind them. Witnessing the early successes of the Alberta Wheat Pool, Saskatchewan and Manitoba followed suit, creating wheat pools of their own. Fortitude, grit and a little luck allowed Canadian grain farmers a little breathing space as markets stabilized. At the close of their first operating year in 1924, Alberta Wheat Pool\u2019s total assets were at $426 thousand, but by the end of 1928 they had climbed to $9 million. In 1928, the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Wheat Pools had become the greatest business in Canada, accomplishing a cash turnover of $323 million.\n\n\n\nIn 1928, the collaborative Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Wheat Pools were described as the finest agricultural co-op in the world \u2013 the harvests were good, turnover was excellent and confidence in the market was at an historical high. Then came 1929.\n\n\n\nOn October the 29th, the stock market crash on Wall Street heralded the start of the Great Depression across Canada and the United States. Grain prices plummeted, and continued to fall until 1932 when wheat sold at 38 cents a bushel. Alberta farmers were receiving 19 \u00bd cents per bushel at their respective grain elevators, marking the lowest price of grain in history. But, despite hardships and loss of faith throughout the ranks, the Alberta Wheat Pool fought on.\n\nCover to the Alberta Wheat Pool\u2019s report, marking the 25th Anniversary of the cooperative\n\nDuring the Second World War, Canadian food suppliers provided 40% more than usual to compensate for the shortfalls in production and importation. Hard-pressed combatants and occupied countries were no longer in a position to provide food for the rest of the world, and so Canada\u2019s farmers accelerated production to meet increasing demand. Older farmers remembered the repercussions of the First World War, when peace had led to the steady decline of prices for wheat, and so pushed hard for protection. The Agricultural Price Support Board was installed, and the government guaranteed a price of $1 per bushel until 1950.\n\n\n\nThe Alberta Wheat Pool continued to develop its standing as a global supplier, and, much like the windmills of the Netherlands, soon the Alberta Wheat Pool elevators became a characteristic feature of the Alberta landscape.\n\nAn Alberta Wheat Pool Grain Elevator. A grain elevator is a tower that contains a pneumatic conveyor. The conveyor moves grain from a lower level into a silo or other large storage facility.\n\nThe collaboration of farmers provided sound and vigorous representation on matters affecting the social and economic position of the farming industry, as well as supporting the rest of the world in its development. The success of the cooperative enabled the pool to diversify and develop agricultural technology and innovative farming practices that remain at the forefront of grain production today. It is estimated that around half of the world\u2019s calories are supplied by wheat, and so it is important to recognize pioneering enterprises, such as those who developed the Alberta Wheat Pool.\n\n\n\nThis story is just one of many contained within Adam Matthew Digital\u2019s electronic resource Global Commodities, Trade, Exploration and Culture, a learning platform that provides a vast range of visual, manuscript and printed materials sourced from over twenty key libraries and more than a dozen companies and trade organisations around the world.

It began operations on October 29, 1923 as the Alberta Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited.\n\nThe Pool was formed to aid farmers by selling their grain at a competitive rate without wild price fluctuations. Previously, farmers were at the mercy of the line elevators and the Winnipeg Grain Exchange\u2019s rates, which could vary wildly.\n\nFarmers signed up to send their grain to the Pool to store and sell when they thought best. Initially the Pool\u2019s grain was received by the grain elevators of the United Grain Growers Grain Co.

In 1927 the Pool bought 41 grain elevators at an average cost $10,140. These 41 included the following from UGG: 21 elevators, 14 coal sheds and 5 houses.

On the advice of Aaron Sapiro, a California lawyer they created a non share, non-profit organization responsible solely for selling wheat for the best advantage. It was set up as a one-man, one-vote organization, with a 5-year contract required to deliver 100% of his commercial wheat to the Pool.\n\nUnited Grain Growers grain company and the Alberta Pacific Elevator company agreed to accept Pool deliveries in their facilities. Other elevator owners quickly agreed to accept Pool wheat when they realized the pricing power the farmers had created.\n\nThe Pool purchased the grain produced by its members at a provisional or initial price. The pool then sold the grain, and if there was a surplus in the account at the end of the year, it was distributed to its members at a pro-rated basis. Everyone who was a member of the Pool received the same price. Initially 26,000 farmers joined the Pool, with hundreds of shipping points.\n\nThe Alberta Wheat Pool started making direct sales to flour milling companies and even exported grain directly. Direct sales accounted for over 60% of the total in the first year. They had to use the services of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, despite objections from the farmers, in order to reduce risk which would in turn satisfy the banks that financed the venture.\n\nAfter the first year, the Pool began to deduct 2 cents per bushel for purchase/building of Pool-owned elevators. This levy system was to be used often in the Pool's history. Considering that wheat sold at the time for over $1.00 per bushel, this was a low percentage cost. With this income, the Pool accumulated a $200,000 reserve. Shortly thereafter, Saskatchewan and Manitoba created Wheat Pools of their own.\n\nThe Pools grew in numbers and political power. In 1928 the combined Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba Wheat Pools were among the biggest business concerns in Canada with a cash turn over of $323 million. The Pool attempted to purchase United Grain Growers Ltd., but the attempt failed. Instead the Wheat Pool began to build more elevators and terminals. By the late 1960s the Wheat Pool had 567 elevators.\n\nIn 1925 wheat prices rose to $2.17 then dropped down to $1.36. Fearing market collusion to lower prices, the Pool began to buy wheat futures - 3 million bushels worth. This had the effect of raising prices to $1.69, possibly preventing the feared 'bear raid'. As a result, the Pool was extremely profitable. The Pool did so again in 1929 and again in 1930. The first was profitable, but in 1930 (in part due to the stock market collapse in 1929) there were major losses when wheat prices fell under $0.20. The losses far exceeded the profits in 1925 and in 1929 combined, and government loans were necessary to stay solvent. The loans took 17 years to pay off. In order to obtain the government loans, the Pools had to give up overseas direct sales. This caused anger among members and harsh accusations were delivered.\n\nNevertheless, the pool continued to grow quickly in members, wheat capacity and popularity. In 1935, a Canadian Grain Board (now the Canadian Wheat Board) was created by the government as an alternative to pooling. The board had the ability to set a minimum price for wheat, which initially was 87.5 cents ber bushel.\n\nBy 1937, a worldwide poor harvest that had not affected Canada had turned the market around. Prices were well above $1 and the Canadian Wheat Board made a profit for the government. This was short lived when, in 1938, the world harvest was good and prices fell again to 60 cents, creating huge losses."}, {"url": "https://calverley.ca/article/08-078-history-of-the-alberta-wheat-pool/", "page_content": "The first Alberta Wheat Pool elevator in the B.C.

The results of that election marked the start of Alberta becoming an electoral testing ground for anti-establishment ideologies and political projects.\n\nIt would not be until 1971 that a nationally-mainstream and nationally-affiliated party would again form government in Alberta.\n\nFounded in 1909, the UFA was an influential farmers\u2019 lobby group that reluctantly entered electoral politics after years of frustration with the establishment Liberal Party that had governed Alberta since the province was formed in 1905.\n\nPart of a broader national progressive cooperative movement, the UFA was the first of the prairie farmers parties to break through and form government. The United Farmers of Manitoba would form government in 1922 and Saskatchewan would buck the trend until the election of Tommy Douglas\u2018 Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in 1944.\n\nUntil 1921, the Liberal Party had dominated elections in the three prairie provinces, with the Conservative Party only occasionally forming government. A 16-year old Alberta Liberal Party government already damaged by years of internal power struggles and still reeling from the conscription crisis was shocked to be swept out of office.\n\nThirty-eight UFA MLAs were elected, with 15 Liberal MLAs, 4 Dominion Labour MLAs, 3 Independents and 1 Conservative forming the opposition (one Dominion Labour MLA, Alex Ross, was invited to join the UFA cabinet and served as Minister of Public Works).\n\nDespite the incumbent Liberals winning 34 per cent of the vote compared to 28 per cent for the UFA, the UFA won 38 seats compared to 15 for the Liberals. The lopsided popular vote was due to a new electoral system which gave voters in Calgary and Edmonton the ability to cast votes for five candidates and voters in Medicine Hat the ability to vote for two candidates. The UFA did not run any candidates in the two largest cities.\n\nBeing new to electoral politics, the UFA did not actually have an official party leader at the time they won the election (this would become a trend in Alberta politics, as neither did the Social Credit Party when it won in 1935).\n\nWanting to do politics differently, the newly elected UFA is said to have approached defeated Liberal Premier Charles Stewart to ask if he would remain in the job. Stewart, who had been a member and supporter of the UFA before they became his political opponent, declined.\n\nUFA President Henry Wise Wood also declined, wanting to stay out of the partisan political side of the organization.\n\nUFA Vice-President Percival Baker was next in line, but died one day after being elected as the MLA for Ponoka from injuries caused by a falling tree.\n\nGeorge Hoadley was considered a potential premier due to his previous experience as leader of the Conservative Party, but it was likely his pre-floor crossing connections that cost him the job.\n\nHerbert Greenfield was named interim vice-president after Baker\u2019s death and was selected by the UFA Caucus to become the next Premier. Without a seat in the Legislative Assembly, Greenfield ran in a December 1921 by-election to become the MLA for Peace River.\n\nThe UFA\u2019s election also marked the beginning of a political wave that would sweep over Alberta and the prairies, with the UFA-allied Progressive Party electing 8 Members of Parliament in the December 1921 election and forming official opposition in Ottawa.\n\nIt\u2019s record as government in Alberta was mixed. It ended prohibition, formed the Alberta Wheat Pool, founded the first provincial parks, and introduced elements of proportional representation into the provincial electoral system. But it was also responsible for the formation of the Alberta Eugenics Board, marking the start of a dark period in our province\u2019s history.\n\nThe UFA\u2019s political fortunes would also suffer from the Great Depression and number of high-profile sex scandals that would dog it until the party\u2019s defeat in 1935 and subsequent retreat from politics.\n\nI will be sharing more thoughts over the next few days about the election of the UFA in 1921 and how it reshaped politics in Alberta for decades to come."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/economic-history-of-western-canada", "page_content": "This entry is one of three survey entries on the economic history of Canada. (See also \u200bEconomic History of Atlantic Canada and \u200bEconomic History of Central Canada.)\n\nEarly Economy\n\nEconomic development in what is now Western Canada began with the fur trade. By the end of the 18th century, M\u00e9tis and First Nations peoples on the prairies engaged in the trade. Fur-trade posts were scattered throughout the region; on Vancouver Island the city of Victoria began as an Hudson\u2019s Bay Company trading post (see Fur Trade Routes).\n\nSettled agriculture began in 1812 with Lord Selkirk\u2019s Red River Colony. However, the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s gave Manitoba a means of export and therefore a wheat economy. Winnipeg became a centre for commerce and railways, and soon acquired a few factories. In the late 1890s the prospects for development brightened as world prices rose, transport costs fell, methods of dryland farming improved, and more appropriate varieties of wheat became available (see Marquis Wheat; Red Fife Wheat). Until 1929, the Prairie provinces enjoyed an immense expansion of the wheat economy, onto which was grafted a very much larger rail system, a network of cities and towns, coal mining and ranching.\n\nRed Fife Heritage Wheat, Metchosin, BC, 2007 (courtesy Sharon Rempel).

A total of 189 men died (courtesy PAA). PreviousNext\n\nBy 1914, the frontier of settlement had been pushed well toward the northwest, attracting migrants from many lands (see History of Settlement in the Canadian Prairies). The result was a regional economy that depended almost entirely upon the world price of a single crop and on local yields, both of which fluctuated greatly (see Commodity Trading). There was little diversification except in Alberta, which began to produce small quantities of oil and gas (see Petroleum Exploration and Production; Petroleum Industry).\n\nImperial Oil Leduc #1 Well, Leduc oil fields, the day the well blew on 13 February 1947.\n\nRapid Growth in BC\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s economic evolution before 1929 was very different. There was little agricultural land, and most farm products were locally consumed. There were few European residents except fur traders until the Fraser River Gold Rush of the 1850s. After the gold rush, coal mining on Vancouver Island was no substitute, and until well after Confederation the population grew very slowly. However, with the construction of the CPR, followed by the Canadian Northern Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway between 1900 and 1914, much more rapid development and urbanization occurred. Important activities were lumbering, the fisheries, and copper, silver, coal and base metal mining in the south. Ranching and fruit-growing were also established. Some industries, especially shipbuilding and repairing, were set up, and the great smelter at Trail came into operation in 1920.\n\nDonald Smith driving the Last Spike to complete the Canadian Pacific Railway on 7 November 1885. PreviousNext\n\nWith regular transpacific sailings to the Asia and Australasia, Vancouver became an important port, not only for the province\u2019s own goods but for prairie grain. After the Panama Canal opened in 1914, trade with Britain became faster and much cheaper. Coastal shipping also developed, partly to serve the lumber trade. Thanks to urban growth, there was rapid development of hydroelectricity. There was very large immigration, not only from elsewhere in Canada but from Britain and Asia. Immigration from Asia was much feared and rigidly controlled, although significant Asian communities did develop (see Chinese Head Tax; Chinese Immigration Act).\n\nWar and Economic Depression\n\nFrom 1914 to the late 1940s, especially during the Great Depression, conditions were often difficult. All four provinces felt themselves to be the victims of Canada\u2019s tariff policy, which raised the price of the manufactured goods that came from elsewhere but did nothing for the price of the primary products and simple processed goods which they had to sell.\n\nPrairie drought, adverse price movements and foreign protective tendencies, as in the 1920\u201322 recession and the slump of 1929\u201333, were serious matters. Ottawa provided relief money, protected the provincial governments from bankruptcy, and tried through trade negotiations to improve the conditions for western exports (see Ottawa Agreements).\n\nAfter the collapse of the co-operative wheat pools in 1929\u201330, Ottawa also supported the marketing of prairie wheat, although until the middle of the Second World War the farmers could market their wheat through private channels if they wished (see Alberta Wheat Pool; Saskatchewan Wheat Pool). Wartime prosperity helped western farmers pay off their debts.\n\nIn BC, meanwhile, co-operative marketing increased for such goods as apples and peaches. But new manufacturing plants were slow to appear. By 1939, a Ford assembly plant near Vancouver supplied export markets in India and the Pacific, but when these markets vanished after 1939 the plant vanished too. The Second World War saw the rapid development of shipbuilding and aircraft construction on the West coast, but after the war these industries dwindled or vanished.\n\nThe Oil Boom\n\nThe years after 1945 saw new resource-based development, rapid urbanization and dramatic increases in standards of living. The most striking new projects were in oil, gas, pipeline-building and potash, which transformed the economies of Alberta and Saskatchewan. British Columbia began to produce oil and gas; BC and Manitoba acquired immense new hydroelectric plants, and aluminum smelting began at Kitimat, BC, in 1951. There were new export markets, as oil and gas moved to Ontario and the US, and as BC coal and lumber moved to Japan. Prairie wheat, which gradually lost its old markets in Britain and Europe, eventually found new markets in the USSR, China and in developing nations.\n\nWorkers at a potash mine in Saskatchewan (courtesy Masterfile).

PreviousNext\n\nFederal policy was helpful: Ottawa began to make equalization payments to Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and it provided a protected Ontario market for expensive Alberta oil from 1960 to 1973, although thereafter it held oil prices below world levels. It also reduced or removed many tariffs. Lumbering and pulp and paper expanded, and most of the time did well because of the North American construction and communications booms. In 1967, the exploitation of Alberta\u2019s oil sands began (see Bitumen).\n\nDevelopment, mining and exploration in the Athabasca Oil Sands, Fort McMurray, Alberta.

Yet the western provinces remained heavily dependent on the export of a few primary products and on the investment activity that the primary industries could generate. The West remained \u201cdevelopment-minded,\u201d as it had been between 1896 and 1914.\n\nBy the 21st century, Alberta\u2019s petroleum industry began anxiously to look to Asia for future markets. As the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, an independent Ottawa think tank noted, the province\u2019s oil sector was designed to serve a monopsony (a demand-side monopoly) of one customer, the US, moving its energy product south, instead of west or east for Asian and even domestic markets. The Paris-based International Energy Authority said in 2012 that the US not only would become energy self-sufficient but would become the world\u2019s top oil producer by 2020, because of emerging shale oil technologies and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. As a result, new markets for Canadian energy exports became a sudden priority.\n\nA major pipeline proposal by \u200bTransCanada PipeLines Limited, Keystone XL, to move Alberta oil south to refineries in Illinois and Texas shared government and public attention with two pipeline projects intended to connect Canadian oil supplies to Asian markets. Enbridge\u2019s Northern Gateway and Kinder Morgan\u2019s TransMountain Expansion Project were proposed to run to export terminals on the West coast. Other proposals raised the possibility of shipping Alberta oil eastward to be refined and exported from the facilities in Saint John, New Brunswick. However, by early 2018 all of these projects were either abandoned or still in the regulatory process.\n\nStill, output from Alberta\u2019s oil sands was expected to almost triple from 2012 to 2035. As a result, Alberta was expected to continue to dominate the Canadian economy. Another part of the shift in economic power to the West was the growth of Saskatchewan, because of its own shale oil reserves and its vast potash reserves used in making fertilizer.\n\nRegional Economics \u2014 Summary\n\nThe four Western provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia) contributed $721.8 billion, or 35 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016. The West has seen the fastest growth of all Canadian regions (see Regional Economics). Much of the development has been resource-based. Heavy investment in Alberta\u2019s oil sands has significantly boosted employment in the province, particularly in the Fort McMurray region and has added billions of dollars in revenues to provincial government coffers. Saskatchewan has been a big beneficiary of excellent farmland and the development of its uranium, potash, shale oil and other resources. A heavy reliance on commodity prices, however, makes these provinces highly vulnerable to depressed world prices for oil and other raw resources.\n\nBritish Columbia, also rich in natural resources, continues to profit from an exceptionally strong real estate sector. Vancouver is a major Pacific shipping hub, and it and Calgary are important corporate and financial centers."}, {"url": "https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/farming-stalwarts-john-cameron", "page_content": "John Cameron is probably one of the few farmers who is universally known across Scotland.\n\nThe farming champion is widely respected for a 40-year career in roles which included a five-year presidency of NFU Scotland, chairmanship of the Scottish Beef Cattle Association and an eight-year stint as chairman of the European Sheepmeat Advisory Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn association with WareingBuildings\n\nFor much of that time he was referred to as Europe\u2019s biggest sheep farmer, and when he wasn\u2019t busy with politics, running eight different farming units or commuting to Brussels, he chaired British Rail\u2019s Scottish Regional Board and often drove the company trains.\n\nJohn Cameron is a man with sharp political instinct, the charisma to get grassroots producers on board and while at one time he farmed 37,000 acres with beef, sheep and arable interests, his focus has never left the beleaguered hill producer in the less favoured areas where his father\u2019s family farmed for generations.\n\nHis political career was launched when he was appointed NFUS Hill Farming Committee chairman in the 1970s and the rise to the role of national president was fast.\n\nWhat marked him out was his insistence that the civil servants, rule-writers and great and good of Westminster and Brussels should all experience the practical implementation of their policies and edicts. And so he would transport them by tractor and trailer eight miles into the hills of north-west Scotland then deliver his demands, always ending with the question: \u201cDo you understand now what I want? If not you can walk home\u201d.\n\nIt was a performance which consistently achieved results, not least an exceptionally advantageous EU Sheepmeat Regime and Less Favoured Area payments which underpinned production on some of Scotland\u2019s most challenging terrain.\n\nBut not every victim survived unscathed. A former Secretary General of COPA, the international farmers\u2019 pressure group in Brussels, lost a leather buckled shoe in the mud on one of Mr Cameron\u2019s day-long expeditions, and was reportedly seen hobbling back to a trailer sobbing and wet. The subsequent large drams of whisky and generous hospitality tended to soften the physical discomfort and end the experience on a high note.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of the rabble-rouser in John Cameron, too. It was he who came out of semi-retirement to lead 1000 Scottish farmers in a protest at Stranraer docks when imports of Irish beef threatened their livelihoods, and he who successfully negotiated the return of six containers of beef back home across the Irish Sea that same evening.\n\nBut just as his call to arms could inspire some of the smallest livestock producers in the country, so did he negotiate with the most formidable politicians of his generation. He had several spats with Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister, and found they shared some common values.\n\n\u201cYou had to stand up for yourself, and she\u2019d respect you if you contradicted her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe certainly wasn\u2019t a push-over, but once we had won our argument her government was a strong supporter of the less favoured areas.\u201d Indeed, letters from the former prime minister are among his most treasured possessions.\n\nThese days John has downsized his farming operation, selling off five of the units which were scattered across Scotland, and setting aside a \u00a31m fund for the Cameron Travel Scholarship Trust for the benefit of young agricultural students and pupils of Dollar Academy.\n\nAfter an entire lifetime managing stock, he says the decision to semi-retire was a surprisingly quick and easy one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been gathering sheep on a freezing wet day and was soaked to my backside in the truck coming off the hill and suddenly thought: Why am I here?\u201d he recalls.\n\nBut he is still left running the substantial Fife farm of Balbuthie and a neighbouring unit. And he continues to buy lambs every year from Oban Mart where he is still given a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nThe scrapbooks he occasionally pores over offer an insight into his dominating role on Scottish farming over four decades, but while John may now be 70, he\u2019s adamant the pages are not yet complete. It\u2019s not so long, after all, since NFU Scotland was plunged into crisis with the resignation of a president and chief executive and a poll of farmers for a national farming magazine voted overwhelmingly for John Cameron to take the helm. On that occasion he graciously declined, but that twinkle in his eye and his restless energy and passion for the industry means we haven\u2019t heard the last of the Grand Old Man of Scottish farming.
