{"Charles Melville Hays was a visionary leader who was determined to make the GTR a success.": [{"url": "https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melville-hays.html", "page_content": "Mr Charles Melville Hays, 55, was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA, on 16 May 1856. He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the companys way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy and \u00a9 Craig Sopin,USA / Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nDear [?Marin / Mavin] I thought you would be interested in seeing the decision in the [?Flessen - a law suit of that time] case + so enclose you the synopsis of same which please keep for my scrap book after you have read.

Hays\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n\n\n(Courtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada)\n\nand at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system invarious capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery. A massive monument is inscribed: \"And so he died and the example of his simple, devoted consecrated life is our priceless heritage. We are a different people, we are a better people, because this man worked and loved and died.\"\n\nCourtesy: Alan Hustak, Canada Courtesy: Diane Lapierre, Canada\n\nThe town of Melville in Saskatchewan and Hays in Alberta, Canada are named for him, and a statue in his memory was erected in Prince Rupert, B.C. which would have been the Pacific terminus city of the transcontinental railroad he had planned to build.\n\nIn 1919 the Grand Trunk Railroad was placed in recievership, and later was absorbed into Canadian National Railways.\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1907 Hays was given Japan's highest decoration, the Order of the Rising Sun by Prince Fushimi, and in 1910 was offered a knighthood but turned it down because to become Sir Charles would have meant giving up his U.S. citizenship. His Japanese decoration can be seen today at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/charles-melville-hays-1.html", "page_content": "Grand Trunk President Planned Great Canadian Transcontinental\n\n---\n\nCharles Melville Hays, President of the Grand Trunk and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Companies, has been considered one of the most brilliant and successful of railroad officials. He was born at Rock Island, Ill., May 16, 1856. His school education was completed when he was 17 years of age.\n\n\n\nHis first work in the railroad world was in the passenger department of the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to an important position in the ofice [sic] of the auditor of the road, and later was transferred to the General Superintendent's office, where he remained until 1877. That year he was made Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In 1886 he became Assistant General Manager of the road. One year later he was appointed General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific, and later became Manager of the Wabash Western.\n\n\n\nWhen the consolidation of the Wabash lines took place, Mr. Hays was made Vice President of the company and General Manager of the lines of the whole system. This position he retained until his Grand Trunk appointment. At that period he held the following directorships and important railroad positions: Director of the Chicago & Western Indiana Belt Railway of Chicago, Detroit Union Railway and Station Company, Keokuk Union Station Company, Kansas City Union Station Company, Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He also represented the Wabash Railroad at the meetings of the Central Traffic Association, Western Passenger and Trunk Line Association. On Dec. 31, 1895, he resigned from the service of the Wabash Railroad, of which he was then General Manager and Vice President, to accept the position of General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, at Montreal.\n\n\n\nIn 1897 he completed the reorganization of the Central Vermont Railway Company, a subsidiary line of the Grand Trunk, of which he was then President, and in 1908 supervised the completion of the Victoria Jubilee open span double track bridge crossing the St. Lawrence River at Montreal, replacing the old single track, tubular bridge; and the single span steel arch bridge over the Niagara River at Niagara Falls, replacing the old suspension bridge at that point. Under his regime the main line of the Grand Trunk was double-tracked all the way from Ste. Rosalle, a point thirty-eight miles east of Montreal, to Chicago, a distance of 878 miles.\n\n\n\nUpon the death of the late Collis P. Huntington, the President and a large owner in the Southern Pacific Company and steamship lines, controling upward of 10,0000 miles, Mr. Hays was the first choice for his successor, and the appointment was made Jan. 1, 1901. In the Autumn of the same year, he resigned and was recalled to take charge of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, of Canada, becoming Second Vice President and General Manager Jan. 1, 1902.\n\n\n\nThe same year, Mr. Hays conceived the project of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his Government made possible by the passage of the necessary legislation in 1903 and 1904. This line will he the only transcontinental railway wholly within Canadian territory. It will rum from Moncton, N. B., to Prince Rupert, B. C., about 3,600 miles.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1910, Mr. Hays was elected a member of the Board of Directors of the Grand Trunk Central Railway Company, and on that date was made President of the company and its consolidated lines and subsidiary railroad and steamship companies.\n\n\n\nMr. Hays has been in full charge of the company's affairs in America. A year ago Sir Wilfrid Laurier, at a dinner of the Canadian Club of New York, held at the Hotel Astor, said:\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Hays is beyond question the greatest railroad genius in Canada. As an executive genius he ranks second only to the late Edward H. Harriman.\""}, {"url": "https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/charles-melville-hays", "page_content": "EC3, Lombard Street, 57 - 59, St Edmund the King Church\n\nSt Edmund the King church is now the London Centre for Spiritual Direction.

Gregg in St Louis, Mo., and they had four daughters; d. 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic, and was buried in Montreal.\n\nCharles M. Hays grew up and received his early education in St Joseph, Mo. At 17 he began work in St Louis with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. In 1878 he was appointed secretary to the general manager of the Missouri Pacific and six years later he accepted a similar position with the larger Wabash, St Louis and Pacific. He became general manager of the Wabash Western in 1887 and of the entire Wabash system in 1889.\n\nA reorganization of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada in 1895 resulted in Hays\u2019s appointment as general manager of that system, effective 1 Jan. 1896, and his move with his family to Montreal. His predecessor, Lewis James Seargeant, became a special adviser to the GTR\u2019s London-based board of directors. With one interruption, in 1901, Hays held his position until 1909, when he was appointed president; he was president as well of the railway\u2019s western Canadian subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Pacific, from 1904 until his death.\n\nHe had arrived in Canada at a time of economic depression. The performance of railways had been disappointing for years, although the Canadian Pacific Railway had fared better than the larger, more heavily indebted GTR. Hays was brought in to make major managerial changes \u2013 specifically to introduce \u201cAmerican\u201d methods which were more aggressive and less scrupulous than those of British systems. His first responsibility was to restructure the GTR\u2019s administration and operations. Instead of relying only on the reports and recommendations of senior administrators in Britain, he sought the opinions and advice of operating staff in Canada. Traffic exchanges with other systems, the negotiation of running rights, and the modernization of accounting procedures solved many of the practical problems left unaddressed by the head office. Hays was even willing to sell important trackage between Toronto and Hamilton to the rival CPR, but only after the GTR had obtained an advantageous agreement on running rights. The improved efficiency resulting from these reforms coincided with an era of unprecedented growth and enabled him to bring the GTR from a state of near-bankruptcy to one of moderate success. In the process, Hays, a stocky man who invariably appeared well dressed with a neat beard, became known for his unwillingness to tolerate any interference in the way he ran the railway and for his implacable disdain for organized labour, especially during a dispute in Ontario in 1905 and a bitter, system-wide strike in 1910.\n\nAfter 1896 Canadian prosperity was based on the settlement of the prairies. To compete effectively with the CPR, Hays believed the GTR had to cross them. In 1900 he had advanced a grandiose plan to run the lines of an American subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Western, from Chicago to Winnipeg and thence to the Pacific. The directors in London rejected this proposal and in late 1900 Hays resigned to become president of the Southern Pacific Railroad in the United States as of 1 Jan. 1901. Unfortunately for him, it was taken over by the interests of railway magnate Edward Henry Harriman. Hays disagreed with the new owners and quit; by the end of 1901 he had returned to his old job, and a vice-presidency, at the GTR. In the meantime its board had been persuaded by president Sir Charles Rivers Wilson to adopt an aggressive policy of westward expansion. Significantly too, the federal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier had decided to promote the building of a second transcontinental railway. On the failure of the GTR and the smaller, prairie-based Canadian Northern to unite on such a project, Ottawa threw its support behind the GTR. On 24 Nov. 1902 Hays formally announced plans to construct a transcontinental.\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific, Hays\u2019s greatest and most controversial work in Canada, was to consist of two sections: a line west from Winnipeg and a government-built line between Winnipeg and Moncton, N.B., that was to connect with the old Grand Trunk system. Hays was responsible for the construction and operation policies of the new western line. His persistent demands for federal subsidization, however, contributed to bitter discord within Laurier\u2019s cabinet [see Andrew George Blair*], which could not agree on a policy. In May 1903 Hays was joined by president Sir Charles Wilson, who was able to exert greater influence on cabinet; together they formed an effective team, one tough, the other smooth. Hays was willing to promise whatever Wilson thought diplomatically necessary, but he did so only if there were no real means for the government to enforce terms that the GTP might find inconvenient in the future. Nevertheless, his concessions were critically important in meeting specific political difficulties faced by Laurier when he was promoting the transcontinental scheme in parliament that summer and fall. In October the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed and the GTP was incorporated.\n\nFour aspects of Hays\u2019s GTP policies were particularly problematic. He seriously underestimated the Canadian Northern, whose owners he thought would sell out to him but who, instead, launched vigorous competition. A second, more difficult matter was the commitment of the GTR to the GTP. There were no existing traffic links between the two systems, and the board in London was not willing to give the western project its unqualified support. Nevertheless, Hays, acting without proper authorization from London, committed the parent company in 1903 to conditions which would ultimately ruin the GTP and the Grand Trunk. The selection in 1905 of the site of Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., as the western terminal was the third controversial decision supported by Hays. There was little local traffic on the portion of the line in northern British Columbia, only 100 miles of which had been built by 1912, but Hays insisted that it would prove beneficial since it shortened the route to Asia.\n\nA final, disastrous decision involved the priority Hays gave to the construction of the GTP to the highest standards in North America, before a system of feeders had been developed on the prairies. The resulting delay in completion and the lack of competition allowed the CPR and the Canadian Northern to consolidate their holds on traffic on the prairies. Consequently, what was arguably the best main line across western Canada did not attract the volume of freight needed for profitable operation.\n\nHays did not live to see the GTP completed: he perished in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Sanctified by this tragic end and by his high social standing in Montreal, including membership in the American Presbyterian Church, he was eulogized as one of Canada\u2019s greatest railwaymen. On 25 April 1912 work and movement on the GTR\u2019s entire system stopped for five minutes in tribute. Hays\u2019s legacy, however, was mixed. He presided over the most prosperous era in the history of the GTR, but as president of the GTP he initiated policies and programs which led in 1919 to the GTP being placed in receivership and to legislation authorizing federal acquisition of the GTR\u2019s capital stock. During the proceedings of the board appointed to value this stock, it was alleged that Hays had deceived the London directors in 1903 and that they had never knowingly endorsed the scheme that led to the insolvency and nationalization of the entire system.\n\nTheodore D. Regehr"}, {"url": "https://canadaehx.com/2022/02/23/the-history-of-warren/", "page_content": "The land of Melville, Saskatchewan has only been settled for a little over a century. Before that, it was the land of the Indigenous who followed the bison through the region over the centuries. The Indigenous groups were primarily the Blackfoot and the Cree, along with the western edge of the Anishinaabe.\n\nEventually, the bison started to disappear due to overhunting by Canadians and Americans. Nearing starvation, the Indigenous of the area would sign Treaty 4 and move to a series of reserves in what would be eastern Saskatchewan.\n\nToday, Melville sits on Treaty 4 land.\n\nThe settlement era of Melville begins, as with so many other prairie communities, with the arrival of the railroad. In the early 1900s, the Grand Trunk Railway was approaching the area. In 1906, the first parcel of land in what would be Melville was sold to a Mr. Pope. He was sure that the land he had bought would one day be part of a city, and he was right. Today, Melville is the smallest city in Saskatchewan. Melville officially became a city on Aug. 1, 1960.\n\nIn 1908, the railroad was finished in the area and Melville was officially born. It could be natural to assume that Melville was named for Herman Melville, the writer of Moby Dick, but that would not be the case. Melville was named for Charles Melville Hayes, who was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway. Unfortunately, Hayes would only live four more years. In April 1912, he was on a voyage from the Britain to North America on the RMS Titanic. He would not make it off the ship.\n\nThe future of Melville was assured when it was decided that the community would be the second divisional point on the railway west of Winnipeg. With the construction of its railyard, people began to flood into the area.\n\nBy this point, 30 blocks had been surveyed and staked. Lots began to sell for $60 to $400, which would be about $1,600 to $11,000 today. The population of Melville began to explode. In 1907, the population was 66, which rose to 625 in 1908. By 1909, Melville had over 1,000 people.\n\nIn 1910, the Montreal Gazette reported quote:\n\n\u201cThree years ago, Melville had but one building. Today, it has over 500 buildings and this number is constantly being added to\u2026Every day the traffic on the main line of the Grand Trunk Pacific is increasing and with every increase comes an addition to the force of railroad employees, making Melville their home and headquarters.\u201d\n\nComing out of the community, there were 20 different rail lines that spread across the country and even into the United States.\n\nIn 1911, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway built a new Third Class Railway Station in the community. This type of station was designed to handle small traffic volumes. For decades, this station was the focal point of activity in Melville as the railroad was one of the largest employers in the community. In 1977, the station was relocated, and the restoration of the building began. Today, it is the Melville Railway Museum and if you love trains, this is a great place to visit. Inside the museum, you will find antique communication equipment including telegraphs and vintage telephones. On the property that includes the original station, now a Municipal Heritage Property, there is also a steam engine, a coal tender, a flat car and an original caboose. The locomotive was built in 1919 in Montreal and was used to pull passenger cars for decades, as well as some freight. The caboose was built in 1895 by the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1925, it was transferred to the Canadian National Railway. This caboose would serve as the bunk house for the train crews. After its use was over in the 1980s, it was completely restored. It was then used as the Tourism Melville Office until 2006 when a new tourism office was built in the community.\n\nWith Melville expanding quickly, the town leaders decided that the community needed a new city hall. Built of brick and stone, this two-storey building was constructed from 1912 to 1913 and features a large central dome that helped it become a landmark in the community. With optimism for the future, Melville, along with other communities in Saskatchewan, built buildings that may have been too large for their time. In all, 19 such buildings were erected in Saskatchewan and the Melville City Hall is the only one that remains intact in its original form. It is also only one of two to have a central dome over the auditorium. Standing today, it is a beautiful building to visit. In 1991, it was made a Provincial Heritage Property of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1913, the Luther Academy was built in Melville. This large gothic style building became one of the most noticeable structures in the entire community and it would remain the home of the Academy until 1926 when it moved to Regina. At that point, the building became the St. Paul\u2019s Home for the Aged and the Orphans. The organization would stay in the building until 1973 when it closed. For the next 10 years it sat empty but in 1983, the building was turned into the Melville Heritage Museum, more on that later. Today, the building is a recognized Municipal Heritage Property.\n\nThe Melville Millionaires have existed since 1908 and are one of the oldest teams in Saskatchewan. Since 1970, the team has been a member of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League and while it has never won a championship, the team has had several notable players take to the ice for them. These players include Ron Hextall, Brian Propp and Chris Kunitz. Another player who wore the Millionaires jersey was Eddie Shore, one of the greatest players in NHL history, who played for them in the 1923-24 season.\n\nThe reason I bring up the current team is because the original team, which played senior hockey in the Southern Saskatchewan Hockey League, was one of the best teams to ever play in the province.\n\nIn 1915, the Millionaires became not only the best team in Saskatchewan, but the best amateur team in the entire country.\n\nBy winning the Southern Saskatchewan Hockey League, they were given possession of the Allan Cup, having defeated the previous holders, Regina Victorias. Once the Millionaires had the Cup, they then had to defend it and they would do so in two challenges during 1915 against some of the best teams in the league.\n\nIn the first Allan Cup challenge that the Millionaires faced, the Prince Albert Mintos played them in a two-game series. In those two games, the Millionaires won both games, scoring 15 goals to the 13 scored by the Mintos. With that challenge win, the Millionaires were able to keep the Allan Cup.\n\nThe Edmonton Bulletin would state quote:\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most pleasing part of the game from a Melville standpoint was the performance of Moyness. It was his second game this season and he showed all the ear marks of a star, which was the case last year.\u201d\n\nThe challenges in 1915 didn\u2019t stop there. The Toronto Victorias then challenged Melville. Once again, Melville won the series but this one was a bit closer. In the first game, the Millionaires and Victorias both scored eight goals for a tie game. In the second game, the Millionaires won 7-3. By outscoring Toronto 15-11, Melville once again held onto the Allan Cup.\n\nIn the third challenge of 1915, the Winnipeg Monarchs took on Melville in another two games. In the first game, Melville won 4-3, but the second game was won by the Monarchs by a score of 4-2. By outscoring Melville 7-6, Winnipeg took possession of the Allan Cup.\n\nThe Edmonton Bulletin reported quote:\n\n\u201cBattling as they have never battled before and playing the most sensational hockey that they have ever shown after being against one of the hardest positions a hockey team ever met, the Monarchs of Winnipeg came from behind in the second half and won back the Allan Cup when they defeated Melville here tonight.\u201d\n\nThus ended the Allan Cup championship run for the Melville Millionaires.\n\nUnfortunately for Melville, their name was removed from the Allan Cup 18 years later by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association because they did not hold the trophy at the end of the year.\n\nIn 1979, the Melville Millionaires were inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nSo, why was the team called The Millionaires? One story, which isn\u2019t true, says the name came from the fact that Charles Melville Hayes was on the Titanic with a group of millionaires.\n\nThat isn\u2019t the true story though.\n\nIn truth, when the Millionaires were assembled to win the Allan Cup by Goldie Smith, several well-known players for the time went to the team. Several critics grumbled that Melville would have to be a town of Millionaires to attract such talent. Smith liked the idea of this, and the name Millionaires stuck to the team.\n\nMelville has had a fascinating history with NHL players coming from the community. In all, 14 people from Melville have gone on to play in the NHL to various levels of success. No player has had the success of Sid Abel though, one of the greatest NHL players ever.\n\nAbel was born in Melville on Feb. 22, 1918. As a young man, he gained the nickname of Old Bootnose. In 1938, he would go on to play for the Flin Flon Bombers and then spent two years playing for the Detroit Red Wings and its minor league affiliates. In 1940, he went full-time for the Red Wings, and he would become the team captain in 1942 and won the Stanley Cup in 1943 with the team. After serving in the Second World War with the Royal Canadian Air Force, he would be joined in the Red Wings by Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay. As part of the Production Line, he would win the Stanley Cup in 1950 and 1952, and the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1949. Upon his retirement in 1953-54, Abel had 283 points in 612 games. In 1969, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and in 1996, his number 12 was retired by the Detroit Red Wings. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL players ever. He would pass away on Feb. 8, 2000.\n\nBy 1938, Melville was gaining notice for its success as the largest divisional point between Winnipeg and Saskatoon. At the time, it had a population of 4,000 people. The community had also recently built a new arena at the cost of $65,000 which was no small amount during The Great Depression.\n\nIn June 1939, Melville briefly became the largest community in the entire province. It was all thanks to the arrival of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth who were travelling Canada on their famous Royal Tour of Canada. I actually looked at this Royal Tour in January, so check it out on the podcast.\n\nThe Royal Couple arrived in Melville at 10 p.m. on the day of their visit and 60,000 people were waiting for them. The community typically had a population of only 3,000. With such a huge influx of people into the community, the Royal Couple decided to spend several hours in Melville, rather than the originally planned 10 minutes. In the crowd were 600 First World War veterans, 10,000 school children and a 200-piece orchestra.\n\nR.J. Carnegie would say of the stop in Melville, quote:\n\n\u201cNever throughout the tour did I see such unbridled enthusiasm as then.\u201d\n\nThe community is in the Central Time Zone but for the Royal Visit and to keep everything on the same day, the community temporarily switched to the Mountain Time Zone.\n\nKing would write quote:\n\n\u201cWe got the surprise of our lives when we reached Melville. There was the largest outdoor massing of children and others that I have seen at any of the stations. I think the King and Queen were almost taken off their feet by surprise as they went to the platform.\u201d\n\nWith its population swelling to 60,000 people, Melville became the largest city in Saskatchewan for a few hours.\n\nOn July 28, 1978, Queen Elizabeth would follow in the footsteps of her father when she too came to Melville for a visit. She arrived at 2 p.m. in the community where hundreds of people lined the streets to see her train arrive. She then took a car to Melville School to honour it on its 70th anniversary. She would watch a performance by Ukrainian dancers, and she met with the local Indigenous leader Noel Williams. A large crowd also gave the Queen, who was accompanied by Prince Philip, a rousing send-off.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the history of Melville, then the best place to visit is the Melville Heritage Museum, located in the aforementioned Luther Academy Building. In the building, the museum has over 10,000 artifacts from the town\u2019s history, as well as 1,000 books including textbooks written in German, English, Ukrainian, Latin and Greek. Across three floors and the basement, there are 20 rooms that look at the history of the area. These include recreations of a chapel, Grand Trunk Pacific/CNR room, sports history room and a military room. There are over 100 original black and white framed photographs, and murals that depict the first quarter century of Melville.\n\nIf you visit Melville, you will notice that throughout the community there are a series of silhouettes dotting the community. Depicting a person on a bike, a locomotive and conductor, a farmer, a hockey player and figure skater, an RCMP officer, a cowboy, a bison and more. In all, there are 30 figures depicted. These displays were made by local welders and every figure depicts something from the local life and things to do in Melville.\n\nShare this Facebook Twitter Reddit\n\nLiked it?

At the age of 17, he began working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis, Missouri. He became a secretary to the general manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1878. After his time as a secretary he then was the General Manager for the Grand Trunk Railroad from 1896 \u2013 1909, where he became President until his death in 1912. He married Clara Jennings Gregg in 1881 and together had four daughters. They then moved to Melville in 1909 and started the construction of the railway between Regina and Melville. He was a major part in the building of the City Hall Opera House because he believed it would be a great way to represent the growing community.\n\nThe Naming of Melville\n\nAdditionally, due to his role in making Melville a hub in the railway, his middle name became the basis for which our city was named. According to records from the late J. W. Redgwick, who also played an important entrepreneurial role in early Melville, claimed that, \"there were several rumours about the name of the place - one name mentioned was Hayes, another Melhayes, and the name finally decided on by the Grant Trunk Pacific officials was the middle name of their president\". The name was officially introduced and used instead of 'Killaly', in 1908.\n\nThe End of the Legacy\n\nAt the age of 55, Charles was one of the 1,503 people who died on the RMS Titanic in 1912. His wife and daughters were able to make it off of the ship alive and came back to Melville to continue his legacy. Charles is buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal."}, {"url": "http://nauticapedia.ca/Articles/Hays_Charles.php", "page_content": "Charles M. Hays \u2013 A Titanic Loss\n\nby Lynn Salmon 2014\n\nPrince Rupert\u2019s deep water harbour, ships at anchor, cruise ship dock at lower left corner, overlooking Cow Bay. (Photo from the Laura Yerex collection.)\n\nThe early 1900s in Canada were a time of great and rapid expansion; construction on an epic scale was embraced and lauded. In 1910 Prince Rupert was carved from the dense forest that towered over the shores of one of the deepest natural harbours in the world. Situated on the northern coast of British Columbia at the southern tip of the Alaskan panhandle, it was strategically located to divert coastal trade and exploit the seemingly endless natural resources of the area.\n\nDevelopment was intense, anticipating the wealth and prestige of being the terminus of the ambitious Grand Trunk Pacific Railway \u2013 a line that would run from Montreal right across the prairies to the profitable shores of British Columbia. The city boomed in its infancy; stump\u2013laden, muskeg\u2013mired lots just 25 feet in width sold for hundreds of dollars sight unseen by speculators eager to cash in on the easy money of a resource town. Fishing, logging, mining, railroads: Prince Rupert looked to be the next big boom. Canadian Prime Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier, a champion supporter of expansion westward, came out to visit in 1910. There seemed to be no limits to the successes that awaited the fledgling city.\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic in the Irish town of Belfast, the White Star Line, a subsidiary of millionaire J.P. Morgan\u2019s International Mercantile Marine, was building the second of three large ocean liners. The RMS Olympic was already a resounding success in her initial year of transits between Southampton, Cherbourg and Queenstown (now Cobh) and New York. The RMS Titanic, under construction eleven months behind her sister, was slated to make the same run on the opposite schedule. Titanic lived up to her name: massive and grand and White Star Line was rightfully pleased with their building efforts. Her maiden voyage was set for April 10th, 1912 and due to a just\u2013ending coal strike in England the bunkers of other liners were robbed to fill the holds on Titanic. This meant the passengers booked on those ships were now transferred to Titanic as well. She sailed with 2200 persons aboard and Charles M. Hays was among them.\n\nStatue of Charles M. Hays at the City Hall, Prince Rupert BC. (Photo from the Laura Yerex collection.)\n\nCharles M. Hays was an American railroader whose vision for a northern rail line terminating in Prince Rupert sent him to Europe looking for capital investors. The Grand Trunk Pacific was struggling to grow and compete with the Canadian Pacific Railway for a share in the transportation market. The idea for a northern transcontinental rail line terminating at Prince Rupert was ambitious; magnificent in scale and an enterprise that required a lot of money and the indomitable drive of one man.\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born at Rock Island, Illinois in May 1856. He was working on the railway by the age of 17 and by 22 had established himself with the Missouri Pacific Railway as the secretary to the manager of the rail. In his personal life he was married in 1881 to Clara Gregg and they had four daughters. He continued to work for various rail lines in the States until he took an appointment as general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific based out of Montreal in 1896.\n\nHays secured funds from the Laurier government to begin construction on the rail line in 1902 but the costs involved skyrocketed and by 1911 the debt accumulated was nearing 100 million dollars. His answer to this was to continue building: investing in rolling stock, track laying and erecting grand hotels in competition with the prosperous Canadian Pacific Hotels. The Chateau Laurier (named in recognition of the prime minister\u2019s support) was almost ready to open in Ottawa and plans were readied for six similar luxury hotels at locations across the country including Prince Rupert. Francis Rattenbury, the architect of the Parliament Buildings in Victoria BC, was commissioned to design one of the grandest terminals yet to be seen in Canada at Prince Rupert. (The plans for the building can be viewed at the Prince Rupert archives.)\n\nTo see the completion of his grand schemes and secure even more money to spend his way out of debt, he travelled to England to address the Grand Trunk Railway board of directors (the GTP\u2019s parent company) and convince them to continue investing in the company\u2019s future. He won the tentative approval from the GT board to continue with his plans and with this knowledge he mercilessly pursued the White Star Line with his ideas of connecting ships and rail lines, convinced that profits were just around the corner.\n\nIt would be a tough sell and an ultimately futile one. When Hays went down in the Titanic in April 1912 he took the GTP with him. He was travelling with a large party on board, his wife and one daughter among the group. When the call came for women and children to board the lifeboats, Hays saw both women safely into a lifeboat and remarked that he was confident the ship would remain afloat for \u2018a good ten hours\u2019. Hays was fatally wrong. His body, identified by an engraved watch he was carrying, was recovered twelve days later by the ship Minia. He was returned to Montreal in his private rail car where he was laid to rest in Mount Royal Cemetery beneath a conspicuous monument. On the day of his burial all GTP workers across the country ceased for a five minutes to pay respect to the man who had taken the vision of a second transcontinental railway to the government and attempted to make the concept a reality.\n\nIn Prince Rupert, though the rail line was completed, the grand hotel was never built and GTP was in financial ruin by 1914. By 1920 the Federal Government stepped in and created the Canadian National from the remnants of the GTP. Hays\u2019 impact on Prince Rupert, and across the country, is commemorated by a statue that stands beside the city hall in Prince Rupert, and the naming of the towns of Melville (Saskatchewan) and Hays (Alberta) as well as the large mountain that rises above Prince Rupert.\n\nIncidentally, the rail car that delivered his body to Montreal has been preserved and is now displayed at the Canadian Railway Museum in Quebec. He was offered a knighthood in 1910 but declined it as he did not want to relinquish his American citizenship. The Japanese awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun in 1907. This medal is on display at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nThe Grand Trunk, the Titanic and Charles Hays have long since vanished. Prince Rupert, as a primarily resource\u2013dependent city, has continued over the decades in cyclical booms and busts. They celebrated their centenary in 2010 expressing a still hopeful future. Today the city is anticipating a resurgence of investment as gas and oil interests build facilities to handle the shipping of their products westward. Log exports continue and the container port expands as shipping demand increases.\n\nOne can only wonder what Prince Rupert\u2019s future would have been had Charles Hays survived the sinking of the Titanic. His was indeed a \"titanic loss\".\n\nTo quote from this article please cite:"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Charles-Melville-Hays/6000000016092549189", "page_content": "About Charles Melville Hays\n\nDictionary of Canadian Biography Online\n\nhttp://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/charles-melvill...\n\nName: Mr Charles Melville Hays\n\nBorn: Friday 16th May 1856\n\nAge: 55 years\n\nLast Residence: in Montreal Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Canada\n\nOccupation: Businessman\n\n1st Class passenger\n\nFirst Embarked: Southampton on Wednesday 10th April 1912\n\nTicket No. 12749 , \u00a393 10s\n\nCabin No.: B69\n\nDied in the sinking.\n\nBody recovered by: Minia (No. 307)\n\nBuried: Mount Royal Cemetery Montreal Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c Canada on Wednesday 8th May 1912.\n\nMr Charles Melville Hays, 55, was born at Rock Island, Illinois, USA, on 16 May 1856. He was educated at the public schools of Rock Island, and went to work for the Atlantic and Pacific Railway when he was 17. At 22 he was appointed secretary to the Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railway.\n\nHe married Clara Gregg in St. Louis Mo, 13 October 1881, and they had four daughters.\n\nIn 1889 he was appointed general manager of the entire Wabash Railway network. In 1896 he moved to Montreal to become general manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It was Hays who convinced the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of the need for a second transcontinental railroad. To this extent, the Canadian government subsidized the Grand Trunk to the tune of $30-million, and in November 1902 construction of the railroad began. The company's board of directors in England, however, were more concerned with dividends than with risky expansion. Financing proved chaotic, and at the end of 1911 the railroad was 100-million in debt. Hays went to England for a directors meeting where he proposed to spend the company's way out of bankruptcy by upgrading rolling stock, double tracking and by building a chain of luxury hotels across Canada. Hays had already built the flagship hotel, the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier in Ottawa, and had plans for six others, including the Fort Garry in Winnipeg and the Macdonald Hotel in Edmonton.\n\nHe arrived in England \"looking fagged and tired,\" according to Alfred Smithers, Chairman of the Grand Trunk's board of directors. He was supposed to spend Easter in Paris with his daughter and son in law, Thornton and Orian Davidson, but in a letter to friends in Montreal on April 1, said he preferred to stay at Smithers country estate in Kent before sailing home on 10 April on the Titanic. The recipient is unknown, partly because the letter is so hard to decipher, it is possibly Lockett Gavin Coleman, asst. superintendant of the Grand Trunk Railroad but the informality of the letter suggests it was to a close friend or relative. [See Titanica page for images and transcriptions of letters]\n\nWhile in England he recieved news that the third of his four daughters, Louise, was having a difficult pregnancy and might have to be delivered by Ceasearean section. ANother reason for his return was the imminent opening of the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier Hotel on April 26. Travelling with him would be Paul Romaine Chevr\u00e9, the sculptor who had done the bust of Laurier that still stands in the lobby.\n\nIn his business dealings Hays had had discussions with the White Star Line about speeding travellers from Europe to the Orient using White Star ships and his transcontinental railroad. As a result, J. Bruce Ismay invited Hays and his entourage as guests aboard Titanic. They paid \u00a393 10s to cover incidental expenses, travelled on ticket number 12749, and occupied four cabins: B-69-71-73 and B-24. (Mr and Mrs Hays in B-69, Thornton and Orian Davidson in B-71, their maid Miss Perreault in B-73 and Hays secretary, Vivian Payne, in B-24).\n\nOne hour before the disaster, Hays relaxed with Colonel Archibald Gracie and Captain Edward Crosby in the Gentlemen's Smoking Lounge and they talked about the technological advances in transportation. At one point, Hays conceded that while Titanic was a superlative vessel, he expressed concern that \"the trend to playing fast and loose with larger and larger ships will end in tragedy.\" Twenty minutes later, Titanic struck the iceburg. Hays never believed the ship would sink quickly. As he put his wife and daughter into a lifeboat he assured them Titanic would stay \"afloat for at least 10 hours.\"\n\nHays drowned in the disaster, but the Minia recovered his body on 26 April. \"It was no trouble to identify him as he had a lot of papers on him and a watch with his name on it,\" sailor Francis Dyke wrote to his mother. His coffin was brought back to Montreal for burial aboard his private railway car, Canada. The car is still preserved and on display at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson, Quebec.\n\nSimultaneous funerals for Hays were held on 8 May at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal...\n\n...and at the Church of St. Edmund King and Martyr in London. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the funeral, as the Montreal Herald Reported:\n\n\"From Montreal to Chicago, from New Brunswick to the Pacific coast, in all the thousands of miles of sidings and branch lines owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway, in every Grand Trunk Depot, at every Grand Trunk crossing, action ceased for the space of five full minutes as the Grand Trunk Railway system paid its respects to the memory of its great departed chief. For five minutes activities were suspended and the thousands of individuals who serve the great system in various capacities bowed their heads in silent tribute. Then once more work resumed, the wheels turned, and in 30 seconds things had been as they had before.\"\n\nHays is buried in the Pine Hill Section, (Lot 246) of Montreals' Mount Royal Cemetery. A massive monument is inscribed:\n\n\"And so he died and the example of his simple, devoted consecrated life is our priceless heritage. We are a different people, we are a better people, because this man worked and loved and died.\"\n\n\n\nThe town of Melville in Saskatchewan and Hays in Alberta, Canada are named for him, and a statue in his memory was erected in Prince Rupert, B.C. which would have been the Pacific terminus city of the transcontinental railroad he had planned to build.\n\nIn 1919 the Grand Trunk Railroad was placed in recievership, and later was absorbed into Canadian National Railways.\n\nNotes\n\nIn 1907 Hays was given Japan's highest decoration, the Order of the Rising Sun by Prince Fushimi, and in 1910 was offered a knighthood but turned it down because to become Sir Charles would have meant giving up his U.S. citizenship. His Japanese decoration can be seen today at the Lyman House Memorial Museum in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nTravelling Companions (on same ticket)\n\nReferences and Sources\n\nNewark Evening News, 16 April 1912, Word Received Here of C.

Hasta hace muy poco no ten\u00edamos ni siquiera una fotograf\u00eda de \u00e9l, pero en marzo de 2.013 finalmente se public\u00f3 la \u00fanica de la que existe constancia. La imagen muestra a un Vivian beb\u00e9, con apenas 9 meses.\n\nVivian Payne con apenas 9 meses. La imagen est\u00e1 deteriorada, pero el paso del tiempo no ha podido ocultar sus ojos llenos de vida y la atm\u00f3sfera de futuro que cualquier ni\u00f1o de su edad desprende. Lamentablemente, para Vivian ser\u00eda un futuro demasiado corto\n\nQueremos que esta entrada sirva como homenaje a todos los j\u00f3venes llenos de sue\u00f1os que se hundieron con el Titanic y de los que apenas conocemos los nombres.\n\n__________\n\nVivian Ponsonby Payne naci\u00f3 en 1.889. Su padre, un contable de la Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, muri\u00f3 en 1.903 cuando Vivian s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os. El presidente de la compa\u00f1\u00eda donde trabajaba, Charles Melville Hays, se convirti\u00f3 casi en un padre para el chico tras el fallecimiento del suyo. Para Hays fue todo un placer ya que s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda hijas.\n\nCharles Hays, el que fuera como un padre para Vivian tras la muerte del suyo\n\nAsisti\u00f3 a la Escuela Superior de Montreal, donde fue calificado como \u201cun estudiante brillante, su reputaci\u00f3n no fue dada s\u00f3lo por su gran capacidad, sino por su duro trabajo\u201d.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de su graduaci\u00f3n fue contratado por Hays como secretario personal y trabaj\u00f3 para la Grand Trunk haciendo recados entre las oficinas de Montreal y Ottawa. El Montreal Herald, un peri\u00f3dico canadiense, dijo sobre \u00e9l lo siguiente:\n\n\u201cMr. Payne ten\u00eda el don de hacer amigos sin ning\u00fan esfuerzo y atra\u00eda a todo aquel con quien entrara en contacto.\u201d\n\nA principios de 1.912 Vivian acompa\u00f1\u00f3 al matrimonio Hays y su familia a un viaje por Europa. El joven pisar\u00eda por primera vez Inglaterra y qued\u00f3 asombrado con los hermosos paisajes. Escribi\u00f3 entusiasmado a su madre una carta donde describ\u00eda con gran ilusi\u00f3n, lo incre\u00edble que le parec\u00eda que todo fuese verde en pleno marzo.\n\nPor lo poco que podemos extraer de su carta y lo que los que le conocieron dec\u00edan de \u00e9l, se puede deducir que Vivian viv\u00eda con ilusi\u00f3n cada momento, que era un gran trabajador y sobretodo, podemos destacar su alegr\u00eda.\n\nHays y su s\u00e9quito embarcaron al Titanic el mi\u00e9rcoles 10 de abril de 1.912 en el puerto de Southampton, Inglaterra. Lo hicieron como invitados del mism\u00edsimo Bruce Ismay, el presidente de la White Star Line, la compa\u00f1\u00eda naviera propietaria del buque.\n\nLa familia regresaba precipitadamente debido a las complicaciones del embarazo de una de las hijas de los Hays, Louise, que se presentaba con amenaza de ces\u00e1rea. De no haber sido as\u00ed, seguramente el viaje se hubiese alargado algunos d\u00edas m\u00e1s.\n\nLa partida ocup\u00f3 cuatro camarotes de primera clase, Charles y Clara Hays el B-69, la hija y el yerno de \u00e9stos, Orian y Thornton Davidson el B-71, la doncella de Clara, Mary Anne Perreault, el B-73 y el joven Vivian el B-24.\n\nEl camarote que utiliz\u00f3 Vivian Payne. Estaba situado en la cubierta B por el lado de babor por proa\n\nLa noche del 14 de abril de 1.912, a las 23,40 horas, el Titanic choca con un iceberg que le hiere de forma mortal. Probablemente la familia Hays, su doncella y el joven Payne subiesen presurosos a la cubierta de botes.\n\nClara, Orian y Anne embarcaron en uno de los primeros salvavidas, el 3, que dej\u00f3 el Titanic a alrededor de las 00,50-00,55 horas. Ninguno de los tres hombres tuvo la oportunidad de subir con ellas y seguramente se quedasen despidi\u00e9ndolas desde la cubierta mientras el bote era bajado.\n\nLa noche era cada vez m\u00e1s fr\u00eda y los tres intentar\u00edan por todos los medios salvar la vida, pero eran varones y su condici\u00f3n no ayudaba. El 80,5% de los hombres que hab\u00eda en el buque, perecer\u00edan.\n\nSeguramente se mantuviesen los tres juntos hasta el final. Se lanzar\u00edan al mar intentando la \u00faltima oportunidad, sin embargo no les servir\u00eda de nada. El joven Vivian falleci\u00f3 esa noche junto con su mentor y casi padre Charles Hays y el yerno de \u00e9ste, Thornton Davidson. Podemos imaginarnos la impotencia de Hays al no poder hacer nada por el que sent\u00eda era su propio hijo.\n\nEl 26 de abril el Minia encontr\u00f3 el cad\u00e1ver de Charles Hays, pero nunca pudieron hacerlo con los de Thonrton y el joven Vivian.\n\nMientras tanto en Canad\u00e1 la madre de Vivian esperaba impaciente noticias de su hijo. Tan pronto como se enter\u00f3 de la gravedad de la situaci\u00f3n, se dirigi\u00f3 a las oficinas de la compa\u00f1\u00eda naviera, la White Star Line en Montreal y suplic\u00f3 que le diesen noticias de su hijo. Desesperada implor\u00f3 que fuese uno de los supervivientes. El peri\u00f3dico canadiense Toronto Globe recogi\u00f3 sus palabras.\n\n\u201c\u00bfNo pueden encontrar nada acerca de mi hijo? \u00c9l es mi beb\u00e9 y s\u00f3lo tiene 22 a\u00f1os. \u00bfNo cree que el se\u00f1or Hays pueda haberlo salvado?\u201d\n\nDesgraciadamente para ella sus deseos nunca se har\u00edan realidad, jam\u00e1s volver\u00eda a ver a su hijo. Lo \u00fanico que le quedar\u00eda de \u00e9l, ser\u00eda el recuerdo de esos ojos vivaces que tanto se iluminaban.\n\nUna placa de lat\u00f3n fue erigida en su memoria en la Iglesia Cristiana Anglicana de Montreal, Canad\u00e1. Fue pagada por 123 de sus asociados."}]}
