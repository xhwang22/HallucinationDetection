{"Alfred Fischer was responsible for the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz.": [{"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz", "page_content": "Where was Auschwitz Located?\n\nAuschwitz is the German name for the Polish city O\u015bwi\u0119cim. O\u015bwi\u0119cim is located in Poland, approximately 40 miles (about 64 km) west of Krak\u00f3w. Germany annexed this area of Poland in 1939.\n\nThe Auschwitz concentration camp was located on the outskirts of O\u015bwi\u0119cim in German-occupied Poland. It was originally established in 1940 and later referred to as \"Auschwitz I\" or \"Main Camp.\"\n\nThe Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center, also referred to as \"Auschwitz II,\" was located near the Polish village Brzezinka (German: Birkenau). This is about 2 miles (just over 3 km) from the Main Camp. The Germans started construction on Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1941.\n\nAuschwitz III or Monowitz was located near the Polish village of Monowice (German: Monowitz). This is about 4 miles (approximately 6.5 kilometers) from the Main Camp. The Germans initially established the Buna subcamp there in 1942. In 1943, it became a concentration camp.\n\nThe Auschwitz camp complex also included numerous subcamps. The majority of these subcamps were located in the region around Auschwitz.\n\nNumber of Victims\n\nIt is estimated that the SS and police deported at least 1.3 million people to the Auschwitz camp complex between 1940 and 1945. Of these deportees, approximately 1.1 million people were murdered.\n\nThe best estimates of the number of victims at the Auschwitz camp complex, including the killing center at Auschwitz-Birkenau, between 1940 and 1945 are:\n\nDuring the Holocaust, concentration camp prisoners received tattoos only at one location, Auschwitz. Incoming prisoners were assigned a camp serial number which was sewn to their prison uniforms. Only those prisoners selected for work were issued serial numbers; those prisoners sent directly to the gas chambers were not registered and received no tattoos.\n\nAuschwitz I\n\nAuschwitz I, the main camp, was the first camp established near Oswiecim. Construction began in April 1940 in an abandoned Polish army barracks in a suburb of the city.\n\nSS authorities continuously used prisoners for forced labor to expand the camp. During the first year of the camp\u2019s existence, the SS and police cleared a zone of approximately 40 square kilometers (15.44 square miles) as a \u201cdevelopment zone\u201d reserved for the exclusive use of the camp.\n\nOn May 20, 1940, the first prisoners arrived at Auschwitz. The transport consisted of some 30 German inmates, categorized as \"professional criminals.\" The SS had selected them from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp outside of Berlin. Less than a month later, on June 14, German authorities in occupied Poland deported 728 Polish prisoners from a prison in Tarnow to Auschwitz. This was the first of many transports of Poles to the Auschwitz camp.\n\nLike most German concentration camps, Auschwitz I was constructed for three purposes:\n\nTo incarcerate real and perceived enemies of the Nazi regime and the German occupation authorities in Poland for an indefinite period of time\n\nTo provide a supply of forced laborers for deployment in SS-owned construction-related enterprises (and, later, armaments and other war-related production)\n\nTo serve as a site to kill small, targeted groups of the population whose death was determined by the SS and police authorities to be essential to the security of Nazi Germany.\n\nLike some concentration camps, Auschwitz I had a gas chamber and crematorium. Initially, SS engineers constructed an improvised gas chamber in the basement of the prison block, Block 11. Later a larger, permanent gas chamber was constructed as part of the original crematorium in a separate building outside the prisoner compound.\n\nAt Auschwitz I, SS physicians carried out medical experiments in the hospital, Barrack (Block) 10. They conducted pseudoscientific research on infants, twins, and dwarfs, and performed forced sterilizations and castrations of adults. The best-known of these physicians was SS Captain Dr. Josef Mengele.\n\nWhen we think of the crimes of Nazi doctors, what comes to mind are their cruel and sometimes fatal experiments\u2026 Yet when we turn to the Nazi doctors\u2019 role in Auschwitz, it was not the experiments that were most significant. Rather, it was his participation in the killing process\u2014indeed his supervision of Auschwitz mass murder from beginning to end.1\n\nBetween the medical-experiments barrack and the prison block (Block 11) stood the \"Black Wall,\" where SS guards executed thousands of prisoners.\n\nAuschwitz II (Auschwitz-Birkenau)\n\nConstruction of Auschwitz II, or Auschwitz-Birkenau, began at Brzezinka in October 1941.\n\nOf the three camps established near Oswiecim, the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp had the largest total prisoner population. It was divided into ten sections separated by electrified barbed-wire fences. Like Auschwitz I, it was patrolled by SS guards, including\u2014after 1942\u2014SS dog handlers.\n\nThe camp included sections for women; men; a family camp for Roma (Gypsies) deported from Germany, Austria, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; and a family camp for Jewish families deported from the Theresienstadt ghetto.\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau was also a killing center and played a central role in the German effort to kill the Jews of Europe. Around the beginning of September, 1941, the SS at Auschwitz I conducted the first tests of Zyklon B as a mass murder agent, using Soviet POWs and debilitated Polish prisoners as victims. The \u201csuccess\u201d of these experiments led to the construction of a chamber in the crematorium of Auschwitz I that, like the subsequent gas chambers at Auschwitz, used Zyklon B to murder victims. The first transports of Jewish men, women, and children sent to Auschwitz as part of the \u201cfinal solution\u201d were murdered in this gas chamber (Crematorium I) in February and March 1942.\n\nDuring the first half of 1942, the Auschwitz SS moved the gassing operations to Auschwitz-Birkenau by converting two farmhouses just outside the camp\u2019s fence into gas chambers. Bunker I began operating in spring 1942, the larger Bunker II in mid-summer 1942.\n\nThese gassing facilities soon proved inadequate for the task of murdering the large numbers of Jewish deportees being sent to Auschwitz. Between March and June 1943, four large crematoria were built within Auschwitz-Birkenau, each with a gas chamber, a disrobing area, and crematory ovens. Gassings ceased at Bunkers I and II when Crematoria II through V began operating, although Bunker II was put back into operation during the deportation of Hungary\u2019s Jews in 1944. Gassing of newly arrived transports ceased at Auschwitz by early November 1944.\n\nJewish deportees arriving at Auschwitz-Birkenau immediately underwent selection. The SS staff chose some of the able-bodied for forced labor and sent the rest directly to the gas chambers, which were disguised as shower installations to mislead the victims. The belongings of all deportees were confiscated and sorted in the \"Kanada\" (Canada) warehouse for shipment back to Germany. Canada symbolized wealth to the prisoners.\n\nDeportations to Auschwitz\n\nTrains arrived at Auschwitz frequently with transports of Jews from virtually every country in Europe occupied by or allied to Germany. These transports arrived from early 1942 to early November 1944. The approximate breakdown of deportations from individual countries:\n\n\n\nHungary: 426,000\n\nPoland: 300,000\n\nFrance: 69,000\n\nNetherlands: 60,000\n\nGreece: 55,000\n\nBohemia and Moravia: 46,000\n\nSlovakia: 27,000\n\nBelgium: 25,000\n\nYugoslavia: 10,000\n\nItaly: 7,500\n\nNorway: 690\n\nOther (including concentration camps): 34,000\n\nWith the deportations from Hungary, the role of Auschwitz-Birkenau in the German plan to murder the Jews of Europe achieved its highest effectiveness. Between late April and early July 1944, approximately 440,000 Jews were deported from Hungary. Of the nearly 426,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz, approximately 320,000 of them were sent directly to the gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau. They deployed approximately 110,000 at forced labor in the Auschwitz camp complex. The SS authorities transferred many of these Hungarian Jewish forced laborers within weeks of their arrival in Auschwitz to other concentration camps in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe Prisoner Revolt at Auschwitz\n\nOn October 7, 1944, several hundred prisoners assigned to Crematorium IV at Auschwitz-Birkenau rebelled after learning that they were going to be killed. During the uprising, the prisoners killed three guards and blew up the crematorium and adjacent gas chamber. The prisoners used explosives smuggled into the camp by Jewish women who had been assigned to forced labor in a nearby armaments factory.\n\nThe Germans crushed the revolt and killed almost all of the prisoners involved in the rebellion. The Jewish women who had smuggled the explosives into the camp were publicly hanged in early January 1945.\n\nThe Auschwitz SS stopped gassing newly arrived prisoners by early November 1944. On orders from Himmler, camp officials began dismantling the crematoria. The SS destroyed the remaining gassing installations as Soviet forces approached in January 1945.\n\nAuschwitz III\n\nAuschwitz III, also called Buna or Monowitz, was established in October 1942. It housed prisoners assigned to work at the Buna synthetic rubber works, located on the outskirts of the small village of Monowice.\n\nIn the spring of 1941, German conglomerate I.G. Farben established a factory in which its executives intended to exploit concentration camp labor to manufacture synthetic rubber and fuels. I.G. Farben invested more than 700 million Reichsmarks (about 2.8 million US dollars in 1941 terms) in Auschwitz III. From May 1941 until July 1942, the SS had transported prisoners from Auschwitz I to the \u201cBuna Detachment,\u201d at first on foot and later by rail. (Between July and October 1942 there was a pause in transports, due to a typhus epidemic and quarantine.) With the construction of Auschwitz III in the autumn of 1942, prisoners deployed at Buna lived in Auschwitz III.\n\nAuschwitz III also had a so-called Labor Education Camp for non-Jewish prisoners who were perceived to have violated German-imposed labor discipline.\n\nAuschwitz Subcamps\n\nBetween 1942 and 1944, the SS authorities at Auschwitz established 44 subcamps. Some of them were established within the officially designated \u201cdevelopment\u201d zone, including Budy, Rajsko, Tschechowitz, Harmense, and Babitz. Others, such as Blechhammer, Gleiwitz, Althammer, F\u00fcrstengrube, Laurahuette, and Eintrachthuette were located in Upper Silesia north and west of the Vistula River. Some subcamps, such as Freudenthal and Bruenn (Brno), were located in Moravia.\n\nIn general, subcamps that produced or processed agricultural goods were administratively subordinate to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Subcamps whose prisoners were deployed at industrial and armaments production or in extractive industries (e.g., coal mining, quarry work) were administratively subordinate to Auschwitz-Monowitz. This division of administrative responsibility was formalized after November 1943.\n\nAuschwitz inmates were employed on huge farms, including the experimental agricultural station at Rajsko. They were also forced to work in coal mines, in stone quarries, in fisheries, and especially in armaments industries such as the SS-owned German Equipment Works (established in 1941). Periodically, prisoners underwent selection. If the SS judged them too weak or sick to continue working, they were transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau and killed.\n\nPrisoners selected for forced labor were registered and tattooed with identification numbers on their left arms in Auschwitz I. They were then assigned to forced labor at the main camp or elsewhere in the complex, including the subcamps.\n\nEvacuation of Auschwitz and its Subcamps\n\nIn mid-January 1945, as Soviet forces approached the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the SS began evacuating Auschwitz and its subcamps.\n\nSS units forced nearly 60,000 prisoners to march west from the Auschwitz camp system. Thousands had been killed in the camps in the days before these death marches began.\n\nTens of thousands of prisoners, mostly Jews, were forced to march either northwest for 55 kilometers (approximately 30 miles) to Gliwice (Gleiwitz) or due west for 63 kilometers (approximately 35 miles) to Wodzislaw (Loslau) in the western part of Upper Silesia. Those forced to march northwest were joined by prisoners from subcamps in East Upper Silesia, such as Bismarckhuette, Althammer, and Hindenburg. Those forced to march due west were joined by inmates from the subcamps to the south of Auschwitz, such as Jawischowitz, Tschechowitz, and Golleschau.\n\nSS guards shot anyone who fell behind or could not continue. Prisoners also suffered from the cold weather, starvation, and exposure on these marches. At least 3,000 prisoners died on route to Gliwice alone. Possibly as many as 15,000 prisoners died during the evacuation marches from Auschwitz and the subcamps.\n\nUpon arrival in Gliwice and Wodzislaw, the prisoners were put on unheated freight trains and transported to concentration camps in Germany, particularly to Flossenb\u00fcrg, Sachsenhausen, Gross-Rosen, Buchenwald, Dachau, and also to Mauthausen in Austria. The rail journey lasted for days. Without food, water, shelter, or blankets, many prisoners did not survive the transport.\n\nIn late January 1945, SS and police officials forced 4,000 prisoners to evacuate Blechhammer on foot. Blechhammer was a subcamp of Auschwitz-Monowitz. The SS murdered about 800 prisoners during the march to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. SS officials also killed as many as 200 prisoners left behind in Blechhammer as a result of illness or unsuccessful attempts to hide. After a brief delay, the SS transported around 3,000 Blechhammer prisoners from Gross-Rosen to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.\n\nThe Liberation of Auschwitz\n\nOn January 27, 1945, the Soviet army entered Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Monowitz and liberated about seven thousand prisoners, most of whom were ill and dying."}, {"url": "https://newspapers.ushmm.org/events/deportation-of-hungarian-jews-begins", "page_content": "Frame Your Search Keywords: Hungary, Hungarian, Jews, deportation, Auschwitz, Poland, Oswiecim See Dates to Check\n\nGerman forces occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944. In April 1944, Hungarian authorities ordered Hungarian Jews living outside Budapest (roughly 500,000) to concentrate in enclosed ghettos located in certain cities, usually regional government seats. Hungarian gendarmes were sent into the rural regions to round up Jews and dispatch them to the cities. None of these ghettos existed for more than a few weeks, and many were liquidated within days.\n\nIn mid-May 1944, the Hungarian authorities, in coordination with the German Security Police, began systematically to deport Hungarian Jews. SS Colonel Adolf Eichmann was chief of the team of \"deportation experts\" that worked with the Hungarian authorities. The Hungarian police carried out the roundups and forced the Jews onto deportation trains.\n\nIn less than two months, nearly 440,000 Jews were deported from Hungary in more than 145 trains. Most were deported to Auschwitz. Thousands were also sent to the border with Austria to dig fortification trenches.\n\n\n\nIn light of the worsening military situation and facing threats from Allied leaders of war crimes trials, the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Miklos Horthy, ordered a halt to the deportations on July 7, 1944. By that time, the only Jewish community left in Hungary was that of Budapest, the capital."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/eichmann-trial", "page_content": "Who was Adolf Eichmann?\n\nAdolf Eichmann was a high-ranking Nazi German official and war criminal. During the Holocaust, he played a central role in the implementation of the \u201cFinal Solution.\u201d\n\nEichmann organized the deportation of more than 1.5 million Jews from all over Europe to ghettos, killing centers, and killing sites in German-occupied Poland and parts of the occupied Soviet Union. He organized these deportations with a cadre of Nazi officials referred to as \u201cEichmann-M\u00e4nner\u201d [Eichmann\u2019s men]. Following the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, he relayed the plans for the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d to his network of officials who helped him carry out deportation efforts.\n\nFor much of the war, Eichmann\u2019s main role was to organize the logistics of the deportation of Jews. Eichmann made deportation plans down to the last detail. Working with other German agencies, he determined how the property of deported Jews would be seized. He also made certain that the offices he directed in the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) would benefit from the confiscated assets. In addition, Eichmann arranged for the deportation of tens of thousands of Roma (Gypsies).\n\nIn Hungary, Eichmann involved himself directly on the ground in the deportation process. From late April until early July 1944, Eichmann and his aides deported approximately 440,000 Hungarian Jews, mostly to Auschwitz.\n\nEscape to Argentina\n\nAfter World War II, Eichmann was arrested by American authorities and held in detention camps for SS members. However, he succeeded in evading suspicion by using fictive identity papers.\n\nWhen he learned that his true identity had been discovered, Eichmann escaped from a work detail. He eventually succeeded in fleeing Europe to Argentina, where he lived under the assumed name Ricardo Klement. He was eventually joined by his family. Eichmann lived quietly and worked in a Mercedes-Benz factory in Buenos Aires.\n\nCapture by the Israelis\n\nTipped off by German justice official Fritz Bauer concerning Eichmann\u2019s whereabouts, Israeli officials initiated a plan for his capture. Because Argentina had a history of denying extradition requests, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made the decision to secretly capture him. On May 20, 1960, officers from the Israeli foreign intelligence service (Mossad) seized Eichmann outside his residence at 14 Garibaldi Street and took him to Israel. Eichmann\u2019s seizure by Mossad became an international incident, with Argentina protesting a violation of its sovereign rights to the United Nations Security Council before the dispute was smoothed over.\n\nThe Trial\n\nEichmann Trial: Photographs The Eichmann Trial was held before a special tribunal of the Jerusalem District Court. It began on April 11, 1961.\n\nCharges\n\nThe legal basis for the charges against Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators\u2019 Punishment Law. This law allowed Israeli courts to punish Nazi perpetrators for crimes against Jews during World War II. Israeli attorney general Gideon Hausner signed a bill of indictment against Eichmann on 15 counts, including crimes against the Jewish people and crimes against humanity.\n\nEichmann was also charged with membership in the Storm Troopers (SA), Security Service (SD), and Gestapo, all of which had been declared criminal organizations in 1946 in the verdict of the Nuremberg Trial. As head of the RSHA\u2019s section for Jewish affairs, Eichmann coordinated with Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller on a plan to expel Jews from Greater Germany to German-occupied Poland, which had set the pattern for future deportations.\n\nDefense\n\nEichmann testified from behind a glass booth in order to protect him from possible assassination. He asserted that he had not dictated policy, but only carried it out\u2014that he was \u201cmerely a little cog in the machinery\u201d of destruction. In his last day of testimony, he admitted that while he was guilty of arranging the transport of millions of Jews to their deaths, he did not feel guilty of the consequences.\n\nVerdict and Sentence\n\nEichmann followed the common plea of Nazi perpetrators that he was only following the orders of others. However, Eichmann\u2019s judges concluded that he had been a key perpetrator in the genocide of European Jewry.\n\nOn December 11\u201312, 1961, Eichmann was convicted of crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and membership in a criminal organization. He was sentenced to death on December 15.\n\nOn June 1, 1962, Eichmann was executed by hanging. His body was cremated and the ashes were spread at sea, beyond Israel's territorial waters. The execution of Adolf Eichmann remains the only time that Israel has enacted a death sentence.\n\nLegacies of the Trial\n\nThe Eichmann Trial aroused international interest in the events of the Holocaust. The proceedings were one of the first trials widely televised, and brought Nazi atrocities to a worldwide audience. Many historians date the Eichmann Trial as the time in which the term \u201cHolocaust\u201d and its events became firmly embedded in public consciousness.\n\nUnlike the International Military Tribunal Trial at Nuremberg and the subsequent Nuremberg proceedings, which relied extensively on written documents, the Eichmann Trial put survivors at center stage. Testimonies of Holocaust survivors, especially those of ghetto fighters such as Zivia Lubetkin, generated interest in Jewish resistance. The trial prompted a new openness in Israel; many Holocaust survivors who had heretofore remained silent about their experiences felt able to share their experiences as the country confronted this traumatic chapter in the lives of many of its citizens."}, {"url": "https://harriman.columbia.edu/event/first-deportation-of-hungarian-jews-wwii-1941/", "page_content": "Location Note\n\n1219 International Affairs Building\n\n420 W 118th St, 12th floor\n\nThis event is in-person for CUID card holders only.

During the first weeks of the campaign against the Soviet Union, the wartime Hungarian government deported more than 20 thousand \u201cforeign\u201d Jews to occupied Soviet territories. Most of them became the victims of the massacre of Kamenetsk-Podolsk in late August. This crime ushered in the period of the Holocaust that Father Patrick Desbois and Paul A. Shapiro have called the \u201cHolocaust by bullets.\u201d The talk returns to and takes up the question of \u201calien Jews\u201d in the period between 1919 and 1941 in East-Central Europe in general and in Hungary in particular, examining how government decrees were used by state authorities in Hungary and in Romania to make it very difficult for Jews to prove their citizenship. The authorities were thus able to \u2018create\u2019 \u2018aliens\u2019 out of unwanted Jews almost without limit. An analysis of these processes exposes the techniques used by nationalist regimes to incite hatred against different groups in society.\n\nTam\u00e1s Stark is senior research fellow at the Institute of History Research Center for the Humanities at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Governor of Hungary, a kingdom without a king between 1919 and October 1944, the last years of his reign saw the 1941 deportation of Hungarian Jews to Kamenets-Podolsk, the 1942 pogrom against Hungarian Jews and Serbs in \u00dajvid\u00e9k (today Novi Sad, Serbia), and the 1944 deportations of close to half a million Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.\n\nYet Horthy still has followers and admirers in Hungary today, largely due to the territorial gains of the small Eastern European nation achieved during Horthy\u2019s governance. His behavior during the 1944 German occupation of Hungary remains a matter of dispute. In this article I seek to present the main questions regarding Horthy\u2019s collaboration and explain why Holocaust scholars see him as one of the most important negative characters in the history of the Hungarian Shoah. Due to the limited space I am not dealing with other controversial aspects of his career (such as the 1919 White Terror and the atrocities of 1941 and 1942 already mentioned).\n\nHorthy\u2019s views regarding the 1944 deportations remain a matter of debate. Some contemporary politicians, such as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky, secretary of the interior during the German occupation, claimed that Horthy was enthusiastic about the removal of rural Hungarian Jewry. Edmund Veesenmayer, the German ambassador offered a similar reading of the events. Others, such as Istv\u00e1nn\u00e9 Kov\u00e1cs, a witness in Baky\u2019s postwar trial and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 M\u00e9rey, \u201cf\u0151isp\u00e1n\u201d (political overseer of Hungarian counties) of Pest country claimed differently. German sources also claim that Horthy needed to be \u201cconvinced\u201d of the \u201cmerits\u201d of the deportations. One might argue that a person who had to be \u201cconvinced\u201d of the \u201cmerits\u201d of such atrocities probably did not support them in the first place.\n\nBut bad personal feelings towards such terrible events hardly relieve politicians of historical guilt. It did not matter much whether Hungarian gendarmes deported Jews with a painful heart or with glee. It also does not matter much whether Horthy felt bad about the deportations or not, seeing how he had barely done anything to stop them.\n\nHorthy\u2019s actions during the German occupation are controversial, but it is safe to say that during most of this period (lasting from 19th March 1944 to the country\u2019s liberation in April) he did not do enough to save Hungarian Jews. In fact, in some cases he openly endorsed deportations, such as the 14th April German request of the deportation of 50.000 Jews for \u201clabor\u201d.\n\nSome might argue that Horthy probably didn\u2019t know what was happening to the deported Jews. We do not, in fact, know beyond dispute when exactly Horthy received news of Auschwitz, how much of this information did he internalize, and how he felt about Jews being deported there. Secondary sources and memoirs date Horthy\u2019s being informed about Auschwitz as early as May 1944. Documents have yet to emerge that could settle the debate for good. But some documents do shed light on the question. According to transcripts of Horthy\u2019s meetings with Adolf Hitler, the Hungarian governor had to know since 1943 that the Germans were killing Jews all over Europe. This is not the same as knowledge about Auschwitz, but hardly could Horthy claim naivet\u00e9 after this.\n\nHorthy\u2019s office also received reports of the deportations and the accompanying atrocities in May 1944. Long before the Hungarian deportations of 1944 were finished, Horthy could have learned of the terrible circumstances of these events. One such report also made it clear that Hungarian Jews were being \u201cannihilated.\u201d Even if Horthy only thought that hundreds of thousands of Hungarian citizens were being deported for \u201cforced labor,\u201d we can already establish his guilt. What sort of politician allows for his citizens to be treated this way? And what sort of politician could claim to be uninformed of the largest genocide happening in contemporary Europe?\n\nTo be fair, Horthy of course was not the only person responsible for these events. Much of the guilt lay with the collaborationist prime minister, D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay, his minister of interior, Andor Jaross, and the two secretaries of the interior, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Endre and the already mentioned L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Baky. All of these men were executed after the war. Assisting them were the \u223c200.000 bureaucrats, policemen and gendarmes of the Hungarian state administration, who followed their superiors\u2019 orders without question.\n\nOne might only wonder how the state administration would have reacted had Horthy ordered them to resist the invaders and the collaborators. We will never know, as Horthy never issued such an order during the deportations of 1944.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn 6th July 1944 Horthy put and end to the deportations, thereby sparing Budapest\u2019s Jewish citizens. This event is often cited by Horthy\u2019s admirers as a heroic act of a misunderstood politician. But certain historical facts must be noted here. Budapest\u2019s Jewish citizens were saved by his action, but there were plans to annihilate Budapest Jews even after Horthy stepped down in October 1944. This is not the place to discuss how many times Budapest Jewry was saved and by whom, but it was not Horthy\u2019s action alone that led to the survival of the capital\u2019s Jewish population.\n\nAnd Horthy\u2019s record regarding the remaining Hungarian Jews is not flawless either. According to a document dated 23d August 1944, Horthy was ready to allow the deportation of Hungarian Jewish men then performing unarmed labor service (meaning around 60.000 men). It must be noted that this happened after the 6th July halting of the deportation trains. Horthy was apparently ready to let the Germans murder more Hungarian Jews, even if this final atrocity did not come to being.\n\nHorthy\u2019s behavior during the German occupation is therefore controversial, but careful historical study allows historians to draw sound conclusions. Horthy\u2019s role in the Hungarian Holocaust is clearly a very negative one. He did not do enough to save Jews, but occasionally even agreed to the deportations. Even his act of halting Budapest deportations is overshadowed by his readiness to let tens of thousands of Jewish men be deported \u2013 even if it did not happen so in the end. Any praise for Horthy\u2019s 1944 actions can only be a sign of poor historical knowledge."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deportations-to-killing-centers", "page_content": "In 1941, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the \"Final Solution,\" the systematic mass murder of European Jewry. The Nazi regime sought to forcibly reorder the ethnic composition of eastern Europe within the framework of Nazi racial policy. One method the regime used to do so was rail transport. The German authorities used rail systems across the continent to transport, or deport, Jews from their homes, primarily to German-occupied eastern Europe. Once they had begun to methodically kill Jews in specially constructed killing centers, German officials deported Jews to these facilities by train. When trains were not available or the distances were short, deportees were sent to killing centers by truck or on foot.\n\nOfficials Coordinate Mass Transport by Train\n\nOn January 20, 1942, SS, Nazi Party, and German state officials gathered at the Wannsee Conference, held in a southwestern suburb of Berlin. There, they coordinated the deportation of European Jews to killing centers (also known as \u201cextermination camps\u201d) in German-occupied Poland. At the time, killing centers were already in operation or under construction. The participants of the conference estimated that the \"Final Solution\" would involve the deportation and murder of 11 million Jews. Their estimate included Jewish residents of nations outside German control, such as Ireland, Sweden, Turkey, and Great Britain.\n\nDeportations on this scale required the coordination of numerous German government agencies. Among them were the Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt\u2014RSHA), the Main Office of the Order Police, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Foreign Office. The RSHA or regional SS and police leaders coordinated and often directed the deportations. The Order Police rounded up and transported the Jews to the killing centers. Local auxiliaries or collaborators in occupied territories aided in these efforts. The Ministry of Transportation coordinated train schedules, working with Department IV B 4 of the RSHA, commanded by SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann. The Foreign Office negotiated with Germany's Axis partners over the transfer of their Jewish citizens to German custody.\n\nThe Germans attempted to disguise their intentions. They sought to portray the deportations as a \"resettlement\" of the Jewish population in labor camps in the \"East.\" In reality, the \"resettlement in the East\" became a euphemism for transport to the killing centers and mass murder.\n\nInside the Railcars\n\nGerman railroad officials used both freight and passenger cars for the deportations. In order to convince the German population that the deportees were bound for resettlement, most Jews from the German Reich itself were dispatched to the east by passenger train. Jews in the German-occupied east fared far worse. German authorities generally did not give the deportees food or water, even when the journey was long or the hapless victims had to wait for days on railroad spurs for other trains to pass. Deportees were packed in sealed freight cars and suffered from overcrowding. They endured intense heat during the summer and freezing temperatures during the winter. Aside from a bucket, there was no sanitary facility. The stench of urine and excrement added to the deportees\u2019 humiliation and suffering. Lacking food and water and proper ventilation, many deportees died before the trains reached their destinations. Armed police or military guards accompanied the transports; they had orders to shoot anyone who tried to escape.\n\nThe Victims\n\nBetween December 1941 and July 1942, the SS and police officials established five killing centers in German-occupied Poland. These were Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka II (Treblinka I was a forced-labor camp for Jews), and Auschwitz-Birkenau, also known as Auschwitz II. SS and police authorities in the Lublin District of the General Government (that part of German-occupied Poland not directly annexed to Germany) managed and coordinated the deportations to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka within the framework of \u201cOperation Reinhard.\u201d The Germans killed nearly 2.7 million Jews in the five killing centers.\n\nBelzec\n\nThe principal victims at Belzec were Jews from southern and southeastern Poland. Also among the victims were Jews deported from the so-called Greater German Reich to the Lublin District between October 1941 and the end of summer 1942. The Greater German Reich included Germany, Austria, the Sudetenland, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nSobibor\n\nMost Jews deported to Sobibor came from the Lublin District. German authorities also transported French and Dutch Jews to Sobibor in spring and summer 1943. In late summer 1943, they deported small groups of Soviet Jews from Belarusian [Belorussian] and Lithuanian ghettos.\n\nTreblinka II\n\nGerman officials transported the Jews from the Warsaw and Radom districts of the General Government to Treblinka II, where SS and police officials murdered them. Jews from the Bialystok administrative district were also deported there.\n\nChelmo\n\nGerman authorities deported most of the Jewish residents of the Lodz ghetto to Chelmno between January 1942 and spring 1943, and then in early summer 1944. The ghetto's surviving Roma and Sinti (so-called \"Gypsy\") residents were also deported there during that time.\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau\n\nIn 1943 and 1944, the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center played a significant role in the German plan to kill the European Jews. Beginning in late winter 1943, trains arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau on a regular basis. These trains carried Jews from virtually every German-occupied country of Europe\u2014from as far north as Norway to the Greek island of Rhodes off the coast of Turkey in the south, from the French slopes of the Pyrenees in the west to the easternmost reaches of German-occupied Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nWestern and Northern Europe\n\nGerman officials and local collaborators deported Jews from western Europe via transit camps. Among these transit camps were Drancy in France, Westerbork in the Netherlands, and Mechelen (Malines) in Belgium. Approximately 75,000 Jews were deported from France. More than 65,000 of them were transported from Drancy to Auschwitz-Birkenau; approximately 2,000 were sent to Sobibor. The Germans deported more than 100,000 Jews from the Netherlands. Almost all of these individuals were deported from Westerbork: about 60,000 to Auschwitz and more than 34,000 to Sobibor. Between August 1942 and July 1944, 28 trains transported more than 25,000 Jews from Belgium to Auschwitz-Birkenau via Mechelen.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, the Germans seized approximately 770 Norwegian Jews and deported them by boat and train to Auschwitz. In September 1943, there was an effort to deport the Danish Jews. However, it failed. Alerted to the impending roundup, the resistance in Denmark assisted the mass escape of Danish Jews to neutral Sweden. Of the approximately 7,500 Jews living in Denmark, only 470 were deported to Theresienstadt.\n\nSouthern Europe\n\nThe Germans deported Jews from Greece, from Italy, and from Croatia. Between March and August 1943, SS and police officials deported more than 40,000 Jews from Salonika, in northern Greece, to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Camp staff killed most of them in the gas chambers upon arrival. After the Germans occupied northern Italy in September 1943, they deported about 8,000 Jews. Most were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Based on an agreement with their Croatian Axis partner, German officials took custody of around 7,000 Croat Jews and deported them to Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nBulgarian gendarmes and military units rounded up and deported around 7,000 Jewish residents of Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia, formerly a part of Yugoslavia, via a transit camp at Skopje. Bulgarian authorities concentrated approximately 4,000 Jews residing in Bulgarian-occupied Thrace at two assembly points in Bulgaria. From there, they transferred the Jews to German custody. In all, Bulgaria deported more than 11,000 Jews to German-controlled territory. The German authorities deported these Jews to Treblinka II and killed them in the gas chambers.\n\nCentral Europe\n\nGerman authorities began to deport Jews from the Greater German Reich in October 1941. At that time, the construction of the killing centers was still in the planning stage. Between October 15, 1941, and November 4, 1941, German authorities deported 20,000 Jews to the Lodz ghetto. Between November 8, 1941, and October 1942, German authorities deported approximately 49,000 Jews from the Greater German Reich to Riga, Minsk, Kovno, and Raasiku, all in the Reich Commissariat Ostland. The Reich Commissariat Ostland included German-occupied Belarus [Belorussia], Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. SS and police officials shot the overwhelming majority of the deportees upon arrival there.\n\nBetween March and October 1942, German authorities deported another approximately 63,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews to the Warsaw ghetto and to various locations in Lublin District. These locations included the transit camp-ghettos at Krasnystaw and Izbica and the killing center in Sobibor. German Jewish residents of the Lodz and Warsaw ghettos were later deported with Polish Jews to Chelmno, Treblinka II, and, in 1944, to Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nThe first transport of Jews from the Greater German Reich directly to Auschwitz arrived on July 18, 1942, from Vienna. From late October 1942 until January 1945, German authorities deported more than 71,000 Jews remaining in the Greater German Reich to Auschwitz-Birkenau. They deported elderly or prominent Jews from Germany, Austria, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and western Europe to the Theresienstadt ghetto. This ghetto also served as a transit camp for deportations further east, most often to Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nBetween May and July 1944, Hungarian gendarmes, in cooperation with German security police officials, deported nearly 440,000 Jews from Hungary. Most of them were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. With the cooperation of Slovak authorities, the Germans deported more than 50,000 Slovak Jews to the concentration camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek. The Slovak Jews were the first to be selected for the gas chambers at Birkenau. In the autumn of 1944, German SS and police officials deported 10,000 Slovak Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Slovak uprising. This deportation was the last major one to a killing center.\n\nBetween March 1942 and November 1943, the SS and police deported approximately 1,526,000 Jews, most of them by train, to Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, the killing centers of Operation Reinhard. Between December 1941 and March 1943, and again in June-July 1944, SS and police officials deported at least 167,000 Jews and approximately 4,300 Roma to the killing center at Chelmno. Victims were transported there by train, by truck, and on foot. Between March 1942 and December 1944, the German authorities deported approximately 1.1 million Jews and 23,000 Roma and Sinti to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The overwhelming majority were deported by rail.\n\nFewer than 500 survived the Operation Reinhard killing centers. Only a handful of Jews survived the transports to Chelmno. Perhaps as many as 100,000 Jews survived deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau, having been selected for forced labor upon arrival."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/adolf-eichmann", "page_content": "Eichmann (1906\u20131962) was born in Solingen, Germany, on March 19, 1906. As a youth, he moved with his family to Linz, Austria. A poor student, he completed his basic schooling and began training in mechanical engineering. He did not finish his studies. In the uncertain economic times of the 1920s, he drifted from job to job as a day laborer, an office worker, and as a traveling salesman for Vacuum Oil Company, AG. In 1932, at the instigation of an acquaintance, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who would later serve as his superior in the Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, or RSHA), Eichmann entered the Austrian National Socialist (Nazi) Party, and the SS.\n\nIn 1933, as Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists (Nazis) came to power in Germany, the Austrian government banned membership in the Austrian Nazi Party. Like many Austrian Nazis, Adolf Eichmann fled Austria for Bavaria. There in August 1933, Eichmann joined the \"Austrian Legion,\" an association organized for Nazi Party members from Austria. There, he engaged in a few months' military training. In 1934, with the rank of SS-Scharf\u00fchrer (Sergeant) Eichmann joined the Security Service Main Office (Sicherheitsdienst (SD)-Hauptamt). He still worked for this organization when it became part of the RSHA in 1939. In the mid-1930s, Eichmann worked for SD office II-112, which had among its objectives the surveillance of Jewish organizations. Assigned to a section dealing with Zionist activities, Eichmann negotiated with Zionist functionaries and made an inspection tour of Palestine in 1937. His efforts to promote a \"Zionist emigration of Jews from Germany by all [available] means\" would serve him well in preparing him for his future activities.\n\nDuring the Anschluss in March 1938, Eichmann personally led a raid on the Jewish Cultural Community offices. He then worked to organize a Central Office for Jewish Emigration (Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung) in Vienna, which opened officially on August 20, 1938. According to internal estimates, the Central Office \"facilitated\" the emigration of 110,000 Austrian Jews between August 1938 and June 1939. The Central Office was so successful in its forced emigration efforts that it created a template\u2014often called the \"Vienna Model\"\u2014or a Reich-wide Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration (Reichzentrale f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung).\n\nEichmann led the Central Office beginning in October 1939. Here he met with less \"success,\" particularly as deportation of Jews began to replace emigration as a strategy for a \"Jew-free\" Germany. In this area, Eichmann was ultimately to play a pivotal role. In the summer of 1939, Eichmann became responsible for promoting the expulsion of Czech Jews from the newly annexed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and created a further Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Prague, after the pattern of its Viennese counterpart.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War II, Eichmann organized the first actual attempt at mass deportation from the Greater German Reich. He coordinated the deportation of some 3,500 Jews from Moravia and Vienna to Nisko on the San River, in that part of German-occupied Poland to be designated as the General Government (Generalgouvernement). Although problems with the deportation effort and a change in German policy put an end to these deportations, Eichmann's superiors were sufficiently satisfied with his initiative to ensure that he would play a role in future deportation proceedings.\n\nAfter the foundation of the RSHA in September 1939, Eichmann moved from the SD to the Gestapo and became director of RSHA section (Referat) IV D 4 (Clearing Activities, or R\u00e4umungsangelegenheiten) (1940). After March 1941, he became director of section IV B 4 (Jewish Affairs, or Judenreferat).\n\nIn October 1940, Eichmann and the office IV D 4 organized the deportation of nearly 7,000 Jews from Baden and Saarpfalz to areas of unoccupied France. From his position in RSHA section IV B 4, however, Eichmann played his central role in the deportation of over 1.5 million Jews from all over Europe to killing centers and killing sites in occupied Poland and in parts of the occupied Soviet Union.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, Eichmann, then an SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer (Lieutenant Colonel) and the chief of RSHA section IV B 4, took part in discussions in which the annihilation of the European Jews was planned. Since Eichmann was to be in charge of transporting Jews from all over Europe to the killing centers, RSHA chief Reinhard Heydrich asked Eichmann to prepare a presentation for the Wannsee Conference. At the conference, RSHA officials advised the appropriate government and Nazi Party agencies on the implementation of the \"Final Solution.\" Eichmann also relayed these plans to his network of officials who would help him to carry out deportation efforts in German-occupied areas and in Germany's Axis partners.\n\nProminent among these \"Eichmann-M\u00e4nner\" (\"Eichmann's men\") were his deputy Rolf G\u00fcnther, Alois Brunner, Theodor Dannecker, and Dieter Wisliceny. In 1942, Eichmann and his henchmen organized the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, the Netherlands, France, and Belgium. In 1943 and 1944 came the turn of the Jews of Greece, northern Italy, and Hungary. Only in Hungary did Eichmann involve himself directly on the ground in the deportation process. From late April 1944, six weeks after Germany occupied Hungary, until early July, Eichmann and his aides deported some 440,000 Hungarian Jews.\n\nAt war's end, Eichmann found himself in US custody, but escaped in 1946. In the end, he succeeded, with the help of Catholic Church officials, in fleeing to Argentina. There he lived under a number of aliases, most famously Ricardo Klement. In 1960, agents of the Israeli Security Service (Mossad) abducted Eichmann and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The proceedings before a special district court in Jerusalem drew international attention, and historians roundly credit coverage of the trial (famously in Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem) with awakening public interest in the Holocaust.\n\nIn December 1961, Eichmann was found guilty of crimes against the Jewish people. He was hanged at midnight between May 31 and June 1, 1962. Jewish authorities cremated his remains and scattered his ashes in the sea beyond Israeli boundary waters."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deportations", "page_content": "Deportations In the months following the Wannsee Conference, the Nazi regime continued to carry out their plans for the \"Final Solution.\" Jews were \"deported\"\u2014transported by trains or trucks to six camps, all located in occupied Poland: Chelmno, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Majdanek-Lublin.\n\nThe Nazis called these six camps \"extermination camps.\" Most of the deportees were immediately murdered in large groups by poisonous gas. The Germans continued to murder Jews in mass shootings as well, especially in territory they seized from the Soviet Union. The killing centers were in semi-rural, isolated areas, fairly well hidden from public view. They were located near major railroad lines, allowing trains to transport hundreds of thousands of people to the killing sites.\n\nMany of the victims were deported from nearby ghettos, some as early as December 1941, even before the Wannsee meeting. The SS began in earnest to empty the ghettos, however, in the summer of 1942. In two years' time, more than two million Jews were taken out of the ghettos. By the summer of 1944, few ghettos remained in eastern Europe.\n\nAt the same time that ghettos were being emptied, masses of Jews and also Roma (Gypsies) were transported from the many distant countries occupied or controlled by Germany, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Hungary, Romania, Italy, North Africa, and Greece. The deportations required the help of many people and all branches of the German government. The victims in Poland were already imprisoned in ghettos and totally under German control. The deportation of Jews from other parts of Europe, however, was a far more complex problem. The German Foreign Ministry succeeded in pressuring most governments of occupied and allied nations to assist the Germans in the deportation of Jews living in their countries.\n\nKey Dates\n\nJuly 15, 1942\n\nSystematic deportations from the Netherlands begin\n\nJews in the Netherlands have been systematically concentrated in the Westerbork transit camp. The majority of Jews sent to Westerbork remain there only a short time before their deportation to killing centers in the east. Beginning on July 15, 1942, the Germans deport nearly 100,000 Jews from Westerbork: about 60,000 to Auschwitz, over 34,000 to Sobibor, almost 5,000 to the Theresienstadt ghetto, and nearly 4,000 to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The overwhelming majority of those deported are killed upon arrival in the camps.\n\nJuly 22, 1942\n\nWarsaw Jews deported to Treblinka killing center\n\nBetween July 22 and mid-September 1942, over 300,000 people are deported from the Warsaw ghetto: more than 250,000 of them are deported to the Treblinka killing center. Deportees are forced to the Umschlagplatz (deportation point), which is connected to the Warsaw-Malkinia rail line. They are crowded into freight cars and most are deported, via Malkinia, to Treblinka. The overwhelming majority of the deportees are killed upon arrival in Treblinka. In September, at the end of the 1942 mass deportation, only about 55,000 Jews remain in the ghetto.\n\nMay 15, 1944\n\nSystematic deportations of Jews from Hungary begin\n\nGerman forces occupy Hungary on March 19, 1944. In April 1944, all Jews except those in Budapest are ordered into ghettos. Systematic deportations from the ghettos in Hungary to Auschwitz-Birkenau begin the next month, in May 1944. In less than three months, nearly 440,000 Jews are deported from Hungary in more than 145 trains. The overwhelming majority are killed upon arrival in Auschwitz."}, {"url": "https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/180847", "page_content": "8/1/2021\n\ntags: Holocaust\n\nKarl Pfeifer is an Austrian born journalist of Hungarian Jewish origin and a member of the board of the Archives of the Austrian Resistance.\n\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ferenczy of the Hungarian Royal Gendarmerie was a key figure in the expulsion of Jews from Hungary prior to and after the 1944 Nazi occupation of the country.\n\nThe official narrative that Hungary was a safe country of asylum for Jews until the German occupation on March 19, 1944 is simply false. As early as the summer of 1941, the Hungarian state deported Jewish inhabitants without any pressure from the German side.\n\nAnti-Semitism and revisionism were cornerstones of the Horthy regime from 1919 onwards. Hungary was the first country in which a government again enacted an anti-Jewish law after the First World War, the so-called Numerus Clausus law of 1920, which restricted Jewish students' access to universities.\n\nKARPATO-UKRAINE\n\nThe first decree for the deportation of Jews was issued on July 12, 1941 by the Foreigners Police KEOKH on the instructions of Interior Minister Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer. In July and August 1941, a total of about 18,000 people, mainly from Carpatho-Ukraine, were deported via the K\u00f6r\u00f6smez\u00f6 concentration camp to Kolomea and from there to Kamenec-Podolsk, about 50 kilometres northeast of Czernowitz.\n\nTwo thirds of those deported by the Hungarian state were Hungarian citizens. From the report of the German Einsatzgruppe C, a mobile killing squad, we know that on August 27 and 28, 1941, 23,600 Jews were shot in this area by men of the 320th Police Battalion. Some of those murdered were members of the local Jewish community, about 15,000 were deportees from Hungary, and the rest probably escaped or were sent back to Hungary by the local authorities.\n\nAs early as July 17, 1941 Herbert Pell, the US ambassador in Budapest, reported on this cruel action, which was carried out with \"alarming speed.\" He also informed the Joint\u2014the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\u2014about it, but adhered to Washington's instructions and only intervened on behalf of two US citizens.\n\nFATE\n\nThe fate of the surviving deportees would be \"starvation or massacre,\" Pell wrote, citing reports from Joint representatives Jacobson and Blum, who were unaware that they had received and passed on news of one of the first Holocaust massacres.\n\nThe authorities tried to keep this action secret and the newspapers did not publish anything about it. But since Jews from Budapest were also brought to K\u00f6r\u00f6smez\u00f6 from the West Railway Station in sealed wagons, the deportations were common knowledge.\n\nOn November 21, 1941, Arrow Cross MP M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Matolcsy asked Hungarian Foreign Minister L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e1rdossy in parliament: \"I cannot understand what would be wrong if the government really rounded up the Jews and expelled them?\"\n\nIn his answer, B\u00e1rdossy revealed, \"after the occupation of the Ukrainian territories, we deported a very significant number of Jews. We wanted to deport even more, but the friendly German Reich warned us not to do so. We were forced to bow to this wish.\"\n\nREMEMBRANCE POLICY\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Orb\u00e1n government founded the historical institute \"Veritas\" to \"present the Hungarian public law tradition in a dignified way,\" as its mission was officially proclaimed. The real goal, however, was to serve the state's politics of memory. The military historian S\u00e1ndor Szak\u00e1ly, whose revisionist views have provoked fierce opposition from serious historians for almost 20 years, was appointed head of the institute.\n\nIn an interview with the Hungarian news agency MTI in 2014, Szak\u00e1ly said Jews in Hungary suffered \"significant losses\" only after the German occupation of the country on March 19, 1944. He called the first deportation from Hungary in the summer of 1941 to Kamenec-Podolsk an \"alien police procedure\" and claimed, \"when it turned out that many of them had been murdered, Interior Minister Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer allowed them to return to Hungary.\"\n\nOfficially, Hungary does not commemorate the victims of the deportations on the anniversary.\n\nThis history-twisting trivialization of a massacre led Jewish organizations to demand Szak\u00e1ly's dismissal to no avail; he still runs Veritas today.\n\nPeople were deported who could not prove their Hungarian citizenship because the anti-Semitic administration made this difficult.\n\nBut there were also cases where the citizenship certificates were simply torn up by gendarmes. \"Veritas\" historians deny that a Hungarian gendarme could have done such a thing, because an important part of the historical distortion committed by this institute is the exoneration of the Hungarian gendarmerie, which in the early summer of 1944 herded Jews with extreme brutality - often with lashes - into cattle cars whose destination was Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nCORESPONSIBILITY\n\n\n\nVeritas attempts to polish the political culture of the Horthy regime. And because this is closely related to the practice of state anti-Semitism, it is also concerned with its ideological and moral rehabilitation. This self-congratulatory view of history is part of the \"National Cooperation\" (NER) under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. It strives to weaken the Hungarian state's co-responsibility for the Holocaust.\n\nFor this reason, those in power since 2010 wrote into the preamble of the Basic Law adopted in 2011 that Hungary lost the \"state self-determination of our homeland\" on the day of the German occupation of the country, March 19, 1944. It was only restored after the fall of communism on May 2, 1990.\n\nBut thanks to the serious research tolerated so far, we know that without the active involvement of the Hungarian government under Reichsverweser Mikl\u00f3s Horthy and his administration, the deportation of almost half a million people to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944 would have been impossible within a few weeks.\n\nOfficial Hungary does not commemorate the victims of the deportations on the 80th anniversary. But the Budapest Rabbinical Seminary and the Methodist John Wesley High School will jointly hold an academic conference in October - just as they did ten years ago - in memory of the mass murder.\n\nThis essay was published in German in Allgemeine J\u00fcdische Wochenzeitung (28/21, July 15, 2021)."}, {"url": "http://lekcja.auschwitz.org/en_6_dep_zydow/sco_9.html", "page_content": "During the occupation I worked in the so-called Ostbahn.

These trains arrived at Tarn\u00f3w from the border in Muszyna. \u2026 Every one of them had 50\u201260 cars. People were crammed into these cars and part of their luggage was transported in separate cars. Such transports travelled under armed guard. The transport commander was an SS functionary, most often a Ukrainian, who would not allow anyone approach the train. \u2026 When checking the brake pads, I had to pass the cars.

At the marshalling yard the train was taken over by a shunting team, who rolled the train to the railway ramp in Birkenau. Such a train was rolled to the ramp through the gate, and the shunting (locomotive switching) team got off the train at the gate. The locomotive also remained outside the gate, with the cars remaining in the camp, where they were taken over by a shunting team of inmates. Before they were returned from the railway ramp messages, names and initials were removed from the freight car walls. This writing was wiped off, scratched off or painted over with oil paint. But some of the more concealed inscriptions remained.\n\n\n\nVarious freight cars were used to transport Hungarian Jews. French and Dutch cars were the most common since they had grated windows that were easy to close.

After the Sonderkommando was quartered in the undressing room in crematorium IV, the people sent to die there undressed in a specially constructed barracks.\n\nThe SS men kept the people fated to die unaware of what awaited them. They were told that they were being sent to the camp, but that they first had to undergo disinfection and bathe. After the victims undressed, they were taken into the gas chamber, locked in, and killed with Zyklon B gas.\n\nAfter they were killed, Sonderkommando prisoners dragged the corpses out of the gas chambers. They cut off the women\u2019s hair and removed all metal dental work and jewelry. Then they burned the corpses in pits, on pyres, or in the crematorium furnaces. (Until September 1942, some of the corpses were buried in mass graves; these corpses were burned from September to November 1942.)\n\nBones that did not burn completely were ground to powder with pestles and then dumped, along with the ashes, in the rivers So\u0142a and Vistula and in nearby ponds, or strewn in the fields as fertilizer, or used as landfill on uneven ground and in marshes."}, {"url": "https://www.auschwitz.org/en/history/camp-hospitals/selection-executions-and-experiments/", "page_content": "The site and on the sides of the subsidiaries are used cookies.

If you're learning about what happened to the six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazi's during WW2, you'll have heard of the concentration camps where the killings took place. This next clip gives some detail about what actually happened in the gas chambers and the experience of some of the Jewish survivors. It also includes an account of the Commander of the camp at Auschwitz, a man called Rudolph Hoss, who oversaw the murders.\n\nNARRATOR: In this field stood a Polish cottage which would be come to be known as the little red house, or Bunker one. Hoss and his SS comrades saw this as a step forward in the killing process at Auschwitz. Two separate gas chambers were quickly improvised by bricking up the windows and door and creating two new entrances.\n\nNARRATOR: Unlike in the crematorium in the main camp, people could be murdered here in relative secrecy. In this shabby cottage tens of thousands of people would be murdered. The manner of killing remained the same. Jews would to be told they were to take a shower. They would be locked in the room, and Zyklon B thrown in through a hatch in the wall. Within weeks, the Nazi's had converted another nearby cottage, the little white house, in just the same way. Slovakian Jews arrived at the railway stop, two miles from the gas chambers, on the 29th of April, 1942, and faced selection by the SS. This was the first of hundreds of SS selections to be held over the next 30 months.\n\nEVA VOTAVOVA: When they opened the train carriages and forced us out they shouted at us immediately. They were screaming in German. They were SS men who were dealing with us. We had to stand in line. Men had to step up first. Then women with children, and then old people. I looked at my father here and I saw a sad look on his face.\n\nEVA VOTAVOVA: This is my last memory of him.\n\nNARRATOR: The Slovakian Jews selected to die were taken up past the newly built buildings of Birkenau and towards the isolated gas chambers of the little red house and the little white house.\n\nOTTO PRESSBURGER: When we were returning from work we saw people being bought over. They waited there the whole day. They sat there, they still had food from home. And SS men were around them with dogs. They didn't know what was going to happen to them.\n\nNARRATOR: After the war, while he awaited trial, Rudolf Hoss wrote about the process of murder in the converted cottages in the spring of 1942.\n\nRUDOLPH HOSS: \"It was most important that the whole business of arriving and undressing should take place in an atmosphere of the greatest possible calm. Small children usually cried because of the strangeness of being undressed in this way. But when their mothers or members of the Jewish Sonderkommando comforted them, they became calm and entered the gas chambers playing, or joking with one another and carrying their toys. Hundreds of men and women in the full bloom of life walked all unsuspecting to their death in the gas chambers under the blossom-laden fruit trees of the orchard. This picture of death in the midst of life remains with me to this day. I looked upon them as enemies of our people. The reasons behind the extermination program, seemed to me, right.\"\n\nNARRATOR: After the gassing, Hoss and the SS made other Jewish prisoners load the bodies onto trucks and wheel them down a make-shift railway line towards giant pits. Otto Pressburger was one of the prisoners forced to dispose of the bodies.\n\nOTTO PRESSBURGER: We were digging holes and, in the beginning, we really didn't know what they were for. It was only when the holes were deep enough that we started to throw the bodies into them. It was appalling. New bodies were lying here every morning. And we had to bury them. When summer came, everything started to rot.\n\nOTTO PRESSBURGER: It was terrible. The majority of the people working here were from my home city of Trnava. I knew all of them. And every day there were less and less of them. They must still be buried around here somewhere. My brother and my father are buried here as well, you know.\n\nDAN SNOW: After being captured, and while awaiting trial, Hoss wrote an autobiography, which revealed terrible and sometimes horribly precise details of how so many people had been killed at Auschwitz. And it was at Auschwitz that he would die, executed there, after being found guilty of murder, two years after the war's end, in 1947."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/way-gas-ladies-and-gentlemen", "page_content": "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\n\nTadeusz Borowski 1946\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nPlot Summary\n\nCharacters\n\nThemes\n\nStyle\n\nHistorical Context\n\nCritical Overview\n\nCriticism\n\nSources\n\nFurther Reading\n\nIn his introduction to the English translation of This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentleman, Jan Kott writes of Tadeusz Borowski\u2019s decision to render his Auschwitz stories in the first person: \u201cThe identification of the author with the narrator was the moral decision of a prisoner who had lived through Auschwitz\u2014an acceptance of mutual responsibility, mutual participation, and mutual guilt for the concentration camp.\u201d Indeed, in a review for another author\u2019s book about the concentration camps, Borowski stated, \u201cIt is impossible to write about Auschwitz impersonally.\u201d He defined as the \u201cfirst duty of Auschwitzers . . . to make clear just what camp is.\u201d It is where survival depended on a prisoner\u2019s taking part in the murder and degradation of their fellow victims. \u201cBut write that you, you were the ones who did this,\u201d Borowski intoned. \u201cThat a portion of the sad fame of Auschwitz belongs to you as well.\u201d\n\nIn the collection\u2019s title story, Borowski squarely fulfills his obligation. Seen through the eyes of a Polish gentile prisoner, as Borowski himself was, \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentleman\u201d describes a typical day at Auschwitz. The narrator joins in the task of unloading thousands of Jews from the cattle cars and sending them to their death in the gas chamber, all to acquire food and maybe a pair of shoes. Subject matter aside, Borowski\u2019s story is chilling and unforgettable in the success with which the narrator distances himself from his actions. As readers grow to understand that the narrator is forced to this extreme in order to continue to perform the work that guarantees his own existence, they become implicated themselves\u2014 they become part of the community of the concentration camp.\n\nBorowski was born in 1922 to a poor Polish family in what was then part of the Soviet Ukraine. In 1926, Borowski\u2019s father, accused of political dissidence, was sent to a labor camp, and when Borowski was eight years old, his mother was sent to Siberia. An aunt then took over the boy\u2019s care. In 1932, Borowski\u2019s father was freed in a prisoner exchange program between Poland and the Soviet Union, and the two were reunited. Two years later, Borowski\u2019s mother rejoined the family in Warsaw.\n\nThe young Borowski was educated at a Franciscan boarding school. Borowski was 17 when Poland fell under German occupation at the start of World War II. Schools were closed down, so Borowski studied in underground classes and managed to graduate from secondary school. He then attended the underground Warsaw University, majoring in Polish language and literature. Already a budding writer, Borowski also worked as a stockboy and a night watchman.\n\nIn 1942, Borowski printed and distributed his first book of poetry, Gdziekolwiek ziemia (translated as Wherever the Earth). Borowski anonymously published this collection of metaphoric verse that centered on the death of civilized man in the German labor camps and then distributed it secretly. However, the Gestapo discovered his actions, and within weeks of the volume\u2019s release, Borowski and his fiancee, Maria, were arrested. He was sent to several prison camps before arriving at Auschwitz. To ensure his survival, Borowski got a job as an orderly in the camp hospital. As the Allied liberation forces drew close to Auschwitz, Borowski and other prisoners were moved to Dachau. The U.S. Army liberated the camp in May 1945.\n\nBorowski was then transferred to a camp for displaced persons. He left the camp in September to search for his fiancee, whom he had last seen at Birkenau, the women\u2019s barracks near Auschwitz. He learned that she was living in Sweden, but he was unable to cross international borders to reach her. Borowski spent a short time in Munich and Paris before returning to Communist Poland in May 1946. His fiancee joined him in November, and they were married the following year.\n\nFollowing his release, Borowski continued to write stories, including \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d which he produced at the displaced persons camp. Some of these stories as well as his poetry had been published in Poland before his return. Along with two other Polish Gentile writers, Borowski compiled We Were in Auschwitz, stories of life in the concentration camp. The Polish readership, though shocked at the amoral world Borowski depicted, recognized his talent. Pozegnanie z Maria (Farewell to Maria) and Kamienny swiat (World of Stone) were both published toward the end of the 1940s. These volumes contained Borowski\u2019s Auschwitz stories, as well as stories about the displaced person camps in Germany and his return home.\n\nBorowski was wooed by and joined the Communist party in 1948. He turned to writing political propaganda\u2014pro-communist journalistic pieces for Warsaw newspapers. These writings had little literary merit; however, he received a government prize for them. In the summer of 1949, he was sent to Berlin for a year to work in the press section at the Polish Military Mission. He was also given a secret intelligence assignment by the secret police. Less than fifteen months after his return to Poland, in July 1951, Borowski committed suicide.\n\nHis five-volume Utwory zebrane (Collected Works) was published in Warsaw in 1954. Translations of his works have been published in other countries as well.\n\nIn the barracks of Auschwitz, the unnamed narrator eats his breakfast with Henri, his friend and fellow prisoner. Henri is a member of the so-called Canada squad, members of the Kommando labor gang whose job is to unload the Jewish prisoners from the cattle cars and send them either to the work camp or to the gas chambers. In the midst of their meal, a messenger comes with the news that a transport is arriving. It is the first transport that the camp has seen in several days, and Henri invites the narrator to come work on the ramp. This is how prisoners get food and items of clothing. In the past, the narrator had to depend on Henri for these items, and he accepts the offer.\n\nThe narrator and the other workers go to the railroad station. They are joined by SS officers and guards, all of whom wait for the first train to arrive. As the train rounds the bend, the workers all jump to their feet. The train stops on the tracks, alongside the ramp. Anguished cries for water and air can be heard coming from inside. Heads push out through the windows, and bodies pound against the inside of the train. To silence the prisoners, a soldier shoots a volley of rounds into the side of the cattle car. The SS officer warns the workers not to take anything from the Jews beside food.\n\nThen the train doors open. People rush forth from inside. They are ordered to make a pile of their possessions\u2014luggage, blankets, coats, food, money. Some people ask the workers what will happen to them, but the workers, following \u201ccamp law,\u201d refuse to answer. The Jews are made to go either to the left or the right. Those on the left side board the waiting trucks that will take them to the gas chamber. Those on the right will go to Auschwitz to work. The men carry out the selection quickly, shoving prisoners into the trucks. One SS officer keeps track of how many people have gone to the gas chambers with hash marks.\n\nAfter the train has been emptied, the prisoner-workers must clean it up. Inside, the narrator finds babies among the filth and squalor. The narrator gives them to an old woman to take to the gas chamber, and she shows her sympathy for him. The narrator suddenly feels very tired. He asks Henri if they are good people; he is concerned because he feels no pity for the Jews.\n\nOnce all the people and trucks have gone, the workers collect the Jews\u2019 food, as well as the material objects that will go into Germany\u2019s coffers. Just as the workers have completed this task, another train rolls in.\n\nUnloading this train, the workers react more brutally and more impatiently. A woman attempts to leave behind her small child, hoping that she will be selected as a laborer. A guard curses her, throwing her on the trucks, and tossing the child in after her. The narrator sees an attractive young woman. She asks the narrator where they are being taken, and when he doesn\u2019t answer, she tells him that she knows. She walks off to the truck, though she is young and strong, and her life would have been spared.\n\nAfter unloading the two transports, the narrator declares to Henri that he is done with this work.\n\nHenri tells him to sit quietly and not let an SS soldier see him. By the light of the stars and the overhead bulbs, the narrator watches the work begin again. He sees a little girl crawl out the window of a train that has just pulled onto the tracks. She walks in circles, stunned and terrified. An SS man kicks her down and then shoots her with his revolver. The narrator goes back to the ramp to work, but when he touches yet another corpse, he vomits.\n\nLeaning against the stack of rails, the narrator dreams of being back at his bunk. He longs to return to the camp, which is a place of peace compared to the hell he is now in. Then, finally, the last transport has been unloaded. The dead are cleared off the ramp. The prisoners line up to go back to camp, weighted down with the food belonging to the Jews.\n\nAndrei\n\nAndrei is a Russian sailor who is a member of the labor gang that unloads the Jews from the cattle cars. He attacks a woman who is trying to deny her child to keep from being sent to the gas chambers. Through his act of attacking the woman, he wins the approval of the SS officers.\n\nGirl\n\nThe narrator notices an attractive, confident Jewish girl. She calmly asks him what will happen to them. Though he will not answer her, she tells him that she already knows the truth. Instead of allowing herself to be among the women chosen to go to the labor camp, she puts herself on the trucks headed for the gas chambers.\n\nHenri\n\nHenri, a Communist from France, is a friend of the narrator\u2019s. A member of the Canada labor gang, Henri regularly smuggles back food and clothing for his friends. He has a cynical attitude toward the camp, his fellow prisoners, and the Jewish victims, as well as a clear understanding that the welfare of the prisoner-workers depends on the continuing destruction of the Jews.\n\nLittle Girl\n\nThe little girl pushes herself out of the train window. Her mind has been unhinged by the experience, and she walks in circles until an SS man knocks her down with a kick and then shoots her dead.\n\nNarrator\n\nThe unnamed narrator is a Polish gentile imprisoned in Auschwitz. He is better off than most prisoners, receiving food packages from his family. His trip to the ramp is the first time he has worked such duty. On his way to the train station, he considers himself lucky to get this work detail because he knows he will be rewarded with food. However, he does not anticipate the horror of the work: forcing the Jews from the cattle cars, fending off their questions of what will happen to them, cleaning out the cars of the human detriment and dead babies. After unloading his first transport, the narrator feels tired and nauseous, yet completely disassociated from himself. Instead of feeling pity for the Jews, he is furious with them because, as he rationalizes it, if the Nazis were not determined to murder them, he would not be forced to carry out this disturbing and dehumanizing work. As a response to his malaise, he loses control, unloading the second train with barely restrained brutality; he wants the Jews to be gone so he is not reminded of what he is doing. After working on two transports, he is unable to continue. Instead, he longs only to return to the peace that the concentration camp provides where at least he remains among the living and not in continual contact with those who are like the waking dead.\n\nThe Holocaust and Its Literature\n\nThe term Holocaust refers to the genocide of European Jews and others by the Nazis during World War II. The narrator of \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d is a prisoner at the infamous Auschwitz, one of the death camps where the brutal killings were carried out. Around six million Jews died in the Holocaust, along with at least three million prisoners of other backgrounds. The Nazis organized this mass extermination with extreme efficiency; for example, by the end of the day that the story takes place, 15,000 people have been sent almost effortlessly to their deaths.\n\n\u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d is one of several of Borowski\u2019s Auschwitz stories and part of a larger genre of Holocaust literature. Writers such as Primo Levi and Elie Wiesel have produced some of the most famous accounts of survivor testimony. Holocaust literature focuses on how people survived amidst the horror of the concentration camps. Different Holocaust survivors have posited different explanations. One leading view, proposed by Viktor Frankl, states that in spite of terrible circumstances, the prisoners still found life to be unconditionally meaningful, even in its suffering. Other survivors support the idea that there was no real meaning to the death camps, that to survive people had to leave behind all their notions of the \u201cnormal world\u201d and normal human behavior; Borowski\u2019s work falls into the latter category.\n\nDeath and Survival\n\nDeath and survival are inextricably linked in \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen.\u201d For the narrator (and the other prisoners in his situation) to stay alive, he must take part in the business of the camp, which primarily revolves around the murder of the Jews and other \u201cundesirables.\u201d The narrator must carry out jobs that facilitate the destruction of the \u201ccremo\u201d transports, be it actually unloading the Jews\u2014as in the story\u2014or some other camp-related job (as Borowski performed in real life). The physical welfare of the prisoners also depends on the destruction of the Jews. Prisoner-workers get necessary items, from clothing to food, from the prisoners who are sent to their death. As the story opens, the prisoners are feeling the effects of the recent lack of transports arriving at the camp. As Henri notes, if the camp \u201cruns out of people\u201d to kill, he and his fellow prisoners will starve to death. \u201cAll of us live on what they bring,\u201d he says, underscoring the connection between death and survival. Indeed, when the narrator leaves the barracks to attend to the transport\u2014his first time doing so\u2014he considers himself lucky. In aiding in the deaths of others, he will facilitate his own survival.\n\nMorality\n\nIn the world of the camp, traditional notions of morality have no meaning. The narrator and his fellow prisoners rely on the deaths of others for their survival, so they are thus implicated in the murder of the Jews. What is more troubling, the prisoners are forced to take part in carrying out this crime; if they were to refuse to do their jobs, they would be killed themselves. To exist under such circumstances, the narrator is forced to detach himself mentally and emotionally from his actions. The narrator refers to the arrival of the cattle cars as the camp\u2019s \u201cusual diversion,\u201d thereby equating the death of thousands of innocent people with entertainment. He speaks casually of letting a praying rabbi continue \u201craving\u201d because the Nazis would \u201ctake him to the oven that much sooner.\u201d The only kindness the prisoners show those who are doomed to the gas chambers is deceiving them about their impending fate; the prisoners tell the Jews they don\u2019t know where they are being taken.\n\nThe narrator raises moral issues at the ramp when he asks Henri if they are good people. Instead of feeling pity for the doomed Jews, he is furious with them\u2014because of these people, he thinks, he is forced to be at the ramp at Auschwitz, experiencing this horror. Despite his rhetoric, however, the narrator demonstrates physical signs of his moral turmoil. He feels nauseous, until eventually, after unloading several transports, he loses control and vomits. As he sits down, he suddenly \u201csee[s] the camp as a haven of peace,\u201d which shows how far from the mainstream he has traveled; in the abnormal world of Auschwitz, the death camp has become a refuge.\n\nTopics for Further Study\n\nImagine that you are a journalist writing about life in Auschwitz. Write an article using Borowski\u2019s story as your reference source.\n\nRead other survivor accounts and compare these former prisoners\u2019 stories and experiences to Borowski\u2019s. What similarities do you find? What differences do you note?\n\nWrite a monologue that one of the Jewish characters in the story might have given at the ramp. What aspects would you focus on? How would you portray his feelings?\n\nWho do you think has a more realistic way of looking at camp life, the narrator or his friend Andrei? Explain your answer.\n\nImagine that you are a Jew who had survived the Holocaust. Write your response to Borowski\u2019s story.\n\nDo you think Borowski\u2019s story implies his own feelings about what took place in Auschwitz? Explain your answer.\n\nPoint-of-View\n\nAlthough the story is written from the first-person point-of-view, the unnamed narrator maintains a tone of extreme detachment from the horrific events that surround him and in which he participates. He reports the goings-on in a casual, unin-volved manner, so that his observations\u2014both those made to himself and to others\u2014resemble nothing as much as those of an impartial journalist. For example, although Henri complains about a Jewish man\u2019s wailing prayers, the narrator points out in a practical, unconcerned manner that the unpleasant noise will only lead the Nazis to gas the rabbi that much sooner. Despite the narrator\u2019s distant attitude, he is touched by the horror of the ramp. His nausea and his eventual refusal to take part in further unloading show that his distance stems not from a lack of feeling; instead, it emerges as a coping mechanism.\n\nStill, the narrator\u2019s understatement of the events of Auschwitz is disconcerting and continually keeps the reader off-balance. The second line of the story is a good example of the power of Borowski\u2019s technique: \u201cThe delousing is finally over, and our striped suits are back from the tanks of Cyclone B solution, an efficient killer of lice in clothing and of men in gas chambers.\u201d\n\nSymbolism and Metaphor\n\n\u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d is rich with symbolism and metaphor. In this base world, where survival is all that matters, people become animals\u2014Nazi captors and prisoners alike. The Nazis have \u201cbeefy\u201d faces. A female SS officer with a \u201crat-like\u201d smile \u201csniffs around\u201d the ramp. Another officer complains that the prisoner-workers, stunned by the events, are \u201cstanding about like sheep,\u201d and he whips them like the beasts of burden they have become. The starving Greek prisoners on transport duty, who are desperate enough to eat rotted, mildewed food, are looked upon as pigs, schweinedreck, and \u201chuge human insects\u201d with jaws pumping greedily. Even the trucks that participate in the slaughter transform into \u201cmad dogs.\u201d\n\nThe Jewish victims are not spared such degrading comparisons either. A couple locked in a frantic last embrace are \u201cdragged like cattle\u201d to the waiting truck; children run wildly around the ramp \u201chowling like dogs.\u201d The dead babies retrieved from the cattle cars are bloated monsters, which the prisoners carry out \u201clike chickens, holding several in each hand.\u201d A corpse is referred to simply as a \u201cmound of meat.\u201d\n\nThe oppressive heat, which the narrator describes as \u201cunbearable,\u201d is also important symbolically. It is a constant physical reminder of the crematoria where the bodies of the dead are burned. The breeze in the air brings no relief, but instead, \u201cfeels like a sizzling blast from a furnace.\u201d The heat is also trapped in the cattle cars, which the narrator describes as \u201can inferno.\u201d Auschwitz is a very real hell, both for those who work there and those who are sent there to die.\n\nSetting\n\nThe story takes place at Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp where the largest number of European Jews were killed. Auschwitz was both a labor camp where thousands of prisoners lived (Auschwitz I) and a death camp with gas chambers and crematoria where more than a million people were sent to their deaths (Auschwitz II). The two camps were located about a mile and a half apart, and each was heavily guarded, surrounded by gates and watchtowers. At the ramp, as the prisoners disembark from the cattle cars, they are immediately sent either to the right\u2014to labor in the camps\u2014 or to the left\u2014to death in the gas chambers.\n\nThe area around the ramp resembles a smalltown railway station, with a square surrounded by chestnut trees that provide a bit of shade in the heat. Although the narrator initially describes it as \u201ccheerful\u201d looking, the guards posted all along the rails\u2014 and their violent actions\u2014allow little opportunity for him to maintain this facade of normalcy. Soon the ramp transforms into what it really is: a hellish place of murder and madness.\n\nPoland Under Attack\n\nDespite being a dominant power in Eastern Europe from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century, in the eighteenth century, Poland was divided up by its neighbors. With the end of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, however, an independent Polish state was formed. Poland also received a large area of German territory, including the Polish Corridor. This strip of territory separated Germany from East Prussia, which gave Poland access to the Baltic Sea. The seaport Danzig, to which Germany retained usage rights, became a free city administered by the League of Nations. Poland\u2019s post-World War I government was precarious, however, and its leaders were unable to conclude defensive security agreements with other European powers.\n\nAs German expansion in Europe grew, Poland\u2019s government vainly attempted to protect itself. Danzig had a large German population, and Adolf Hitler eventually claimed it for Germany. A strong Nazi Party developed in Danzig, and by 1937, it controlled the city government. These officials made relations with Poland increasingly difficult.\n\nIn August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union announced a pact of non-aggression in which each nation pledged it would never attack the other.

A museum and memorial, first created in 1947, are on the site of the former Nazi concentration camp.\n\nAnywhere from 1 to 3 million are put to death by the Nazis at the concentration camp Auschwitz. 1940s: The Nazis murder at least 9 million people during the Holocaust. Today: In Rwanda, in 1994, the Hutu-led government systematically kills between 750,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu.\n\ncalled the Hitler-Stalin Pact, this pact included a secret agreement to divide Eastern Europe between the two nations; Germany would take western Poland and the Soviet Union would take eastern Poland in addition to other nearby territory. Within a week of signing this pact, Hitler demanded that Danzig be returned to Germany and that the Germans be allowed to occupy a strip running through the Polish Corridor.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, Hitler declared the annexation of Danzig to the Third Reich. At the same time and without warning, the German air force and ground armies launched a massive attack on Poland from three directions: the north, south, and west. Poland\u2019s military was unprepared for this blitzkrieg, or \u201clightning war.\u201d Then, on September 17, Soviet forces invaded Poland from the east. Within a month, Poland had surrendered.\n\nAn Occupied Poland\n\nAs had happened many times in its history, Poland disappeared from the maps of Europe. The nation was divided between the victors. The western half of Poland, occupied by the Nazis, was declared a new territory, the \u201cGeneral Government,\u201d while the eastern half was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Both the German and Soviet governments committed mass executions of civilians, political leaders, and military officers; arrested thousands of political prisoners; initiated police screening and registration; and segregated the population according to categories of undesirability.\n\nHitler had the goal of obliterating all traces of Polish history and culture. By October 1939, many Poles had been stripped of all rights. The use of the Polish language was forbidden; secondary schools were closed; and young men were drafted into the German army. The Gestapo forced about two million Jews to relocate to ghettos. The Soviets also carried out atrocities. All Poles living within Soviet territory were declared Soviet citizens. The Soviets deported some two million Poles to Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Soviet Far East, took over Polish businesses and factories, destroyed churches, and closed savings accounts.\n\nIn 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union and captured eastern Poland. The Germans\u2019 New Order in Poland included plans to Germanize suitable Poles and relocate the rest beyond the Ural Mountains; enslave the Slavs; and exterminate inferior or useless human beings. The Soviets began to organize Polish armies for their own defense, joined forces with the Allies, and began its advance on the Eastern Front, or eastern Poland, in 1943. In August 1944, Polish resistance fighters in Warsaw rose up against German occupation forces. Stalin ordered his troops that were approaching the city to halt, giving the Nazis time to smash the Polish forces and eliminated any potential competitors to Stalin\u2019s hand-picked communist government.\n\nConcentration Camps\n\nAlong with Jews, leaders (religious, educational, and political) and many others were imprisoned and put to death at the concentration camps. Other Poles were executed in public. The first mass execution of World War II took place on December 27, 1939, and was a strategy of war, aimed at terrorizing Poles into subservience.\n\nAuschwitz, located in southern Poland outside of Cracow, remains perhaps the most infamous concentration camp. For the first 21 months of its existence, Auschwitz was primarily inhabited by Polish non-Jews; by the time of the camp\u2019s liberation, more than 100,000 non-Jewish Poles had died at Auschwitz. However, soon it became a final destination point for Jews from throughout Europe, who were sent there in cattle cars and gassed. In 1945, as the Allies were approaching, the Nazis exterminated more than 400,000 Jews. That summer the Nazis began to evacuate the inmates of Auschwitz into Germany.\n\nCommunist Poland\n\nDuring the war, a free Polish government-in-exile had been based in London. However, after the war, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin refused to recognize this government. The United States and Great Britain wanted a democratic government in Poland. Stalin agreed that an unspecified number of pro-Western Poles would be granted a place in the new government and reluctantly agreed to hold free elections in Poland, but he did not say when. Over the protests of the Western Allies, Stalin installed a pro-Soviet Communist government in Poland. Stalin also insisted that the Soviet Union would retain the Polish territories it had seized in September 1939, but was not willing to risk war over this demand. The Soviets were able to crush all opposition. In 1956, however, Polish protestors began insisting on greater rights and threatened to revolt. The Soviets allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka, a former Polish leader deposed by Stalin for wanting to bring Poland more independence, to return to the country. Under Gomulka, who remained in power for fourteen years, Poland gained a small amount of independence in domestic policy-making.\n\nBorowski\u2019s story \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d first appeared in Poland the spring of 1946, little more than a year after the Nazis began evacuating Auschwitz\u2019s more than 50,000 prisoners (including Borowski). The story was included in the 1947 volume, We Were in Auschwitz, which collected short pieces by Borowski along with the works of fellow Poles Janusz Nel Siedlecki and Krystyn Olszewski. In their collective Preface, the authors explained that they hoped to talk \u201cwithout subterfuge, openly\u201d about the horrors they saw in Auschwitz. Their publication was an early attempt to diminish the already developing legend of the concentration camp: that in this place of horror, heroism supplanted cowardice, and prisoners worked together for the good of their fellow sufferers.\n\nTwo years later, Borowski\u2019s first collection, also titled This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, was published in Poland, making Borowski one of the first writers to depict the harshness of the concentration camps. Borowski\u2019s earliest readers noticed what became one of the most unique features of his stories: that no one was the \u201cvictim\u201d and no one was the \u201ccriminal.\u201d Rather, the narrator in his stories is part of the concentration camp community, which shares in the collective guilt over the deaths of millions of Europeans. Immediately, Borowski drew criticism; the Catholic Church denounced his nihilism while the Polish Communist\n\nparty condemned his work as decadent, Americanized, and amoral.\n\nIn 1967, an English translation of This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen was published, and American critics in numerous publications immediately responded favorably to Borowski\u2019s courageous message. George Eckstein of Dissent noted that the stories were \u201cremarkable in the unsentimental, unflinching frankness with which they face the universal brutality.\u201d Rather than eliding over the prisoners\u2019 role in the deaths of millions of people, Borowski emphasizes their brutality and implied guilt because this was the \u201cbitter essence of life in the Nazi concentration camp.\u201d\n\nDaniel Stern of the New York Times Book Review reserved the highest of praise for Borowski, whom he compared to noted Holocaust writer Elie Wiesel. \u201cDo not let the title of this short-story collection mislead you,\u201d he admonished readers, cautioning them from believing the book to be \u201cmerely another of the reports from hell\u201d that reached readers in the decades after the Holocaust. \u201cIt is a true work of art, full of brutality and pain. . . . [Borowski] paints a picture of the horror and madness that ruled the concentration camps, so brilliantly that the immediacy of the experience is almost too much to bear.\u201d Stern further singled out the title story as a \u201cbitterly perfect portrayal of the \u2018politics\u2019 of camp life,\u201d which requires prisoners to be pitted against other prisoners. Borowski\u2019s skill, wrote Stern, causes the reader to momentarily lose all \u201cnormal moral control\u201d and root for the narrator. He also lauded the scenes of Jews arriving at the camp as \u201cimpossible to forget.\u201d\n\nThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen was reissued in 1976, as part of a series of literature from Eastern Europe. Again, it drew overwhelmingly favorable criticism. Even thirty years later, wrote A. Alvarez in The New York Times Book Review, Borowski\u2019s prose still had an \u201cimpact and power [that is] as unsettling now as it must have been then.\u201d\n\nIn addition to responding to Borowski\u2019s message, literary critics have responded to his style. Stern praised Borowski\u2019s \u201cirony tempered with lyricism.\u201d Alvarez compared Borowski\u2019s prose, the \u201cpurity of style and language\u201d to that of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s, \u201cwhich remained even while expressing the fiercest corruption.\u201d He continued, \u201cThere is no melodrama, no moral gesturing. He [Borowski] simply records the facts, lucidly, in a style as stripped and deprived as the fact themselves.\u201d\n\nBecause of this style, some critics have found Borowski\u2019s work more akin to documentary or nonfiction than short fiction. Mark Shechner wrote for the Nation that Borowski\u2019s stories in This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen are \u201cbarely transformed autobiographical sketches. . . They are fiction only in a formal sense.\u201d He praised Borowski\u2019s detached style ofwriting as doing \u201cwhat is morally required,\u201d which is allowing the depravity of the Holocaust \u201cto speak for itself.\u201d Indeed, Irving Howe wrote in a lengthy New Republic piece on Holocaust literature that while Borowski\u2019s detached tone \u201cin a naturalistic novel would signal moral revulsion from represented ugliness, it has here become a condition of survival.\u201d Unlike many previous critics, however, Howe only responded to Borowski\u2019s \u201ctestimony.\u201d For Howe, the stories\u2019 very authenticity rendered him \u201call but indifferent to their status as art.\u201d\n\nLiterary critics have continued to explicate Borowski\u2019s work. In a 1982 essay, Lawrence Langer asked \u201c[W]hat are we to make of Borowski\u2019s narrator, who helps drive victims from the cattle cars, unloads their belongings, watches them being led off to the gas chambers?\u201d The narrator, answered Langer, lived in a world of \u201cchoiceless choice,\u201d for he \u201cis left only a choice between evils, between extermination and continued existence in Auschwitz.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, We Were in Auschwitz was published for the first time in English, and Borowski\u2019s work has continued to elicit strong reactions. Despite the fact that more than half a century has elapsed since Borowski first wrote about Auschwitz, the reviewer for Publishers Weekly experienced the book\u2019s \u201cchilling immediacy.\u201d In keeping with earlier critics, this reviewer found the volume to be \u201can important addition to Holocaust studies, but not for those who choose to see survival in Auschwitz as a triumph of the human spirit.\u201d\n\nRena Korb\n\nKorb has a master\u2019s degree in English literature and creative writing and has written for a wide variety of educational publishers. In the following essay, she discusses the moral climate of Auschwitz. On the heels of the end of World War II, Borowski and two other Polish survivors brought out the simply titled We Were in Auschwitz.\n\nThe three authors composed a collective Preface to their book. \u201cConfinement in the camp, destitution, torture, and death in the gas chamber,\u201d they wrote, \u201care not heroism, are not even anything positive.\u201d They described life in the camp as \u201cdefeat, the almost immediate abandonment of ideological principles\u201d and themselves as \u201cevil, hard, and cruel.\u201d Borowski\u2019s Auschwitz stories demonstrate the sad truth, that \u201cwe often renounced our humanity because we wanted to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d which reached American audiences in 1967 when it was first translated into English, has riveted readers for decades. Told from the point-of-view of a prisoner who participates in the Auschwitz killing machine, it shows a world in which long-accepted moral values do not exist. Prisoners at Auschwitz have no humanity because they can\u2019t afford to be human. They are stripped of any real choice; they must either contribute to the murder of other innocent victims or be killed themselves. \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d represents an alternate, surreal reality, one which human beings cannot even conceive until visiting this alien realm themselves.\n\nAs the story opens, the schizophrenic world of the camp manifests itself immediately. The unnamed narrator sits on a top bunk, lunching on \u201ccrisp, crunchy bread,\u201d bacon, onions, and tomatoes from his family\u2019s garden, and evaporated milk, while beneath him crowd hollow-cheeked, \u201cwithered\u201d men. Detached from his situation and any moral center, the narrator refers to the arrival of the trains filled with Jews to be murdered as the camp\u2019s \u201cusual diversion.\u201d He worries that the Nazis will \u201crun out of people\u201d to kill, which would take away the reason for the existence of the special Canada labor gang. He ruminates on Cyclone B solution, which is utilized in the camp as \u201can efficient killer office in clothing and men in the gas chambers.\u201d\n\nThe narrator does not long maintain his distance from the true business of the camp. He soon is offered the opportunity to participate in one of the most amoral activities at the camp: unloading the Jews from the cattle cars and sending the unfortunate ones to their death in the gas chambers. This is a monumental occasion. To go to the ramp is to win the opportunity to obtain food, clothing, liquor\u2014it\n\nWhat Do I Read Next?\n\nBread for the Deported (translated into English in 1997) by Bogdan Wojdowski is a novel about World War II Poland, describing the terrible difficulties of life in the Warsaw ghetto and culminating in deportation to the Treblinka concentration camp.\n\n(translated into English in 1997) by Bogdan Wojdowski is a novel about World War II Poland, describing the terrible difficulties of life in the Warsaw ghetto and culminating in deportation to the Treblinka concentration camp. Auschwitz survivor Ilona Karmel wrote the novel An Estate of Memory (1969) comparing the experiences of three women in the camp.\n\n(1969) comparing the experiences of three women in the camp. Czeslaw Milosz, the Nobel Prize winner for Literature in 1980, wrote the political poem, \u201cOn the Death of Tadeusz Borowski.\u201d\n\nPrimo Levi\u2019s Survival in Auschwitz (1947) is one of the classic accounts of life in Nazi concentration camps.\n\n(1947) is one of the classic accounts of life in Nazi concentration camps. Night (1958) by Elie Wiesel is a semi-autobiographical account of a young boy\u2019s spiritual reaction to Auschwitz.\n\nis to be lucky. It is also to enter a world even more unreal than the world of the barracks.\n\nThe narrator\u2019s very journey to the ramp visually implies the schizophrenia that surrounds him. He marches past \u201cguards all around, young men with automatics,\u201d past \u201ca clump of unfamiliar green\u2014apple and pear trees,\u201d past \u201cthe circle of watchtowers,\u201d only to arrive at a \u201ccheerful little station\u201d that is shaded by small chestnut trees. \u201cThis is where they load freight for Birkenau: supplies for the construction of the camp, and people for the gas chambers.\u201d The narrator\u2019s note\u2014 \u201c[t]rucks drive around, load up lumber, cement, people\u201d\u2014reinforces the equation on the part of the Nazis of people and mere objects. Unlike the construction materials, however, the people are considered useless. The Red Cross truck transforms into a similarly disturbing symbol; instead of acting in its typical role as a vehicle bringing aid, it carries the deadly gas from the train to the gas chambers.\n\nOnce the cattle cars arrive, the true horror of Auschwitz reveals itself. At the ramp, the only people who act with even a modicum of humanity and respect are the Jews, despite the brutality with which they are met. An old woman being sent to the gas chambers is forced to carry the bodies of the dead babies retrieved from the train cars. However, she shows the narrator pity for the work he must do; \u2018\u201cMy poor boy,\u2019 she whispers and smiles at me.\u201d A beautiful young woman catches the narrator\u2019s attention, and she asks him where they are going. When the narrator doesn\u2019t answer, \u201cI know,\u2019 she says with a shade of proud contempt in her voice, tossing her head.\u201d Then she chooses to join the other doomed Jews by \u201cboldly\u201d walking to the trucks. A one-legged girl who is being taken to the truck politely addresses the men who carry her. \u201cTears are running down her face\u201d and she tells the men they are hurting her, but she still address them as \u201cSir.\u201d Such instances of sympathy, dignity, and courtesy are seen nowhere else this day except at the ramp and except from the Jews.\n\nOnly in one instance does a Jew show a real lack of humanity. A woman denies that a little boy is her own, even as the child \u201cruns after her, wailing loudly: \u2018Mama, mama, don\u2019t leave me!\u2019\u201d By contrast, the Nazis and the camp inmates display such savagery almost constantly throughout the day. In a rage, a burly prisoner-worker physically attacks this woman. He verbally castigates her as well for abandoning her child, accusing her of immoral behavior at the same time that he tosses her into the truck and consigns her to death. In a moment of bitter irony, an SS officer applauds the prisoner\u2019s actions and calls the woman a \u201cdegenerate.\u201d\n\nSome of the brutality committed by the officers, guards, or prisoners is rendered even more heinous because of the casual manner in which it is dispensed. As the cattle cars roll into the station, an SS officer hears the cries and moans of Jews inside.\n\n\u201cThis brief exchange shows the process by which prisoners in Auschwitz change from normal humans who experience and act upon a social conscience to humans who are cut off from any moral core.\u201d\n\nThe officer \u201cjerks his head impatiently, his lips twist in annoyance,\u201d before signaling a guard to riddle the train car with shots from an automatic rifle. As the Jews are sent to their death, another officer stands with a notebook in hand. \u201cFor each departing truck he enters a mark; sixteen gone means one thousand people, more or less. The gentleman is calm, precise.\u201d The SS man who orders the narrator to give the dead babies to one of the women does so while examining his cigarette lighter \u201ccarefully.\u201d\n\nA little girl comes to metaphorically represent the madness teeming on the ramp. She has pushed herself out through the train\u2019s window and fallen out to the gravel before regaining her feet and \u201cwalking around in a circle, faster and faster, waving her rigid arms around in the air.\u201d As the narrator realizes that \u201c[h]er mind has given way,\u201d an SS officer \u201ccalmly\u201d kicks her down and then shoots her dead.\n\nLanguage is yet another example of the schizophrenic nature of the camp. The \u201cmultilingual throng\u201d can hardly understand each other and must manufacture new modes of communication, which are generally unreliable and ineffective. The prisoners speak in a medley of languages, sometimes mimicking the German of their captors, sometimes relying on \u201ccrematorium Esperanto.\u201d The prisoners also are unable to forge real communication with the Jews, who are really their partners in victimization and abuse. \u201cSir, what\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d the Jews coming off the train ask the workers. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d is the only answer they will receive. Explains the narrator, \u201cIt is the camp law: people going to their death must be deceived to the very end.\u201d One old man keeps repeating a German phrase, \u201cI wish to speak with the commandant,\u201d drawing the derisive laughter of an SS officer. Though this man speaks the language of the Nazis, the two parties will never be able to communicate. In reality, no one at the camp can have hopes of understanding one another\u2014 Auschwitz is beyond true human comprehension.\n\nIn the midst of this manifestation of hell, the narrator is forced to confront his reaction to the situation\u2014the anger he has for the Jews. He explains to Henri, \u201cI am furious, simply furious with these people\u2014furious because I must be here because of them. I feel no pity. I am not sorry they\u2019re going to the gas chamber. Damn them all!\u201d He recognizes that his feelings \u201cmust be pathological,\u201d but is assured by Henri that actually, such feelings are \u201cnatural, predictable . . . The ramp exhausts you, you rebel\u2014and the easiest way to relieve your hate is to turn against someone weaker.\u201d This brief exchange shows the process by which prisoners in Auschwitz change from normal humans who experience and act upon a social conscience to humans who are cut off from any moral core. Henri may be correct that the narrator\u2019s reaction is natural, but that does not make the narrator\u2019s confession any less shocking.\n\nDespite his words, the narrator is strongly affected by the events that he is helping to bring about. Even if his mind maintains its distance from what is going on around him, his body does respond as if in physical pain. He vomits, a metaphorical representation of his attempt to rid himself of his guilt and his responsibility in the death of 15,000 Jews from Sosnoweic-Bedzin. Like that little girl, his mind gives way in his sudden longing for the camp \u201cas a haven of peace.\u201d\n\nIn stories such as \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d Borowski, writes Laurence Langer in \u201cAuschwitz: The Death of Choice,\u201d \u201cmercilessly confronts us with moments of dehu-manization.. .the terror of extermination generated consequences that leave us morally speechless.\u201d Readers may be tempted to evaluate, even judge, the narrator\u2019s actions at the ramp. The circumstances that Borowski and others like him faced, however, clearly show that Auschwitz was another world, one which the average person could never understand.\n\nSource: Rena Korb, Critical Essay on \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d in Short Stories for Students, The Gale Group, 2001.\n\nSusan Sanderson\n\nSanderson holds a Master of Fine Arts degree in fiction writing and is an independent writer. In this essay, she looks at the techniques Borowski uses in his short story to develop a narrator who, while appearing to be detached from the atrocities he witnesses and participates in at Auschwitz, still presents evidence of his humanity.\n\nAfter reading the cycle of Auschwitz stories in Polish writer Tadeusz Borowski\u2019s collection This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, many critics understandably focus on the author\u2019s apparently amazing detachment from the gruesome subject matter, as well as on his extreme pessimism about human nature. Borowski\u2019s thinly veiled autobiographical stories about life as a non-Jew sentenced to a Nazi concentration camp are breathtaking in their horror; Borowski propels the reader into a world so foreign from his or her own that the first-person view of the atrocities committed by both prisoners and perpetrators can be described only as relentless.\n\nBut in the world of the labor camp, where there are no heroes, or at least no characters who die by choice for a righteous cause, Borowski\u2019s view of human nature might not be quite as bleak as could be interpreted from a cursory reading of the text. There is no denying that Borowski\u2019s picture of what men will do to each other to survive is far from inspiring, and he does view the stories\u2019 events through his narrator with a sometimes impassive tone.\n\nNevertheless, a close examination of the first story (with the same title as the collection) shows that Borowski draws on a variety of techniques to offer some, if scant, relief from the unblinking detachment of his narrator, and to expose, however briefly, the narrator\u2019s humanness in the most inhumane of conditions. For if he did not, on the rare occasion, show some human feeling amid the horror he witnesses, no one would blame the overwhelmed reader for crying out, as the narrator does, \u201cMy God, man, I am finished, absolutely finished!\u201d And when a man decides he is finished at Auschwitz, there is no honorable way to die; survival is the only way of honor. The narrator makes a conscious decision, through his anger as well as by his holding tight to small pieces of his own humanity, not to become a \u201cMuslim,\u201d the camp name for a prisoner who has been physically and spiritually destroyed.\n\nBorowski makes clear in his description of Auschwitz that the setting is, if not actually hell,\n\n\u201cIn the black-is-white and white-is-black world of the death camps, where beauty looks so out of place, mothers cannot safely claim their children\u2019s bodies, and a Red Cross truck carries the gas to the crematoriums, mental health is measured in a way that would seem insane outside the barbed wire.\u201d\n\na good representation of it. The temperature is blisteringly hot, and \u201c[t]he sun . . . illuminates the ramp with a reddish glow; the shadows of the trees have become elongated, ghostlike. . . . the human cries seem to rise all the way to the sky.\u201d In fact, Borowski even creates a hierarchy in this Inferno, and places his narrator (who is never called by name in the first story but is known to be a Polish non-Jew) in a position somewhat removed from the squalor and deprivation of many of his fellow prisoners.\n\nIn an early scene, the narrator surveys from his top bunk bed the swarming men below him, almost insect-like in their anonymity. \u201cAll of us walk around naked. The delousing is finally over, and our striped suits are back from the tanks of Cyclone B solution, an efficient killer of lice in clothing and of men in gas chambers.\u201d Lawrence L. Langer writes in his article \u201cAuschwitz: The Death of Choice\u201d that the narrator\u2019s apparent cynicism \u201cis not merely a literary device; it represents an honest attempt to suggest how Auschwitz \u2018denatured\u2019 human character.\u201d\n\nAccording to Langer, Borowski has created \u201can unrecognizable Eden\u201d where the occupants, instead of naming the animals they see, \u201cbecome confused with them.\u201d While he and his friend Henri enjoy their bread, tomatoes, and bacon\u2014treasures acquired in exchange for helping move the Jews from the boxcars to their ultimate deaths\u2014he looks out over those below, the \u201cnaked, sweat-drenched men [who] crowd in the narrow barracks aisle.\u201d Borowski immediately identifies the narrator and his friend as part of the prisoner elite.\n\nRelief from the nightmarish setting of the concentration camp appears in small glimpses of nature that have not been corrupted by man. When the narrator becomes part of the work detail assigned to unloading new Jewish prisoners from the boxcars, he passes \u201ca small square framed by tall chestnuts and paved with yellow gravel.\u201d In fact, the narrator tries to inject a bit of ironic levity into the situation, calling the building where the Jews will be unloaded prior to their march to the ovens, \u201ca cheerful little station, very much like any other provincial railway stop.\u201d\n\nLater in that scene, the narrator sees a similar grove of trees and describes them in an almost bucolic manner, as \u201cthe green shade of the Silesian chestnuts.\u201d At the end of the day, \u201c[t]he evening has come, cool and clear,\u201d an appreciated contrast to the hellish temperatures of daytime. \u201cThe stars are out. . . . It is incredibly quiet.\u201d But if the contrast between human depravity and nature isn\u2019t strong enough, Borowski adds a political analogy; he uses the word \u201cCanada\u201d throughout the story to refer to the labor gang members who unload the trains and to any sign of wealth and well-being at the camps. This Canada, however, \u201csmells not of maple forests but of French perfume, [and] has amassed great fortunes in diamonds and currency from all over Europe.\u201d\n\nJust as \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d presents no heroes, it also contains no villains. To include them, according to Andrzej Wirth in his essay \u201cA Discovery of Tragedy,\u201d would have resulted in \u201ca pale and pretentious sentimentality\u201d and \u201ca demonization of the criminal. . . . [which would be] an inadequate solution.\u201d The Nazi system of extermination and governance becomes the distant villain, and all who participate in it\u2014whether desperate inmate laborers like the narrator and Henri, newly arrived Jewish prisoners, or brutal German guards\u2014are victims in Borowski\u2019s story. Nonetheless, Borowski includes a few people in the story whose presence breaks up the continuous parade of death and decay.\n\nHenri is a fat Frenchman who has the morals of an alley cat but, importantly, he is the narrator\u2019s only friend. While it could be argued that their relationship is strictly related to their survival, Henri is the person the narrator turns to when his sense of self begins to crack during the horrific work they are doing on the train ramp, asking, \u201cListen Henri, are we good people?\u201d Granted, Henri\u2019s response is a bit cold-hearted, but this exchange allows the narrator to make himself vulnerable, if even for a brief moment, while he ponders his part in the horrible play of evil around him. He questions why he hates so much and how he can have no pity for the people he prepares for the gas chambers. \u201cIt must be pathological, I just can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nAfter trying to brush him off, Henri assures the narrator that his reactions are \u201cnatural, predictable, calculated. . . . Why, I\u2019d even call it healthy.\u201d Henri understands the narrator\u2019s emotional fragility at this point; he has not developed quite the tough veneer that Henri possesses. Henri goes beyond telling the narrator that his worries are useless and attempts to make his friend feel better\u2014a tiny moment of tenderness, however perverse. Later in the conversation the narrator becomes even too bitter for Henri, and Henri gently reminds his friend that he has suffered hunger and has frantically stuffed himself with found food, much like the Greeks he condemns.\n\nThree women, like shadows from a life the narrator feels is completely lost, also provide a few moments of solace for the narrator, as well as brief respites for readers from the story\u2019s dark, unrelenting progression. After the beginning scene recounting the use of the Cyclone B to kill both lice and men, the narrator cuts a piece of bread sent to him sent by his mother. (He is one of the elite prisoners allowed packages in the camp.) He is angered by a rabbi\u2019s loud chanting and praying in the bunk below his, but pauses to reminisce, \u201conly a week ago my mother held this white loaf in her hands . . . dear Lord, dear Lord.\u201d His reverie is broken by Henri plotting how they will acquire real French champagne the next time a train load of Jews comes from France.\n\nThe other two women appear among the people unloaded from the boxcars later that day. The narrator is ordered to clean up the human remains left on one of the trains after everyone alive has disembarked. This horrific scene has the prisoners picking up dead infants, unsure of what to do with them. \u201cWe carry them out like chickens, holding several in each hand,\u201d he says. The prisoners are instructed to hand them over to the women who have just come off the train, but the women are frightened and refuse to take the bodies.\n\nAn SS officer threatens to shoot the women if they don\u2019t take the dead babies, but an older woman steps in to diffuse the situation. \u201cA tall, gray-haired woman takes the little corpses out of my hands and for an instant gazes straight into my eyes. \u2018My poor boy,\u2019 she whispers and smiles at me.\u201d Her calm wisdom is a welcome contrast to the hysterical scene unfolding on the ramp.\n\nThe narrator has experienced a moment of genuine connection with another human being, someone that has sympathy for him, but the result is almost too much for him to grasp. Immediately after this incident, the narrator turns to Henri for the conversation about whether they are good people. And even though the narrator rants about how much he hates the people he unloads from the trains, his anger is a clear signal that his soul is not completely hardened; at least he is able to have an emotional response, indicating there is still something human left inside him.\n\nThe third woman who creates a pause in the narration appears suddenly, as if in a dream, and \u201cdescends lightly from the train.\u201d She acts as if she has just disembarked at a regular train station, looking around at the huge crowd for her friends, whom she expects to be there any minute. \u201cWith a natural gesture she runs her hands down her blouse, casually straightens her skirt,\u201d the narrator notices, and then she looks directly at him and asks where they will be taken. He is speechless and cannot answer. All he can think of is her beauty contrasted with the ugliness of the gas chambers and the foul-smelling concentration camp. In a flash, he notices a gold watch on her wrist and sadly thinks \u201cWhy did she bring it? . . . They\u2019ll take it from her anyway.\u201d When she realizes her fate, she confidently walks to the trucks taking people directly to the gas chambers. Her actions are of some creature from another planet, a planet the narrator feels he has left long ago and can only remember in snippets. But her appearance softens him for a moment, as he appreciates her normalcy and animation amid the concentration camp\u2019s decay.\n\nBorowski writes with a tone of \u201capparent cynicism, moral indifference, and an uncontrollable moral insanity,\u201d according to Wirth. And Mark Shechner in his review of the collection in The Nation observes \u201chow cool Borowski is, how ironic!\u201d But this tough facade is developed for good reason; if the narrator (and Borowski, during his time at Auschwitz) ever lets his guard down, allows anyone at the camp to see his humanity and his tenderness, his survival will be in jeopardy. \u201cYet this cool is not at all dispassionate but rather guarded and mature. It is a manner forged under extreme vigilance,\u201d according to Shechner.\n\nHowever, Shechner goes on to argue that anger, sympathy, and guilt are \u201cthe most useless emotions of all to the totally dominated.\u201d Only part of this statement is accurate, though, as the narrator shows time and time again that, while sympathy and guilt are certainly ineffective, his anger saves him from becoming a \u201cMuslim.\u201d Henri stokes the narrator\u2019s anger toward the Jews he unloads from the trains, because he knows that any sensible man who stops, even for a moment, to think of the atrocities he is abetting to support his existence will be utterly destroyed. In a perverse sense, Henri is right, and the narrator\u2019s well-developed hatred is nothing if not \u201chealthy.\u201d In the black-is-white and white-is-black world of the death camps, where beauty looks so out of place, mothers cannot safely claim their children\u2019s bodies, and a Red Cross truck carries the gas to the crematoriums, mental health is measured in a way that would seem insane outside the barbed wire.\n\nSource: Susan Sanderson, Critical Essay on \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d in Short Stories for Students, The Gale Group, 2001.\n\nHamida Bosmajian\n\nIn the following essay excerpt, Bosmajian analyzes \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, \u201ccommenting on Borowski\u2019s \u201cclimactic but ironic use of parallelisms.\u201d\n\n[Borowski\u2019s] stories, while they can be arranged to give the illusion of beginning, middle, and end, are really memory shards in which he retraces his guilt, reacts aggressively against it, and mocks himself profoundly as an artist in a world of stone.\n\n[In \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d we see] how a young man, the narrator Tadek, incorporated Auschwitz . . . Tadek, who works at the ramp, actively participates in sending thousands to their deaths. Yet the nonmetaphysically inclined Tadek also arrives at metaphysical intimations; for the magnitude of decreation around him evokes such resonances in \u201cThis Way for the Gas,\u201d internalizes them in \u201cA Visit,\u201d and disgorges them in aggressive apocalyptic visions in \u201cThe World of Stone.\u201d\n\nThe uncreating world of the concentrationary universe is a world of lies and deceit, as is already evident in the title of \u201cThis Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d and is confirmed as the reader\n\n\u201cThe uncreating world of the concentrationary universe is a world of lies and deceit, as is already evident in the title of \u2018This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2019 and is confirmed as the reader becomes conscious of the fact that within the twenty pages of this short story 15,000 people have been gassed.\u201d\n\nbecomes conscious of the fact that within the twenty pages of this short story 15,000 people have been gassed. Speed intensifies throughout the narrative as Tadek races through the account of his participation in preparing the victims of three transports for their deaths. In the beginning he and his composers seem to eagerly await the first transport, for also at the ramp is \u201cCanada,\u201d the land of plenty, where the inmates get supplies for survival. The narrator\u2019s tone is objective, casual, and cynical. . . Typical of Borowski\u2019s style is the climactic but ironic use of parallelisms. [A distant] church steeple obviously points to something that transcends this world. But whatever that might be, it has no contact with the two groups of men who conspire within this confined, narrow ground of evil.\n\nAfter the wagons have been emptied, the inmates must clean up the \u201cSchweinerei\u201d (pig\u2019s mess); the physical and moral stain must appear to have been removed. Among the human refuse in the wagon, Tadek finds \u201csquashed, trampled infants, naked little monsters, with enormous heads and bloated bellies. We carry them out like chickens, holding several in each hand.\u201d . . . Pity is consistently undercut as the narrator moves from infants to monsters, to chickens, and to the seemingly unaffected diversionary attitude of the SS man who sees but does not choose to see. Shocked, the women refuse to take the little bodies; but a tall, grey-haired woman accepts them and addresses Tadek as \u201cmy poor boy,\u201d a personalized phrase that over-whelms him, not with tears, but with intense, physical fatigue and with the refusal to look at people individually.\n\nWith the arrival of the second transport brutality increases and deception diminishes. A woman, aware that she would go to the gas chamber if defined as a mother, denies her child but is killed by a Russian inmate. As Tadek once again struggles with nausea, there emerges from the train a girl that belongs to another time and world. She \u201cdescends lightly from the train, hops to the gravel, looks around inquiringly as if somewhat surprised. Her soft, blond hair has fallen on her shoulders in a torrent.\u201d Her wise and mature look defines her as in the know as she insists on going to the gas chamber. She is a totally absurd but true appearance of personhood and dignity in this world of deceit; her knowledge, however, leads her to seek death .. . [Only] the human being can contain such knowledge, for there is no god who contains or refuses to contain so much suffering.\n\nThis is particularly evident after Tadek has cleaned up the wagons of the second transport and rests against the rails: \u201cThe sun has leaned low over the horizon and illuminates the ramp with a reddish glow: the shadows of the trees have become elongated, ghostlike. In the silence that settles over nature at this time of day, the human cries seem to rise all the way to the sky.\u201d . . . No ear will receive the cries that rise from this constricted and seemingly eternal narrow ground. Tadek, who sees all this, describes it in a language resonant with religious connotations, a language similar to the images of Nelly Sachs in \u201cLandscape of Screams\u201d; for the precision of Borowski\u2019s attempt to imitate reality and Sachs\u2019s precise use of the literalness of the word approximate each other.\n\nNausea is a momentary and illusory relief for a man who has made such a world part of his being that his sense of ego has been lost. In the sketches \u201cA Visit\u201d and \u201cThe World of Stone,\u201d Tadek describes the state of such a man after liberation. He admits in \u201cA Visit\u201d that\u2019 T have never been able to look at myself.\u201d . . . Self-knowledge is a myth for the former concentration camp inmate, for his self is constituted of what he saw. \u201cA Visit\u201d is a visit of the people who claimed his kinship, as is evident in the twice-repeated whisper of a dying man: \u201cBrother, brother.\u201d Tadek had to fail as his brother\u2019s keeper, for he had thousands of brothers and sisters who claimed his kinship. As the repetition of \u201cI saw, I saw, I saw\u201d reveals, Tadek has only been able to fulfill the final request of the victims, namely, that he remember what happened. He is now housed in his memory but is unhoused in his present world as he sits \u201cin someone else\u2019s room,\u201d where in a moment he will feel \u201chomesick for the people I saw then.\u201d He can visit them all, and they will be his visitation. Because he is defined through them alone, because there is no room for self-knowledge, his consciousness is nothing but a house for the memory of the victims. The world that once swallowed him is now contained within him.\n\nIn \u201cThe World of Stone\u201d the alienated narrator reacts aggressively against the \u201cintimate immensity\u201d (Bachelard) of himself as the anagogic container of the world of Auschwitz. Growing within him \u201clike a foetus inside a womb\u201d is the terrible knowledge and foreboding that \u201cthe Infinite Universe is inflating at incredible speed.\u201d He wants to retain it like \u201ca miser,\u201d afraid that solid matter will dissolve into emptiness like a \u201cfleeting sound.\u201d Demonic knowledge crowds and pressures the confines of his being, a knowledge that cannot be transformed into the logos of speech because it would not generate an individualized creation; rather, it would generate a chaos of emptiness, reminiscent of smoke and air or the cries that rose all the way to the sky from the ground of Auschwitz.\n\n[In \u201cThe World of Stone\u201d] Tadek is left with the choice of chaos as void or a world of stone, the latter symbolized by the \u201cmassive cool building made of granite\u201d where he works. But granite does not protect him; he knows it \u201ccannot keep the world from swelling and bursting like an over-ripe pomegranate, leaving behind but a handful of contracted, grey, dry ashes,\u201d an image which is a grotesque inversion of Mallarme\u2019s \u201cAfternoon of a Faun.\u201d In Borowski\u2019s world of stone there may be a volcanic eruption of aggression, there may be ashes, but no queen of love visits the day dreamer.\n\nTadek concludes that, because the world has not yet blown away, he intends to write and \u201cgrasp the true significance of the events and people I have seen.\u201d His matter is great and worthy of \u201can immortal epic,\u201d but the act of writing would mean a concession to the illusion of normality in which he does not want to participate. Tadek and the other victim/survivors of the concentrationary universe have not left us, who are still caught in the illusion of reprieve, the conclusive comfort of a great epic. They have left us partial visions, short stories, sketches, and fragments and retained \u201cwith a miser\u2019s piercing anxiety\u201d. . . the world which swallowed them and which they swallowed with open eyes.\n\nSource: Hamida Bosmajian, \u201cThe Rage for Order: Autobiographical Accounts of the Self in the Nightmare of History,\u201d in Metaphors of Evil: Contemporary German Literature and the Shadow of Nazism, University of Iowa Press, 1979.\n\nJan Kott\n\nIn the following introduction, Kott stresses the cultural and historical importance of Borowski \u2018s Auschwitz stories.\n\n[This text has been suppressed due to author restrictions]\n\n[This text has been suppressed due to author restrictions]\n\nSource: Jan Kott, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d in \u201cThis Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u201d and Other Stories, translated by Barbara Vedder, with the Introduction translated by Michael Kandel, Penguin Books, 1976, pp. 11-26.\n\nAlvarez, A., \u201cThe Victim of a Full European Education,\u201d in New York Times Book Review, February 29, 1976, pp. 3-4.\n\nEckstein, George, \u201cThe Festering Sore,\u201d in Dissent, Vol. 247, No. 2, March-April, 1968, pp. 184-86.\n\nHowe, Irving, \u201cWriting and the Holocaust,\u201d in New Republic, October 27, 1986, p. 27.\n\nKott, Jan, Introduction to This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, by Tadeusz Borowski, translated by Barbara Vedder, Penguin Books, 1976.\n\nLanger, Lawrence L., \u201cAuschwitz: The Death of Choice,\u201d in Versions of Survival: The Holocaust and the Human Spirit, State University of New York Press, 1982, pp. 67-129.\n\nReview in Publishers Weekly, Vol. 247, No. 23, June 5,2000.\n\nShechner, Mark, \u201cSurvival Declined,\u201d in Nation, Vol. 222, No. 24, June 19, 1976, pp. 760-62.\n\nSiedlecki, Janusz, Krystyn Olszewski, Tadeusz Borowski, and Anatol Girs, Preface to We Were in Auschwitz, Welcome Rain Publishers, 2000.\n\nStern, Daniel, \u201cMaking Way for the Dead,\u201d in New York Times Book Review, November 19, 1967, p. 81.\n\nWirth, Andrzej, \u201cA Discovery of Tragedy,\u201d in Polish Review, translated by Adam Czerniawski, Vol. 12, No. 3, Summer 1967, pp. 42-52.\n\nAroneanu, Eugene, comp., Inside the Concentration Camps, translated by Thomas Whissen, Praeger, 1996.\n\nThis oral history presents 100 eyewitness testimonies, first recorded in 1945, of the concentration experience from the point of view of many different types of survivors.\n\nBorowski, Tadeusz, This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, translated by Barbara Vedder, Penguin USA, 1992.\n\nThis is a recent edition of Borowski\u2019s work.\n\nClendinnen, Inga, Reading the Holocaust, Cambridge University Press, 1999.\n\nClendinnen explores the experience of the Holocaust from the point of view of both the victims and the perpetrators, and discusses survivor testimonies of writers.\n\nGutman, Yisrael, and Michael Berenbaum, eds., Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, Indiana University Press, 1998.\n\nThe book compiles reports from 27 multinational contributors on the history, population, and operations of Auschwitz.\n\nHatley, James, Suffering Witness: The Quandary of Responsibility after the Irreparable, State University of New York Press, 2000.\n\nHatley uses survivor literature, including works of This book presents an overview of Polish life under Borowski, and philosophy to argue that bearing wit- the German occupation, focusing on such aspects as ness to the Holocaust is a serious responsibility. the government, the underground, and daily life.\n\nLukas, Richard C, and Norman Davies, The Forgotten Marrus, Michael R., The Holocaust in History, Penguin Holocaust: The Poles under German Occupation 1939-1944, Books, 1987. 2d rev. ed., Hippocrene Books, 1997.\n\nThis book presents an overview of Polish life under the German occupation, focusing on such aspects as the government, the underground, and daily life.\n\nMarrus, Michael R., The Holocaust in History, Penguin Books, 1987."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/class-clips-video/history-ks3-gcse-gas-chambers-development-during-the-holocaust/zdvh2sg", "page_content": "DAN SNOW: Hi, I'm Dan Snow. I'm a historian and I've been going through the BBC's archives looking for material that will help with your understanding of one of history's darkest events ever. The Holocaust of World War Two. It was an event in which Germany was responsible for the murder of six million Jews. Many of whom were gassed to death in camps that were specifically designed to carry out mass killings. The clip we're about to look at isn't an easy watch, as it focuses on one of the first camps where poison gas was used. At a place called Chelmno in Poland, which was then controlled by Germany.\n\nDAN SNOW: The camp was run by Herbert Langer, a German commander, and the local Jewish population was among the first to suffer under his terrible plans, which saw the use of gas vans rather than the notorious gas chambers.\n\nNARRATOR: The selected Jews were taken here, to Herbert Langer's new improvised extermination facility at Chelmno.\n\nNARRATOR: Jews from the immediate area had been the first to die here a few weeks before.\n\nNARRATOR: The Nazi's blew up the large house which was the centre of the killing operations in order to hide evidence of their crime.\n\nNARRATOR: This is one of the few photos that remain of the house itself.\n\nNARRATOR: But evidence gathered after the war allows a picture to be constructed of what the Nazi's did here.\n\nNARRATOR: The Jews from Lodz were told to undress. They were then pushed down a corridor in the basement of the house, up a ramp and into a small windowless chamber.\n\nNARRATOR: Doors were then slammed behind them. They'd been locked in the back of a van.\n\nNARRATOR: These vans had been invented two years earlier to kill mentally ill people, by cramming them in the sealed rear cargo area and then gassing them with carbon monoxide.\n\nNARRATOR: Now Langer and other Nazi's used their own initiative to adapt this killing method to murder Jews.\n\nNARRATOR: They made gas vans central to the new killing operations here at Chelmno.\n\nZOFIA SZALEK: There was a lot of screaming, how terribly they screamed. It was impossible to bear.\n\nZOFIA SZALEK: We could hear the screams but we couldn't see the people.\n\nZOFIA SZALEK: They were loaded in and murdered there. It was hell. That's why we called these vans Hell Vans.\n\nZOFIA SZALEK: When I saw it going, I'd say, \"The hell's going.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The van's carrying the bodies of the Jews who had been gassed were driven two miles through remote country roads to a nearby forest and buried in a clearing.\n\nNARRATOR: Many of the German's who worked here at Chelmno believed what they were doing was perfectly legal, as the post-war testimony of Kurt Mobius, one of the SS guards, reveals.\n\nOFFICER: We were told by Captain Lange that the order for the extermination of the Jews came from Hitler and Himmler. And as police officers, we were drilled to regard any order from the government as lawful and correct. At the time, I believed the Jews were not innocent, but guilty. The propaganda had drilled it into us again and again that all Jews were criminals and sub-humans who were the cause of Germany's decline after the First World War.\n\nNARRATOR: Motivated by such anti-Semitic delusions, the German's created here at Chelmno the first systematic process for the mass gassing of the Jews.\n\nDAN SNOW: In all, it's thought that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people died in Chelmno, and according to records only seven people ever managed to escape."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/gas-chamber", "page_content": "gas chamber, method of executing condemned prisoners by lethal gas.\n\nThe gas chamber was first adopted in the U.S. state of Nevada in 1921 in an effort to provide a more humane form of capital punishment.

In Arizona, inmates sentenced to death before November 1992 were allowed to choose between lethal injection and lethal gas; in Wyoming, lethal gas was designated to replace lethal injection if the latter method was ruled unconstitutional. From 1921 to 1972 (when the U.S. Supreme Court commenced its moratorium on the death penalty), lethal gas was applied in some 600 executions; from 1976 (when the moratorium ended) to 1999 it was used in only 11 executions.

Some attempted to flee, others ran into a nearby building and set it on fire. Another section of their group stationed some half mile away killed a kapo, or prisoner-overseer, broke out of their building, cut the wire fence and escaped into the countryside. Before they had covered more than a few miles, they were tracked down and killed.\n\nThis revolt was the largest and most determined uprising that happened in Auschwitz-Birkenau. But it met with little success. It certainly did not save the lives of those who took part in it: about 450 members of their work group were killed in the uprising or in retaliation for it. Nor does it seem to have had much effect on Birkenau\u2019s killing capacity.\n\nNicholas Chare , Author provided\n\nBut this probably does not account for the relative obscurity of the revolt. Instead, the status of those who were involved in it often causes people to hesitate before discussing them. This work group, or \u201cspecial squad\u201d, is more often known by its German name, Sonderkommando. They were slave labourers, almost entirely drawn from Jewish arrivals to Auschwitz, who were forced to process and dispose of the bodies of those murdered in the gas chambers. They were marked for death in their turn. Indeed, their revolt was a response to the imminent threat of being deported and murdered.\n\nCut off from the rest of the camp, the Sonderkommando became objects of queasy fascination even before its liberation. Myths of them as unfeeling drunkards who had given up their humanity for a few more weeks of life circulated between prisoners, and were perpetuated afterwards.\n\nIn fact, their resistance to their \u201cwork\u201d went far beyond the last minute scramble to save their lives on October 7. They made efforts to record what they saw in photographs smuggled outside the camp and writings buried in the grounds of the crematoria. The photographs are the only ones taken of the extermination process within Birkenau. The writings, sometimes called the \u201cScrolls of Auschwitz\u201d, discovered between 1945 and 1980, show them to have been planning a revolt for months, but also to be agonisingly self-aware, and concerned with communicating their knowledge to the outside world.\n\nPost-war discussions of the Holocaust have had little to say about these writings, however. While few historians have said much about the Sonderkommando (with the major exception of Gideon Greif), literature and film have taken some interest, but in ways that serve to circulate the myths.\n\nSonderkommando stories\n\nIn some of the earliest novels in North America to address the Holocaust in the 1950s and 1960s, characters who are former members of the Sonderkommando function as archetypal survivors: psychologically damaged but also morally suspect. Holocaust survivors in general were often greeted with unease, facing questions of what compromises they had made and at whose expense. The Sonderkommando clearly stood for this moral dilemma more than any other figure.\n\nBy the 1980s, a very different set of ways of presenting the Sonderkommando arose. Greater knowledge of the specific details of the Holocaust produced more of a sense that the Holocaust was a uniquely total attempt to exterminate a people, and a concomitant belief that it tested the capacity of art to represent it.\n\nClaude Lanzmann placed one member of the Auschwitz Sonderkommando, Filip M\u00fcller, at the centre of Shoah (1985), his nine-and-a-half-hour documentary film about the \u201cfinal solution\u201d. For Lanzmann, M\u00fcller\u2019s story could only be told through testing the boundaries of film making, stretching it out almost beyond the limits of an audience\u2019s endurance. M\u00fcller\u2019s speech rhythms were slowed to a glacial pace, the spliced-in silences resonated with the emptiness of the landscapes over which it served as a voice-over.\n\nAnd Primo Levi devoted part of his essay \u201cThe Grey Zone\u201d (1986) to the Sonderkommando. For him too, silence was the only possible response. He urged readers to dwell on rather than pass over the Sonderkommando\u2019s situation, but argued that such meditation could only end in the impossibility of judging them.\n\nNew voices\n\nIn the 21st century, with the distance of time and a greater sense that it is possible to draw links between the Holocaust and other genocides and atrocities, the story of this group has become more readily tellable. The fiction film The Grey Zone (2001) and an X-men comic, for example, both dared to present narratives of their lives within the crematoria. But they did so by working with rather than against generic conventions, casting them as anti-heroes.\n\nAs these examples show, this new readiness to tell stories about the Sonderkommando does not mean that their voices are listened to. In Martin Amis\u2019s Zone of Interest, a fictional Sonderkommando quotes one real member\u2019s writings and calls them \u201cdisgusting\u201d. The first part of Sebastian Faulks\u2019s A Possible Life, a tale of a British POW who is forced to work in a camp crematorium, is based on a fake memoir.\n\nEven the far more thoughtful and impressive Son of Saul (2015), for all its formal strictures of filming, tells a story with a well-defined plot: one protagonist on a quest to bury one child. And this premise was adapted from an account recorded by Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli, who knew, but was not part of, the Sonderkommando.\n\nBut there are stories from the Sonderkommando themselves \u2013 found in the \u201cScrolls of Auschwitz\u201d \u2013 that show them mourning and memorialising relatives and friends, not as the traumatised, unfeeling automata of legend.\n\nZalman Gradowski dedicated the beginning of each section of his manuscript to the dead members of his family. Leyb Langfus powerfully recorded his own feelings of helplessness when he was unable to protect his son, devoting a chapter in his account of the extermination of his home town. Zalman Lewental, who recorded a history of the revolt, also took the time to list the names and even sketch out the personalities of those he saw as the main figures of the resistance. All of them devoted material and creative resources to conveying how they felt to future audiences, not simply to provide them with the necessary facts, but to allow their readers to gain insight into them as human beings.\n\nSo the increasing interest in the Sonderkommando should be taken as an opportunity to attend to the stories they themselves told, rather than simply placing them within easier, wider narratives."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/century/1940-1949/Story/0,,127738,00.html", "page_content": "The Military Court sitting here in judgment on Joseph Kramer and forty-four members of his staff at Belsen has had a surfeit of horror during the past fortnight, but for sheer ghastliness nothing has equalled the description given in evidence to-day of the gas chambers of Auschwitz, which were used as the chief instrument of Nazi policy for mass extermination of the Jews.\n\nThe prosecution put forward an unexpected witness in Charles Bendel, a Rumanian doctor resident in Paris for many years, who was arrested there in 1943 for not wearing the yellow star and was sent to Auschwitz. Here he worked at a crematorium as doctor to the special Kommando of prisoners required to dispose of bodies from the gas chamber and who were kept under lock and key lest details of what went on became known in the rest of the camp.\n\n80,000 wiped out\n\nDr. Bendel's was the whitest face in the courtroom as, speaking in French in almost a whisper, he described a normal day at the cremating places during a period when 80,000, composing the whole ghetto of Lodz, were being wiped out. Even some of the accused, let alone the many British officers and German civilians in court, seemed appalled at the horror of it all, and later on, with the brilliant arc lights over the dock switched on, Dr. Bendel came forward and with a disdainful wave of the hand identified Kramer and the S.S. doctor Klein as being in positions of responsibility at Auschwitz at the time.\n\nAt Berkenau, a sector of the main camp, there were, stated witness, four crematoriums, each equipped with two gas chambers. But their capacity became insufficient and an additional system was devised by digging large trenches, some 12 yards by six, in which the bodies were burned, and to expedite matters channels were cut at the bottom of the trenches to drain away the human fat.\n\nIt was part of his Kommando's work to prepare these pits each day by laying huge wood fires saturated with petrol, and by this system it was possible to dispose of one thousand bodies an hour as against one thousand a day in a crematorium.\n\nAt eleven o'clock in the morning, witness went on, the chief of the political bureau would arrive on his motor-cycle to say that a new batch of prisoners had arrived. There would be between 800 and 1,000 of them, some on foot and others, usually too ill to walk, in tip-up trucks, from which, to the amusement of the drivers, they were spilled out without warning. They were taken into the courtyard or, in winter, to a large hall of the crematorium and required to undress under the pretext that they were to take a bath followed by hot coffee.\n\nThen came a wait for the gas to arrive, said the witness. Raising his voice, he exclaimed that for a doctor the greatest insult was to have the cylinders delivered in a Red Cross ambulance in which, on occasion, he had seen the prisoner Klein.\n\nBlows at victims\n\nThen the doors of the two-roofed gas chambers would be opened and the victims, who by this time realised that they were going to their death, herded in with blows from whips and sticks. Finally the guards would succeed in locking the doors. \"You would hear cries and shouts as the people within began to fight against each other and to beat at the walls. This goes on for two minutes-then complete silence, nothing more.\"\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, said Dr. Bendel, the main task of the special Kommando began. With the opening of the doors the bodies, tightly jammed inside, would fall out. Often it was almost impossible to separate one from another and one had the impression that they had fought terribly against death. Anyone who had seen a gas chamber filled to a height of four feet with corpses would never forget it. before they were dragged by their wrists to the ghats, barbers and dentists would shear off the hair and go over the teeth.\n\nHell let loose\n\nAs for the Kommando, which might contain an electrical engineer from Budapest or a solicitor from Salonika, people who had human faces a few minutes before were no longer recognisable. It was hell let loose. \"They are like devils, no longer human beings as they drag the corpses away as fast as possible under a rain of blows from the S.S.\"\n\nAt the same time guards by the edge of the pits would go on shooting people for whom there had not been room in the gas chambers. After one and a half hours of it the work would be completed-a new convoy had been dealt with in crematorium No. 4.\n\n\"Who was commandant at Auschwitz at the time?\" asked Colonel Backhouse, prosecuting officer. \"Kramer,\" came the swift response.\n\nIt became apparent in cross-examination that a plot had been prepared by the Kommandos to destroy a crematorium. Women prisoners working in a munitions factory had attempted to pass on dynamite to them. In October 500 men revolted and tried to set fire to crematorium No. 3. Firearms were hidden in No. 1 crematorium, but through a misunderstanding were not used.\n\nThere was a touch of the macabre at the conclusion of to-day's hearing when Anita Lasker, a pretty German girl of nineteen, spoke of how she had played the 'cello in the camp orchestra at Auschwitz and from her quarters near the crematorium had watched bodies brought to the burning-pits."}, {"url": "https://www.jta.org/archive/nazi-forced-jews-to-sing-on-way-to-gas-chambers-witness-testifies", "page_content": "A description of how Jewish victims at Auschwitz were forced by an SS officer called \u201ca killer\u201d to sing songs while on their way to the gas chambers was given to the court here today as the trial of 22 former Auschwitz-Birkenau administrators and medical corpsmen continued.\n\nThe day\u2019s principal witness, Hermann H. Biermanski, who spent five years at Auschwitz, named Wilhelm Boger, one of the defendants, as the man who made the Jews sing on their way to their death. Boger, according to Biermanski, had \u201ca reputation as a killer\u201d even before he had been assigned to Auschwitz.\n\nWhile the mass trial of the 22 continued, Dr. Joachim Greiff, president of the Frank-furt Provincial Court, announced that a series of other major war crimes trials has been scheduled to open soon. On April 27, he said, Hermann Krumey and Otto Hunsche, both aides to the late Adolf Eichmann, will go on trial here. The indictment against Krumey alleges he was responsible for the death of 437, 402 Hungarian Jews. Hunsche is accused of having been Krumey\u2019s assistant. Hunsche is already serving a five-year prison sentence for complicity in the murder of Hungarian Jews.\n\nOn May 25, Dr. Greiff said, two more ex-Auschwitz officers will go on trial. One, Wilhelm Burger, will be charged with having procured the Zyclon-B gas used in the Birke au gas chambers for killing Jews. The second, Josef Erber, has been indicted for having selected prisoners for the Birkenau gas chambers. In addition, Dr. Greiff declare, two batches of 10 ex SS officers each will face separate trials for killing Hungarian Jews at Auschwitz. Still later, former Nazi police officers who had killed many thou-sands of Jews in Pinsk, in 1942, will face another count.\n\nAt Cologne, today, Werner Schnonemann, 52, a former SS officer, went on trial on charges of responsibility in the shooting of at least 3,197 Jewish men, women and children, as well as Soviet war prisoners, in Poland and Byelorussia, in 1941. He also faced a second charge of assisting in the shooting of another 800 Jews.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\n"}]}
