The club won 11 premierships, including a three-peat in 1915 to 1917 and back-to-back premierships in both 1919-20 and 1946-47.\n\nJust over 900 players have worn the famous black and gold since captain-coach Bob Graves led them out for their first match, and the list is littered with not only local legends but also some of the league\u2019s greatest ever players. Players like Paul Sironen, Benny Elias, Gary Jack, Keith Barnes, \u2018Chook\u2019 Fraser, Wayne Pearce, Steve Roach, Tim Brasher, Peter Provan, Tom Bourke, Sid Goodwin and Dennis Tutty need little or no introduction to league fans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nIt\u2019s now been 21 seasons since the finale Balmain Tigers game. How many of this team of Balmain players do you remember?\n\n1. Morvin Edwards\n\nAfter beginning his career in New Zealand, he came to the Tigers in 1993 after playing a couple of season in England. He played 26 games for the Tigers over the next two years before moving on to Penrith. He also played ten Tests for NZ.\n\n2. Ian Herron\n\nBorn in Ireland but raised in the St George district, Herron represented the Australian Schoolboys before making his first-grade debut for the Dragons in 1990. A prolific goal kicker with an unusual kicking style, he joined the Tigers for just one season in 1996, playing 12 games for the club. He then played for Parramatta and finished his career in England. He also represented Ireland on one occasion.\n\n3. Andy Currier\n\nCurrier was a strong running centre and excellent goal kicker who played over 300 games at the top level in his 15-year career in rugby league. Currier joined the Tigers in 1989 and played 23 first-grade games for the club over the next two years. He was the league\u2019s top point scorer in 1989. He also played two Tests for Great Britain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Geoff Starling\n\nStarling was a Balmain junior who had a meteoric rise when he made his first-grade debut for the club in 1971. A few months later he became the youngest player to be selected for Australia at 18 years and 178 days. Starling was a naturally gifted player and could do it all. He played 65 games for the Tigers between 1971 and 1974 and 11 Tests for Australia before his career was sadly ended at the age of 22 by Addison\u2019s disease.\n\n5. Larry Corowa, MBE\n\nNot big by the standard of today\u2019s outside backs, Corowa was an absolute speedster with great evasive skills. He came from the far north coast of New South Wales to the Tigers and made first grade in 1978. He played 96 games for the club over the next six years and scored 64 tries. He also played five games for NSW and two Tests for Australia. After eight years out of the game he played two first-grade games for the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1991.\n\n6. Tony Myler\n\nA legend at Widnes, Myler joined the Tigers for 13 games during the 1986 English off-season. An outstanding five-eighth when fully fit, he also played 14 Tests for Great Britain.\n\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\n7. Gary Freeman, MNZM\n\nFreeman was a fierce competitor and a Kiwi legend who loved nothing more than firing up the opposition no matter how big they were. After first playing in New Zealand and England, he joined Balmain in 1988 and played 51 games for the club over the next four years. He then moved on to the Roosters, Penrith and finally Parramatta before retiring at the end of the 1996 season. He played 45 Tests for NZ.\n\n8. Dennis Manteit\n\nA top-class forward, Manteit moved from the Brisbane competition at the age of 27 to join the Bulldogs for four years in 1970. He then transferred to the Balmain Tigers for three years in 1974 and played 43 first-grade games for the club. He also played 15 games for Queensland and three Test matches for Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Peter Boulton\n\nA Balmain stalwart, Boulton came from Grafton to join the Tigers in 1969 and stayed for the next seven years. He played 95 games for the club, including the victorious 1969 grand final, which was just his second first-grade game.\n\n10. Barry McTaggart\n\nHailing from Gympie in Queensland, McTaggart joined Balmain in 1969, winning a premiership in his first year with the club. The big, hardworking forward went on to play 59 games for the Tigers over the next four years before injuries curtailed his career. He also played one Test match for Australia.\n\n11. Glenn Morrison\n\nBig and mobile, Morrison played 324 games in his 16-year career and scored 96 tries along the way. He made his first-grade debut with Balmain in 1996 and played 41 games for the club over the next two seasons before moving to the North Sydney Bears, where he played in their final match in the big time in 1999. He then had stints with both the Cowboys and the Eels before finishing his top-level career in England.\n\n12. Trevor Ryan\n\nAn excellent back-rower or centre, Ryan came from northern NSW to the Tigers and made his first-grade debut for the club at the age of 18. He went on to play 136 games for the club over the next seven years before transferring to Newtown and then Wests. He ended up back at Balmain in 1982 and captained the side, playing another 23 games for the club. He played one game for NSW.\n\n13. Brian Lockwood\n\nAn English league legend who played over 440 top-level games in a 19-year career as well as 19 Tests for England and Great Britain. Hard as nails and also one of the best ball-players of all time, he joined Balmain in 1975 and played 43 games for the club over the next three seasons before returning to England.\n\n14. Neil Whittaker\n\nWhittaker began with his head in a scrum for Balmain in 1979 and ended up as the NRL\u2019s CEO in 1999. He was selected as first-grade hooker by the Tigers in 1979 and held that spot, playing 118 games over the next seven years, until eventually losing his place to Benny Elias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Adam Starr\n\nA big prop forward, Starr joined Balmain from the Roosters in 1996 and played 41 first-grade games for the club over the next four years. He went on to play with Redcliffe in the Queensland Cup competition.\n\n16. Steve Lavers\n\nLavers was one of the most feared defensive forwards of his day and didn\u2019t take any prisoners on the field. He played 92 games for Balmain between 1975 and 1982 and also one game for NSW.\n\n17. David Grant\n\nThere weren\u2019t many better forwards going around in the late 1970s and early 1980s than David Grant. A good ball runner and punishing defender, he played 50 first-grade games for the Tigers between 1978 and 1981 before heading to Canberra, where he captained their inaugural first-grade team in 1982. He was very unlucky never to play representative football. Sadly, Grant died of a heart attack at the age of 38."}, {"url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/from-the-archives-1922-north-sydney-s-easy-win-20220829-p5bdmo.html", "page_content": "L-R: Herman Peters, Chris McGrath, Geoff Hilder (trainer), Ted (\u2018Tappy\u2019) Taplin, and George Green.\n\nA neat set of passes along the three-quarter line gave Blinkhorn a chance, but, although he evaded Stapleton, F. Burge brought him down. A good run by Toohey was the next event of importance. He kicked when threatened by Horder, and then went on to tackle Proctor, who had caught the ball close to the line. Stapleton secured the ball from a kick-out and was thrown into touch near the corner post.\n\nNorth Sydney found relief from a free kick, but Ogle was given a chance a little later. He failed to control the ball, however, from a pass by Stapleton, who was showing dash in assisting to attack. A surprise try to North Sydney followed.

Stapleton next failed to take the ball from a short punt by Rule, who ran on, secured the hall again, and crossed for an easy try. Horder converted. North Sydney, 16 points to nil.\n\nA spurt by Glebe made the game interesting. Toohey, who was well watched by both Blinkhorn and Horder, and then F. Burge, well tackled by Pye, were conspicuous, but the speed of the North Sydney forwards enabled them to continually harass their opponents. Ives and Peters next raced through with the ball at their toes. Rushing past Stapleton, Peters picked up cleanly and scored a try, which Horder failed to convert.

There was just something about the Bears.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nOver 900 players represented the club in this time and they had their fair share of legends. Players like Greg Florimo, Ken Irvine, Ross Warner, George Ambrum, Gary Larsen, Don McKinnon and Les Kiss were legends of both the club and the game, but does anyone remember the guys who only briefly wore the red and black with pride?\n\nHere\u2019s a team made up of some of the forgotten Bears who played for the club since the mid \u201960s.\n\n1. Barry Glasgow\n\nGlasgow was a very good footballer, starting off with Wests where I recall him playing many fine games in the black and white, and then heading to Norths for four seasons from 1970, playing 32 games for the club.\n\nGlasgow was a field goal exponent and kicked 44 for Wests in 43 games, but only one for Norths after the field goal was reduced to only one point in 1970.\n\n2. Terry Butler\n\nButler was a pacey winger who also had success playing in the halves. He began his career in the QLD competition and was selected for QLD in one Origin game in 1983. He tried his luck in the big smoke in 1986 with the Bears but was only selected to play in four first-grade games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Keith Rugg\n\nRugg was a talented and versatile back who just never got his career off the ground. A member of the inaugural 1972 Australian Schoolboys team, he played seven games for Norths in 1979 before moving on to Illawarra and Parramatta, where he also failed to make an impact.\n\n4. Fred Ah Kuoi\n\nAh Kuoi was a very talented player with great speed and footwork and could play almost anywhere in the back line. He began his career in New Zealand before spending three years with the Bears from 1981, where he played 24 games in first-grade.\n\nHe then headed to England for a successful stint with Hull before returning to his junior club in New Zealand to play and coach. He played 28 internationals for New Zealand in an 11-year international career, captaining the side at the age of 22. Some player!\n\n5. Wade Horder\n\nHorder was a relative of the great Harold Horder and followed him onto the North Sydney wing in 1996. He played 16 games for the Bears over the next four seasons including their last ever first-grade match in 1999.\n\n6. Leo Toohey\n\nToohey was a very elusive and tough 5/8 who played nearly 140 first grade games in a ten-year career. Playing firstly with Parramatta and then Canterbury, Toohey came to the Bears in 1969 and played 36 first-grade games for the club over the next three seasons.\n\n7. Tommy Smales\n\nSmales was a very successful player, notching up nearly 400 top-level games in a 17-year career. He played for both England and Great Britain and his only foray into the Australian competition was a brief nine-game stint with the Bears in 1967.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Jim Mills\n\nBig Jim Mills was as hard and as tough as they come, and he had a long career at the top. He took no prisoners in an era when forward battles were open warfare.\n\nHe began his career in rugby union and then embarked on a 343 game League career over 16 seasons, including 37 games for the Bears across the 1970-1972 seasons. He was also selected many times for Wales and Great Britain.\n\n9. Rex Wright\n\nWright was one of only three players ever selected for the NSW origin team while playing in the country. He had one game for the Blues in 1984 and came to Norths in 1985 and played over 40 first grade games for the club over the next three years, before branching out as both a trainer and assistant coach following his retirement.\n\n10. Brian Norton\n\nNorton was a powerful and uncompromising forward with a great turn of speed for a big man. I recall him running nearly the length of the field to score a try at the SCG. A Norths junior, he began his first-grade career with the club in 1968 and played 40 games with them over the next three seasons.\n\nHe then headed to St George in 1971 before returning to Norths for his final season in 1975, playing another seven games in the top grade. He later coached Norths in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. They don\u2019t make them like that anymore.\n\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Dave Cooper\n\nCooper was a hard-working, mobile forward who played 114 first grade games in a 12-year career. After long stints with both Balmain and Cronulla, he came to Norths for his final season in the top grade in 1972, playing 18 games.\n\n12. Mick Tilse\n\nA big forward, Tilse has the remarkable distinction of playing 15 first-grade games and not winning one of them. Four of those games came with Norths in 1980, before he moved on to play with the Raiders for a continued run of losses.\n\n13. Wayne Chisholm\n\nChisholm was a very good player and played all but four of his 119-game first-grade career with South Sydney. Of the remaining four, he had two with Manly in his first season in 1984, and two with Norths in his last season in 1992.\n\nHe also has the \u201cdistinction\u201d of copping a ten-week suspension for tackling a referee in 1991. It was copybook.\n\n14. Mark Reber\n\nReber was a clever hooker who played over 40 games for the Bears across the 1995-1998 seasons, before heading off to try his luck in England where he played with Wigan for two more years.\n\n15. Harry Raven\n\nRaven was a versatile forward who played over 100 games for Balmain in a seven-year stint before joining Norths for just one season in 1966 where he played just six games in the top grade.\n\n16. Bruce Sinclair\n\nA rugged prop or second-rower, Sinclair played 89 games for four clubs in a ten-year career. He came to Norths from Balmain in 1989 and played 15 games for the Bears over the next two years. He had the talent to play many more games at the top level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. George Bartlett\n\nA mobile back-rower, Bartlett came to the Bears via the Eels in 1992 and played 19 games for the club over the next three seasons before heading to the Cowboys in 1995.\n\nSome other players from this era that you may have forgotten were Aub Le Brocq, Ricky Walford and John Vandenberg."}, {"url": "https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/12/14/nrl-2020-in-memoriam/", "page_content": "The rugby league world said goodbye to several well-known players, coaches, administrators and people associated with the sport in 2020.\n\nBrian James\n\n1943-January 10, 2020\n\nA high-quality winger for South Sydney who represented Australia at the 1968 World Cup before retiring at the age of 26.\n\nThe son of former Cootamundra Maher Cup prop Jack \"Swifty\" James, he came to rugby league via rugby union after attending Newington College and playing a season of first grade with the St George rugby club.\n\nHe switched to rugby league with St George in 1961 where he played centre and wing but top-grade opportunities were scarce in the Dragons\u2019 star-studded backline, so he made the decision to transfer to South Sydney in 1966.\n\nHe was quickly vindicated, playing more first-grade games in his first season with Souths (18) then he did in four years at St George (16). A winger of above average pace (he pursued professional sprinting in the off-season), James earned his first representative jersey with City Seconds in 1967 before making City Firsts the following year.\n\nHe progressed to NSW selection and then was named in Australia\u2019s 19-man squad for the World Cup. Although overlooked for the opening games he was given an opportunity in the pool match against France.\n\nAustralia won easily but James saw little of the ball and the chance to play his way into the top 13 for the final was lost. James played in four consecutive lower-grade grand finals with St George (winning all but one) before appearing in three first-grade deciders with the Rabbitohs.\n\nHe shared in Souths\u2019 triumphs over Canterbury in 1967 and Manly in 1968 but tasted defeat against Balmain in 1969. James retired soon after to pursue a career in transport and logistics.\n\nHe died on January 10 following an accident on his property at Capertee in central-western NSW.\n\nMark Harris\n\n1947-January 15, 2020\n\nMark Harris was a blockbusting centre who made his mark with Eastern Suburbs in the early 1970s and in 1974 helped secure the club its first premiership title in 29 years.\n\nHarris made a meteoric rise with the Roosters after being signed sight unseen by officials, who had heard of his exploits with the Kone Tigers in Port Moresby.\n\nHarris was a first-grader after only a handful of games in the lower grades at Easts and by the end of his first season was chosen in Australia\u2019s 1970 World Cup squad. A cousin of former Test prop Dud Beattie, Harris played on the wing in the brutal Cup final against Great Britain, won 12-7 by Australia at Headingley and figured in a second World Cup campaign in France two years later.\n\nHis career took a sudden detour in 1973 after his kicking abilities were identified by an American radio broadcaster who had undertaken a worldwide search for a kicker for the Boston Patriots NFL team.\n\nHarris tried out with the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles before landing a contract with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. Harris struggled to learn the nuances of the new code and was frustrated that his input was limited to taking kick-offs.\n\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Harris scores as Coote and Beetson split the Bulldogs\n\nHe returned to Easts in 1974 and resumed his centre partnership with former Wallaby John Brass. Under Jack Gibson\u2019s direction, Harris recaptured his rampaging attacking form and scored a crucial grand final try against Canterbury.\n\nA fractured leg in the preliminary final against Manly cost Harris the chance of back-to-back titles with Easts a year later but he continued to flourish at representative level and helped Australia to another World Cup title in 1977.\n\nAfter playing 195 first-grade games in a decade with Easts, Harris crossed the bridge to join North Sydney for the final two seasons of his career in 1980 and 1981. He died in Sydney on January 15 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nGreg Hawick\n\n1932-February 6, 2020\n\nEven before Greg Hawick played his first Test for Australia, he was described by former Test captain Len Smith as \u201cthe most competently versatile footballer the rugby league code has had since Jim Craig in the 1920s.\u201d\n\nIt was praise that the young South Sydney player lived up to over the next decade, featuring in four different positions in a 10-Test career for his country. Hawick displayed versatility from his earliest days as a footballer, alternating between lock and five-eighth at Gardener\u2019s Road Junior Technical School and even filling in at centre and wing when required.\n\nHe played primarily five-eighth for the Rabbitohs and occupied that role when Souths ended an 18-year premiership drought in 1950. But in his first three Tests for Australia he played five-eighth, lock and halfback to effectively cement his reputation as one of the game\u2019s great all-rounders.\n\nHe added a second premiership title with Souths in 1954 but injury cost him the chance of winning three more when he missed deciders in 1951 (broken jaw), 1953 (shoulder) and 1955 (knee). Hawick headed bush in 1957, joining Wagga Kangaroos and lifting the club from the doldrums to win back-to-back titles in 1962-63.\n\nIt was in 1957 that Hawick etched his name in the record books by booting 15 goals for NSW in a 69-5 demolition of Queensland. Hawick returned to Sydney in 1959 for two seasons with Norths but afterwards settled into country life.\n\nHis only foray back into the big smoke was an unedifying stint as North Sydney coach in 1985.\n\nNamed in South Sydney\u2019s all-time Dream Team in 2004 (on the bench) and in the NRL\u2019s Team of the 1950s in 2007 (at five-eighth), he died in Wagga Wagga on February 6, aged 87.\n\nDon Furner\n\n1932-February 24, 2020\n\nDon Furner was best known as the foundation coach of Canberra but his years with the Raiders were only part of the story of a remarkable lifelong contribution to the game.\n\nFurner\u2019s career began as a player in the Balmain juniors in the 1940s and culminated in selection for the Kangaroos in 1956 and a Test jersey against Great Britain.\n\nHis journey included stints at Toowoomba, where he shared in five consecutive Bulimba Cup titles in the annual triangular tournament with Brisbane and Ipswich, at Mackay and Mitchell in rural Queensland, along with Tumbarumba, Junee and Queanbeyan in southern NSW.\n\nFurner quit playing in 1966 but continued to coach Queanbeyan United, steering the club to five grand finals and three premierships. He took on the Eastern Suburbs coaching job in 1970 and guided a team that included Arthur Beetson and Ron Coote to the grand final in 1972.\n\nReturning to Queanbeyan, Furner coached representative teams including Monaro and Country Firsts and Seconds. The Raiders endured a tough initiation into the NSWRL competition but Furner built steadily, eventually enticing high calibre players Mal Meninga, Gary Belcher, Steve Walters and Peter Jackson to the club and, in partnership with Wayne Bennett, led the Raiders to their first grand final in 1987.\n\nFurner coached the Australian team on a second undefeated Kangaroo tour in 1986 and plotted Australia\u2019s defeat of New Zealand in the 1988 World Cup final.\n\nHe became Australia\u2019s chairman of selectors for a decade and coached Fiji at the 2000 World Cup. Furner\u2019s legacy at the Raiders was carried on by his sons David (200 first grade games) and Don jnr (CEO since 2007). Don snr passed away in Canberra on February 24, aged 87.\n\nDon 'Bandy' Adams\n\n1934-March 4, 2020\n\nA stockily built dairy farmer from Nelson Plains in the Hunter Valley, Adams was the star of Australia\u2019s 1956 home series win over New Zealand before he winged his way to England with the Kangaroos.\n\nHis chance at Test level came in the lead-up to the first Test against the Kiwis, when Newcastle\u2019s Brian Carlson injured a leg at training. Adams emerged the hero of a knife\u2019s edge contest at the Sydney Cricket Ground, scoring two tries in Australia\u2019s 12-9 win, including a long-distance match-winner with a minute to play.\n\nAfter seeing little of the ball in a forwards-dominated second Test in Brisbane, won 8-2 by Australia, Adams played another blinder in the third, crossing for a hat-trick of tries in a 31-14 cakewalk and guaranteeing his place among the Kangaroo tourists later in the year.\n\nAdams hit the ground running in England, scoring the first try of the tour, and four for the match against Liverpool. But his progress was slowed by a knee to a kidney at Barrow and despite finishing with 11 tries from 15 games, he played only the one Test against Great Britain and one against France.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where his big-time representative career ended. Adams came to Sydney with Country teams in 1957 and 1958 but after that he was content to stay in the Hunter where he turned from farming to work as a telephone linesman.\n\nAdams played 11 seasons with Maitland, before stints as player coach at Gloucester, Scone and Muswellbrook. His eldest son, David, later played first grade with Manly and Balmain. Don died at Scone on March 4 at the age of 86.\n\nTony Branson\n\n1946-April 1, 2020\n\nTony Branson took the ride of a lifetime in 1967, progressing from first grade at the Nowra Warriors all the way to a Kangaroo tour, where he scored a glorious try to set up Australia\u2019s Ashes victory at Swinton and then played all three Tests against the French.\n\nThe 20-year-old pivot was virtually unknown to Sydney crowds at the start of that season but after representing Group 7 and Southern Division, he played for Country Firsts and then NSW before beating no less a player than Bob Fulton for a place in the Kangaroo squad.\n\nHe signed on with St George after the tour. There he came face-to-face with another high-profile five-eighth, Phil Hawthorne, recruited from Wallaby ranks the same year. Branson admitted in a 2010 interview that he was blindsided by Hawthorne\u2019s signing and claimed he had no idea that he had signed with St George as a centre.\n\nBranson didn\u2019t have the speed for the position and although he tried hard to make a success of the role, his confidence and form suffered and he was eventually dumped to reserve grade. Branson stayed with the Dragons until 1973, playing 101 top grade games and appearing in the club\u2019s 1971 grand final loss to South Sydney.\n\nHe signed with Wollongong before returning to Nowra in 1977 and finally hanging up his boots. He died on April 1, aged 73.\n\nArthur Summons\n\n1935-May 16, 2020\n\nArthur Summons was never one to dwell on the disappointments that could have dimmed the great moments of a career of outstanding endeavour in two rugby codes.\n\nWell before he became the Western Suburbs and Australian captain and then one of the iconic figures adorning the game\u2019s premiership trophy, Summons enjoyed resounding success in rugby union. He played 10 Tests for the Wallabies, debuting against the Springboks in 1956 before touring the British Isles in 1957-58.\n\nHe made the decision to switch to league in 1960 and within two seasons he had become a dual international, playing the first of nine Test matches in his new code.\n\nSummons was appointed Test captain for the third Test of 1962, beginning an undefeated run of five Tests as skipper.\n\nIn 1963 he was selected as captain-coach of the Kangaroos touring team and even though a knee injury kept him out of the three Ashes Tests, he remained at the helm of the first all-Australian team to win the Ashes on British soil.\n\nHe played in three grand finals in five seasons with Western Suburbs, all of them ending in heartache at the hands of St George, the 1963 defeat hurt the most.\n\nIt was a controversial finish and involved a hint of scandal but for Summons there was a silver lining. The photograph snapped by Sun-Herald sharpshooter John O\u2019Gready just after the full-time siren proved to be a life-changer.\n\nHis muddy embrace with Dragons skipper Norm Provan became rugby league\u2019s most famous image, the basis for the game\u2019s premiership trophies since 1982 and led to a lifelong friendship with his former rival that was only broken by Summons\u2019 death on May 16.\n\nBobby Dimond\n\n1929-May 30, 2020\n\nThe passing of Bobby Dimond in a Gold Coast retirement home in May marked the end of an era. Dimond was the last surviving member of the 1948-49 Kangaroos, the first team to tour Great Britain and France after World War II.\n\nDimond was the baby of the tour, becoming only the second Kangaroo (after Charles \"Chook\" Fraser in 1911) to celebrate his 19th birthday while in England. Dimond failed to make the Test team but gained invaluable experience in 15 tour games, playing mostly as a winger and occasionally at centre.\n\nHe came into first grade at Dapto at the age of 16 and played his first senior representative football early in 1948, turning out for Country Firsts and NSW before sailing for England aboard the Maloja with his Kangaroo teammates later in the year.\n\nHe had begun to make his mark in Sydney football with Western Suburbs when he suffered fractures and a severe concussion in a motorcycle accident which ruled him out of the game for two years.\n\nHe attempted a comeback with St George in 1954 but fractured his wrist in a trial and after making a brief comeback at Kempsey in 1955, Dimond was selected for Country Seconds but was forced to withdraw with injury.\n\nDimond\u2019s younger brother Peter toured with the Kangaroos in 1963-64. Bobby was 90 when he died on May 30.\n\nNoel Kelly\n\n1936-June 14, 2020\n\n\"Ned\" was as rough and rugged as they come. Raised in rural Queensland, Kelly took to rugby league like he was made for it and stood his ground against the toughest opponents that played the game in his era.\n\nHe cut his teeth in the ultra-tough Bulimba Cup competition (Ipswich-Brisbane-Toowoomba) in the late 1950s, wore his first Australian jersey in 1959 and became a fixture in the Test line-up for a decade. He became the first front-rower to make three Kangaroo tours (1959-60, 1963-64 and 1967-68) and played 72 games for his country, including 28 Tests.\n\nIn club football, Kelly ensured that few teams enjoyed playing Western Suburbs as he dished out his own brand of punishment for nine seasons. He played 111 games of premiership football for Wests, a figure undoubtedly diminished by regular suspensions.\n\nHis top-level career wound up in 1969 before a brief stint as captain-coach at Wollongong. Kelly became non-playing coach of North Sydney from 1973-76 but apart from steering the Bears to a mid-week final, success proved elusive.\n\nHe remained heavily involved in the game, his character shining through as a panelist on Rex Mossop\u2019s Controversy Corner and he later rendered outstanding service to the Men of League organisation.\n\nIn 2008 Kelly was bestowed the ultimate honour when named in the Australian Rugby League Team of the Century, at hooker. He passed away on June 14 following a brief illness, aged 84.\n\nKeith Middleton\n\n1931-August 24, 2020\n\nKeith Middleton was still a teenager when he achieved his greatest moment in rugby league, throwing the final pass for the try that won the Ashes for Australia after a 30-year drought.\n\nOn any other day it would have been applauded as a slick, if regulation, backline movement but with the SCG a quagmire, the Ashes up for grabs and the match delicately balanced at 2-all, the pressure was intense.\n\nFrom an Australian scrum win, Keith Holman, Frank Stanmore and Doug McRitchie played their part before Middleton sent winger Ron Roberts galloping away for the match-winning try.\n\nMiddleton emerged from the NSW far south coast town of Bermagui, playing his early football as a half and five-eighth before shifting to centre when he joined North Sydney as a 17-year-old in 1948.\n\nHe was selected for Australia for the first Test in 1950 after only one representative game for City Seconds. Middleton\u2019s performances in all three Tests caught the eye of former Test captain Len Smith, who was convinced that the young centre was poised for a long representative career.\n\nApart from one further appearance for NSW, and a couple of games for City, he played no further rep football. By 1955 he announced his retirement to pursue a career as a building executive.\n\nHe made a brief comeback with South Sydney in 1956 before retiring for good at 25. He died at Miranda on August 24, aged 89.\n\nGary Parcell\n\n1933-November 30, 2020\n\nA farmer from Harrisville, a small rural hamlet 25km south of Ipswich, Gary Parcell gained fame as a rugged second-rower or prop in a 10-year career in which he represented Ipswich, Queensland and Australia.\n\nHe won a place in Ipswich Brothers\u2019 first-grade side as an 18-year-old in 1952. He played his first representative game the following season against the American All Stars and the first of 34 Bulimba Cup matches for Ipswich the same year.\n\nBy 1956 he emulated his father Perce Parcell when he was chosen for Queensland. Perce had represented the Maroons in two interstate games in 1924-25. Gary went on to surpass his father\u2019s tally, appearing 12 times in interstate matches and in three games against international opposition.\n\nParcell achieved a breakthrough year in 1959 when he helped the Maroons to a rare series victory over NSW (it turned out to be their last until the 1982 State of Origin series) and from there was chosen to tour with the Kangaroos.\n\nHe made his Test debut at Swinton in a 22-14 victory and went on to play in four of the six Tests on tour. He played his first Test on Australian soil against France in 1960, forming a famous all-Ipswich front row, along with Dud Beattie and Noel Kelly. The trio were part of Australia\u2019s World Cup squad in England later the same year. Parcell played his final Test in 1962.\n\nHis son Steve carried on the family tradition, representing Queensland Residents on a tour of France in 1989, while grandson Matt played NRL for Brisbane and Manly before forging a successful career in the English Super League.

He died on January 9, aged 85.\n\nManfred Moore\n\nAn American-born winger who played five first grade games for Newtown in 1977 but left an impression that lived on among supporters of the Jets and the wider league community.

The criteria for selection is:\n\n\u2013 No representing at senior level: internationals, State of Origin, Prime Ministers XIII, City vs. Country or All Stars.\n\n\u2013 Current players are excluded.\n\n\u2013 Players are only eligible for the club they played the most first-grade games for.\n\n\u2013 For players who straddle the 1970s and 1980s, 30 games after 1980 is generally the cut-off to qualify.\n\nThis time we move on to the extinct clubs. Firstly Norths, followed by Newtown, then a composite of the Super League casualties.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nNorths are an extremely solid side. They had a very good period in the 1990s before being cut and they never got much love in rep sides.\n\nFullback:\n\nPaul Conlon (98) 1985-1993. 47 wins 47 losses. 18 tries 89 goals 1 FG. 3 finals 1 win.\n\nPaul Conlon played his entire career with the Bears finishing just two games shy of 100 games. He would not have been as effective in today\u2019s game, given his shoulder charge was considered one of the best and once had Wally Lewis carried off as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConlon was a solid fullback in an improving era for the club and scored a try in their 1991 preliminary final loss to Canberra. He is a life member of the club.\n\nIn retirement, Conlon became a district court judge and chairman of the NRL judiciary. He resigned in 2014 in protest over a $50,000 fine handed down to Paul Gallen for some tweets criticising the governing body.\n\nWings:\n\nNigel Roy (117) 1995-1999. 63 wins 49 losses. 35 tries. 8 finals 2 wins.\n\nLismore-born Nigel Roy played a couple of seasons for Illawarra before spending 5 years at Norths and a final year in the doomed Northern Eagles joint venture. Roy was a durable winge,r playing over 20 games each season for the Bears.\n\nRoy played finals with the Bears for four years running, including scoring a try as the club went down in the 1997 preliminary final to eventual premiers Newcastle by just five points.\n\nAfter over 150 first-grade games, Roy moved to England and played over 100 games for the London Broncos. In retirement, Roy has stayed heavily involved with rugby league, running the game in the Northern Territory for many years before becoming the Illawarra Rugby League\u2019s Operations Manager in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew Simons (106) 1982-1988. 51 wins 51 losses. 36 tries 2 goals. 2 finals 2 losses.\n\nLocal junior Andrew Simons played 7 seasons for Norths in the 1980s appearing in their 1982 finals campaign. He finished off with two seasons at Penrith for a total of 133 first-grade matches and 50 career tries. While at Penrith he played all games in the 1989 season, scored in each of the first six rounds and played finals for the second time.\n\nSimons also wrote two Crowd articles on the Roar in 2012.

Adam was a solid centre, a leader who captained the club and had a knack for taking intercepts. Adam played in the club\u2019s 1982 finals series and is a life member of the club after also serving on the board and as a selector.\n\nHe was also a solid cricketer having captained the NSW Colts. Adam qualified as a solicitor in 1979 and in retirement became the first President of the Players Association. He is the managing partner of Marsdens Law Group\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Caruana (108) 1992-1997. 65 wins 36 losses. 38 tries. 8 finals 3 wins.\n\nChris \u201cSmoke\u201d Caruana was a very good player in an extremely strong North Sydney team in the 1990s, as demonstrated by his win-loss percentage above. In 6 seasons with the Bears, Caruana played in three preliminary finals, but the club never quite reached that elusive grand final. Caruana\u2019s best years were 1996 and 1997 when he scored 23 tries in 47 matches.\n\nAfter leaving Norths Caruana spent a final three seasons with Souths (both before and after their removal from and readmission to the competition) before retiring with over 150 first-grade games to his name.\n\nUnfortunately in retirement Caruana has fallen on hard times at various stages and has struggled with physical and mental health issues.\n\nFive-eighth:\n\nMitchell Cox (75) 1982-1985. 36 wins 38 losses. 15 tries 6 FG. 2 finals 2 losses.\n\nMitchell Cox was rugby royalty when he switched codes to join North Sydney in 1982. His father and brother had both represented the Wallabies and Cox himself played three union tests on the 1981-82 Tour of Great Britain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his first year in the new code in 1982, Cox won the Dally M five-eighth of the year as he took Norths to the finals for the first time since 1965. He had another solid season in 1983 as the club just missed the finals, but struggled in the next two seasons following a bout of hepatitis and the emergence of a young Cliff Lyons (was he ever young?) and left for Manly in 1986.\n\nCox had a good first season with the Sea Eagles as they played finals in 1986, but struggled in 1987 when replaced again by Cliff Lyons, who had followed him to the club) and retired.\n\nCox also kicked the only 3-point drop goal in the history of rugby league, in a match against Newtown in 1982. In the act of kicking the field goal, Cox was fouled by opposing number Ken Wilson. The field goal was successful plus the ref awarded the Bears a penalty right in front, which was put over by John Gray.\n\nDon McKinnon on Cox: \u201cFunniest bloke I\u2019ve ever met. Completely irresponsible. Always played great footy. Quick. Great defender.\u201d\n\nHalf:\n\nMark Soden (170) 1989-1999. 100 wins 66 losses. 28 tries 1 goal 1 FG. 11 finals 3 wins.\n\nNext up we have a beauty: Mark Soden. He is the only player in this team to have registered 100 wins for the club, the next best being only 65. Soden played 11 seasons for the Bears, participating in five finals series in the 1990\u2019s without ever making a grand final. He retired after Norths\u2019 last ever NRL match after not being picked up by the Northern Eagles merged club and played and coached park footy on the Northern Beaches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoden played half for the club in the early 1990s before switching to hooker in 1994. I have a gun hooker in this side and not a lot of halves, so Soden goes back to his half days here.\n\nSoden on the demise of North Sydney as a top-level club: \u201cI have four boys and they can never go watch an NRL game and say \u2018my Dad was a part of this club\u2019, that\u2019s what makes me sour\u201d. He is a life member of the club.\n\nLock:\n\nAlan \u2018Frank\u2019 Burns (95) 1981-1985. 42 wins 49 losses. 24 tries. 2 finals 2 losses.\n\nLocal junior Alan Burns played 5 seasons for North Sydney in the early 1980s, including during their 1982 finals appearances. He also played an off-season for Wakefield in 1983-84 and finished his career with a season at Wests in 1986 to get him to 100 career first-grade games.\n\nFrom Don McKinnon (todaystale.com): \u201cNerdiest footballer I\u2019ve ever met in my life.

He played in three straight finals series between 1994 and 1996. He played mostly off the bench as an impact forward.\n\nAfter leaving the Bears Wilson played a season each with The South Queensland Crushers and with Illawarra. He then finished in England with Gateshead and Hull FC.\n\nOddly for a forward Wilson was a bit of a field goal specialist, potting 9 during his career, despite never kicking a goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFred Teasdell (112) 1983-1988. 50 wins 60 losses. 14 tries.\n\nFred \u201cMercury\u201d Teadell\u2019s father Bill played for the Bears in the 1960s, but Fred spent his first three seasons with local rivals Manly. After moving to Norths in 1983 Teasdell cemented a first-grade position and played six seasons with the Bears, captaining the club at various stages.\n\nAfter leaving North Sydney, Teasdell moved around a bit. In 1988 he spent a season in France with Villa France de Rouergue. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve been kicked, gouged, head-butted, grabbed in the Christmas hold and spat at\u2026I\u2019ve never seen anything like the last four weeks, I\u2019ve just felt like getting away\u2026It\u2019s a lovely place and the people are great but I have to worry too much about survival\u201d.\n\nOn returning to Australia, Teasdell continued to play in the lower tiers and captained the Newtown Jets from 1991 leading them to a Metropolitan Cup premiership in 1992. After that, he moved to the Gold Coast and coached the Bilambil Jets to back-to-back A Grade Premierships.\n\nTeasdell retired to the Gold Coast and like a true Norther Beaches boy, was part of a surfboard club at Rainbow Bay while selling poker machines for a living.\n\nProps:\n\nSteve Trindall (94) 1996-1999. 53 wins 38 losses. 3 tries. 7 finals 2 wins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWee Wah born Steve Trindall play 11 years and 172 matches of first grade from his debut for Canberra in 1993. Four of those seasons were spent with North Sydney as well as another two in the ill-fated Northern Eagles joint venture. These six years were Trindall\u2019s most productive, playing over 20 games each season, scoring all of his career 6 tries and appearing in three finals series including two preliminary finals with the Bears.\n\nAfter the Northern Eagles fell apart, Trindall joined another joint venture, the Wests Tigers, where he played for two largely unremarkable seasons before heading off to England. There he played for three seasons with the London Broncos under former teammate Tony Rea, before spending a further two years in their second division with the Whitehaven Warriors.\n\nAdrian Toole (131) 1985-1995. 56 wins 67 losses. 8 tries. 5 finals 2 wins.\n\nOne-club player Adrian Toole played 11 seasons for the Bears from 1985. Toole played in the club\u2019s 1991 preliminary final loss to Canberra and also appeared in their finals series in 1994 and 1995 (his last game for the club). He also won a reserve grade grand final in 1993. He is a life member of the club.\n\nToole was a soccer player in his hometown of Forbes before becoming a prop in the NRL. He was also the subject of the mighty \u201cToooooole\u201d call resounding around North Sydney Oval.\n\nHooker:\n\nTony Rea (120) 1988-1994. 59 wins 55 losses. 14 tries 14 goals 1 FG. 3 finals 1 win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Rea was one of the smarter players running around. After playing in Brisbane for Brothers from 1984 and winning a premiership in 1987 he joined the exodus of Brisbane players in 1998, landing at Norths. By 1989 he was captaining the club culminating in leading them to a preliminary final in 1991.\n\nRea left Norths in 1995 after well over 100 games with the club. He then built a long-term career in England with the London Broncos as a player, CEO head coach and Director. He also worked as a commentator in England.\n\nIn 2011-2012 Rea also coached the ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby. They did not do well and Rea was not impressed, in 2011 giving one of the all-time sprays to his own team and club \u201cWe are just a mob without any fight in us when it gets tough, even if we win\u2026 We have just too many people and an organisation that makes too many soft decisions \u2026 it\u2019s in the wood now.\u201d Asked if the side could lift for their last five matches of the Super season, Rea replied: \u201cNo, no chance.

While at Wests he had the distinction of scoring the last ever try at Pratten Park, in 1985. McArthur could play anywhere in the backline and featured in two finals series for the Bears from the bench. This included scoring a try in their 1991 preliminary final loss to Canberra. McArthur also topped the tryscoring for the club in 1993.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Cross (94) 1979-1986. 41 wins 50 losses. 4 tries. 2 finals 2 losses.\n\nPeter Cross was a one-club player for the Bears in the 1980s. He earned a permanent first-grade position in 1982 as the Bears made their first finals series since the mid-1960s. His brother Greg played a few games for Manly and his father, the late Barry Cross was a highly respected referee who acted as a touch judge up to international level. He was a brave ref, sending off England and Cronulla half Tommy Bishop at Endeavour Field in 1973.\n\nCourtesy of Todaystale.com, here are some comments from Norths stalwart Don McKinnon on Cross: \u201cWould walk around with a vacant grin on his face. He came to training once with his hand bandaged. We said, \u2018What\u2019d you do?\u2019 He said \u2018I got electrocuted today at work\u2019. I asked \u2018You got an electric shock?\u2019 He said, \u2018No I got electrocuted and they had to resuscitate me and bring me back to life\u2019. He was dead on the ground. He worked for Sydney Council in the wires. He clutched one of them, fell down and died. But they brought him back. That night he came to training. People might ask, Is he really dumb or really tough?

Unusually for a halfback, Martin had to do the nudie run that year, scoring exactly zero points from 22 games.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Martin had been shunted to lock and hooker as a young Greg Florimo came through and he left for Newcastle and then North Queensland, where he captained the club during an injury-ravaged 1995.

Geoff is North Sydney first grade player number 439\n\nAt the age of 26 he returned to Uralla and continued to play in the Armidale competition with great distinction in local and representative cricket.\n\nLet\u2019s find out more about Geoff journey in the game\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Wood batting at SCG No2\n\nWhat year you were born?\n\n1953\n\nCan you remember you first game of cricket?\n\nI think in my last year in primary school the team was short one Saturday and I was asked to fill in. My only recollection was that I volunteered to be the wicket keeper, my first and last time.\n\nTell us briefly about your cricketing journey?\n\nI played junior cricket for Uralla (my home town) before moving into senior cricket. I played my first A grade game when I was 15. Incidentally Walter Taylor who had a piece written about him on \u2018stump to stump\u2019 scored his last century and I scored my first in the same match in my second season in A grade in the Armidale District Cricket Association competition.\n\nI then played in various representative games including trips to Tasmania and New Zealand with the Northern NSW Colts (Emus) before representing NSW Country 1sts v\u2019s City on 2 occasions at the SCG.\n\nI started with North Sydney in the 1973/74 season. Along the way I made 2 overseas trips with the Emu Club, one to Malaysia/Singapore and a World Tour in 1974.\n\nI returned to Uralla in 1979 and except for a few seasons with the Armidale club Hillgrove I finished my career where I started.\n\nI played a number of representative country zone matches after returning home including a game against the touring New Zealand side involved in the infamous underarm incident. A couple of years later I played a game against their \u201dA \u201cside which included a number from that match (they were still wearing their one day uniforms) plus fringe Test players. I managed to scramble 60 odd against them and was reminded of sportsmanship on more than one occasion.\n\nGeoff Wood batting against Tasmanian Colts team\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you moved to Sydney you chose to play with North Sydney Cricket Club. Why did you choose North Sydney?\n\nRo Shelton, who I knew through the Northern NSW Emu Club and who I played against in the City v Country games as well as Ken Shine (also an Emu) were at North Sydney and were a good country connection. Fellow Emus Tim Wooster and Billy Crane from Tamworth came to North Sydney the year after.\n\nAt what age did you make your first grade debut in grade cricket in Sydney?\n\nI was fortunate to be selected in first Grade when I came to Sydney from the country. I was 20 and still eligible for Poidevin Gray under 21 competition.\n\nWhat can you remember about your debut and can you recall how you performed?\n\nI remember getting an inside edge of Gary Gilmour for not many, single figures. Other recollections were Peter Toohey scoring 80 or 90 wearing rubber spiked batting gloves and Gary Gilmour hitting Kerry O\u2019Keefe for a couple of sixes out of the ground. We had to leg someone over the fence to retrieve the ball and then realised he would have to pay to get back into the ground as you had to pay to watch grade cricket in 1973.\n\nPeter Toohey\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next couple of games I scored a couple of 30\u2019s and then a 60 odd against a strong Balmain side containing Dave Renneberg ,Tony Steele as well as a number of state representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can share with our audience, how would you describe yourself as a cricketer?\n\nEssentially a batsman until I returned to the country when I bowled a bit of straight off spin.\n\nWhat were your strengths as a player?\n\nAll my early cricket was pre helmet (not much hooking) and generally as an opening bat. Most quicks (especially Sydney) tended to bowl short of a length outside off-quite often without mid-off and mid-on and fairly square fields. So the square cut was often used even though you hung in there hoping for a ball to drive.\n\nWhat was your highest score in senior cricket?\n\nI scored 152 for Northern NSW Colts against Tasmanian Colts in Hobart.\n\nWhat were your best bowling figures in senior cricket?\n\nI recall taking 7 for about 26 in a country inter council match-big wicket hauls were few and far between most of the time for me. However in a Tooheys Cup match (promotional country matches which included several state or Australian reps.) I managed to get the 3 international opposition players out.\n\nWho were some the best fast bowlers you have played against?\n\nI was fortunate to play against all the NSW based international players in the 70\u2019s including Len Pascoe, Dave Colley, Geoff Lawson and Dave Renneberg.\n\nEvery batsman had a Thommo story through that period. In one game we had managed to beat Bankstown on the first innings however Jeff Thomson needed to prove his fitness before the selectors after injury. Our captain Ross Collins decided that I would benefit from a hit out at the top of the order. Thommo wound it up a few knots from the first innings and somehow I survived his 6 or 7 overs with plenty of encouragement from the Bankstown fieldsmen. (I\u2019m sure they were closer to the boundary fence than the wicket). Just after he was taken off I managed to get run out at the bowlers end with a throw from fine leg.\n\nOn another occasion we were scheduled to play Andy Roberts (Sutherland) however the match was washed out\u2026disappointing!\n\nJeff thomson\n\n\n\n\n\nWho were the best spinners you have played with or against?\n\nAll the NSW based spinners that played for Australia in the 1980\u2019s I played against in Grade cricket. However the one I thought deserved higher honours that I played against in the 70\u2019s was David Hourn. In a Country v City match on a slightly damp SCG pitch he was almost unplayable.\n\nKerry O\u2019Keefe was the incumbent State and Australian spinner and I only played with him on a few occasions(I managed to run him out at Rushcutters on one of his rare appearances for Norths). I was always impressed by our 2 spinners at North Sydney, Ro Shelton and Tim Wooster.\n\nDennis Hourn\n\n\n\n\n\nWho were the best 3 batsman you\u2019ve played against?\n\nI was fortunate to play against all the NSW based test players through the seventies. Also this time coincided with World Series Cricket so there were a few extra stars playing grade at that time. This included 3 Test captains(plus a couple of English- Mike Gatting and Tony Greig)\n\nI had a lot of respect for Rick McCosker as he came from the same country area and I played with and against him on a number of occasions.\n\nThere was newspaper article written criticising some of the Test players performances in grade so Alan Turner came out on the following Saturday against us and got 99.\n\nHowever the batsman I enjoyed playing against and watching bat was John Benaud. It wasn\u2019t just his batting style but the overall way he played his cricket, I was almost disappointed when he was dismissed.\n\nJohn Benaud\n\n\n\n\n\nWho played the best innings you\u2019ve seen firsthand playing with or against?\n\nI batted with Mark Hope at Bankstown Oval and against a great attack including Jeff Thomson he scored an 80. I was amazed how easy he made it look\n\nWas there any bowler in particular who for whatever reason always seemed to cause you a few problems?\n\nFor reasons I could not work out I had trouble batting against Mick O\u2019Sullivan \u2013a left hand spinner from Sydney Uni.\n\nCan you recall a time when you thought, wow, this is a step or two up from what you were used to in grade cricket and you really had to knuckle down to survive?\n\nThere are 2 occasions. Firstly I went to Brisbane when I was a raw sixteen year old to play in the Qld Country week. In one game I came up against the 2 opening bowlers and really struggled with the pace and swinging ball. I was to learn after that the bowlers were Ross Taylor who had opened the bowling for NSW and Geoff Dymock who went on to represent Qld and Australia.\n\nThe second occasion and probably a little on reflection were the two City v Country games.\n\nFive players from those games went on to represent Australia and many more for NSW and Qld. Jeff Thomson managed to half volley the second or third ball into the sight screen in the first match then David Hourn weaved his magic on a slightly damp wicket. While we were beaten soundly in the first match the second was pretty competitive. I managed a 40 the first year and a 50 odd the second.\n\nWho was the best wicket keeper you\u2019ve seen firsthand playing with or against?\n\nI played with Steve Rixon in a Country v City match and then a few times in the Tooheys country matches and he deserved his international recognition. Two others who I thought were great keepers that I played Colts cricket with were Michael Cox who played for Gordon in Sydney then onto the WA shield team and Alan Campbell was the other who had a long distinguished career in Sydney Grade with a couple of clubs.\n\nWho was the best captain you had the good fortune to play with?\n\nRoss Collins and Ro Shelton were my 2 first grade captains at Norths and both did an admirable job. I played a season with Doug Cole and we won a second grade premiership against Manly, 2 teams that were essentially first grade teams.\n\nDoug\u2019s only \u201cblemish\u201d for the season was when we were playing Gordon at North Sydney and were dismissed for a paltry 140.\n\nGordon were 2 for 130 and Doug decided that it was time for me to try my leg spinners which I dabbled with in the nets.\n\nMick Falk, who\u2019d scored a brilliant 100 against our Emu side in England playing for Sevenoaks was my first victim and I got another in that over.\n\nI was getting ready for my second and Doug took me off and brought back our frontline bowlers who cleaned up the rest for an amazing victory. In the season statistics I was mentioned as also bowled 1 over, 1 maiden, 2 wickets for no runs.\n\nWho was the umpire you had admiration for?\n\nIn my second last match in Sydney our opponents were Waverly played at Waverly. They batted first and scored a reasonable total, around 300. After a hot dry week we turned up the following Saturday to a fairly wet track. There was a friendly rivalry between the state squad members to the outcome of the match.\n\nThroughout the afternoon I chatted to umpire Tom Brooks, the former Test umpire. We discovered through the course of events that he knew my hometown Uralla very well and had indeed spent considerable time on a neighbouring property to ours in an army camp through WW2. Billy Crane and I managed a sizable partnership and we won the match.\n\nWhen I reached three figures he quietly congratulated me which I was very chuffed about.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has been your funniest team mate?\n\nI probably couldn\u2019t go past my Country teammate Jeff Thatcher. We mostly played against each other in country zone matches and these games went over a couple of days requiring an overnight or two stay. It was not unusual to book into a pub or motel and find someone had tampered with the bookings and find yourself stuck with the opposition party animal\u2019s intent of ensuring you got minimum sleep.\n\nIn a Country v City match Thatch and I roomed with a young player from the Riverina. On the morning of the second day we got up and had breakfast and the cabs had arrived to take us to the SCG.\n\nWe grabbed our gear, got to the ground and warmed up and realised we had left our roommate asleep back at the motel. We tried the phone in the dressing room and only managed to get the scoreboard. I was to learn a couple of years later that our roommate decided to follow an AFL career and won a couple of Premierships in Melbourne.\n\nCan you recall some banter or an exchange on the cricket field that still makes you laugh today?\n\nMy Emu teammate Bill Hutchinson was very frustrated in a match I played against him when I managed to hit some boundaries past a couple of strategically placed fieldsman. He turned to me and said \u201cyou\u2019ve got more arse than a toilet seat\u201d. I generally tried to ignore any sledging.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing dismissal in senior cricket?\n\nIn my last match in Sydney against the old Sydney Club at Rushcutters I managed to be dismissed three times on no balls. When eventually dismissed in unusual circumstances I mentioned to the bowler, who\u2019d also been involved in the no balls, (I think Dave Chardon), as I left the field that you couldn\u2019t help bad luck. His reply was unprintable.\n\nWho are the three sports people in the world you\u2019d most like to meet?\n\nSerena Williams, Tiger Woods and Virat Kohli.\n\nWho\u2019s your favourite cricket commentator?\n\nI\u2019m showing my age but Alan MacGilvray. I grew up listening to him and he remained my favourite.\n\nAlan McGilvray\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was your favourite ground to play at?\n\nI always had a bit of success at Manly. I watched a couple of games there when I was a kid and thought it would be great to play there. Manly had good bowling attacks, Jeff Macpherson (who took 9 for one day) ,Graeme Beard, Mick Pawley, Terry Lee and Brian Kinsey and I was lucky enough to get a 100 there in the second grade grand final. I was fortunate to play at both the SCG and SCG No2 a fair bit when North Sydney Oval was being redeveloped.\n\nGeoff Wood batting at Manly Oval\n\nWhat\u2019s have been some of your funniest moments in cricket?\n\nThere are three that come to mind.\n\nOn the Emu World tour playing in Bahrain in the desert opening batsman Lindsay Mulligan called for drinks before he faced a ball. (It was 50 degrees plus and sand for as far as you could see.)\n\nPlaying Northern District at North Sydney, Neil Marks decided to answer the call of nature at a drinks break. Someone \u201caccidently\u201d locked the gates to the dressing sheds while he was gone and while all (including umpires) found it amusing Marksy didn\u2019t see the funny side.\n\nIn a country zone match which are often used as a stepping stone to higher honours, the same applies to umpires. In one particular match we had a Canberra based umpire appointed. At the conclusion of the match he congratulated us on a very competitive match but played in amazingly good spirit and asked could he join us for a drink afterwards.\n\nIt turned out that not only did he make a few extra dollars umpiring but was a part time magician. As the night wore on the tricks were coming thick and fast and David Jurd (ex Petersham) was a master (or tried to be) of one up manship. Our umpire friend procured from the bar person a broom and ordered a schooner. He took a couple of drinks and proceeded to balance the glass on the broomstick (much to the trepidation of the barperson) and raised it to the ceiling where he asked Jurdy to hold it while he prepared for the second part of the trick. He promptly left and Jurdy was left holding the stick not game to move. He did come back to the relief of Jurdy and the bar person.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the best win you\u2019ve been involved with?\n\nProbably our second grade premiership win against Manly. I was able to get some runs to contribute plus I had a good season overall run wise. Towards the end of Manly\u2019s innings chasing our score, captain Doug Cole had 10 vice captains offering advice\n\nWho are the three players from your playing days at the top of the list for a Saturday afternoon barbeque?\n\nThe first two people I met when I went to North Sydney were Chris Elder and Reg Reber. Over the next few seasons they introduced a na\u00efve country kid to the bright city lights.\n\nJohn Moran and I went to college together in Armidale. While he was affectionately called Jack at Northern Districts his nickname at college was \u201cknuckles\u201d and I had a lot of trouble convincing his mother that it wasn\u2019t because of his fighting ability.\n\nIn a game we played against each other Pete Villama bowled me a half tracker and I hit it like a rocket at John/Jack at short gully. He hit the deck however to the relief/disappointment of myself and relief/joy of his teammates he managed to get his hand in front of his face and the ball stuck.\n\nSydney Grade Cricket scoreboard - Geoff Wood 106 for North Sydney against Waverley\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\nLike many ex cricketers \u2013golf. I try to play at least once a week.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve received?\n\nMy grandfather told me \u201cnot many people get caught out hitting the ball along the ground\u201d.\n\nWhat is your occupation?\n\nWhen I left Sydney I came back to the family farm which has grown a bit over the years. My two sons now run the property and I help out occasionally. At present, together with a few neighbours we\u2019re involved in the development of a large scale solar farm-720 mega-watt (New England Solar Farm) being constructed by UPC/AC Renewables.\n\nAre you still involved in cricket?\n\nI played a bit of veterans/vintage/golden oldies cricket and was lucky enough to go on 5 overseas tours to various carnivals/competitions. These trips were to Sri Lanka, England/Scotland, South Africa, South America and India/Nepal/ Malaysia. You can meet some interesting people on the cricket field, Head of the British Inland Revenue, Bobby Charlton the English world cup soccer star, David Tenant (Dr Who) umpired a game and in Columbo we played a Kiwi team made up of ex All Black Rugby players. A couple of knee replacements has put an end to this.\n\nIf you were running a State Cricket Association what would your 2 priorities to ensure cricket in the state remained strong and successful on and off the field?\n\nI\u2019ve been out of the loop too long to offer any constructive suggestions. However from observation the exposure of playing with and against the Test and State players at grade level is no longer there and I believe cricket to be poorer for it. I understand the demands on the elite players across all formats of the game and am not sure if there is any ready solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/geoff-griffin-dies-aged-67-268860", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler who was effectively no-balled out of Test cricket, has died in Durban aged 67\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Griffin in action during the 1960 tour of England which was the start and end of his international career \u00a9 Cricketer International\n\nGeoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67. Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nHe returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career was over after he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury."}, {"url": "https://www.northsydneybears.com.au/roar-top-ten-north-sydney-players/", "page_content": "This article originally appeared on www.theroar.com.au on Satur\n\nLet us know what you think about this top ten on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Google+.\n\nWith all the talk of the North Sydney Bears potentially coming back into the competition after nearly twenty years of hibernation, it\u2019s time for their top ten players to be revealed.\n\nWant to help keep the Bears going strong?

Neil Whittaker\n\nWhittaker began with his head in a scrum for Balmain in 1979 and ended up as the NRL\u2019s CEO in 1999. He was selected as first-grade hooker by the Tigers in 1979 and held that spot, playing 118 games over the next seven years, until eventually losing his place to Benny Elias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Adam Starr\n\nA big prop forward, Starr joined Balmain from the Roosters in 1996 and played 41 first-grade games for the club over the next four years. He went on to play with Redcliffe in the Queensland Cup competition.\n\n16. Steve Lavers\n\nLavers was one of the most feared defensive forwards of his day and didn\u2019t take any prisoners on the field. He played 92 games for Balmain between 1975 and 1982 and also one game for NSW.\n\n17. David Grant\n\nThere weren\u2019t many better forwards going around in the late 1970s and early 1980s than David Grant. A good ball runner and punishing defender, he played 50 first-grade games for the Tigers between 1978 and 1981 before heading to Canberra, where he captained their inaugural first-grade team in 1982. He was very unlucky never to play representative football. Sadly, Grant died of a heart attack at the age of 38."}, {"url": "https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1993/balmain/summary.html", "page_content": "Players\n\n* Greyed out numbers in the table below indicate that the corresponding data is incomplete.\n\nAge is sorted on both years and days.

Garry Jack\n\nKnown for his barnstorming kick returns that normally broke the first line of defence, Jack was calm under pressure and had an all-round game. He was the best fullback in the world from the mid to late \u201980s, which amounted to a Golden Boot win.\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\n2. Arthur Patton\n\nThe Port Kembla flyer was an outstanding winger who captained Balmain to a premiership victory in 1944. He played a game on a broken leg, which was amazing for a winger who predominantly needed to run. He was the first Balmain player to 100 tries and retired as their greatest ever try scorer.\n\n3. Tim Brasher\n\nHe made his debut while still in high school. Brasher was effective anywhere in the outside backs. His 1996 season was extraordinary as he was the driving force in a weak Balmain team that almost made the finals. His two try-saving tackles in the 1992 State of Origin decider proved vital in giving the Blues a close series win.\n\n4. Ellery Hanley\n\nHe was perhaps the best import from England. The impact Hanley brought to Balmain was measurable. He had good form in 1988, when he scored so many crucial tries and helped them make the grand final. He was knocked out cold by Terry Lamb in the grand final. His pace coupled with strength made him a true game breaker. I wish he stayed in Australia for a longer period of time.\n\n5. Keith Barnes\n\nHe was nicknamed \u2018Golden Boots\u2019 as he was the best goal kicker of his era. His gritty defence and courage gave the Balmain sides a real hardened edge, which saw them grind out many games as close games. He captained Australia in 1959. He kicked ten out of 11 goals against Leeds, however his game-winning conversion from 57 metres out against St George will go down as one of the best clutch conversions ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Olsen Filipaina\n\nHe was a pioneer for Polynesian players as he was perhaps their first big star. Filipaina wasn\u2019t consistent, however, as he was dropped to reserve grade and still played for New Zealand. When he was on, he was such a damaging ball runner that had a great bump off. He was so strong so he couldn\u2019t be tackled easily. Also he put on some brutal hits. He was such an iconic figure in New Zealand rugby league.\n\n7. Arthur Halloway\n\nHe was a part of NSW\u2019s first ever game. He was halfback in Balmain winning five straight grand finals. His vision and passing gave his backs opportunities to score. He was so tough he had his finger amputated on the morning one day, and later that afternoon he led his team to a victory with a bloody bandage.\n\n8. Kerry Hemsley\n\nHe was a cult hero. His moustache and long flowing hair made him a fan favourite. He was a true enforcer who came up with a play in attack or defence to change the momentum of the game.\n\n9. Ben Elias\n\nHe revolutionised the way hookers play. He was one of the first hookers to be the focal point of the attack. He was so elusive around the ruck. Elias\u2019 field goal, which hit the crossbar, will go down in infamy in the 1989 grand final. He was an inspirational NSW captain. Elias was the greatest hooker when he retired.\n\n10. Steve Roach\n\nHe was one of the great personalities. This bull-like prop was powerful as he could monster opposition packs and have soft hands with the ball. His aggression and tenacity made him one of the of the most controversial on-field players for his suspensions and clashes with referees. Being taken off the field in the \u201989 grand final goes down as one of the great coaching blunders.\n\n11. Paul Sironen\n\nHe played American college football for the University of Hawaii. Sironen made an instant impact in his rookie year, being crowned rookie of the year. His peak saw him be a destructive ball runner who used his tall frame to his advantage. His performances for Australia like Game 3 in the Ashes against Great Britain cemented his legacy as an all-time great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Harry Bath\n\nHe has the moniker of the best foward to never play for Australia. He played most of his career in England. When he returned to Australia he helped Balmain win two premierships. He was known for his ball-playing skills, which was unusual for second rowers at the time, and his ability to kick goals.\n\n13. Wayne Pearce\n\nThe dedication and discipline he had to the game set the standard for how a player in the modern game should approach the sport. He didn\u2019t drink or smoke. He wasn\u2019t the most talented but his determination was easily his best best trait. He only weighed 88 kilos but used his heart and leadership as his best asset. He was captain of the NSW Blues\u2019 first ever series sweep.\n\nBench: Jim Craig, Bruce Maguire, Bob Boland, Peter Provan\n\nCoach: Norman Robinson\n\nThe team\u2019s foward pack is the strength. Roach, Sironen, Pearce and Hemsley give Balmain an amazing platform, plus they have a mean streak in them to intimidate opponents.\n\nThe backs also possess strike with Jack\u2019s dangerous kick returns coupled with Brasher giving opposition teams nightmares. Hanley is the most damaging player, and his game-breaking ability gives Balmain someone who can win a game for them by himself.\n\nThe central point of the attack is Elias, whose darts and creativity around the ruck will give teams fits as they will already be concerned with dealing with the other great players on the team."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Balmain-Tigers", "page_content": "The club's home grounds are at present Leichhardt Oval , in Lilyfield, and T.G Milner Sportsground, in Marsfield. The distinctive black and gold colours of their 1908 thin striped jerseys lead their fans to quickly nickname them \"THE TIGERS\". Though it is claimed they were also known as \"The Watersiders\" in the early days, this appears a moniker that was used by newspaper journalists rather than Balmain supporters and fans. It seemed to be used to refer not only to most Balmain sporting teams (Lacrosse, Rugby Union, Cricket etc.), but also to Balmain residents in general. The following boxing quote is a good example,taken from \"Sydney Sportsman\" 11 Dec,1901. \"On Xmas Eve, Cam Brookes and Ike Stewart, heavyweights, meet at the Golden Gate, Brookes is another Balmain boy, and the watersiders are sure to follow him to town in shoals.\" As late as the 1930s some journalists were still using both \"Tigers\" and \"Watersiders\" in the same article. One of the earliest newspaper references to Balmain & Tigers appears in \"The Arrow\" 12 August 1911. The journalist \"Gulliver\" in his \"Football Notes\" column reports; \"W.G.B. (Balmain) writes: \"Who said Balmain weren't rough? Here is an essay on \"The Tiger\" written by an eight year old boy at one of the local schools.:- The tiger has large padded feet so that he can steal softly upon his prey...The tiger is like the Balmain footballers, because he has black and yellow stripes. He is very wild, but not so wild as the Balmain footballers.\"\n\nThe Balmain Tigers (also known as the Sydney Tigers from 1995\u201396) are a rugby league football club based in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Balmain . They were a founding member of the New South Wales Rugby League and one of the most successful in the history of the premiership, with eleven titles. In 1999 they formed a joint venture club with the neighbouring Western Suburbs Magpies club to form the Wests Tigers for competition in the National Rugby League (NRL). They no longer field any senior teams in the lower divisions. At the time of the joint venture only South Sydney Rabbitohs and the St George Dragons had won more titles than the Tigers.\n\nFoundation club\n\nIn 1908 Australia's first season of rugby league began in Sydney and the Balmain club were one of nine foundation clubs. One of the club's founders was future Premier of New South Wales, John Storey. Their home ground was Birchgrove Park. Balmain reached their first Grand Final in only the second year in the competition against the previous year's champions, South Sydney, but would protest as the match was scheduled as a warm up for a Kangaroos vs. Wallabies game at Souths' home ground. Souths were officially awarded the Premiership when they kicked off to an empty half of the field.\n\nAfter a string of poor years the Tigers managed a strong turn-around to become a dominant force in the Australian Rugby League with the club's first, second and third Premierships coming in successive years dominating the 1915, 1916 and 1917 seasons. Tigers dominance continued winning the 1919 and 1920 seasons comfortably. When they won the 1924 premiership this would be the last success for Balmain for over a decade to come.\n\nGolden era\n\nIt would not be until 1939 the Tigers won back the Premiership smashing Souths 33-4. The weekend of the Final will also be remembered for the invasion of Poland by Germany which led to England and Australia going to War.\n\nPost-World War II marked a golden era for Balmain with the Tigers reaching five consecutive Grand Finals winning three of them. In the 1944 Grand Final the Tigers beat the strong favourites Newtown 19-16. Balmain reached the Grand Final again in 1945 but fell at the last hurdle against Easts 22-18. The loss was not long remembered as the Tigers went on to take out the next two seasons, beating St George 14-12 in 1946, and Canterbury 13-9 in 1947. On the hunt for a third successive title, they lost to Wests in 1948.\n\nThe Tigers' jerseys\n\n1960s-1970s\n\nThe Tigers would appear in several Grand Final matches throughout the 1950s and 1960s but were just another victim to the mighty St. George Dragons eleven-year streak of Premiership wins in this period, losing in 1956, 1964 and 1966. When the Tigers did take out the competition in the 1969 NSWRFL season it was a classy 11-2 defeat of favourites Souths who boasted 11 internationals, this would signal the last time Balmain would ever win a Grand Final. The side was captained by Peter Provan, brother of Norm, and coached by Leo Nosworthy.\n\nThe 1970s were not a great era for the Tigers. The wooden spoon had not been in Balmain since 1911, but it returned for the second time in club history when the Tigers won only 4 games and had 2 draws in 1974 following a number of poor years. That period of time between 1911 and 1974 remains the longest wooden spoon drought for any team. In 1976 things looked more hopeful when Balmain began the year with an undefeated run through the pre-season \"Wills Cup\" competition. The side also won the 1976 Amco Cup knockout tournament in front of a then-record crowd of 21,600, beating North Sydney. The Tigers won eight straight games and led the competition, but a mid season slump left the Tigers in the same position as in 1975 and they failed to make the finals.\n\n1980s-1990s\n\nThe Tigers consistently made the finals series in the 1980s reaching the play-offs in 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989.\n\nOn 4 August 1985 a crowd of 21,707 set a new ground record for Leichhardt Oval.\n\nIn 1986, one of Balmain's players, Great Britain captain Garry Schofield topped the try-scorers list for the season. The 1988 Great Britain Lions tour captain Ellery Hanley was signed by the Balmain Tigers to play the remaining rounds of the 1988 NSWRFL season for them once his representative commitments were fulfilled. The Tigers reached the 1988 Grand Final, the first time since the 1969 success, winning a lot of fans along the way with a number of \u2018backs to the wall\u2019 performances winning four consecutive sudden death matches in just 3 weeks. The top five teams out of the premiership table went on to the final series, and this was the first time since 1979 that a team in fifth position had progressed to the Grand Final. In 1988 the Tigers were deemed certain to miss the finals with 8 games left in the regular season. The Tigers remarkably only lost a single game from that point onwards reaching the Grand Final against Canterbury, only to be denied the trophy in a controversial 24-12 loss. Canterbury player, Terry Lamb, is still remembered by fans for knocking out the legendary Ellery Hanley with a high shot in back play midway through the first half. The Tigers were leading the game at the time.\n\nThe side would again make the Grand Final in 1989 but this time as favourites. The \u201989 Final is regarded by many as one of the best ever in the history of Rugby League. In a controversial affair the side lost in extra time against the Canberra Raiders after being ahead 12-2 at half time.\n\nAfter the heartbreak of the 1989 Grand Final, the Tigers never regained their dominating form (although they did make the finals again in 1990) and went through a rebuilding phase following the retirement of star players Wayne Pearce, Garry Jack, Steve Roach and David Brooks who had all played over 100 games for the club over a period of 10 years or more. The stars were missed as Balmain finished second-last in 1993 and got the wooden spoon in 1994.\n\nThe departure of coach Warren Ryan at the end of 1990 was a key turning point for the club. Balmain hired the famous former Wallabies coach-come-radio announcer Alan Jones as coach in 1991. As Paul Sironen admitted years later in his autobiography, the 'running rugby' style of Jones was too simplistic for the structured defensive patterns which had developed in rugby league during the 1980s. Jones also began a controversial clear-out of some of the other Tigers stars who had not retired, notably the Kiwi international Gary Freeman, and often replaced them with inexperienced juniors who were not yet really ready for first grade football. By the time Jones was sacked as coach at the end of 1993, incoming coach Wayne Pearce inherited a massive problem which was only getting worse.\n\nIn drastic action Balmain released 31 players at the end of 1994 and moved to Parramatta Stadium as the 'Sydney Tigers'. The Tigers stayed at Parramatta Stadium for 2 seasons before heading back to Leichhardt Oval. The Tigers only averaged 6,565 people attending home games at Parramatta Stadium in what was regarded as a failed experiment.\n\nAt the end of the season, 1996 ARL season the League's chief executive John Quayle resigned and was replaced by Balmain president (and former hooker) Neil Whittaker.\n\nJoint Venture\n\nAlthough things picked up for the club in following years, the Australian Rugby League/Super League war would spell trouble for the club. 1999 was a tumultuous year for the Balmain Tigers. The season began with a dark cloud hanging over the 17 clubs. The Super League/ARL compromise had left 1999 as the last season before the 14 team NRL competition began and with it came the much talked about criteria. On-field Balmain was struggling with a savage injury toll that forced the Tigers to use over 40 players throughout the season.\n\nIn July the option of forming a joint venture with fellow foundation club, the Western Suburbs Magpies was put to the Football Club members. The members ultimately voted in favour of a joint venture. As it turned out Balmain was in the top 14 clubs under the criteria (ahead of current NRL teams Penrith and South Sydney) but would have continued to struggle to be financially competitive with bigger clubs. The decision to enter a joint venture saw a crowd of 15,240 turn out in atrocious conditions to watch the Tigers play their last home game in first grade at Leichhardt Oval as the Balmain Tigers.\n\nThe new entity, Wests Tigers, made it to the 2005 Grand Final and defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 30-16.\n\nClub today\n\nThe club currently competes in both of the junior New South Wales Rugby League competitions, the Harold Matthews Cup and S. G. Ball Cup competitions, recording consecutive SG Ball premierships in 2012-13. From 2000, they played in the NSW Cup as a merged team with the Ryde-Eastwood Hawks and competed as the Balmain Ryde-Eastwood Tigers. From season 2013 onwards, Balmain do not have a senior representative side, having formed a joint venture with the Western Suburbs Magpies to form a Wests Tigers team.\n\nPlayers of note\n\nIn May 2003 the Balmain Tigers Team of the Century was named:\n\n2005 the members of the Team of the Century became the inaugural inductees to the Balmain Tigers Hall of Fame. In addition to those inductees a further five were inducted at the inaugural Hall of Fame dinner on 17 March 2005.

The club spent a majority of the early days at Birchgrove Oval (1908 - 1933, and in 1942), with short stints at Wentworth Park (1930) and at Drummoyne Oval (1932 - 1933) in that time.\n\nIn 1934, they moved to Leichhardt Oval, where they majority played until they were forced to merge with the Western Suburbs Magpies at the end of the 1999 season. In this time, they had short stints at Sydney Showground (1971 - 1972) and Parramatta Stadium (1995 - 1996).\n\nThe clubs' existing lower grade sides play home games at Leichhardt Oval and TG Milner Sportsground in Marsfield.\n\nHere is a list of their grounds used as their primary use in first grade:\n\nBirchgrove Oval (1908 - 1929; 1931 - 1932; 1942)\n\nDrummoyne Oval (1932 - 1933)\n\nLeichhardt Oval (1934 - 1941; 1943 - 1970; 1973 - 1994; 1997 - 1999)\n\nParramatta Stadium (1995 - 1996)\n\nClub\n\nBiggest win\n\n64-2 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nWorst defeat\n\n5-62 vs Wests at Lidcombe Oval on 31 March 1974\n\nIndividual\n\nMost appearances\n\nPaul Sironen: 246\n\nGarry Jack: 244\n\nBen Elias: 234\n\nKeith Barnes: 200\n\nWayne Pearce: 192\n\nTim Brasher: 185\n\nCharles Fraser: 185\n\nSteve Roach: 185\n\nReg Latta: 176\n\nGarry Leo: 173\n\nMost tries in a match\n\nSid Goodwin: 5 vs University at Leichhardt Oval on 4 April 1935\n\nArthur Patton: 5 vs Eastern Suburbs at SCG on 12 August 1944\n\nBob Lulham: 5 vs Parramatta at Leichhardt Oval on 2 August 1947\n\nDavid Topliss: 5 vs Newtown at Henson Park on 7 August 1977\n\nMost tries in a season\n\nBobby Lulham: 28 in NSWRFL season 1947\n\nMost tries for club\n\nArthur Patton: 95\n\nSid Goodwin: 86\n\nBob Lulham: 85\n\nTim Brasher: 82\n\nBob Mara: 70\n\nMost goals in a match\n\nFrank Driese: 11 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nKeith Barnes: 11 vs Norths at Sports Ground on 24 July 1960\n\nMost goals in a season\n\nLen Killeen: 84 in NSWRFL season 1969\n\nMost Goals For Club\n\nKeith Barnes: 742\n\nMost points in a match\n\nFrank Driese: 22 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nKeith Barnes: 22 vs Norths at Sports Ground on 24 July 1960\n\nRoss Conlon: 22 vs Wests at Leichhardt Oval on 4 April 1985\n\nMost points in a season\n\nLen Killeen: 207 (9 tries, 84 goals, 6 Field goals) in NSWRFL season 1969\n\nMost points for club\n\nKeith Barnes: 1,519 (11 tries, 742 goals, 1 field goal)\n\nAward winners\n\nWayne Pearce (Rothmans Medal, 1985)\n\nCamperford (1977)\n\nAvis (1978\u20131980)\n\nSaxonvale Wines (1983\u20131985)\n\nAlpha Micro Computers (1986\u20131987)\n\nMLC mobiles (1994\u20131995)\n\nMeriton Apartments (1997\u20131999)\n\nNotable fans\n\nNeville Wran, Premier of New South Wales\n\nDawn Fraser, olympic swimmer\n\nLaurie Nichols\n\nBalmain Tigers District Junior Rugby League\n\nThe Balmain Tigers District Junior Rugby League is one of the oldest Junior Rugby League Competitions in Australia.

People take gold medals away from Olympians who cheat \u2013 I would say this is on par. It\u2019s clearly stated in the records they both agreed not to turn up \u2013 one team did and they won the premiership.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nAs I discovered after including a precis of the incident in an article about the early history of premiership deciders, it still elicits passionate disputation. 112 years later!\n\nI\u2019m confident in saying two things at the outset.\n\nFirst, it was a farce, to which Balmain, Souths and the game\u2019s administration all contributed. But the biggest contributor was rugby league\u2019s parlous financial state.\n\nSecond, the events leading to the farce of September 18, 1909 are far more interesting than a 112-year-old chip on Balmain shoulders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany rugby league supporters know some version of the story \u2013 and there are multiple versions. Most of the disputed details concern the role of Souths: what, if anything, did they agree with Balmain beforehand, and, regardless, should they have withdrawn in solidarity, rather than perpetrating a ridiculous charade, when it became apparent Balmain wouldn\u2019t play?\n\nI\u2019ll get to that, but to understand what happened we have to go back 12 months earlier to where it all began.\n\nThe New South Wales Rugby Football League\u2019s (NSWRFL) first season in 1908 was a partial success. The recruitment of the immensely popular rugby union star Dally Messenger provided some initial impetus and many reviews of the fledgling code in the popular press were positive.\n\nIn late 1908, The Sportsman wrote: \u201cThey play that kind of football that delights the public taste, having a clever lot of backs behind a rattling set of forwards. The success of the league now largely depends on the ability of our representatives to win matches in the north of England.\u201d\n\nTrouble was, not enough of the public turned up and JJ Giltinan\u2019s Kangaroo tour of 1908-09 was a financial disaster. The NSWRFL lost \u00a3500 in 1908, while Giltinan was bankrupted after the tour of England lost \u00a3418. Ten of the 34 pioneering Kangaroos accepted contracts with English clubs just to raise funds for the tour.\n\nWhen Giltinan and the Kangaroos returned home in May 1909, rugby league was on its knees. Giltinan had already been dismissed from his post with the NSWRFL, along with fellow founding directors Henry Hoyle and Victor Trumper, on the grounds of financial mismanagement and allegations of impropriety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRugby league was broke and crowds were dismal. The NRL we know today probably wouldn\u2019t exist in the same form if it wasn\u2019t for what happened next: the entry of Sydney businessman James Joynton Smith.\n\nSmith financed an audacious raid on rugby union, with almost all the 1908-09 Wallabies team defecting to league, including Olympic gold medalists Robert Craig, Chris McKivat and Arthur McCabe.\n\nThis caused quite a controversy in Sydney sport. While rugby league was still barely scraping by financially, the defections were seen by some as a tipping point.\n\nHaving invested somewhere between \u00a31500 and \u00a31800 on the new recruits \u2013 $223,000 to $268,000 in today\u2019s money \u2013 Smith wasn\u2019t content with business as usual.\n\nA series of games between the Kangaroos and Wallabies was arranged late in the 1909 season, with a total of about 37,000 people attending the three fixtures and the Wallabies winning the series 2-1. They were essentially fundraisers for league, union and, of course, James Joynton Smith.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t enough for Smith to recoup his outlay. A fourth Kangaroos-Wallabies clash was scheduled for the evening of September 18, 1909 at the Sydney Showground. The Kangaroos won 8-6 and, while the crowd was small, Smith likely broke even.\n\nAll that was slightly overshadowed by events earlier in the afternoon. The 1909 NSWRFL premiership final between Balmain and Souths had been scheduled as a curtain-raiser to the inter-code showdown and Balmain wasn\u2019t happy about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalmain\u2019s objections were entirely reasonable. The significance of the premiership final was clearly diminished by being relegated to the undercard, the clubs stood to gain nothing financially as a result and many of Balmain\u2019s players would\u2019ve had to skip work and forego wages to make the 2pm kick-off.\n\nTwo days before the scheduled fixture, the Balmain club unanimously decided it wouldn\u2019t play.\n\nAs it happens, a few Balmain players attempted to picket the Showground on the day. This turned out to be a public relations mistake, with sections of the press turning on the club.\n\nThe Sportsman took a very dim view, remarking that Balmain \u201chad run like a pack of kids with letters to the dailies, and used other efforts to prevent the crowd from rolling up to the fixture\u2026 nothing but disgust is expressed for their despicable behaviour\u201d.\n\nThe ridiculous charade subsequently perpetrated by Souths \u2013 kicking-off to a non-existent opponent and running in an unopposed try before claiming the premiership \u2013 was far from edifying. But it seems many were weary of the affair and happy to consign it to history after a most tumultuous season.\n\nWhich brings us back to the burning questions: was there a mutual agreement to boycott and, regardless, should Souths have claimed the premiership?\n\nIf there was an agreement \u2013 a handshake, a wink or a nod \u2013 the details have been lost to history. Ian Heads\u2019 wonderful, sprawling history of NSW rugby league, True Blue, notes that the surviving documentary evidence consists of rumours and \u201cidle talk\u201d, including a letter to the editor of the Evening News by somebody titled \u2018Balmain Barracker\u2019, hardly compelling or impartial evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the latter question, Souths clearly felt compelled to turn-up and provide a spectacle of some sort. After the charade of their premiership \u2018victory\u2019, they played a scratch game against an assortment of players from other teams before the Kangaroos-Wallabies game.\n\nIf Souths hadn\u2019t turned up, they would almost certainly have been premiers anyway. They\u2019d finished two points clear of Balmain in first place. Under the rules at the time, Balmain would\u2019ve had to beat them twice to take the title and the NSWRFL had already indicated it wouldn\u2019t reschedule one game, never mind two, due to its leasing arrangements.\n\nAfter more than 112 years, it\u2019s time to put this one to bed. Balmain were dudded but didn\u2019t do themselves any favours. Souths could\u2019ve stayed home but were obviously beholden to financial imperatives.\n\nLike it or not, everybody was playing for James Joynton Smith at the time. With the benefit of hindsight, that was probably a good thing."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Geoffrey_Griffin_(cricketer)", "page_content": "Geoffrey Merton Griffin (12 June 1939 \u2013 16 November 2006) was a Test cricketer who toured England with the South African cricket team in 1960, appearing in two Test matches. A right-arm, fast bowler and lower order batsman, his selection for the tour was controversial, because of his suspect bowling action \u2013 some of his deliveries were judged to be thrown rather than bowled. The core of his problem was that, due to a childhood accident, he was unable to fully straighten his right arm.\n\nSouth African cricketer\n\nQuick facts: Personal information, Full name, Born, D... \u25bc\n\nDuring the 1960 tour he was no-balled for throwing in several matches prior to the Test series, but retained his place in the side nevertheless. In his second Test appearance, at Lord's in June 1960, he became the first South African cricketer to take a hat-trick in a Test match, and also the first cricketer of any nationality to do this at Lord's. In the same match, however, he was no-balled for throwing eleven times, and again in an exhibition match that followed the match's early conclusion. These events ended his international career, and after fruitless attempts to resolve his problem, he retired from cricket in 1963, at the age of 23.\n\nGriffin was unfortunate to emerge on the international scene at a time when cricketing authorities were particularly concerned about the growing proliferation of bowlers with dubious actions and were determined to eradicate it. He, along with others, was convinced that he had been made a scapegoat to ensure that certain bowlers would be omitted from the Australian side due to tour England in 1961. After 1960 the throwing controversy largely subsided as an issue in international cricket."}, {"url": "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/Balmain%20Tigers/en-en/", "page_content": "The Balmain Tigers (also known as the Sydney Tigers from 1995\u201396) are a rugby league football club based in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Balmain. They were a founding member of the New South Wales Rugby League and one of the most successful in the history of the premiership, with eleven titles. In 1999 they merged with the neighbouring Western Suburbs Magpies club to form the Wests Tigers for competition in the National Rugby League (NRL). They still field independent teams in the lower divisions. At the time of the merger only South Sydney Rabbitohs and the St George Dragons had won more titles than the Tigers.\n\nThe club's home ground was Leichhardt Oval, in Sydney's inner west. They were also known as The Watersiders in their earlier days.\n\nHistory\n\nFoundation club\n\nIn 1908 Australia's first season of rugby league began in Sydney and the Balmain club were one of nine foundation clubs to compete. Their home ground was Birchgrove Park. Balmain reached their first Grand Final in only the second year in the competition against the previous year's champions, South Sydney, but would protest as the match was scheduled as a warm up for a Kangaroos vs. Wallabies game at Souths' home ground.[1] Souths were officially awarded the Premiership when they kicked off to an empty half of the field.\n\nAfter a string of poor years the Tigers managed a strong turn-around to become a dominant force in the Australian Rugby League with the club's first, second and third Premierships coming in successive years dominating the 1915, 1916 and 1917 seasons. Tigers dominance continued winning the 1919 and 1920 seasons comfortably. When they won the 1924 premiership this would be the last success for Balmain for over a decade to come.\n\nGolden era\n\nIt would not be until 1939 the Tigers won back the Premiership smashing Souths 33-4. The weekend of the Final will also be remembered for the invasion of Poland by Germany which led to England and Australia going to War.\n\nPost-World War II marked a golden era for Balmain with the Tigers reaching five consecutive Grand Finals winning three of them. In the 1944 Grand Final the Tigers beat the strong favourites Newtown 19-16. Balmain reached the Grand Final again in 1945 but fell at the last hurdle against Easts 22-18. The loss was not long remembered as the Tigers went on to take out the next two seasons, beating St George 14-12 in 1946, and Canterbury 13-9 in 1947. On the hunt for a third successive title, they lost to Wests in 1948.\n\n1960s-1970s\n\nThe Tigers would appear in several Grand Final matches throughout the 1950s and 1960s but were just another victim to the mighty St. George Dragons eleven year streak of Premiership wins in this period, losing in 1956, 1964 and 1966. When the Tigers did take out the competition in the 1969 NSWRFL season it was a classy 11-2 defeat of favourites Souths who boasted 11 internationals, this would signal the last time Balmain would ever win a Grand Final. The side was captained by Peter Provan, brother of Norm, and coached by Leo Nosworthy.\n\nThe 1970s were not a great era for the Tigers. The wooden spoon had not been in Balmain since 1911, but it returned for the second time in club history when the Tigers won only 4 games and had 2 draws in 1974 following a number of poor years. That period of time between 1911 and 1974 remains the longest wooden spoon drought for any team. In 1976 things looked more hopeful when Balmain began the year with an undefeated run through the pre-season \"Wills Cup\" competition. The side also won the 1976 Amco Cup knockout tournament in front of a then-record crowd of 21,600, beating North Sydney. The Tigers won eight straight games and led the competition, but a mid season slump left the Tigers in the same position as in 1975 and they failed to make the finals.\n\n1980s-1990s\n\nThe Tigers consistently made the finals series in the 1980s reaching the play-offs in 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989.\n\nOn 4 August 1985 a crowd of 21,707 set a new ground record for Leichhardt Oval.[2]\n\nIn 1986, one of Balmain's players, Great Britain captain Garry Schofield topped the try-scorers list for the season.\n\nThe Tigers would not reach the Grand Final until 1988, the first time since the 1969 success, winning a lot of fans along the way with a number of \u2018backs to the wall\u2019 performances winning four consecutive sudden death matches in just 3 weeks. The top five teams out of the premiership table went on to the final series, and this was the first time since 1979 that a team in fifth position had progressed to the Grand Final. In 1988 the Tigers were deemed certain to miss the finals with 8 games left in the regular season. The Tigers remarkably only lost a single game from that point onwards reaching the Grand Final against Canterbury, only to be denied the trophy in a controversial 24-12 loss. Canterbury player, Terry Lamb, is still remembered by fans for knocking out the legendary Ellery Hanley with a high shot in back play midway through the first half. The Tigers were leading the game at the time.\n\nThe side would again make the Grand Final in 1989 but this time as favourites. The \u201989 Final is regarded by many as one of the best ever in the history of Rugby League. In a controversial affair the side lost in extra time against the Canberra Raiders after being ahead 12-2 at half time.\n\nAfter the heartbreak of the 1989 Grand Final, the Tigers never regained their dominating form (although they did make the finals again in 1990) and went through a rebuilding phase following the retirement of star players Wayne Pearce, Garry Jack, Steve Roach and David Brooks who had all played over 100 games for the club over a period of 10 years or more. The stars were missed as Balmain finished second-last in 1993 and got the wooden spoon in 1994.\n\nThe departure of coach Warren Ryan at the end of 1990 was a key turning point for the club. Balmain hired the famous former Wallabies coach-come-radio announcer Alan Jones as coach in 1991. As Paul Sironen admitted years later in his autobiography, the 'running rugby' style of Jones was too simplistic for the structured defensive patterns which had developed in rugby league during the 1980s. Jones also began a controversial clear-out of some of the other Tigers stars who had not retired, notably the Kiwi international Gary Freeman, and often replaced them with inexperienced juniors who were not yet really ready for first grade football. By the time Jones was sacked as coach at the end of 1993, incoming coach Wayne Pearce inherited a massive problem which was only getting worse.\n\nIn drastic action Balmain released 31 players at the end of 1994 and moved to Parramatta Stadium as the 'Sydney Tigers'. The Tigers stayed at Parramatta Stadium for 2 seasons before heading back to Leichhardt Oval. The Tigers only averaged 6,565 people attending home games at Parramatta Stadium in what was regarded as a failed experiment.\n\nAt the end of the season, 1996 ARL season the League's chief executive John Quayle resigned and was replaced by Balmain president (and former hooker) Neil Whittaker.[3]\n\nMerger\n\nAlthough things picked up for the club in following years, the Australian Rugby League/Super League war would spell trouble for the club. 1999 was a tumultuous year for the Balmain Tigers. The season began with a dark cloud hanging over the 17 clubs. The Super League/ARL compromise had left 1999 as the last season before the 14 team NRL competition began and with it came the much talked about criteria. On-field Balmain was struggling with a savage injury toll that forced the Tigers to use over 40 players throughout the season.\n\nIn July the option of forming a joint venture with fellow foundation club, the Western Suburbs Magpies was put to the Football Club members. The members ultimately voted in favour of a joint venture. As it turned out Balmain was in the top 14 clubs under the criteria (ahead of current NRL teams Penrith and South Sydney) but would have continued to struggle to be financially competitive with bigger clubs. The decision to enter a joint venture saw a crowd of 15,240 turn out in atrocious conditions to watch the Tigers play their last home game in first grade at Leichhardt Oval as the Balmain Tigers.\n\nAlthough now known as Wests Tigers, the side made it to the 2005 Grand Final and defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 30 -16. Many[who?] old Balmain supporters have stuck with the club through the merger and regard the Tigers Grand Final win as one for Balmain also.\n\nClub today\n\nThe club currently competes in all of the New South Wales Rugby League competitions. In the NSW Cup they are merged with the Ryde-Eastwood Hawks and compete as the Balmain Ryde-Eastwood Tigers. They still enjoy their rival match against the Western Suburbs Magpies.\n\nCoaching register\n\nPlayers of note\n\nIn May 2003 the Balmain Tigers Team of the Century was named:[4]\n\n2005 the members of the Team of the Century became the inaugural inductees to the Balmain Tigers Hall of Fame.

The club spent a majority of the early days at Birchgrove Oval (1908 - 1933, and in 1942), with short stints at Wentworth Park and at Drummoyne Oval in that time. They moved to Leichhardt Oval in 1934, where they majority played until they were forced to merge with the Western Suburbs Magpies at the end of the 1999 season.\n\nHere is a list of their grounds used as their primary use:\n\nRecords\n\nClub\n\nBiggest win\n\n64-2 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nWorst defeat\n\n5-62 vs Wests at Lidcombe Oval on 31 March 1974\n\nIndividual\n\nMost appearances\n\nMost tries in a match\n\nSid Goodwin: 5 vs University at Leichhardt Oval on 4 April 1935\n\nArthur Patton: 5 vs Eastern Suburbs at SCG on 12 August 1944\n\nBob Lulham: 5 vs Parramatta at Leichhardt Oval on 2 August 1947\n\nDavid Topliss: 5 vs Newtown at Henson Park on 7 August 1977\n\nMost tries in a season\n\nMost tries for club\n\nMost goals in a match\n\nFrank Driese: 11 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nKeith Barnes: 11 vs Norths at Sports Ground on 24 July 1960\n\nMost goals in a season\n\nMost Goals For Club\n\nKeith Barnes: 742\n\nMost points in a match\n\nFrank Driese: 22 vs Wests at Pratten Park on 29 July 1944\n\nKeith Barnes: 22 vs Norths at Sports Ground on 24 July 1960\n\nRoss Conlon: 22 vs Wests at Leichhardt Oval on 4 April 1985\n\nMost points in a season\n\nMost points for club\n\nKeith Barnes: 1,519 (11 tries, 742 goals, 1 field goal)\n\nAward winners\n\nCamperford (1977)\n\nAvis (1978\u20131980)\n\nSharp (1981\u20131982)\n\nSaxonvale Wines (1983\u20131985)\n\nAlpha Micro Computers (1986\u20131987)\n\nPhilips (1988\u20131993)\n\nMLC mobiles (1994\u20131995)\n\nMeriton Apartments (1997\u20131999)\n\nNotable fans\n\nBalmain Tigers District Junior Rugby League\n\nThe Balmain Tigers District Junior Rugby League is one of the oldest Junior Rugby League Competitions in Australia.

To some extent, the Leichhardt match, as well as Saturday\u2019s Brookvale Oval semi-final between the Sea Eagles and the Sharks - the last of many successful games played at suburban grounds in 2019 - do remind us of \u201cthe days that are no more.\u201d Tiger tough: A Rabbitohs player is taken to ground in a full-blooded tackle during the 1969 grand final. Credit: Fairfax Media David Trodden, the chief executive of the NSWRL, became a Tigers fan that September day a half century ago, when Balmain won that grand grand final. \u201cI thought anything was possible if you were born in Balmain,\u201d Trodden said. \u201cTwo of the players in the team \u2013 Gary Leo and John Spencer \u2013 lived in east end Balmain. Dawn Fraser lived in Balmain. Dave Renneberg opened the bowling for Australia. Neville Wran was later to become Premier and Sir John Kerr, Governor General.\n\n\u201cEven Sydney\u2019s top criminals \u2013 Lenny McPherson and Stan Smith- lived in Balmain. I thought being a Balmain boy allowed you to go where you wanted.\u201d Leo went to Fort Street Boys\u2019 High School, a selective school, and scored A's in the Leaving Certificate in Latin and French. A prop forward, he undermines the myth that front-rowers are dumb. Norm Provan congratulates brother Peter after his man-of-the-match performance for Balmain. Credit: Fairfax Media He was also pivotal in the Tigers\u2019 strategy of lying down and feigning injury to gain a rest, similar to Muhammad Ali\u2019s rope-a dope tactics against George Foreman, which some would say is winning by doing nothing. Well, that\u2019s not true. Balmain scored the only try when winger Syd Williams (another Latin student, but only for one year) crossed the line.\n\nAnd, as Leo says of the frustrating practice of halting momentum, \u201cWe had been doing it all season. We weren\u2019t that strong in defence. There was a way to do it and not to do it. The same bloke didn\u2019t go down all the time. We took turns.\u201d Leo recalls a comic occasion at Leichhardt Oval in a game against Canterbury when a prop, Terry Cross, was told to lie down. Celebration: Post-match festivities at Balmain Leagues Club carried on long into the night. Credit: Fairfax Media \u201c'Go down\u2019,\u201d we told him. \u201cHe said, 'But there\u2019s nothing wrong with me'. \u201cWe said, \u2018We need a spell. Go down.\u2019 So eventually, it got through to him and he went down on the ground. I walked over to the halves to work out what we were going to do next with the ball.\n\nLoading \u201cI looked over to where the \u2018injured\u2019 player was supposed to be being treated and he was being carried off on a stretcher. He obviously misunderstood what I meant.\u201d While today\u2019s practice of wrestling in the tackle can be compared to Balmain\u2019s lying down in that both are designed to give a team time to re-set, Leo argues there are significant differences. \u201cIn our day, it was one-on-one tackling,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, there are three of four in a tackle and they slowly peel off. We tackled from chest down. Today, they tackle from chest up. That\u2019s why you get those head clashes.\u201d As Monday\u2019s lunch ended, news came through of the endorsement by the ARLC of its next chair, Racing NSW chief executive Peter V\u2019landys, and a reminder of the game\u2019s historic problems with conflict of interest."}, {"url": "https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/balmain-tigers/transfers.html", "page_content": "This page should not be used as an authoritative guide on player transfers & debuts.
