Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d\n\nPaul Caddis has played more than 350 matches professionally at club level, while also represented his country in youth and senior competitions.\n\nDue to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the midfield. He played in every position for Celtic and Swindon Town, except striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis began his professional career at Celtic. Caddis broke into the first-team during the 2007/08 season but was never able to maintain a place in the starting lineup over the following years.\n\nDundee United took him on loan for the second half the 2008-09 campaign before being sold to English League One club Swindon Town, in August 2010.\n\nIn 2012-13, Caddis spent the season on loan at Birmingham City, and then joined the club permanently in September 2013 and scored the goal in stoppage time that prevented the team from being relegated from the Championship.\n\nIn January 2017, his contract with Birmingham was mutually terminated after three-and a half seasons.\n\nAfter a short stint with Bury in League One, he spent a year with Blackburn Rovers before spending seven months at Bradford City.\n\nHe returned to Swindon Town after a short spell with Bury in League One, played his final match in 2021 and announced his retirement one year later.\n\nCaddis captained Scotland\u2019s under-21 team, and played for them regularly. In 2016, he made his debut as a full-time international for Scotland.\n\nThis is what fans said as Hereford appoint the ex-Swindon, Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn, Bradford player as their new manager\u2026\n\n@BrummieHayden: Blues legend.
