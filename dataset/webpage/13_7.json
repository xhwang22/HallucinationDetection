The really exciting part, which reminded me of being 15 and waiting to hear how your first demo had turned out, was getting the songs back. Some were pretty much as I imagined they'd be, while others were completely different.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough predominantly a DIY affair, Hogan had occasion to cal on Alabama 3/XTC programmer Matt Vaughan and his old producer friend Stephen Street.\n\n\"There were a few tracks where I felt my production wasn't doing the vocal justice so I contacted Stephen and he said 'Come on over!'

The group, which uses a different lead vocalist for almost every song,[citation needed] first appeared when Hogan's website announced the name of his new project on 9 October 2004. Mono Band's first gig was 13 March 2005 at Dolan's in Limerick.

Using his home studio, and then at West London's Town House Studios with Matthew Vaughan, Hogan set about exploring more electronic music of various genres.[citation needed] With Hogan writing, recording and producing almost all of the music for each track the moniker 'Mono Band' is rather appropriate.[original research?] Guest artists include Richard Walters, Marius De Vries, Alexandra Hamnede, Kate Havnevik, Nicolas Leroux, Fin Chambers, Angie Hart, and two fellow Cranberries, Mike Hogan and Fergal Lawler.[4]\n\nIn May 2005, Mono Band released their debut EP, Mono Band EP, shortly before releasing their first album, Mono Band.\n\nWith the touring that followed the release of their first album it became apparent that the concept of Mono Band did not translate as favourably to touring as it did to studio recording.[original research?] Not every vocalist was available for every tour date, with usually two of the vocalist performing at any given show. Over the course of touring Richard Walters began to emerge as the primary vocalist. With their touring commitment completed Hogan and Walters decided to work together and formed Arkitekt.[5] As of February 2011 there was no word on any upcoming projects by Mono Band.[citation needed][needs update]\n\nLine-up\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nEPs\n\nSingles\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Noel_Hogan", "page_content": "What we do.

The band consisted of Noel Hogan (guitar/vocals; also a member of Mono Band, Arkitekt and The Puro), Mike Hogan (bass/vocals), and Fergal Lawler (drums/percussion; also a member of The Low Network). Dolores O'Riordan (vocals, keyboards, guitars) was a member from 1990 until her death in 2018. The band went on hiatus in 2003 and reunited in the summer of 2009.\n\nCombining the melodic jangle of post-The Smiths indie pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, The Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the indie scene of the early 90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice was the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt wasn't until the lush ballad \"Linger\" became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of \"Linger\", The Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles like \"Dreams\", \"Zombie\" and \"Ode to My Family\".\n\nBy the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.\n\nDuring the next few years, the band cancelled a large tour and rumours of a breakup were widespread. In 1999, they released Bury the Hatchet to mixed reviews. In 2001, the band issued Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to rave reviews. The album debuted at number 46 in the US charts.\n\nIn 2002, The Cranberries released the compilation Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, which was supported by the single \"Stars\".\n\nIn 2003, The Cranberries announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers. They decided to put the next album on hold. After more than a dozen years of relentless touring and promotion, which had seen them clocking up album sales in excess of 43 million and playing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe, the band decided it was time for a break.\n\nIn 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released her debut solo album titled Are You Listening?. Two years later she released her second solo album, No Baggage.\n\nOn 25 August 2009, Dolores O'Riordan announced that The Cranberries will be reuniting for a North American tour to begin in mid-November 2009, to be followed by dates in Europe in early 2010. O'Riordan indicated that the band will be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of The Cranberries classic hits as well as some new music written by the group together.\n\nThe Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto (Canada) from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with producer Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all will be included on the album. The album is scheduled for release on 14 February, 2012.\n\nOn 26 May 2016, the Cranberries announced that they would start their next tour in Europe. The first show was held on June 3.\n\nA new \"unplugged\" Cranberries album titled Something Else, featuring the band's hits along with three new songs, was released on 28 April 2017 through BMG. The album received mostly positive reviews.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, lead singer Dolores O'Riordan was found dead of drowning in a London hotel room. The Cranberries confirmed in September 2018 that they would not continue as a band, releasing their final album In the End in April 2019 and disbanding afterward.Noel Hogan stated: \"the Cranberries was the four of us. We don\u2019t want to do this without Dolores. So we\u2019re going to leave it after this.\"\n\nThe Cranberries' final album In the End has been nominated for Best Rock Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.

It is curated by deputy editor Stuart Clark, who has known the band since their early days.\n\nThe group, known for 1990s hits such as \"Zombie\" and \"Linger\", went on to become Ireland's best-selling rock band after U2, selling more than 40 million records.\n\nO'Riordan drowned in a London hotel bath in January 2018 due to alcohol intoxication. The group disbanded in 2019.\n\nReuters spoke to guitarist Noel Hogan about the book, which can be pre-purchased in one of two editions, including a hardback copy signed by band members and O'Riordan's mother.\n\nBelow are excerpts of the conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nQ: What is the book about?\n\n[1/5] A handout photo shows a cover design of a book, \"WHY CAN'T WE? \u2013 The Story Of The Cranberries and the band's iconic frontwoman Dolores O'Riordan\", curated by deputy editor Stuart Clark, featuring interviews as well as previously unseen pictures. Courtesy of Hot Press/Handout via REUTERS\n\nHogan: \"We know Stuart from way back ... We live here in Limerick and he was a local DJ on a pirate radio station when we started out so Stuart used to interview us, then he moved to Hot Press and he always covered us. So there's literally, there is about 30 years worth of interviews, photos and so on.\n\n\"We liked the idea (Hot Press were) going to do everything but they wanted us to be part of it.\"\n\nQ: Why do this book now?\n\nHogan: \"Certainly, when they brought it to us, it wasn't something that was ever mentioned, maybe that's what kind of sparked this idea. The other side of it (is) the band obviously up until three years ago were a running entity. So I guess you do something like this when you're finished, more so.\n\n\"It probably didn't seem like right then would be the time, because things are moving along and you would be doing interviews and maybe, if Dolores hadn't passed away, I think the band was going and (it would be) something you could do way off down the road. So, maybe it's the combination of these things that kind of made them think, 'yep'.\"\n\nQ: Did you have specific moments or thoughts when helping put the book together?\n\nHogan: \"It's a bittersweet thing for us because you have amazing memories and you realise, God, we did so much stuff. And then it reminds you again that Dolores isn't here and that the band is finished and you don't have that anymore. But I guess we have learned to live with in time the legacy of the band more now, that it's still appreciated. And, I mean, to have that after all this time, it's a pretty cool thing. It's something we never thought we would have.\"\n\nReporting by Lisa Keddie; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Alex Richardson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-cranberries-mn0000784814/biography", "page_content": "Combining the melodic jangle of post-Smiths indie guitar pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-'80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, the Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the pre-Brit-pop indie scene of the early '90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice was the most distinctive element of the group's sound, they initially had little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn't until the lush ballad \"Linger\" became a worldwide hit in 1993 that the band achieved mass success. Following \"Linger,\" the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, they had added distorted guitars to their sonic palette and began crafting more socially conscious music. They continued down this path into the 21st century before taking an extended hiatus in 2003 to pursue solo efforts. After nearly a decade, the quartet returned with 2012's Roses and 2017's Something Else. However, in early 2018, O'Riordan died from an accidental drowning in London. Her last vocal recordings were used to construct the Cranberries' final work, 2019's Grammy-nominated In the End, a goodbye to O'Riordan, fans, and the band itself.\n\nOriginally, the Cranberries were a band called the Cranberry Saw Us. Brothers Noel and Mike Hogan (guitar and bass, respectively) formed the band in Limerick, Ireland, with drummer Fergal Lawler in 1990. Following the departure of the group's original singer, Niall Quinn, the trio placed an advertisement for a female singer. Dolores O'Riordan responded to the advertisement and auditioned by writing lyrics and melodies to some of the band's existing demos. When she returned with a rough version of \"Linger,\" the group hired her on the spot. Shortly after she joined, the band recorded a demo tape and sold it in record stores throughout Ireland. After the original run of 300 copies sold out, the group truncated its name to the Cranberries and sent another demo tape, which featured early versions of both \"Linger\" and \"Dreams,\" to record companies throughout the U.K. The tape was made at Xeric Studios, which was run by Pearse Gilmore, who would later become their manager. At the time the tape was made, all of the members were still in their late teens.\n\nThe demo tape earned the attention of both the U.K. press and record industry, and there was soon a bidding war between major British record labels. Eventually, the group signed with Island. The Cranberries headed into the studio with Gilmore as their producer to record their first single, \"Uncertain.\" The title proved to be prophetic, as the band did indeed sound ill at ease on the single, leading to poor reviews in the press in addition to tensions between the group and Gilmore. Before they were scheduled to record their debut in 1992, the Cranberries discovered that Gilmore had signed a secret deal with Island to improve his studios. The tensions within the band became so great they nearly broke up. Instead, the Cranberries severed all relations with Gilmore, hired Geoff Travis of Rough Trade as their new manager, and hired Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the Smiths, as their new producer.\n\nThe band's debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, was released in the spring of 1993, followed by a single of \"Dreams.\" Neither the album nor the single gained much attention, nor did the second single, \"Linger.\" In the summer and fall of 1993, the band toured the United States, opening for The The and Suede, respectively; frequently, the Cranberries were given a friendlier reception than either of the headliners. Their strong live shows led MTV to put \"Linger\" into heavy rotation. By the end of the year, the single was on its way to becoming a crossover hit. Eventually, the single reached number eight on the U.S. charts, while the album went double platinum. Everybody Else and \"Linger\" began to take off in Britain in early 1994; the album eventually peaked at number one during the summer.\n\nO'Riordan married the band's tour manager, Don Burton, in a much-publicized ceremony in July 1994. The marriage, as well as the group's videos, emphasized the singer as the focal point of the band. O'Riordan's position in the group continued to rise with the fall release of the group's second album, No Need to Argue. Boasting a slightly harder, more streamlined sound, yet still produced by Stephen Street, the record debuted at number six on the U.S. charts and eventually outsold its predecessor; within a year it went triple platinum, spawning the number one modern rock hit \"Zombie\" and the number 11 \"Ode to My Family.\"\n\nDuring the tour for No Need to Argue, rumors began to circulate that O'Riordan was going to leave the band to pursue a solo career, all of which the band vehemently denied. Nevertheless, the rumors persisted until the Cranberries began recording their next album with producer Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith. The resulting effort, To the Faithful Departed, was a tougher, more rock-oriented affair. Upon its spring 1996 release, it entered the charts at number six, but its first single, \"Salvation,\" failed to become a hit on par with \"Zombie,\" \"Linger,\" or \"Ode to My Family.\" Consequently, the album slipped down the charts relatively quickly and only went platinum, which was slightly disappointing in light of its two predecessors' multi-platinum status.\n\nDuring the fall of 1996, the group canceled its Australian and European tours, sparking another round of rumors about O'Riordan launching a solo career. In 1999, the group released Bury the Hatchet, their last big chart hit, and quickly followed with 2001's Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. Shortly after the release of a greatest-hits compilation in 2003, Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, the Cranberries officially declared that they were taking a break. This finally gave O'Riordan the time she needed to work on her long-talked-about solo album, Are You Listening?, which hit shelves in 2007. In 2009, O'Riordan released her second solo album, No Baggage. Around the same time, the Cranberries reunited for a North American tour that continued throughout Europe in 2010. Several live albums also appeared in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the band began work on a new album in Toronto with longtime producer Street. Released nearly a decade after the start of their extended hiatus, the resulting album, Roses, arrived in March 2012. A supporting tour followed, recorded for posterity at London's Hammersmith Apollo on Live 2012. At the end of 2013, O'Riordan performed a New Year's Eve concert in Limerick with a string quartet from the Irish Chamber Orchestra. Inspired by the classical interpretation of the Cranberries sound, she approached the band with an idea to celebrate their silver anniversary. The result was a full album comprising string quartet renditions of the band's biggest hits. Something Else arrived in the spring of 2017, featuring their ten most successful singles culled from their first four albums, as well as three new songs. The band kicked off a tour in support of the album, but it was cut short due to O'Riordan's ongoing back problems.\n\nOn January 15, 2018, O'Riordan died of an accidental drowning at the age of 46 in London. At the time of her death, the Cranberries were in the middle of recording a new effort. After taking some time to process the tragedy, the remaining bandmembers decided to finish the project. Along with Stephen Street, they completed the LP using O'Riordan's demo vocals. Released in April 2019, In the End featured the single \"All Over Now\" and served as the Cranberries' final album. Peaking in the Top 10 across Europe and in the U.S. side charts, the farewell set was later nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album."}], "Mono Band released two albums, Mono Band (2005) and Mono Band 2 (2008).": [{"url": "https://www.monoofjapan.com/releases.php", "page_content": "For two decades, MONO have defined and refined a kind of orchestral rock that is as emotional as it is experimental. Their 10 studio albums over those 20 years have established MONO as what Pitchfork described as \u201cone of the most distinctive bands of the 21st Century.\u201d Meanwhile, their live concerts are typically more subdued in instrumentation \u2013 and more supercharged in volume and voltage. Rarely is there the opportunity to combine those two experiences. In their 20-year history as a band, MONO have presented no more than a half-dozen live concerts featuring the support of an orchestra. Such events are not only unusual \u2013 they are also unforgettable.\n\nBeyond the Past \u2022 Live in London with the Platinum Anniversary Orchestra documents MONO\u2019s extraordinary performance from the Beyond the Past event that celebrated the band\u2019s 20th anniversary, which took place at the historic Barbican Centre in London, England on December 14, 2019. For that once-in-a-lifetime event, MONO selected a memorable lineup of old and new friends, including fellow Japanese underground icons, Boris and Envy, as well as French post-metal legends, Alcest, and UK collaborators A.A. Williams and Jo Quail. The event culminated with MONO performing with The Platinum Anniversary Orchestra, featuring National Youth String Orchestra to a rapt, sold-out audience of 2,000.\n\nPlaying through a two-hour set that touches on the band\u2019s entire history, the sheer euphoria and dynamic resonance that engulfed the massive crowd was captured in brilliant detail by MONO\u2019s live sound engineer, Matt Cook. Meticulously mastered by Bob Weston and presented here in its entire two-hour glory, Beyond the Past is one of the most essential MONO recordings.

Since 1999 they've offered a dynamic, atmospheric, shapeshifting, classically tinged sound that lends itself to long compositions, drama, improvisation, and tension. 2004's Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined bridged detuned raw power to lush, delicate beauty. 2006's Palmless Prayer/Mass Murder Refrain and 2012's For My Parents (in collaboration with producer World's End Girlfriend) employed strings, reeds, and a vocal chorus. In 2014 they simultaneously issued Rays of Darkness and Last Dawn. Drummer Yasunori Takada left after 2016's Requiem for Hell, replaced by Dahm Majuri Cipolla. Mono released Nowhere Now Here in 2019 and Pilgrimage of the Soul in 2021. The following year, they wrote the soundtrack to the documentary film My Story, The Baraku Story and surprise released Heaven, Vol. 1 on Christmas Day.\n\nThe foursome, bassist Tamaki (the lone female in the group), drummer Yasunori Takada, and guitarists Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto and Yoda, released their first full-length record, Under the Pipal Tree, in 2001 on John Zorn's Tzadik label. After switching to Arena Rock Recording Company in 2003, Mono issued One Step More and You Die; a remix version came out the following year as New York Soundtracks. That same year, their fourth album, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined, recorded in Chicago with producer Steve Albini, was released on Temporary Residence. Albini performed the same duties on their April 2006 record You Are There, and in September the band issued Palmless Prayer/Mass Murder Refrain, a mix of classical and rock that also featured a collaboration with World's End Girlfriend, among others. Their fascination with classical arrangements, strings, and atmospheres became an integral part of their sound. In 2006 they recorded You Are There, which included cellos on one part of the album and a string section on another while retaining the dynamic- and tension-building sound that had become the band's trademark, weaving beauty and chaos together to form an inseparable whole. On 2009's Hymn to the Immortal Wind, the band played live with a 25-piece chamber orchestra that featured woodwinds, reeds, and strings -- and added a Hammond B-3 in spots to extend the orchestral dynamic. This culminated in 2010's Holy Ground: NYC Live with Mono accompanied by the Wordless Music Orchestra, another large chamber ensemble featuring everything from harp and strings to winds and piano. For 2012's For My Parents, they employed a smaller chamber group conducted by Jeff Milarsky and dubbed the Holy Ground Orchestra, comprising two violins, two cellos, viola, upright bass, timpani, and cymbals.\n\nAfter a global tour and a break, Mono returned to the studio in 2013 and recorded two albums simultaneously as parts of a whole. The Last Dawn was lighter, briefer, and more melodic; once again, it placed the band in sonic juxtaposition with strings. The second part, Rays of Darkness, didn't include strings for the first time since 2003. It was far blacker and heavier, and featured a guest vocal appearance by Tetsuya Fukagawa of Envy. Both albums were released by Temporary Residence in October of 2014. The following year, Mono signed with Pelagic (the label of German metal act the Ocean). Both bands collaborated on a split album called Transcendental. The recording prefaced a joint European tour. Each band contributed a single extended track. Mono's \"Death in Reverse\" served to complement the Ocean's \"The Quiet Observer\" in that both cuts explored themes of life, death, and rebirth/regeneration, as well as the in-between \"bardo\" states. The album was released at the end of October by Pelagic. In July 2016, Mono released the 18-minute \"Ely's Heartbeat\" on the Internet as the pre-release single from the full-length Requiem for Hell, issued by Temporary Residence that October.\n\nIn December of 2017, after the completion of an extensive world tour with the Ocean, Mono announced via social media that founding member Takada was leaving the group for personal reasons. He was replaced by Dahm Majuri Cipolla just in time for the live performances that began in August of the following year. Mono had entered Electrical Audio, again with Albini, earlier that year, and in January of 2019 issued the full-length Nowhere Now Here. To ice the cake on their 20-year anniversary celebration, Mono returned to Albini's Chicago studio while on a tour break. They recut three of their earliest songs -- \"Com(?),\" \"L'America,\" and \"Halo\" -- live from the studio floor. They issued them without overdubs or post-production as Before the Past: Live from Electrical Audio. In March 2021, Mono released a document of its remarkable 2019 British concert as Beyond the Past: Live in London with the Platinum Anniversary Orchestra.\n\nAfter the global COVID-19 pandemic ended the rest of their world tour, Mono spent the summer of 2020 writing, recording, and mixing. The end result, Pilgrimage of the Soul, was issued in October of 2021. It showcased an evolved sound offering faster tempos, electronics, and rhythms influenced by disco, techno, and other dance music. 2022 saw the release of their first score and soundtrack for the feature-length documentary My Story, The Buraku Story, by director Yusaku Mitsuwaka. The songs were largely built around piano, strings, synths, and choral vocal loops offering a sharp contrast in musical direction and production methods, but continued to offer understated execution and oversized emotional resonance.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Mono released the three-track EP Heaven, Vol. 1 for the Ocean's Pelagic label in Germany. The EP marked the beginning of a tradition that would see the band issue an EP of new material annually on Christmas. Recorded by Taka in his home studio, it offered an aural portrait of Mono at their most hopeful and cinematic. The EP saw U.S. release by longtime indie Temporary Residence in March 2023."}, {"url": "https://www.famousfix.com/list/mono-japanese-band-albums", "page_content": "You Are There Album by Mono\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 \u00b7\n\nYou Are There is the fourth studio album by the Japanese instrumental rock band Mono, a double album released on 15 March 2006.

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nJapanese instrumental band\n\nMono (stylised as MONO) is a Japanese instrumental band, formed in 1999 in Tokyo. The band consists of Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Dahm Majuri Cipolla (drums), and Tamaki Kunishi (bass guitar, electric guitar, piano, glockenspiel).\n\nMono have released eleven studio albums. The band spent their early years, from 1999 to 2003, touring Asia, Europe, and America continuously, and released two studio albums, Under the Pipal Tree (2001) and One Step More and You Die (2002) on the Tzadik Records and Music Mine Inc. record labels, respectively. From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to Temporary Residence Limited, released two more studio albums, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined (2004) and You Are There (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, Hymn to the Immortal Wind (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited. During the tour that followed they recorded a live album, Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra which was released in 2010. In October 2016 the band released their ninth studio album, titled Requiem for Hell. Their most recent effort, Nowhere Now Here was released on January 25, 2019 through Pelagic Records, and was produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago. It also contains Tamaki's first vocals for the band on the track \"Breathe\".\n\nThe band have cited a variety of experimental, avant-rock and classical music artists as inspirations but stated that their aim is to transcend genre, rejecting the post-rock label which has often been applied to them. Mono's sound is characterised by the lead and rhythm guitars of Goto and Yoda respectively, both of whom make extensive use of reverb, distortion and delay effects. The band's live performances are noted for their intensity, both in the playing and in the dynamics.\n\nHistory\n\nElectric guitarist \"Yoda\" in 2007\n\nFormation and early years: 1999\u20132000\n\nIn January 1999, Tokyo native electric guitarist Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto began composing music and spent the remainder of the year searching for other musicians with which to form an instrumental rock band; eventually recruiting long-time friend and fellow electric guitarist Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu on rhythm guitar.[1] By December 1999, Tamaki Kunishi and Yasunori Takada had joined Mono on bass guitar and drums, respectively. The band played their first show in late January 2000, at Club 251 in Setagaya, Tokyo.[2] In May 2000, the band entered Rinky Dink Studio in Tokyo and recorded their first extended play with engineers Tetsuya Morioka and Toshiro Kai, which was later self-released in September 2000: a Japan-only release titled Hey, You on their own independent record label, Forty-4. The band spent the bulk of the year composing more music and performing at various houses around Tokyo, in the neighbourhoods of Setagaya, Shimokitazawa, and Shibuya. Mono also travelled to the United States to play a one-off show in November at the Mercury Lounge in New York City; a show which was later described by Paul Wheeler of rockofjapan.com as having a \"big beautiful sound that [...] naturally [expanded] through each song.\"[3]\n\nUnder the Pipal Tree: 2001\n\nFollowing the release of the Hey, You extended play, Mono spent the next year playing shows throughout their native Japan, as well as playing several shows in New York City and Sweden. The band also made an appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, Under the Pipal Tree at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician John Zorn, with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the Hey, You extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through New York City record label Tzadik, owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\nOne Step More and You Die: 2002\u20132003\n\nAfter the release of Under the Pipal Tree, the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, One Step More and You Die at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc. The band spent most of 2003 touring in support of the album, returning to Japan, the United States, Sweden, and visiting Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom for the first time.\n\nWalking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined: 2004\n\nMono's next release was a collaboration with Japanese musician Aki Onda; whom the band met while touring New York in 2002. The band, Onda, and several notable members of the New York experimental music scene (including DJ Olive, Jackie-O Motherfucker, and Loren Connors) remixed One Step More and You Die. The album, titled New York Soundtracks, was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4.\n\nIn January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in Chicago, Illinois. The album, titled Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year. After the album's release, the band embarked upon a year-long tour of America, Asia, and Europe.\n\nYou Are There: 2005\u20132007\n\nMono in Stockholm, Sweden, May 2005\n\nThe band also spent 2005 touring Asia, America, and Europe composing music, and eventually returning to Electrical Audio Engineering in February and September to record their fourth studio album with Steve Albini. The album, titled You Are There was released in Japan in March 2006 on Human Highway, and on Temporary Residence Limited in the United States and Europe. Mono also collaborated with Japanese musician World's End Girlfriend in 2005, releasing a collaboration studio album in December of that year, on Human Highway, and with American band Pelican, releasing a split album with the band through Temporary Residence Limited in October 2005. In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted their split with World's End Girlfriend Palmless Prayer / Mass Murder Refrain No. 7 on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame.[4]\n\nMono spent 2006 and 2007 touring Asia, America and Europe in support of You Are There. In October 2006, the band returned to Electrical Audio Engineering and recorded a four-track extended play, which was released in April 2007 as part of Temporary Residence Limited's Travels in Constants series, titled The Phoenix Tree. In November 2006, the band released a two-track extended play titled Memorie dal Futuro through Vinyl Films, and also contributed a track to a Temporary Residence Limited compilation album, Thankful. In September 2007, the band released their first compilation album, compiling material from all previous extended plays, split albums, and compilations, titled Gone: A Collection of EPs 2000\u20132007, as well as the music documentary DVD, The Sky Remains the Same as Ever, documenting the worldwide tours of 2006 and 2007 and the recording of The Phoenix Tree extended play.\n\nHymn to the Immortal Wind: 2008\u20132011\n\nMono in Prague, Czech Republic, April 2010\n\nIn 2008, the band took a year-long break from touring, spending the time composing new music and playing a handful of shows throughout the year, including an appearance at All Tomorrow's Parties in Somerset, England, curated by Explosions in the Sky in May. Mono returned to Electrical Audio Engineering in June and November 2008 to record their fifth studio album, Hymn to the Immortal Wind, which was later released in March 2009, and followed by a year-long tour of America and Eurasia. The band played a ten-year anniversary show at the Society for Ethical Culture Hall in New York, United States on 8 May 2009, accompanied by the 24-piece Wordless Music Orchestra. The performance was recorded and later released as both a live album and a DVD, named Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra, through Temporary Residence Limited in Europe and America, and Human Highway in Asia. The band then took another year-long break and went into \"hibernation mode\", returning to Japan to work on songs for a new album.\n\nFor My Parents: 2012\u20132014\n\nMono spent early 2012 recording a new album at Waterfront Studios in Hudson, New York, with recording engineers Henry Hirsch, accompanied by the Wordless Music Orchestra.[5] The album was mixed by Fred Weaver at his studio, Apocalypse the Apocalypse, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. For My Parents was MONO's first record in eight years not to be recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago. For My Parents, was released on 4 September 2012, through Temporary Residence Limited.[6] The band's press release for For My Parents states \"We hope that this album serves as a gift from child to parent. While everything else continues to change, this love remains a constant throughout time.\"[6]\n\nThe Last Dawn/Rays of Darkness: 2014\u20132016\n\nMono released a double album on 24 October 2014, two contrasting records: The Last Dawn, being a more traditional Mono record; and Rays of Darkness, some of their heaviest material, even more notable for the first use of vocals on The Hand That Holds The Truth. The two were released on Temporary Residence Limited in North American and Pelagic Records elsewhere.[7]\n\nRequiem for Hell: 2016\u20132019\n\nMono announced the forthcoming release of Requiem For Hell on 19 July 2016, their ninth studio album. It reintroduces strings to their sound. It was also their first full album under the newly formed label Pelagic Records. Prior to the full release of Requiem For Hell they did a split album with The Ocean (Transcendental) to commemorate this event. Later it was known that it was actually a sneak peek of the first two songs of their upcoming album.[8] On December 9, 2017 they announced via their social media pages that Yasunori Takada (drum kit, glockenspiel, synthesizer), who has been a member since the start, will leave the band due to \"personal reasons.\" He was replaced by Dahm Majuri Cipolla beginning with the band's live performance on August 9, 2018.[9]\n\nStarting in August 2018, they worked on their next project with Steve Albini at Electrical once again. On September 25, 2018, the new album was revealed to be called Nowhere Now Here, their first with Cipolla, it was released January 25, 2019.[10]\n\nHymn to the Immortal Wind (10 Year Anniversary Edition)/Pilgrimage of the Soul/My Story, The Buraku Story/Heaven Vol. 1: 2019-present\n\nTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of MONO, and the 10th anniversary of Hymn to the Immortal Wind, Temporary Residence Ltd. released Hymn to the Immortal Wind - Anniversary Edition. Featuring remastered versions of the original.\n\nIn 2020, the band started touring Asia and Australia with more dates to follow in Europe and North America, but they were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band stopped the touring activity and began writing new music.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2020, Mono released a 2-track single called \"Scarlet Holliday\".[11] Firstly released only digitally, it was then released on vinyl on March 4, 2022 with a third extra track.[12]\n\nMeanwhile, the band released their 11th record Pilgrimage of the Soul on September 17, 2021. The album was recorded during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020 with the usual assistance of Steve Albini.[13] The single Riptide was released in July 2021 and anticipated the new album.\n\nAs the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic kept the band away from the stage, Mono composed their first soundtrack ever. My Story, The Buraku Story was released on vinyl on May 27, 2022.[14]\n\nFinally, the band played live for the first time in over 2 and a half years in June 2022 at Hellfest, and in August the new European tour kicked off the reprise of touring and live shows.[15] The European tour was followed by more dates in Asia, the UK and Australia throughout the year.\n\nIn December 2022, the band announced the beginning of a series of Christmas EPs named \"Heaven\" to be released every year on Christmas day. The goal of the series is to express is the light without anxiety and sadness in life.[16] Heaven Vol. 1 featured three brand new songs and was released digitally on December 25, 2022, to which a vinyl physical released followed in April 2023.\n\nMono entered the studio in February 2023[17] to record their 12th album once again at the Electrical Audio in Chicago with Steve Albini. The recording was completed on March 4 and the album is expected to be released in 2024.[18] They also announced a new European tour for spring 2023 with more festival dates to follow in the summer.[19]\n\nMusical style\n\nAlthough Mono's musical style has developed throughout their career, it has primarily been characterised by dynamic, guitar-based instrumental soundscapes, the majority of which are composed by lead guitarist Takaakira Goto, in an attempt to channel and express the emotions of joy and sorrow.[20] The band's style of music originally featured elements of minimalism and noise, and later developed to integrate more complex, orchestral arrangements and instrumentation.[21] Mono's music has been categorised as both contemporary classical[22] and post-rock,[23][24][25][26][27] but Goto has stated:\n\nMusic is communicating the incommunicable; that means a term like post-rock doesn't mean much to us, as the music needs to transcend genre to be meaningful. Takaakira Goto, Time Out[28]\n\nGoto performing in 2007; the band provides an emotional live performance\n\nMono has toured worldwide several times. Their live show tends to feature intense and emotional playing by the band members, as well as using extreme dynamics (in crescendos as well as diminuendos) in their attempt to create an \"unforgettable\" live performance.[29] When recording their music, the band has always played live in the studio and, from 2004's Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined to 2009's Hymn to the Immortal Wind, worked with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, whom they feel accurately captured a live band's \"raw emotion to [magnetic] tape.\"[30]\n\nInfluences\n\nMono has drawn influence from various musical and non-musical sources throughout their career. When the band first formed, their main influences were American experimental rock band Sonic Youth and Anglo-Irish shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine when making Under the Pipal Tree and One Step More and You Die.[1] As the band broadened their musical tastes, starting with the album, Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined, they began to be influenced by music from sources such as German classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven, Italian film score composer Ennio Morricone, and later Polish minimalist composer Henryk G\u00f3recki, among others.[20] Lead guitarist Takaakira Goto has also acknowledged Danish film director Lars von Trier (in particular the 1996 film, Breaking the Waves) as a major influence since the band's formation, in terms of expressing the different depths and heights of emotion.[20]\n\nInstrumentation\n\nIn terms of instrumentation, Mono is a four-piece instrumental rock band. Goto, the group's lead guitarist, uses a 1966 Fender Jazzmaster through Boss, Danelectro, SiB, and Morley effects pedals, into a Fender Twin, a Marshall JCM 2000 head, and a Marshall cabinet for amplification.[31] Yoda, the rhythm guitarist, uses a 1974 Fender Stratocaster through Boss, Tech 21 and Pro Co effects pedals, into a Fender Twin for amplification.[31] Kunishi, the group's bass guitarist, pianist and occasional guitarist uses a 1966 Gibson EB-3 through Boss, TC Electronic, and Tech 21 effects pedals, into an Ampeg B2-R head and a Sunn bass cabinet, as well as a Fender Rhodes, and a Fender Jazzmaster.[31] Takada, the drummer, uses a four-piece 1970s Ludwig drum kit, with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste cymbals, as well as a Korg microKORG synthesizer.[31]\n\nAs the band's career has progressed, they have incorporated string sections on record, beginning with Under the Pipal Tree, which featured use of cello, continuing with One Step More and You Die and Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined which both featured string quartets, and You Are There, which featured a string quintet.

Mono was the dominant format, particularly in the U.K., well into the late 1960s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour \u00bb\n\nImmediately apparent: the crisp impact of the single-channel mixes.\n\nMono focuses the potency of the Bill Wyman-Charlie Watts rhythm section and heightens the intensity of Brian Jones\u2019 and Keith Richards\u2019 guitar work. Then, of course, there\u2019s Mick Jagger\u2019s deliciously rubbery lead vocals.\n\nThe Stones\u2019 gloriously raw, sloppy approach to performance under producer Andrew Loog Oldham\u2019s guidance provided an alternative for anyone not immediately under the harmonious and sunny spell of the Fab Four.\n\nThere\u2019s a fair amount of repetition, especially among the first two-thirds of these albums, as there are overlaps between the U.K. and U.S. versions. (The 15-CD box set sells for $189.99 on Amazon.com, while the vinyl comes with a heftier $389.99 price tag.)\n\nBut what\u2019s genuinely illuminating about the set is the group\u2019s transformation from competent-but-unremarkable blues cover band into the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Band.\u201d This leap occurred over a five-year span between the albums book-ending this set: 1964\u2019s \u201cThe Rolling Stones\u201d and 1969\u2019s \u201cLet It Bleed.\u201d\n\nLike so many British musicians who came of age in the 1950s, Jagger, Richards, Jones, Wyman and Watts lived and breathed American roots music\u2014blues, soul and R&B.\n\nThe Beatles beat them to the punch commercially, but where the Beatles\u2019 tastes in trans-Atlantic music ran more toward Motown R&B and the rock pioneers such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry, the Stones started out as stone-cold blues enthusiasts.\n\nThe ringleader was guitarist Jones, who began the group expressly to play songs by the American blues men he loved: Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Elmore James and others.\n\nBut Jagger and Richards quickly followed the lead of John Lennon and Paul McCartney and started to write their own songs.\n\n\u201cOut Of Our Heads\u201d arrived in the U.K. in 1965, at which point the two songwriters were finding their voices in three striking originals: the swaggering \u201cThe Last Time,\u201d the sensuous \u201cThe Spider and the Fly\u201d and the breakthrough rocker \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThose were mixed in among increasingly convincing versions of more American roots tunes such as Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cHitch Hike\u201d and Don Covay and Ron Miller\u2019s \u201cMercy Mercy.\u201d\n\nThe signature Stones snarl arrives full blown at the end of the same year with \u201cDecember\u2019s Children (and Everybody\u2019s),\u201d the U.S. album that included \u201cGet Off My Cloud\u201d in addition to the group\u2019s disarming reading of Arthur Alexander\u2019s \u201cYou Better Move On.\u201d There\u2019s also one of the act\u2019s earliest attempts at covering American country music with Hank Snow\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Movin\u2019 On.\u201d\n\nThe album \u201cAftermath\u201d brings another step forward in the accomplishment of the Stones\u2019 own material, with \u201cUnder My Thumb,\u201d \u201cLady Jane\u201d and \u201cStupid Girl\u201d represented on the U.K. and U.S. versions, with the U.S. edition trading out the tranquilizer-focused \u201cMother\u2019s Little Helper\u201d for the utterly ominous \u201cPaint It, Black.\u201d\n\nWith the nascent psychedelia movement swirling around them, the Stones entered the fray fitfully in 1967 on the heels of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolver\u201d with the decidedly less assured \u201cBetween the Buttons.\u201d\n\nThen, following the musical revolution spearheaded by \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band,\u201d you could practically hear the Stones tearing the wrapping paper and ribbons off new studio toys they put to work for \u201cTheir Satanic Majesties Request,\u201d which was enlivened only briefly by \u201cShe\u2019s a Rainbow\u201d and the spacey \u201c2000 Light Years From Home.\u201d\n\nThe Stones opted to produce the album themselves, as Oldham was pulling away after getting fed up with their increasing erraticism in the studio.\n\nClearly prog-rock dalliances were not the Stones\u2019 strong suit. Fortunately, they found their blues-rooted mojo again, and as 1968 drew to a close they released \u201cBeggar\u2019s Banquet,\u201d the album their longtime engineer Glyn Johns has called \u201cthe Rolling Stones\u2019 coming of age\u2026The material was far better than anything they\u2019d ever done before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeggar\u2019s Banquet\u201d brought the world \u201cSympathy for the Devil,\u201d \u201cStreet Fighting Man,\u201d \u201cStray Cat Blues\u201d and \u201cNo Expectations,\u201d among the 10 tracks\u2014songs the group still includes in sets 50 years later. The same cannot be said for the vast majority of songs from the two previous albums.\n\nIt also was the first of their highly esteemed collaborations with producer Jimmy Miller, who also produced \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d-- the final studio album in the mono box set--and stayed on board for the string of albums many Stones fans consider their greatest run: \u201cBeggar\u2019s Banquet,\u201d \u201cLet It Bleed,\u201d \u201cSticky Fingers\u201d (1971) and \u201cExile on Main Street\u201d (1972). (Miller abandoned the Stones\u2019 ship after 1973\u2019s \u201cGoat\u2019s Head Soup.\u201d)\n\nThe bonus disc in the mono box set is \u201cStray Cats,\u201d a new compilation of hit singles, non-album tracks, B-sides and other rarities meant to take its place alongside previous compilations such as \u201cHigh Tide (And Green Grass),\u201d \u201cThrough the Past, Darkly,\u201d \u201cHot Rocks (and Fazed Cookies)\u201d and \u201cForty Licks.\u201d\n\nAmong its gems are the Italian-language version of \u201cAs Tears Go By\u201d (Con Le Mie Lacrime), two versions of \u201cPoison Ivy,\u201d their raucous version of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cBye Bye Johnny\u201d and the single mix of \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want.\u201d\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Beatles in 1970, the Stones assumed the crown of British rock royalty--at least until Led Zeppelin began to fully rear its shaggy mane. But that\u2019s a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll evolutionary tale for another day.\n\nrandy.lewis@latimes.com\n\nFollow @RandyLewis2 on Twitter.com\n\nFor Classic Rock coverage, join us on Facebook\n\nALSO\n\nConfessions of a Cubs fan\n\nBeatles family reunites at revamped 10th anniversary of \u2018Love\u2019 show in Las Vegas\n\nIt took the power of Batman and PlayStation VR to turn a skeptic in an almost-believer"}, {"url": "https://noelhogan.bandcamp.com/album/mono-band", "page_content": "\n\nShare / Embed\n\nabout\n\nDebut solo project by Cranberries Guitarist Noel Hogan, featuring collaborations with Alexandra Hamnede, Richard Walters, Kate Havnevik, Nicolas Leroux, Fin Chambers, Angie Hart, Soname Yangchen and Marius de Vries.\n\n\n\n\u201cA far cry from the sound of The Cranberries, Noel Hogan has explored \u2018liberating\u2019 electronic avenues with new project Monoband\u201d (Hot Press)\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first member of The Cranberries to release a solo album, Noel Hogan mat surprise many fans.\u201d (Sunday Times Culture)\n\n\n\n\u201cResonant new music that has Mercury Music Prize written all over it.
