They are the epitome of simplicity and serenity. The stones are all small (the reason for which is described below) and non-Quaker names appear here and there, including enslaved people and Native Americans who were often excluded from other church cemeteries of that era. Knowing more about Quaker funerals and burials will give us some insight.\n\nQuakers tended to have simple funerals. A funeral, called a memorial service, was usually held in a meeting house. Members gathered to honor and remember the deceased.\n\nThe service often began with an explanation by the Elders of what would happen during the meeting, because it was assumed that a number of mourners were not Quakers and would not know the Quaker customs. Then everyone sat in silent meditation. Some might share a memory with the congregation, but there was usually no eulogy given.\n\nA Quaker funeral was not a somber affair but rather a celebration of the life that was lived. In honor of this fact, Quakers did not wear black as a symbol of mourning and there was no prescribed mourning period for Quakers.\n\nQuaker Burial Grounds\n\nQuakers were not permitted to be buried in parish cemeteries in Britain, so as meetings (congregations) were established and land was purchased, they also acquired land for burial grounds. This practice was continued when the Quakers came to the colonies. Many, if not most, meetings had their own burial grounds unless a large city was nearby, where Quakers could be buried in municipal plots.\n\nThe Philadelphia Common practices varied from one meeting to another, but there was usually a funeral committee, made up of members of the meeting who had oversight of funerals and made necessary arrangements for the burials.\n\nHistorically, the deceased were buried in the next available lot. Some meetings allowed families to be buried adjoining lots, although this practice was not the norm. Most Quaker meetings differed from other denominations by allowing American Indians, slaves, and individuals of reduced circumstances to be buried in their burial grounds.\n\nBut no matter who the deceased person was, Quakers did not allow public displays of wealth or position in their cemeteries. For this reason, you will not find large stones or epitaphs in a Quaker burial ground; stones were kept small and of a uniform shape and size.\n\nIn each particular burial ground, such uniformity is preserved in respect to the materials, size, form and wording of the stones, as well as in the mode of placing them, as may effectually guard against any distinction being made in that place between the rich and the poor.\n\nOther Details\n\nHere are some other details about Quaker burial grounds:\n\nThe earliest Quaker burial grounds were simple fields of unmarked stone, in keeping with the discipline of simplicity.\n\nThe Philadelphia and Ohio Yearly Meetings did not permit tombstones until the late 1800s.\n\nIf there were any stones, they usually only provided the names of the deceased, their age or birth year, and date of death. Here is a guide to understanding Quaker dates.\n\nNot all individuals who were buried in the grounds are Quakers.\n\nNot all Quakers were buried in Quaker burial grounds.\n\nMost meetings did not keep careful records of the people interred in their lots; they relied instead on the memories of their members to know where to dig the next lot.\n\nSome meetings kept meticulous records of burials in plot maps.

Fox and his followers were dissatisfied with the conditions of the Church and believed that priests were unnecessary because everyone had a personal experience of the \u2018inner light of God.\u2019 Quakers have four principal values, called testimonies: \u2018equality and justice,\u2019 \u2018peace,\u2019 \u2018truth and integrity,\u2019 \u2018simplicity and sustainability.\u2019 Quakers refer to each other as Friends. Quaker meetings are led by two elders, but worship is unstructured and focused on finding God in \u2018stillness\u2019. These beliefs and practices are important aspects of Quaker funerals.\n\nThis guide explains Quaker beliefs about death and Quaker funeral traditions, including who can have a Quaker funeral and the etiquette and dress code for it.\n\nWhat are Quaker beliefs about death?\n\nQuakers do not have specific beliefs about what happens after we die, but hope that our spirit lives on in the family and friends we leave behind. Quakers believe that it is important to prepare for their death by writing a Will and recording funeral wishes to make things easier for their families after they die. Quaker communities also strive to provide compassion and support for bereaved families and friends after a funeral. Quakers do not have specific burial customs, and cremation is acceptable. Green funerals might appeal to Quakers because of their belief in sustainability.\n\nWhat happens at a Quaker funeral?\n\nThere is no formal structure or order of service at a Quaker funeral, and the emphasis is on \u2018simplicity and stillness\u2019. The meeting is introduced by a Friend responsible for the funeral, usually an elder, who will explain what happens to mourners who are unfamiliar with Quakerism. At a Quaker funeral anyone can speak and say something about their loved one who has died. They might break the silence by saying a prayer, giving a reading from the Bible, sharing memories of the person, or reciting funeral poems. Some programmed tributes, including classical music for funerals or popular funeral songs, might be included in it. Quakers generally do not sing funeral hymns at a service. At the end of the funeral one of the Friends responsible for the funeral will signal that the coffin should be withdrawn and shake hands with the other elder. The funeral ends with all of the mourners shaking hands with each other. Quaker funerals can be held in a Quaker meeting house, a crematorium, or any other preferred venue, including at the graveside of the person who has died. For more information, we have a full guide to cremations that you will find useful.\n\nWho can have a Quaker funeral?\n\nMost Quaker funerals are for Friends who are part of a particular community, but anyone can attend a Quaker meeting at any time and can express a wish for a Quaker funeral. If a Friend does not have a Quaker funeral, a later memorial might be held at the Quaker Meeting Hall. Memorial meetings are often convened at weekends so that more Friends can attend them. Recording the deaths of Friends and arranging Quaker funerals is organised by the Area Meeting. Some meeting houses have funeral subcommittees who liaise with the family of the person who has died. Funeral directors can assist Quakers in other aspects of the funeral, such as liaising with a burial ground, or crematorium.\n\nWhat is the etiquette and dress code for a Quaker funeral?\n\nQuakers do not have a dress code for a funeral. Respecting the silence and stillness is an important aspect of the etiquette for a Quaker funeral, and it is common to have a brief pause between contributions from mourners.\n\nWhat happens after a Quaker funeral?\n\nThere are no traditional rituals for what happens after a Quaker funeral or memorial service, and bereaved families can choose whether they have a funeral reception or wake. Quakers believe that funerals are for the living and the purpose of them is to support bereaved family and friends by expressing love for the person who has died in whatever way is best for them. If you need to organise one, we have a full guide to wakes with everything you'll need to know.\n\nFind a funeral director Comprehensive listings to compare funeral directors near you Compare funeral directors near you Search 85,996 verified reviews"}, {"url": "https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-park-hundreds-bodies-buried-2916963", "page_content": "From things to see and do, to in-depth features of those who make up our thriving, eclectic and buzzing city - with the BristolBuzz, get your weekly dispatch of what's going on in Bristol city centre straight to your inbox\n\nTucked away in a surprisingly tranquil location, sandwiched between St Mary Redcliffe church and Phoenix Wharf, is a small, triangular piece of land known as the Quaker\u2019s Burial Ground. As the name suggests this was the burial ground for the city\u2019s Quaker population, from when it was established in 1665 until the final burial in 1923.\n\nNow a public park, the area still holds one of the most intriguing remnants from Bristol\u2019s history - The Hermit\u2019s Cave. The manmade cave was carved into the soft, sandstone rocks during the 14th century and in 1346 became home to its first hermit - a man named John Sparkes.\n\nSparkes was employed to live a solitary life where he would pray for the fortunes and good health of his master, Thomas Lord Berkeley and would in return be paid in food and shelter. Although he was the first, John Sparkes was not the last hermit to take up residence in the cave.\n\nRead more: Old photos show Bristol landmarks captured through the decades\n\nOver the centuries, this small alcove was the home of a succession of men who had chosen a humble life of self-denial and devotion. Very little is known of these hermits but by the 18th century the park had become a burial ground for the city\u2019s large and influential Quaker population and the hermitage ceased to be used.\n\nAlthough many of the most prominent Bristol Quaker families profited from the West African slave trade in its early years, they eventually became amongst the first religious organisations to oppose it. Their campaigns in Bristol are thought to have played a major role in turning the public\u2019s opinion against the trade in human beings.\n\nBy the 1920s the small burial ground was not only extremely crowded but seemed something of an extravagance for an organisation which now supported cremation as a means of body disposal and the plot of land was gifted to the city in the 1950s. An eerie reminder of what happened next can be found in the Hermit\u2019s Cave, where almost 180 headstones are now piled up behind the railings.\n\nTo allow for road expansions, it was decided the plot of land would become a small park and the headstones would be removed. There are now plaques in the quiet green space, explaining its past to the few people who find it.\n\nOne recent reviewer wrote on Google: \"A small secret garden in a busy city. Not much to see but it was interesting to see that among all the trees there was a fig tree, wild artichokes and rhubarb growing. At the back of the gardens there is a small man made locked cave which holds over 170 gravestones.\"\n\nAccording to a report in a volume of Bristol and Avon Archaeology, dated 1996, referenced 11 Quaker burial sites in the Bristol area - in Brislington, Chipping Sodbury, Downend, Frenchay, Kingsweston, Lower Hazel, Portishead, Quakers Friars, Redcliff Pit and Thombury and Workhouse.\n\nIt said of the Redcliffe Pit location: \"The human remains were exhumed and reinterred in Avon View Cemetery...A number of rectangular memorial stones are stored in \u2018St John the Baptist Hermitage\u2019, a small cave or grotto in the rock at the south end.\"\n\nRead next:"}, {"url": "https://flickeringlamps.com/2020/04/17/the-lost-burying-ground-of-londons-quakers/", "page_content": "Bunhill Fields, just to the north of the City of London, is one of the capital\u2019s most famous burial grounds and particularly noted as the final resting place of many of London\u2019s nonconformist Christians. Close to Bunhill Fields is another green space, its history as a burial ground much less conspicuous than that of its famous neighbour. But like Bunhill Fields, Quaker Gardens has a long history of burial and religious dissent. I visited Quaker Gardens on a sunny winter afternoon in early 2020 to see what remained of this historic site.\n\nQuaker Gardens, as its name suggests, served as a major place of burial for London-based members of the Quaker movement from the 1660s to the 1850s. The story of this burial ground, and the reasons why it exists separate to Bunhill Fields, helps to tell the story of the Quakers in London: their beliefs, their practices, and their evolving role in this particular corner of the city.\n\nThe Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as Quakers, first emerged in the 1650s. It was one of many \u2018nonconformist\u2019 or \u2018dissenter\u2019 Protestant sects that broke away from, or sought to reform, the mainstream Church of England during the 17th Century. George Fox, the founder of the Quaker movement, believed that the relationship between an individual and God was an intensely personal one \u2013 and that the need for a church or priests to express one\u2019s relationship with God was not necessary. These ideas brought Fox into conflict with the Church of England, and he was sent to prison on numerous occasions. The term \u2018Quaker\u2019 was first used for Fox and his followers as a derogatory term linked to Fox\u2019s quoting of a biblical passage about \u2018trembl[ing] at the Word of the Lord.\u2019 Although it began as a derisive nickname, the term \u2018Quaker\u2019 soon became more neutral and was used by Friends and others alike.\n\nQuakers became known for their plain dress and teetotalism, their opposition to war and slavery, and their refusal to swear oaths. Rather than attending structured services in a church or chapel led by a minister, Quakers met at a Meeting House and a Quaker meeting might simply consist of Friends sitting and praying in silence. Although the various nonconformist congregations had a common cause in their dissent from the established Protestant Church of England, the Quakers were often singled out for persecution due to their radical beliefs. Their refusal to take oaths brought them into conflict with a law passed in 1662 which required all subjects to pledge their allegiance to the King, while those spreading Quaker teachings were jailed for causing public disturbances and blasphemy. At a time when expressing one\u2019s faith in a different way to the established Church of England was forbidden, the Quakers were seen as dangerous and subversive.\n\nThe Quaker burial ground is a little older than the main nonconformist ground at Bunhill Fields \u2013 burials of Quakers began here in 1661, and Holmes notes that the Friends had \u2018their own special dead-carts\u2019 during the devastating plague outbreak of 1665. It\u2019s thought that around 1,000 Quakers perished during the plague and were buried in this space. Bunhill Fields \u2013 originally known as Tindal\u2019s Burying Ground after John Tindal, who took over the land\u2019s lease from the City of London \u2013 came into use in 1665. In the mid-17th Century, this area north of Moorgate and the city walls was largely open space, with some areas used for archery practice, and others for windmills.\n\nBy the middle of the 18th Century, the area around the Quaker burial ground and Bunhill Fields was becoming more built up. John Rocque\u2019s famous London map of 1746, an extract of which is pictured below, shows buildings and gardens in the vicinity of the burial grounds, with new roads laid out. This development meant that the Quaker ground was now wholly separate from the main body of Bunhill Fields.\n\nUnlike Bunhill Fields, which is crowded with tombs and memorials, the Quaker burial ground was never filled with headstones. Isabella Holmes, writing in The London Burial Grounds in the 1890s, was complimentary of the Quakers\u2019 approach to burial and to the maintenance of their burial grounds \u2013 as well as their \u2018neat and clean\u2019 cemeteries, she was impressed by their \u2018praiseworthy self-control by not wearing mourning [clothes], by avoiding useless expense at funerals, and ostentatious tombstones, memorials, and epitaphs.\u2019 This approach to burial and mourning was in keeping with the Quaker commitment to simplicity and their belief in equality.\n\nA single exception was made: for George Fox, but this was not without controversy. Fox had been buried in 1691 in the same manner as his fellow Quakers, with no marked grave, but a small plaque with the initials \u2018G F\u2019 was later attached to the wall of the burial ground. This attracted visitors from all over the country, which angered a \u2018zealous\u2019 member of the Friends, Robert Howard. Holmes reported that Howard considered this memorial to Fox, and the visitors it drew to the burial ground, to be idolatrous, and ordered it to be destroyed. The little headstone that commemorates Fox today is a more modern addition to the burial ground.\n\nAlthough the burial ground close to Bunhill Fields was the largest place of rest for London\u2019s Quakers, other graveyards were established for Friends, many of which disappeared long before the mass closures of London\u2019s urban burial grounds in the mid-19th Century. One such ground was in Covent Garden. John Rocque\u2019s 1746 map of London shows a \u2018Meeting House Court\u2019 north of Long Acre, with an entrance on Drury Lane. The burial ground is not indicated on the map, but may well have been adjacent to the meeting house. In 1757, the lease on the land ran out and burials ceased. This burial ground was then built over, and the bones buried there were rediscovered during building work in the 1890s. The remains of the Quakers buried there were then exhumed and reburied at the Quaker burial ground in Isleworth, Middlesex.\n\nAs the 19th Century wore on, the number of Quakers living in the area close to Bunhill Fields dwindled. Burial records show that many of those laid to rest in the Quaker burial ground were living in other parts of London \u2013 the very last burial to take place was that of Herbert Clarke of Ebury Street, Westminster, who was buried on 3rd September 1854. The burial ground officially closed to new burials on 1st January 1855. Although not in an overcrowded or squalid state, like many urban burial grounds, the central London location of the Quaker burial ground meant that its continued use was deemed to be a risk to the health of local residents \u2013 one of the key arguments in support of closing inner-city burual grounds was that the presence of so many decomposing bodies was hazardous to those living nearby.\n\nDuring the 19th Century, development in the area continued to encroach on the burial ground. Part of it was lost to a road-widening scheme, and in the 1870s parts of the burial ground were sold off for the development of a school and dwellings. This was the western section of the burial ground, pictured on the excerpt from Roque\u2019s 1746 map above, but replaced by a Mission Hall and a school in the Ordnance Survey map from the 1890s pictured below. The burials disturbed by the road-widening and the building of the Mission Hall were reburied in a different part of the burial ground.\n\nBy the later part of the 19th Century the streets between Whitecross Street and Bunhill Row were overcrowded and poverty-stricken. The disused burial ground sat derelict for about twenty years, before being used as a site for a \u2018gospel tent\u2019, where services were held for local people. The gospel tent proved popular enough that an iron structure, large enough to set 400 people, was erected in 1875. When the Metropolitan Board of Works purchased a part of the burial ground for a road-widening scheme, they paid compensation to the Society of Friends and it was this money that helped to pay for a permanent Mission Hall at the site. In the late 19th Century, various religious groups founded \u2018missions\u2019 in poor districts of London to provide education, recreation and welfare facilities for the poor, as well as often providing alcohol-free alternatives to pubs and music halls. The Bunhill Memorial Mission Hall, designed by two Quaker architects, was opened in 1881 and included classrooms and lodging rooms, a coffee house, medical facilities and committee rooms as well as a Quaker Meeting House.\n\nOnly a fragment of the sprawing Mission Hall remains today, due to a rocket attack during the Second World War which destroyed most of the Hall. The map commissioned by the London County Council (LCC) to record in detail the extent of damage to the capital\u2019s buildings by enemy action during World War II shows us the devastation in this part of town; the excerpt pictured below, showing Quaker Gardens and some of the streets betwen Bunhill Row and Whitecross Street, shows large areas coloured in purple, indicating buildings damaged beyond repair. The large circle, slightly to the west of Quaker Gardens, indicates the impact site of a V1 flying bomb. These fearful weapons, nicknamed \u2018doodlebugs\u2019, had the firepower to take out an entire street, and unlike bombs dropped from aeroplanes, Londoners had far less warning of the approach of a doodlebug. The section of the Mission Hall shaded in yellow (indicating minor blast damage) is the little building we see today.\n\nThe remaining fragment of the Mission Hall, originally the site caretaker\u2019s house, was converted to a Quaker Meeting House after the Second World War and its still fulfils this purpose today; a more modest Quaker presence at one of the oldest Quaker sites in the capital. Its large windows and neat brickwork designs give us some idea of how the larger Mission Hall may have looked.\n\nThe remainder of the burial ground left untouched by development was laid out as a garden after the Mission Hall was completed, and became a public park after the Second World War, managed by Islington Borough Council. The larger portion of the park is given over to a children\u2019s playground, with other sections landscaped and planted. One area is railed off and designated a dog-free area; it is this section where George Fox\u2019s memorial and the surviving, bomb-damaged stone tablet detailing the histroy of the site can be found.\n\nI visited Quaker Gardens on a sunny Saturday afternoon whilst covering a route for an upcoming tourguiding class. Children were playing football in the playground, their parents gathered in a group to chat and pass the time. Birds chirped and flew from tree to tree. Although only a short distance from the high glass towers of the City of London, this part of London remains largely residential and still predominantly working-class in flavour, despite a great deal of gentrification in recent years. Most of the homes here are postwar social housing developments, with a few older schemes \u2013 such as the distinctive yellow Peabody buildings pictured in the background of the photograph below \u2013 surviving the Blitz and the march of redevelopment in the decades since. Quaker Gardens is less of a haven for City workers during their lunchbreak and more of a garden for local people to relax, play, walk their dogs and socialise.\n\nThe scene is dominated by Braithwaite House, a 19-storey tower block named after Joseph Bevan Braithwaite, Jr, one of the founders of the Mission Hall in the 1870s. He was the son of two Quaker ministers, Joseph Bevan Braithwaite Sr (a well-known conservative within the Quaker movement) and his wife Martha Gillett. Braithwaite Jr was a stockbroker, and played an important role in the early development of electricity supply and infrastructure in Britain at the end of the 19th Century.\n\nBraithwaite House has some interesting tales of its own. Most notoriously, it has a link to the Kray Twins, the infamous East End gangsters. When the family home in Bethnal Green was earmarked for demolition, Violet, mother of Ronnie and Reggie Kray, moved to Flat 43 in Braithwaite House and it was while meeting with associates in this flat that the Kray twins were apprehended by police in May 1968.\n\nI enjoyed the peace and simplicity of Quaker Gardens, particularly the little railed-off section where George Fox\u2019s memorial resides. It feels a world away from the City of London, and is entirely different to its famous neighbour on the other side of Bunhill Row. It is not a place for admiring ornate old gravestones, but its modern-day purpose as a place of relaxation and peace seems very fitting for a site that\u2019s been associated with the Quaker movement for over 350 years.\n\nReferences and further reading\n\nQuaker Gardens, London Gardens Online\n\nQuakers around Shoreditch\n\nQuakers in the City, 2nd edition (PDF)\n\nFriends Meeting House, Bunhill Fields (PDF)\n\nNotes for visitors to Bunhill (PDF)\n\nMrs Basil Holmes \u2013 The London Burial Grounds: notes on their history from the earliest times to the present day, Macmillan and Co, 1896"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03376715", "page_content": "Alexandria Gazette 1933 Leadbeater Relics on \u201cBlock\u201d Today.

This work was undertaken on behalf of the Quaker\u2019s Committee.\n\nThe Matthew Good Foundation kindly donated \u00a31,000.This was used for the purchase of trees, plants and materials to carry out the work.\n\nThe broken perimeter hedge/fence was repaired and new defensive planting installed. This was done to form just 2 entrances/exits. The privet was given a light trim.\n\nA kerb and limestone chippings were placed around the 7 stones that originated in the Hodgson St and Owstwick Burial Grounds. This provides a great focal point for these historically important stones. The Quaker\u2019s are looking to provide an information board to explain the origin of the stones. There already is a board explaining the presence of the Quaker burial ground.\n\nThe dilapidated headstone of Joseph Heward, the first Quaker burial in the cemetery, was re-laid and straightened. Several other fallen kerb stones were straightened. Moss was carefully removed from the lettering on the headstones to enable them to be more easily read.\n\nA \u2018Rest and Contemplation\u2019 bench was erected in the SW corner. This was formed from a large sycamore branch that fell near the cholera monument a year or so ago.\n\nOther fallen branches were chipped and laid as a path leading from the 2 entrances to the new bench.\n\nNew planting\n\nThe laurel bushes were pruned back to give a more formal appearance. Several shrubs and plants were planted to complement the existing plants. These including Fatsia Japonica, Choisya, Euonymus, Agapanthus and ornamental grasses.\n\nA thousand spring bulbs have been ordered for planting in Autumn. These include wild garlic, English bluebells, snowdrops, crocus and daffodils. Hopefully these will provide a riot of colour in the spring.\n\nA specimen laburnum was also planted to provide early summer colour after the bulbs have finished their display.\n\nA shallow watering dish was placed in a shady area of the burial ground. This will provide a water source for birds and small mammals.\n\nA short, on-site, talk about the Quakers in Hull and the work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery, was given by the Quakers on the afternoon of Saturday 21st August.\n\nThe volunteers gave a guided tour around the cemetery to the U3A, AWAKE history group during August, generating \u00a336.00 in donations."}, {"url": "https://quakerspeak.com/video/how-are-quaker-cemeteries-different/", "page_content": "How are Quaker graveyards different? Early Quakers believed that ornate gravestones communicated the dominion of the upper classes, even in death. Earlham College professor Thomas Hamm takes us through the history of Quaker cemeteries.\n\nPhotos: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nResources:\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nEarly Quakers believed that ornate gravestones communicated the dominion of the upper classes, even in death. Do you think this still applies today?\n\nWhat would you like to have on your tombstone? Would you be OK with a simple Quaker tombstone?\n\nTranscript:\n\nSince the beginning of the Quaker movement, one of the ways that Friends have distinguished themselves is in their practices connected with death and burial, and Quaker burying grounds, Quaker cemeteries\u2014although cemetery is a word that Friends probably didn\u2019t use until at least the 19th century\u2014are unusual. They are an illustration of how Friends tried to distinguish themselves from the rest of the world.\n\nHow Quaker Cemeteries are Different\n\nFriends believed that, as it was inappropriate to try to elevate some people above others in life, it was equally inappropriate to do that in death. Thus, Friends banned tombstones from their burying grounds because they thought that all that tombstones did was to distinguish some people from others.\n\nEquality in Life, Equality in Death\n\nWhen Quakers attended church in their parishes in 17th century England, in those churches they would\u2019ve been surrounded by memorials. In some cases grandiose tombs, that even in death were intended to communicate that the upper classes\u2014the people who had sat in the front-most pews by life\u2014still exercised dominion, even in death, by the way that they had buried themselves.\n\nFriends felt it appropriate, required of them, that even in death that they bear testimony against such practices that served to puff up human vanity.\n\nEarly Quaker Burial Grounds\n\nSo in a Quaker burying ground in the 17th and 18th centuries, most likely when you approached it you would have seen a simple, unbroken spans of Earth. Usually consisting entirely of unmarked graves. There were always some Friends who found that unacceptable. They certainly didn\u2019t want grandiose monuments that spoke to how some families were superior to others, but they could see nothing wrong with a simple stone that helped them remember where a loved one was buried.\n\nModern Quaker Cemeteries\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, Friends finally decided that under certain circumstances, marking graves could be appropriate, and so Friends moved towards a new testimony on tombstones. Tombstones would be allowed, but they had to be simple. The name of the deceased, the date of death and the age, or maybe the date of birth. No ornamentation, no epitaphs, no decoration of any kind, and usually strict limits on height and width.\n\nIf you go, for example, to London Grove Meeting, Chester county, Pennsylvania, a Meeting that goes back to the 18th century, and look at the burying ground, there\u2019s maybe one marker before 1850. But if you go to, say, Gwynedd or Chichester or Old Caln, you\u2019ll find the burying ground full of simple, rough stones, going back into the 18th century.\n\nThe views expressed in this video are of the speakers and do not necessarily reflect the views of Friends Journal or its collaborators.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://nha.org/research/nantucket-history/history-topics/how-many-people-are-buried-in-the-quaker-cemetery-on-the-corner-of-madaket-road-and-quaker-road/", "page_content": "No one knows for sure, but it is estimated that approximately five thousand people are buried in the apparently empty field (originally known as the Friends Burial Ground). There are only 56 headstones on the north side. A sign explains that these marked graves are of members of the Hicksite and Gurneyite branches of Quakerism. More conservative members of the Religious Society of Friends considered attachment to earthly remains a type of idolatry, and they regarded the Hicksites and Gurneyites as \u201cheretical Friends.\u201d\n\nThis cemetery is the second one used by Nantucket\u2019s Quakers to bury their dead. An earlier one was located further west somewhere along Madaket Road. Burials there began in 1709, soon after many Nantucketers became \u201cconvinced\u201d Quakers.\n\nThere was a Quaker meetinghouse at the site of this first cemetery, but as the number of Nantucketers embracing Quakerism increased exponentially, that meetinghouse proved too small. What is more, the town was relocating eastward from its first site around Capaum Pond, Maxcy\u2019s Pond, and the North Head of Hummock Pond to its present site. The first Quaker meetinghouse was abandoned in 1731 and a second one was erected at the corner of Madaket Road and Quaker Road where the cemetery is today.\n\nBurials in the old cemetery continued until 1760, but the first burial at the new site took place in 1732. For a short time, despite the lack of a fence or headstones, the old Quaker burial ground could still be located, because the first meetinghouse still stood there, but the abandoned building burned down in 1736. Then\u2014just as the Quakers would have wanted\u2014their first burial place was lost to memory. Despite indications on the 1858 Walling Map and the 1869 Ewer Map, no one knows for sure exactly where it was.\n\nIn 1792 the Quakers demolished their meetinghouse on the corner of Madaket and Quaker Roads and built two new ones in town, leaving more room for burials. Now fenced, and with only the relatively few headstones, it gives no clue to how many human remains were buried there.\n\nRobert Lowell memorialized the field in his poem The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket, in which he speaks of \u201cthis field of Quakers in their unstoned graves.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Nantucket\u2019s cemeteries and burial places, see Frances Karttunen\u2019s book, Nantucket Places and People 4: Underground, available from the NHA Museum Shop."}, {"url": "https://www.darlingtonquakers.org/our-heritage/the-burial-ground/", "page_content": "The Burial Ground\n\nBehind the Friends Meeting House lies a large and peaceful burial ground where many of the names on the simple headstones record the Quaker families who influenced the history of Darlington. (PDF document records are attached below this description text).\n\nThis land has been used as a burial ground by Darlington\u2019s Quaker population since the 18th century. Before that time there are suggestions adjacent plots were used, but what happened to these graves when buildings were erected is not clear. Initially, all headstones were banned. Marking a person in this way could be seen as elevating them above others, which goes against the testimony of equality. By the time of our first headstone, Quakers had come to an agreement that a small, simple stone would be appropriate, marking the name, date of death, and age. However, Quakers objected to using those names of days and months which derived from pagan gods; they substituted numbers, thus Sunday was for them \"First Day.\" The move from the Julian Calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 can therefore cause some confusion, as the first month was March and then became January. Thankfully The oldest headstone at Darlington is 1789, so all first months refer to January. Headstones were never obligatory, and many burials have no marker.\n\nSome time in the 1950\u2019s full burials were ceased, but interment of ashes is still performed. Plots can be subdivided for family and where interment of ashes has been performed up to six subdivisions can be possible per plot. These are indicated by letters (A-F) appended to the plot number. Some Quakers also request that ashes are scattered, which is a less formal process. These scatterings are sometimes in common areas with no plot number, or around a plot where there is a family connection. This list will indicate, where known, the status of the burial/scattering.\n\nWe publish burials from 1789 as show in the attched document records. We do not hold the earlier records, all burial records within Durham General Meeting as existing in 1840 were surrendered to the Public Record Office following public registration in 1837. Friends within the Yearly Meeting made digests of all burials c. 1660- 1837 based on Quarterly Meeting boundaries. These digests are held at Durham County Records Office under the following references:\n\n1628-1837, SF/Du/QM/7/8, M5/128\n\n1655-1840, SF/Du/QM/7/6, M5/128\n\n1655-1816, SF/Du/QM/7/9, M5/128\n\n1789, SF/Du/QM/7/12, M5/128\n\nThe Burial Ground is open to the public and is an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the heart of Darlington town centre.

There, in about 1662/3, the largest community of Quakers in Scotland was based on land given to Friends by the family Jaffray of Kingswells.\n\nThe first Quaker school in the country opened there in 1681 in the cottage beside the Meeting House, teaching \u2018the Latin toung and other commendable learning\u2019. The community flourished, with cobblers, tailors, blacksmiths and a wool mill. The school closed in 1807, but annual meetings were held until the Second World War. The Meeting House no longer belongs to the Society of Friends.\n\nAcross the road, the rectangular burial ground was associated with the parish of Ellon, northwest of Aberdeen. The earliest recorded burial is 1710, but there may have been earlier burials, as headstones were not in keeping with early Quaker beliefs. All but one of the headstones are of a simple design, a sandstone slab with a semicircular top and V-cut letters.\n\nIt is recorded that an Aberdeen Friend, Hamish Milne, was holidaying in Kinmuck as a small boy. He was fascinated by the lid of the Quaker mort safe with padlock, key and spanner, formerly in the corner of the graveyard. It is said to be now in the Museum of the Medical Department of Aberdeen University.\n\nFor many years this burial ground was cared for by Ann & Colin Millar, members of Aberdeen Meeting.\n\nKingswells\n\nKingswells burial ground lies close to the new A90 road, 4\u00bd miles west of Aberdeen, and only 200 yards north west of the 17th century manor house of Kingswells, which belonged to the Jaffrey family. Alexander Jaffrey, a famous provost of Aberdeen who did a lot to enrich the lives of his fellow citizens, is buried here.\n\nJaffrey became a Friend in 1662, and was largely responsible for the founding of the community of Kinmuck. Kingswells meeting house might have been demolished when the gardens of Kingswell House were developed.\n\nThe names of ten people are recorded as buried at Kingswells, half of whom belonged to the Jaffrey household. None of the graves is marked.\n\nThe burial ground, dating from before 1673, lies in the middle of a field with no path to it. It was once surrounded by a wall which became ruinous and was repaired, and there is no longer a gate into the burial ground. The graveyard is largely overgrown with trees.\n\nKingswells burial ground\n\nUry\n\nA few miles northwest of Stonehaven, and 14 miles south of Aberdeen, there was a burial ground at the village of Ury. Little remains there now except the \u2018Houff\u2019, the burial vault of the Barclay family.\n\nUry House is now a ruined mansion. It is recorded that Colonel David Barclay purchased \u2018Urie\u2019 in the late 1660s and his descendants owned it until 1854. In the 17th century Ury was established, by David Barclay, as the centre of north-east Scotland\u2019s Quaker movement.\n\nThe second laird was Robert Barclay, the Quaker apologist, theologian & author, who was interred in the burial ground in 1690, aged 41yrs.\n\nAberdeen\n\nWe know, from the old records, that there was a burial ground on the Gallowgate opposite the site of the college, which possibly now lies under the present high-rise flats, or just to the west of them. This was used for burial from 1672 but can no longer be seen.\n\nThe purchase of the land was funded by Robert Barclay and his friend, the Viscountess Conway of Ragley Hall, Worcestershire. Aberdeen Quakers were persecuted during this period, and the walls of the burial ground were repeatedly demolished by the town council.\n\nMary Dower, Aberdeen Local Meeting\n\nWith additional information from www.canmore.org.uk"}], "Mayhew Foster died in 1823.": [{"url": "https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Mayhew-1258", "page_content": "John Mayhew\n\nJun 1747 in Heveningham, Suffolk, England Bornin\n\nAncestors\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nDescendants\n\n1823 at about age 75 in Westhall, Suffolk, England Diedin\n\nProfile last modified 13 Nov 2021 | Created 4 Jul 2018\n\nThis page has been accessed 275 times.\n\nBiography\n\nBirth\n\nJohn Mayhew was born in June of 1747 in Heveningham, Suffolk, England.

It has borne no mean part in the moral development, while aiding in the material progress of the country. The state of maine owes much to those bearing this patronymic, many of whom are still numbered among its citizens.\n\n\n\n(I) William Mahew was a citizen and grocer of the parish of St. Peter's, Poule's wharfe, London, where record of him first appears in the will of his father-in-law, John Drayton, a brewer, of St. Giles, Cripplegate, London, dated Saturday, Dec. 31, 1373. This will was proved Monday, after the feast of St. Valentine (Feb. 14), 1373. By its provisions Mahew was to receive a tenement in Goldynglane, on condition that he pay debts of Drayton to an amount equivalent to the value of said tenement. Mahew died in 1392, and his will was probated between that year and 1397.\n\n\n\n(II) Robert Mahew, of Goldynglane, St. Giles, Cripplegate, recieved a grant of a tenement in the manor of Talmage's, in the parish of Brockley, county of Suffolk, in 1399-1400.\n\n\n\n(III) John, of Brockley, son of Robert (1) Mahew, was a juryman in 1405.\n\n\n\n(IV) Robert (2), son of John Mahew, of Brockley, living in 1431, left two sons, Thomas and John. The latter was rector of St. Catherine's by the Tower, London.\n\n\n\n(V) Thomas, son of Robert (2) Mayhew, of Brockley, and of the parish of St. Nicholas, Coldabbey, London, died in 1457, as shown by the record of his will.\n\n\n\n(VI) John (2) Mayhew, of Brockley, had sons, John and Thomas. The line of the former is still extant.\n\n\n\n(VII) Thomas (2), second son of John (2) Mayhew, settled in Clipesby, county of Norfolk, where his will was probated in 1498.\n\n\n\n(VIII) Thomas (3), son of Thomas (2) Mayhew, of Clipesby, died 1531. He married Margery, daughter of John Jele, of that place. Her mother was Margery, daughter of John Collett, D.

His wife Elinor was a daughter of William Babbington and his wife, Ellen Aldersey; Anna, wife of Governor Mayhew. The last named married (second) Grace, widow of Robert Paine, of London. He was a merchant residing in Southampton, England, until 1631, when he sailed for Boston, Mass. in the ship \"Griffin.\" He settled in Watertown, Mass., and was appointed one of three commissioners to lay out the bounds of that town, March 6, 1632. In July of the next year he was appointed administrator of the estate of Ralph Glover. He was admitted a freeman May 14, 1634, and was representative to the general court of Massachusetts Bay colony from 1636 to 1641, inclusive, and 1643-44. He conducted stores in both Watertown and Medford.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1641, he purchased from William Alexander, first Lord Sterling, the islands of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Elizabeth Islands, and became governor of these islands in 1645, settling on Martha's Vineyard. On July 8, 1671, he and his grandson, Matthew, received a grant of the manor of Tilbury, conditioned on the annual payment of two barrels of good codfish to be delivered at the bridge of the fort in New York City. Governor Mayhew presided at the first general court at Edgartown June 18, 1672. His grandson Matthew was secretary.

At the end of the war, G\u00f6ring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported G\u00f6ring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because G\u00f6ring weighed more than 300 pounds (140 kg). . Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that G\u00f6ring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom G\u00f6ring - as the commander of the Luftwaffe - had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a.45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn\"t reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled G\u00f6ring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" G\u00f6ring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he\"d been picked up. I wouldn\"t say it changed my view of the war, but it showed me that there are.. Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people.\" G\u00f6ring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities. By October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to brigadier general, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971. A native of Richmond, Virginia, Foster graduated in 1937 with a degree in English from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The couple had one daughter, Susan Carol Foster Korkalo (1944\u20132007). Foster received the Silver Star for his wartime service in southern France in 1944. lieutenant was not until 2009 that he received the French Legion of Honor, when Pierre Vimont, the French Ambassador to the United States, released a letter hailing Foster for his \"personal, precious contribution to the United States\" decisive role in the liberation of our country during World World War World War II\" Foster died at the age of ninety-nine in a nursing home in Missoula, Montana.

Notes\n\nThomas Mayhew Sr, known even to this day on Martha's Vineyard as \"The Governor\", immigrated to Massachusettes in 1631/2 as an agent for a London merchant. He quickly entered into prominance in the political and business life of the 'boom' years of Puritan immigration, the 1630's. In the 1640's he acquired the title to Martha's Vineyard and followed an advance settlement of that island by his son by several years. There he established a minor 'fiefdom' of his own, ruling the\n\nisland with singular authority and nepotism. Following the death of his son Thomas in 1657, he continued the missionary work to the Indians begun by Thomas, establishing the basis for 5 generations of missionary work to the natives. He also entrenched his political authority on the Island when the lands of Martha's Vineyard were transferred to the Duke of York in 1663 by petitioning the Duke and once again being granted sole authority on the island. Surviving, at the age of 81, a rebellion against his autocratic rule by over half the population of the island in 1673, he left firmly established family control of Martha's Vineyard to his grandson, Matthew Mayhew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks, History of Martha's Vineyard, Vol 1\n\n\n\nOf the childhood, education, and early business training of Thomas\n\nMayhew of Tisbury, nothing defininte is known. It is presumed that he\n\nlived in Tisbury during his youth, and was educated in the parish\n\nschool under the care of his parents. When his father died, he was\n\ntwenty-one. We know that he became a merchant, but not where he\n\nserved his apprenticeship. Daniel Gookin, who knew him personally,\n\nsays he was \"a merchant bred in England, as I take it at Southampton.\"\n\nThis seaport town was, in that period, one of the most important\n\ncommercial centers in England, ranking with Bristol as secondary to\n\nthe great port of London. Among the great merchants of London, Mr.\n\nMatthew Cradock was an early adventurer in American Colonial\n\nenterprize and was among the first to support the companies engaged in\n\nthe colonization of New England. In the course of business it is to\n\nbe supposed Mayhew became known to Cradock and thus laid the\n\nfoundation for their later business relations.\n\nAt the accession of Charles the First in 1625, Thomas Mayhew was\n\nthirty-two years old and had probably been in business for himself for\n\nabout a dozen years, since his father's death. Before 1618 he had\n\nmarried a woman whose name has come down by tradition as Abigail\n\nParkus. Tradition further names her as a member of the Parkhurst\n\nfamily of which George Parkhurst of Watertown, Mass., was the first\n\nNew England representative in 1643. George was the son of John\n\nParkhurst of Ipswich, England, a clothier, and his sisters, Deborah\n\nand Elizabeth, came to this country with him, and were later residents\n\nof the Vineyard, the former as wife of John Smith and the latter of\n\nJoseph Merry. So far no documentary or recorded confirmation of this\n\ntradition has been found, although considerable effort has been spent\n\ntrying to determine the likely place of the wedding.\n\nThe couple had only one known child, who would later become the\n\nRev. Thomas Mayhew, missionary to the Indians. No other children are\n\nknown, or when or where the mother died.\n\nIn 1628, the records of the Massachusetts Bay Company contain a\n\nreference to trade with Thomas Mayhew as follows:\n\n\n\nMarch 16, 1628 Bespoke of Mr. Maio at 10 1/2 p yrd for beds &\n\nboulsters 20 bed tikes, Scotch Tikeing 3/4 broad & 2 1-16 long & 1 1/2\n\nyrds wide: 11 yrds each bed and boulster. (Mass Col. Records, I)\n\n\n\nIn two years Mayhew determined to follow to New England the \"beds &\n\nboulsters\" he had sold for the emigrants to the colony. In 1631,\n\nMatthew Cradock hired Mayhew to go to Massachusetts to act as his\n\nagent, making his headquarters at Medford, where he had built a\n\n\"greate stone house.\" Whether Mayhew's wife came with him or had died\n\nbefore 1631 is not known, but he presumably brought his young son with\n\nhim when he emigrated. The first mention of him in the colonial\n\nrecords is when he appears as chairman of a committee appointed by the\n\nCourt to settle the boundary between Charleston and Newton in March,\n\n1631/2. As this record is the report of the committee, it must have\n\nbeen appointed at an earlier date in the previous year, so he would\n\nhave arrived sometime in 1631.\n\nFor the next three years he attended to his employer's business and\n\nwas admitted a freeman by the General Court on May 14, 1634. At this\n\nperiod, he began the erection of a mill for his principal and the\n\nfollowing letter concerning it is here printed:\n\n\n\nMeadeford the 22th of\n\nthe fouerth Moneth June 1634\n\nSir:--- I doe hereby request your worshipp to deliver this bearer\n\nthat hempe you spake of, for caulkinge the pynnase: and I doe\n\nfarther intreate you to lend Mr. Cradock the hellpe of your teeme,\n\na day or two, to hellpe carry the timber for building the mill at\n\nWatertowne. I have sent unto Mr. (Richard) Doomer. I hope he will\n\nafford me his hellpe: that with the hellpe of our owne wee may doe it\n\nin two daies. The reason I desire to have it donne with such\n\nexpedition is for that the cattell must be watched whillst they are\n\nabout it, in reguard they will be from home & soe doubtless otherwise\n\nwould stray, or at least runn home: I will at any time, if your\n\nworshipp have occasion in the like kind, fulfill your desire: the time\n\nwee intend to goe about it is the second or third day of the next\n\nweeke. Thus ceaseing farther to trouble you at present, salutinge you\n\nwith all due respect, committing you to the Lords protection, I rest\n\nYour\n\nworshipps to command\n\nTHOMAS\n\nMAYHEW\n\nTo the worshipfull John Wynthropp (Ma. Hist. Col., 4, VII, 30.)\n\n\n\nProbably in 1634 he married a second time, but whether he found\n\nhis new wife in New England or returned home to England for her is not\n\nknown. Savage, who is usually quite accurate, states that the\n\nmarriage occurred in London, but on what authority is not known.\n\n(Genealogical Dictionary, III, 337. None of the published London\n\nparish registers have a record of this marriage.) His new wife was\n\nMrs. Jane (Gallion?) Paine, widow of Mr. Thomas Paine, a London\n\nmerchant. In London Banks found references to a Gallion family, to\n\nwhich she may have belonged. She brought into the household two\n\nchildren from her former marriage. Thomas Paine had left considerable\n\nestates in England for his children Thomas, Jr. and Jane, both minors.\n\nJane was the older of the two and was probably about five or six at\n\nthe time, Thomas Mayhew, Jr., was about fifteen at the time. In later\n\nyears, these two were to marry.\n\nTheir first child, Hannah was born in Medford in 1635. In this\n\nyear, also, he bought a one-half interest in the mill built by his\n\nmaster, Cradock, and himself. The purchase price was 200 pounds, for\n\nwhich Mayhew gave a bond and a mortgage for 400 pounds with conditions\n\nthat if the price was paid the bond should be void. He turned his\n\nefforts to milling which, according to a man who knew him, \"in those\n\ntimes made him a great profit.\"\n\nLate in 1636, his second daughter was born, and was named Bethiah.\n\nHe was made representative to the General Court this year (a\n\nlegislature for the Massachusetts colony), and was returned every year\n\nuntil he removed to Martha's Vineyard in 1644-45. During the years he\n\nserved as representative, his name appears on many important\n\ncommittees. During these years he was acting as miller, a merchant\n\nand politician, but apparently none of these jobs was very\n\nremunerative, and he was not a very good business man.\n\nAbout this time, Matthew Craddock, Mayhew's principal was becoming\n\ndissatisfied with Mayhew's handling of his investments in New England.\n\nIn his anger, he wrote a letter to Gov. John Winthrop pouring fourth\n\nhis grievances.\n\n\n\nWorthei Sir,-- The greyffe I have beene putt to by the most\n\nvyle bad dealings of Thomas Mayhew hath & doeth so much\n\ndisquiet my mynd, as I thank God never aney thing did in the\n\nlike manner.\n\nThe Lord in mercy ffreey me from this, I absolutely fforbad\n\nchardging moneys from thence or buying aney goods there. I\n\nthanke God my occasions requyred it not but I have had great\n\nreturnes made mee from thence by means of goods I sent thither by\n\nthe direction of Thomas Mayhew ffor above 5000 L in the last 2\n\nyeeres & geeving to much credditt to his insynnuating practices\n\n& the good opynion I by the reports & advize of maney &\n\nmore especially of your selfe, did apprehend of him, but ffarr\n\nbeyond all expectacion & contrary to my express order he hath\n\ncharged me with dyvers somes & geeven bills in my name\n\nwhich he never had order from me to doe, & that not for small\n\nsomes, whereof some partyculers are specefyed in the inclosed\n\nwhich I pray you deliver my servant Jno. Jolliff: & good sir lett me\n\nintreate your self & those in authority there to make some\n\ncourse that thomas Mayhew may be answerable ffor that\n\nestate of myne which my sayd servant can showe you hath come to\n\nhis hands. this conveyance is uncerten & therefore I shalbee breiffer\n\nthen I would or my necessety requyres but by Mr. Peirse, God\n\nwilling, I shall Inlardge, but I know you may by this seey &\n\naprehend my case.

Craddock's\n\nnew agent, John Jolliffe, arrived in New England in late 1636 or 1637,\n\nand terminated Mayhew's employment. Therefore, in 1637, Mayhew and\n\nhis family left Medford, and moved to Watertown. There he had\n\ninvestments of his own, and for the next seven or eight years he was\n\nactively identified with that town. He was chosen selectman in 1637\n\nand was also elected as Deputy to the General Court to represent his\n\nnew home in the Colonial Assembly.\n\nIn 1638 he was again chosen selectman and re-elected as Deputy to\n\nthe General Court. At the same session he was appointed a\n\ncommissioner, which office was a local magistrate or justice of the\n\npeace for trying small causes, the first official of that kind\n\naccredited to Watertown. Another daughter was born to him, probably\n\nearly in the year, who was named Martha. In 1639 he was reelected to\n\nall of his offices, and his fourth daughter, Mary was born. He also\n\npurchase the other half of the mill from Cradock's new agent,\n\nNicholas Davidson, and mortgaged it back to Cradock with six shares of\n\nthe \"Wear,\" for L240. The investment must have been a losing one, for\n\nin less than a year, on April 28, 1640, he sold the entire property to\n\nDeputy Governor Thomas Dudley for L400, subject to the mortgage to\n\nCradock. Dudley paid the money to Cradock, but apparently Mayhew never\n\npaid the first 400 pound mortgage to How, because at How's death in\n\n1644, this bond of Mayhew was one of the assets of the estate. This\n\nis a hint of the financial troubles which led him to take a risk on\n\nMartha's Vineyard.\n\nAlthough he was reelectd as selectman and as a Deputy to the\n\nGeneral Court in 1640 and 1641, there are occasional references to\n\nfinancial disputes between Mayhew and other businessmen. He wrote the\n\nfollowing letter describing his difficulties in obtaining money in the\n\ncountry:\n\n\n\n11th of the 3d 1640\n\nRight Worshipful.\n\n\n\nI am to pay my owne rate, & some 5 li. for other men, that I owe it\n\nunto & allthough that I have had bills due from the Countrey, one\n\nyeare and 7 moneths since, for 70 & od pounds, I must now have my\n\ngoods sold, except I pay out this money: which seeing I have money to\n\nreceive from the countrey methinks it is verry hard measure. I\n\ncannott see equitie in it. I may safely say that if I had had my\n\nmoney as was then fully intended, being then 100 li. it had donne me\n\nmore good, in name & state, then now wilbe made whole with double the\n\nmoney; but if there be noe remedy but my goods must be straynbed and\n\nsolld, I desire your worshipps advice per this bearer which is the\n\nConstable, what course is to be taken in putting it of. I thinke he\n\ncomes unto you for counsell in that behallfe: thus with my due\n\nrespecte, in some hast, I rest\n\nYour worshipps to\n\ncommand\n\n\n\nTHO: MAYHEW\n\nTo the Right Worshipfull John Winthropp, Governour.\n\n\n\nMoney is verry hard to gett upon any termes. I know not the man\n\nthat can furnish me with it. I could not gett the 100 li. of Mr.\n\nGibbins. I gott 30 li. putt off inconveniently: & when I was sick &\n\nin necessitie I could not gett any of the Treasurer. I delight not to\n\ncompleyne.\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently the toll bridge that he had constructed was also a\n\nloss, for it was absorbed by the towns in December, 1641. He was\n\ngiven 150 acres of land on the south side of the Charles River,\n\nperhaps in payment.\n\n\n\nOn the English Origins of the Mayhew name:\n\nIn Rev. Canon Mayo, vicar of Long Burton, Dorset's Genealogical\n\nAccount of the Mayo and Elton Families (London, 1882) there is the\n\nfollowing account of the Mayhew name:\n\nAs an English family name it is most frequently met with in the\n\nSouth and West of this island, and few parish registers in the\n\nCounties of Hereford, Gloucester,Wilts and Dorset can be opened\n\nwithout presenting us with examples. It is spelt in many ways,\n\nvarying from the extended form of Mayhowe to that of Mao, and often,\n\nas it will frequently appear, clipped down and reduced to May to the\n\nloss of its concluding syllable. One lesson is taught by the\n\ndiversity and variety, viz.: -- the identity of Mayhew and Mayo, and\n\nfrom this consideration a ray of light is thrown upon the derivation\n\nof the name. An early occurrence of the name, and in its extended\n\nform is found in Glover's Roll of Arms, supposed by Sir Harris\n\nNicholas to date from Between 1245 and 1250. Herbert le Fitz Mayhewe\n\nis there mentioned as bearing \"party d'azure & de goulz one trois\n\nleonseaux rampant d'or,\" and Woodward in his History of Wales, page\n\n415, narrates that account to the old copy of S. Davids Annals. The\n\nWelsh slew Sir Herbert Fitz-Mahu apparently in 1246, near the castle\n\nof Morgan Cam. The same Roll of Arms gives the clue to the origin of\n\nthe name as a Christian name; in the case of Mahewe de Lovayne, Mayhew\n\nde Columbers and Maheu de Redmain. There can be little doubt that it\n\nis here a softenform of Matthew. Bardsley in his \"English Surnames\"\n\nmentioned two other instances, Adam fil. Maheu, and Mayhew de\n\nBasingbourne, from the Parliamentqary Writs. Shakespeare in King\n\n\"Lear\" Act III, scene 4 says:\n\n\"The Prince of Darkness is a Gentleman\n\nModo he's called Mahu.\"\n\n\n\nIn the Records of the Commissioners for the United Colonies, there\n\nappeared a letter, now in the Connecticut Archives, (Conn. Col.\n\nRecords, 1678-1689. pp. 504-506) written by Governor Mayhew, sealed\n\nwith arms which, upon examination, proved to be the arms, with a\n\nmullet for difference, fo the Mayhew family of Dinton, Wiltshire, a\n\ncounty family of considerable distinction. These facts, taken in\n\nconnection with the bestowal by Mayhew of the names of Tisbury and\n\nChilmark on two adjoining towns on Martha's Vineyard, and the fact\n\nthat Tisbury and Chilmark are adjoining parishes in Wiltshire, and\n\nseparated by a few miles only from Dinton, made it quite evident that\n\nthis locality was the one which should reveal his family connection.\n\nThe parish registers of Tisbury are extant from the year 1563 and\n\ninclude the marriage of his parents, Mathew Maow and Ales Barter on\n\nOcto. 2, 1587 and his own baptism on April 1, 1593 (Thomas, Son of\n\nMathew Maho). The entry of the baptism of Thomas, son of Mathew Maho,\n\nApril 1st, 1593, probably within a few days of his birth, is not\n\nabsoutely conclusive evidence of identity with our Thomas, but taken\n\nin connection with the facts relating to the reappearance on Martha's\n\nViuneyard of the names of Tisbury Manor (which is situtated in the\n\naprish of Tisbury, England) and Chilmark the adjoining hamlet, and the\n\nname of Matthew, which for succeeding generations appeared in the\n\nMartha's Vineyard family, it becomes one of those cases where an\n\naffirmative conclusion is clearly inferential.\n\n\n\nSavage says: First at Watertown. Born early in 1591, came in the\n\nGriffin, 1633, if we might so infer from the fact of his taking his\n\noath as freeman May 14, 1634 when Gov. Haynes and Bov. Brenton,\n\nbesides Cotton, Hooker and Stone, passengers in that ship were\n\nadmitted. But that inference would be wrong, for in Colonial Records\n\nI. 95 is a report signed by him and two other gentleman for setting\n\nout the bounds between\n\nWatertown and the new town on March 6, 1632, and in July 1633, he was\n\nappointed administrator of of Ralph Glover, while Cotton and fellow\n\npassengers did not arrive before September next, so that he must have\n\nbeen here in 1631, and he served as a merchant at Southampton, England\n\nas Bond relates, and here as representative 1636-44 except 42, was\n\nactive in trade, first at Medford, afterwards at W. but was induced to\n\nremove to the Vineyard about 1647, where he was proprietor's Governor\n\nand preacher to\n\nthe Indians above 33 years. Died 1681, six days only before being 90\n\nyears old. It is indistinct pronouncement by tradition that first\n\nwife who died in England had been Martha Parkhurst and second was\n\nprobably brought with him, Grace, widow of Thomas Paine of London, and\n\nby her he had Hannah, Bethia and Mary. It is not known that he had\n\nany sons but Thomas who he, as brother of the former wife brot. from\n\nEngland but some\n\nuncertainty is felt as to the relation of father and I do not concur\n\nwith Bond, 857, in making Jane the last wife of Thomas the elder, but\n\nthink her widow of the son, nor do I believe that it was the son who\n\nwas, in 1647, chosen by Thomas Paine, then 15 years old, as, with his\n\nwife Grace, guardians for him.\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas was baptised 01-Apr-1593 in Tisbury, England; came to Medford, Mass. in 1635; was a prominent member of the\n\nAncient and Honorable Artillery Co.; was a missionary to the Native Americans (Indians). {-See \"The Genealogical\n\nAdvertizer,\" Vol. 4 (1901), p. 1.} He owned Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Elizabeth islands and was Governor of\n\nMartha's Vineyard. He settled Edgartown, 1658-81. He lived to age 90. His son, the Rev. John Mayhew, was first\n\nmissionary on Martha's Vineyard, 1642-57; he died at sea en route to England at age 37 and his father, the Governor,\n\nsucceeded him as missionary pastor.

Provided by Mayhew Foster / Associated Press\n\nMISSOULA, Montana - Captain Mayhew Foster had an extraordinary mission: Fly captured Nazi leader Hermann Goering to the 7th Army's headquarters for interrogation.\n\nThen he took one look at the one-time heir to Adolf Hitler and commander of the fearsome Luftwaffe - all 136 kg of him - and knew he needed a bigger plane.\n\nIt was May 9, 1945, the day after World War II ended in Europe. Goering, Foster and a group of officers from the Army's 36th Infantry Division gathered on a tiny airstrip outside Kitzbuhel, Austria, to transport the highly-prized war prisoner back to Germany in an unarmed, two-man reconnaissance plane.\n\n\"They wanted to get him back where he could be debriefed. There was a strong rumor that in a mountainside in the Alps right down there in Bavaria there was a concentration of (German) military,\" Foster said. \"He just acted as though it was a nice, friendly trip.\"\n\nMayhew Foster, now 99 and living in a Missoula nursing home, recently recounted his rare one-on-one encounter with one of the most wanted Nazi leaders. Foster went on to become brigadier general of the Montana National Guard and was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his World War II service, but it was this mission that stood out as the highlight of an illustrious military career.\n\nGoering, 52, had surrendered to the US Army's 36th Infantry Division the day before. He had fallen out of favor with Hitler and hadn't played an active role at the end of the war, though he remained Reichsmarschall of Nazi Germany.\n\nBefore his capture, Goering wrote a letter to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, offering to work with Eisenhower on the conditions of the German army's surrender, according to an account of Goering's capture by Brigadier General Robert Stack kept by the 36th Infantry Division Association.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Stack and a group of soldiers drove from the division's base near Kitzbuhel across the border into Germany and intercepted a convoy that included Goering, his wife, daughter, sister-in-law, household servants and military aides, according to the account.\n\nGoering agreed to surrender unconditionally but asked that his family be cared for, and the Nazi leader was delivered to Foster for transport the next day.\n\nFoster, who was 33 at the time, said he didn't fear getting shot down carrying such precious cargo alone in an unescorted, unarmed plane. He didn't worry about Goering taking advantage of the lack of a guard to wrest control of the aircraft.\n\nThe main problem, he said, was getting the two of them off the ground - the nimble, lightweight Piper L4 that Foster piloted in his artillery spotting missions wouldn't support both him and Goering. But the division only had the small airstrip that was fine for Foster's aircraft, but was problematic for taking off and landing larger planes.\n\nThey'd have to upgrade to the one L5 in the division's inventory, a slightly larger aircraft Foster hadn't flown in years.\n\nGoering stood on the tiny airstrip in a plain, gray uniform that was unadorned but for a pistol at his hip and a medal around his neck. Still wearing the pistol, he stepped toward the plane. A Goering aide emerged from the group that had gathered and relieved Goering of the weapon.\n\nThe Nazi leader settled into the back seat and tried to fasten his seat belt. It wouldn't stretch across his belly. He held the strap in his hand, looked at Foster and said, \"Das goot!\" - that's good.\n\nA photograph of that moment shows Foster in the cockpit and Goering seated directly behind him, his elbow jauntily propped on the plane's fuselage.\n\nThe two men spent the 55-minute flight from Kitzbuhel to Augsburg, Germany, conversing in a mix of German and English. Foster said Goering avoided any talk of Hitler or the war but appeared to relish pointing out the sites below them.\n\n\"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour and he was showing me where he grew up,\" Foster said. \"I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\"\n\nHe described Goering as sharp, friendly and witty, even cracking a joke when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets.\n\n\"Too late,\" Goering replied, according to Foster.\n\nAt the time, Foster was somewhat less generous in describing the man. In a letter to his wife, Virginia Lou Foster, written soon after the mission, Foster told her that the Nazi leader was \"effeminate\" and \"gave me the creeps\".\n\n\"Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out but he was wedged in like a champagne cork,\" Foster wrote.\n\nAfter landing, Foster asked his passenger to sign a blank flight report. The prisoner scrawled \"Hermann Goering Reichsmarschall\" across the paper, which Foster folded and put in his pocket.\n\nIt's a document that he still has, one of Foster's most prized possessions alongside a collection of photographs of Goering, Hitler and other snapshots from the days of the Third Reich.\n\nThere was just a single jeep at the airstrip to meet the arriving flight carrying the world's most famous war prisoner. Foster rode with Goering to the gates of the 7th Army Headquarters and formally turned him over to the intelligence officer without ceremony.\n\nIt turned out, Foster learned later, those rumors of German troops hiding in the Bavarian Alps were untrue. Goering stood trial at Nuremberg, and the next year he was found guilty of war crimes.\n\nGoering was sentenced to hang, but he committed suicide instead by swallowing a cyanide capsule.\n\nSixty-five years later, Foster is trim, sharp and carries himself as a former military officer.\n\nHe still reflects on his rare insight into the Nazi leadership, and he recognizes that the experience had shifted his perceptions of the enemy. It allowed him to see the human side of those he had only known as caricatures.\n\n\"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up,\" Foster said. \"I wouldn't say it changed my view of the war but it showed me that there are ...\" He broke off.\n\n\"Well, I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/204512090/mayhew-c-foster", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!
