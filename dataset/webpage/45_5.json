The WTC was backed financially by a wealthy Texas oilman, Lamar Hunt, who had, in 1960, been the prime founder of the American Football League. Taken together with a rival group called the National Tennis League, which had such prestigious professionals such as Ken Rosewall, Rod Laver, Pancho Gonzales, Andres Gimeno, and Fred Stolle, as well as another recently signed top amateur, Roy Emerson, so many of the world's top players were lost to amateur tennis that a final impetus was given to the push to create Open Tennis, which would let both professional and amateur players compete in the same tournaments.[1] As a direct result, 12 Open tournaments were authorized for the year 1968 by the International Tennis Association, and the first Open tournaments were held in the spring and summer of 1968.\n\nWho they were\n\nThe Handsome Eight were Nikki Pili\u0107 of Yugoslavia, Earl \"Butch\" Buchholz and Dennis Ralston of the United States, Pierre Barthes of France, Cliff Drysdale of South Africa, Roger Taylor of Great Britain, and John Newcombe and Tony Roche of Australia. At the time of the formation of the Handsome Eight, Buchholz had already been a professional for seven years. All of them were fine players, prominent in their own countries and with many amateur titles to their names, but only Newcombe and Roche were quite at the very highest level of the game as exemplified by Rosewall and Laver in the other touring group.\n\nFor many years the London Daily Telegraph had published an annual unofficial ranking of the top ten amateur tennis players in the world. At the end of 1967, Lance Tingay, who complied the list that year, considered Newcombe to be the world's best amateur, with Roy Emerson, of the rival professional group, as the #2 player. Roche was #5, Pili\u0107 was #7, and Drysdale was tied with two others for #10. The other four of the Eight were not ranked.[2]\n\nFrench Open\n\nOf the 12 Open tournaments played in 1968, the three most prestigious were the national championships of France, Great Britain, and the United States. The first of these, the French Open, was played in Paris in May. For reasons unknown at this date, none of the Eight participated in the tournament. Six members of the rival professional group, the National Tennis League, however, were among the top eight seeds, and all four of the semi-finalists were NTL players. In the final, Rod Laver defeated Ken Rosewall in four sets.\n\nWimbledon\n\nA month later at the British championships at Wimbledon, the world's most prestigious tournament, all of the Handsome Eight participated, with six of them among the top 16 seeds. Barthes and Taylor were unseeded, but Newcombe was #4, Ralston was #9, Buchholz was #10, and Drysdale, Roche, and Pili\u0107 were the final three seeds, #14 through #16.\n\nIn the matches themselves, Pili\u0107 lost in the first round to the unseeded Herb Fitzgibbon. Barthes lost in the second round to the unseeded V. Korotkov, Drysdale lost in the third round to the unseeded Tom Edlefsen, and Newcombe lost in the fourth round to the #13 Arthur Ashe. Both Ralston and Buchholz lost in the quarterfinals, Buchholz to his touring companion Tony Roche, and Ralston to the #1 seed, Rod Laver. Roche, the #15 seed, lost to Laver in the finals in three quick sets.\n\nUnited States Open\n\nAt the final national championships of the year, the United States Open at Forest Hills in New York City, all of the Eight participated except for Earl Buchholz. Roche and Newcombe were seeded #2 and #4 respectively, while Ralston was #6 and Drysdale was #16. The top seed was Rod Laver, the winner of the French Open and of Wimbledon.\n\nAll seven players advanced to at least the third round. In that round Taylor lost to the #7 seed, Clark Graebner, while Barthes lost to the #8 seed, Tom Okker. Unseeded Nikki Pili\u0107 lost in the fourth round to teammate Dennis Ralston, while Roche was shocked in the same round by the 40-year-old Pancho Gonzales, seeded 13th, in straight sets. Ralston lost in the quarterfinals to #3 Ken Rosewall, while Drysdale, who had preciously upset top-seed Rod Laver in the fourth round, was beaten by an amateur, #3 Arthur Ashe. Newcombe was also beaten in the quarterfinals by another amateur, Clark Graebner. In the finals, the American Arthur Ashe beat another amateur, Tom Okker of the Netherlands.\n\n1968 rankings\n\nUnofficial rankings for the year 1968, including both professionals and amateurs, were made by Bud Collins, the noted tennis commentator who, at the time, was a journalist for the Boston Globe. Tony Roche and John Newcombe of the Handsome Eight were ranked #4 and #6 respectively, while Dennis Ralston and Cliff Drysdale were #8 and #9. He judged Rod Laver to have been the world's #1 player for the year.[3]\n\nSubsequent careers in the Open Era\n\nAll eight players continued to compete throughout the first few years of the Open Era, with varying degrees of success. They are listed here by ascending number of singles titles won in 1968 and subsequent years.\n\nEarl Buchholz was the world's best junior player for several years, then turned professional at age 21 and won a number of professional tournaments before the Open Era. Once Open Tennis began, however, he apparently never won another title in either singles or doubles. His most notable year for Grand Slam tournaments was 1969, when he made it to the quarterfinals of both the Australian Open and the United States Open\u2014the previous year he had reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals. He was never ranked in the top ten world players by either Bud Collins or, beginning in 1973, by the ATP's (Association of Tennis Professionals) computer-generated ranking service. Dennis Ralston played sparingly in the Open Era after appearing in eight tournaments during the first year. He won one singles title in 1970 and was a finalist in one tournament in both 1969 and 1970. As well as being a quarterfinalist at both Wimbledon and the United States Open in 1968, he was a quarterfinalist in the United States Open of 1970, after beating the #1 seed Rod Laver in the 4th round, and was a semifinalist in the Australian Open of that same year. He also won five doubles titles in the Open Era. But after being ranked the world's #8 player in 1968, he was never again ranked in the top ten world players by either Bud Collins or, beginning in 1973, by the ATP's (Association of Tennis Professionals) computer-generated ranking service. Pierre Barthes, who was a more successful doubles player than singles player, never got past the fourth round of any of the four Grand Slam tournaments in singles. He was a finalist in six other tournaments, however, and in doubles won six tournaments, including the 1970 United States Open with his teammate Nikki Pili\u0107. He played his last match in a Grand Slam tournament in the doubles competition of the 1980 French Open. He was never ranked in the top ten world players by either Bud Collins or, beginning in 1973, by the ATP's (Association of Tennis Professionals) computer-generated ranking service. Roger Taylor was also a successful doubles player: he twice won the United States Open, in 1971 with John Newcombe and the following year with Cliff Drysdale. He won his last doubles title in 1977. He also, however, won three singles titles between 1971 and 1975. In 1973 he reached the quarterfinals of the French Open as well as the semifinals of Wimbledon. He was never ranked in the top ten world players by either Bud Collins or, beginning in 1973, by the ATP's (Association of Tennis Professionals) computer-generated ranking service. Nikki Pili\u0107 won the United States Open doubles title with Barthes but also won four singles titles from 1969 through 1975. He lost the singles finals of the 1973 French Open and reached the quarterfinals of the United States Open that same year. At the Australian Open he never advanced beyond the third round and at Wimbledon beyond the fourth round. He was never ranked in the top ten world players by either Bud Collins or, beginning in 1973, by the ATP's (Association of Tennis Professionals) computer-generated ranking service. He was, however ranked #15 1973 and #33 the following year. Cliff Drysdale, one of the first players to use a two-handed backhand, was equally successful in the Open Era with five singles titles and seven in doubles\u2014he was 37 when he won his last singles title. He and teammate Roger Taylor won the 1972 United States doubles. In 1968 he reached the quarterfinals of the United States Open, beating #1 seed Rod Laver in the third round, and in 1971 he made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. He was ranked by Bud Collins as the #9 player in the world in 1968, 1969, and 1971. Tony Roche never won a Grand Slam tournament as a professional (he had won the 1966 French Championships as an amateur) but did win 12 singles titles, six of them of 1969, and was the losing finalist in three Grand Slams. He was also a semi-finalist in another three Grand Slams and a quarterfinalist in four more. He was also a superb doubles player, winning Wimbledon four times as a professional with teammate John Newcombe as his partner, as well as the 1976 Wimbledon mixed doubles with Fran\u00e7oise Durr. As a professional he won 27 doubles titles. He was ranked by Bud Collins as the #4 player in the world in 1968, #2 behind Rod Laver in 1969, and #3 in 1970. John Newcombe was the most successful of the Handsome Eight, winning 32 singles titles as a professional and 41 doubles titles, many of them with Tony Roche. He was ranked seven times among the world's ten best players and was considered to be the #1 player in the world in both 1970 and 1971, as well as being the #2 player in both 1973 and 1974. As a professional he won Wimbledon twice, the Australian Open twice, and the United States Open once. He also won 11 Grand Slam titles in doubles. Jack Kramer, the long-time promoter and top player himself, calls Newcombe in his 1979 autobiography one of the 21 best players of all time.[4]"}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2022-07/21/content_78334187.htm", "page_content": "Adjust font size:\n\n\u89c6\u9891\u64ad\u653e\u4f4d\u7f6e \u4e0b\u8f7d\u5b89\u88c5Flash\u64ad\u653e\u5668\n\nCAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- As the 2022 Fencing World Championships reached its halfway mark on Wednesday, France led the medal tally with three gold medals and a silver.\n\nWorld No. 1 and Tokyo Olympic men's epee individual champion Romain Cannone of France continued his dominance, beating Kazuyasu Minobe of Japan to pocket the gold.\n\nEnzo Lefort and Ysaora Thibus added another two gold medals in the men's and women's foil individual for France, while compatriot Maxime Pianfetti claimed a surprising silver in the men's sabre individual.\n\nWith the absence of Tokyo Olympic women's epee champion Sun Yiwen, China aimed to gain experience at the fencing worlds as only eight of its 26 participating fencers competed at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n20-year-old Yu Sihan of China made it to the quarterfinals in the women's epee individual but lost to Alexandra Ndolo of Germany 14-13 to finish eighth in her World Championships debut, while Zhu Mingye's seventh place in the same category was China's best finish in individual events in Cairo.\n\nThe remaining team events will run through July 23.

At the last feeding, I heard some encouragement so I took my chance and it worked out.\"\n\nCavagna took place in the leading after 30km of racing, along with Pierre Rolland (B&B Hotels-KTM), Warren Barguil (Arkea-Samsic), J\u00e9r\u00e9my Leveau (Xelliss-Roubaix-Lille M\u00e9tropole), R\u00e9my Rochas and Victor Lafay (Cofidis), Matthieu Ladagnous, Simon Guglielmi and Molard (Groupama-FDJ), Geoffrey Bouchard and Touz\u00e9 (AG2R-Citro\u00ebn), Alexis Gu\u00e9rin (Vorarlberg), J\u00e9r\u00e9my Cabot and Fabien Doubey (TotalEnergies).\n\nThey got a maximum time gap of five minutes at half way. With 35km to go, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal put the hammer down, launching a strong attack for Alaphilippe. Only David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy (AG2R-Citro\u00ebn) managed to follow the world champion. Guillaume Martin (Cofidis) reacted with a slight delay.

Martin reacted, again with a slight delay.\n\nOnce the trio bridged the gap, Cavagna was gone solo at the beginning of the last lap with 14km to go.

The first Wimbledon championship was held in 1877 on one of the croquet lawns of the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (since 1882 the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club). In 1884 a women\u2019s championship was introduced at Wimbledon, and the national men\u2019s doubles was transferred there from Oxford. Mixed doubles and women\u2019s doubles were inaugurated in 1913.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn 1920 Suzanne Lenglen of France became the first person to win three Wimbledon championships (in singles and doubles events) in a single year; in 1937 Don Budge of the United States became the first man to win three Wimbledon championships in a single year. (In 1938 he repeated that feat, and he also won the other three championships of the Grand Slam.) In 1980 Bj\u00f6rn Borg of Sweden won the men\u2019s singles for a fifth consecutive year; this was a feat not achieved since the winning streaks of William Renshaw (1880s) and Laurie Doherty (1900s), which were held under the old challenge-round system that gave an advantage to defending champions. Martina Navratilova of the United States won six consecutive women\u2019s championships (1982\u201387), eclipsing the record of Lenglen (1919\u201323). In 1990 Navratilova captured her ninth single\u2019s title to break the record set by Helen Wills. Later notable players at Wimbledon include Pete Sampras of the United States, who in 2000 won his seventh title to tie Renshaw, and Roger Federer of Switzerland, whose fifth consecutive title in 2007 equaled Borg\u2019s streak; in 2012 Federer also captured a record-tying seventh Wimbledon title.\n\nThe Wimbledon Championships, originally played by amateurs, were opened to professional players in 1968; Rod Laver of Australia and Billie Jean King of the United States won the singles events that year.

That inspires me a lot and gives me the hunger to win more.\"\n\nImage: Aryna Sabalenka will be playing in a Grand Slam quarter-final for the first time\n\nSabalenka, who knocked out Britain's Katie Boulter earlier in the tournament, overcame Elena Rybakina 6-3 4-6 6-3 in her fourth-round contest.\n\nThe second seed went into this Grand Slam draw with the unenviable label of being the only player in the top 20 not to have reached a Grand Slam quarter-final. Now, she has finally broke down that barrier and like Jabeur, she is looking for more.\n\n\"I'm really happy, but this is not the final goal for me. I'm happy for now, but tomorrow [Tuesday] is another match. I'm trying to stay focused. I'm really happy I finally broke this wall.\n\n\"She has good touch, good serving game, moving well,\" the second seed added about Jabeur. \"I also have a good serve and play aggressive [tennis]. I'm kind of trying to use my touch also.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting match. It's going to be great battle. I'm really looking forward for this match.\"\n\nWimbledon 2021: Women's Quarter-finals Ons Jabeur (21) vs Aryna Sabalenka (2) Ashleigh Barty (1) vs Ajla Tomljanovic Karolina Pliskova (8) vs Viktorija Golubic Karolina Muchova (19) vs Angelique Kerber (25)\n\nSecond on Centre Court will be an all-Australian contest between the world No 1 Barty and Tomljanovic.\n\nBarty secured her 32nd win of the year in the fourth round, after a tough encounter with the recent French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova.\n\nThe 7-5 6-3 victory saw the world No 1 come from 3-1 down in the first, and the contest highlighted both her control and form.\n\nTomljanovic's progression into the quarter-finals came in very different circumstances, after Emma Raducanu retired due to medical reasons when the Australian was 6-4 3-0 up late on Monday night.\n\n\"I'm unbelievably proud of myself that I'm here,\" Tomljanovic said. \"I didn't think I would be, in a way. I didn't think these two weeks would be my breakthrough. Now that they are, it's kind of surreal. It just puts everything back into perspective.\"\n\nTwitter Due to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.

It is her first return to a Grand Slam quarter-final since her 2018 title run at the All England Club and puts to bed first-round exits at both the Australian Open and French Open this year.\n\n\"I really worked hard in the last few months. Being able now to play matches like this, win close matches, going out there and enjoying it, feeling my tennis, it's always a good sign., she said.\n\n\"Being now in the quarters here again, it's really great. I'm looking forward to the next round.\"\n\nMuchova overcame Paula Badosa in their fourth-round match. She came from a break down in the opening set, and trailed 5-2 in the tie-break, to take it 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.\n\nThe world No 22 will now try and erase memories of her quarter-final exit to Elina Svitolina two years ago, during her only other appearance at the Championships. In comparison, this year's main draw is Kerber's 13th at the grass-court slam.\n\nDon't forget to follow us on skysports.com/tennis, our Twitter account @skysportstennis & Sky Sports - on the go!

This is what you train for, this is what it's all about.\n\n\"I'm not close to where I want to be. Today was big, I definitely needed that. He [Tsitsipas] is going to do a lot of great things.\"\n\nWhile Tiafoe contested matches at Queen's and Eastbourne prior to Wimbledon, Tsitsipas arrived at the All England Club without playing on grass since his final defeat on the Paris clay.\n\n\"For sure the lack of matches was crucial today,\" said Tsitsipas. \"I was thinking maybe I should have played the week before Wimbledon, either Mallorca or Eastbourne, I'm not sure. Any of these tournaments would have helped get me in a better shape, get my tennis ready for the grass-court season.\n\n\"The transition from clay to grass, in my opinion, is probably the most difficult one, if not the biggest challenge in our sport. I just wasn't able to adapt, I wasn't able to figure these things out early in the match. You just cannot be defensive on grass.

She led the tie-break 6-3 but after getting back to 6-6, the Slovenian conceded the set with a double fault under the pressure of a fourth break point.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, that quality was required again in the second set as a free-swinging Juvan rallied to claw back one of the three breaks she trailed by - and held four break points on Watson's serve at 5-2.\n\nHowever, roared on by the home crowd, Watson battled back, closing out her biggest career singles win with a forehand volley.\n\nAwaiting her in round four at SW19 is the world number 97 Niemeier, who progressed with a 6-4 3-6 6-3 win over Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThree-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe on Today at Wimbledon\n\nNearly beating Serena Williams in 2015, to me, was the best she's ever played by far and somehow she didn't win that.

He also reached the Australian Open semi-finals last year and the same stage at this year's French Open.\n\n\"I think experience plays a big part,\" Zverev, 24, told reporters. \"I think knowing how to manage your time, knowing how to manage your matches, is a big part of it.\n\n\"It was something that I needed to learn in the beginning of my career. I remember when a lot of people were criticising me for this guy that was playing extremely well at big tournaments, but never at slams.\n\n\"I hope I kind of changed my position on that a little bit. But of course the main goal is still to win them.\"\n\nZverev took a step closer to that on Saturday when he kept his unforced error count low and repeatedly tested the serve of the 31st-seeded American, who underwent surgery less than a month ago after suffering a knee injury at Roland Garros.\n\nBREAK CHANCES\n\nAfter the first set went without a break of serve, the 23-year-old Fritz raised his game in the tiebreak to take the lead against Zverev who had failed to convert two break points.\n\nThe players traded service breaks in the second set but Zverev converted a second opportunity to level the match and then took the lead with a single break of serve in the third.\n\nIt was Zverev's turn to play solidly in the fourth set tie-breaker and, despite committing his ninth double-fault, he was able to close out the contest when Fritz sent a forehand long.\n\n\"Today was probably not the best match I played so far this tournament just feeling-wise, how comfortable I was, but I found a way to win. That's the most important,\" said Zverev, who hit 45 winners, 19 of them aces, and kept his unforced errors to 25.\n\nThe German said he hoped the Tokyo Olympics would be a \"very special moment\" for him as he had to skip the last Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 due to illness.\n\n\"It's my first Olympics. I hope I'll have many more to come. I'm very excited,\" he said. \"It's my first time in Japan, as well. It's one of the places that I've never been to, so that is going to be exciting for me as well.\n\n\"Of course, with the COVID-19 virus, it is very different. I think the rules will be very different to normal Olympic Games. But I'm excited for it. I'm excited to represent my country there.

We just had to find a way to get the basic needs to survive during those times.
