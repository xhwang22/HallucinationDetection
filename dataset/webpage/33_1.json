{"The Blood Divine is a central part of Christian theology, and is seen as a symbol of the sacrificial death of Jesus and the atonement of sins.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/", "page_content": "First published Fri Oct 15, 2021\n\nPhilosophical critics of contemporary analytic philosophy of religion (APR) are often struck by just how Christian and theological much of it seems. This criticism expresses the worry that APR as such looks too much like Christian philosophical theology. At the same time, theological critics often fault APR for lacking theological sophistication ( Section 3 ). In order to understand both poles of criticism, it is useful to have a better sense of the relevant historical background ( Section 1 ). But it is also important to appreciate what the best contemporary work in analytic philosophical theology actually looks like ( Section 2 ).\n\nBecause its twin foci are so broad, an encyclopedia entry on \u201cPhilosophy and Christian Theology\u201d could legitimately go in many different directions. This entry has two related aims. First, the entry discusses methodological questions about how philosophy and theology should be related. Accordingly, it surveys some of the most important ways they have been related in the history of the Christian tradition ( Section 1 ), before turning to contemporary debates about the way Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion interacts with theology ( Section 3 ). Second, in between these two methodological sections, the entry also discusses recent work in analytic philosophical theology ( Section 2 ). Note that the previous version of this entry (Murray and Rea 2008 [2021]) focused on topics in contemporary philosophical theology. That version is archived and available via the Other Internet Resources but see, also, the topic-focused entries linked in the Related Entries for additional coverage.\n\nAs a general, formal matter, this point holds even though different Christian groups disagree about what the constraints of orthodoxy actually are. So Roman Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians will accept different constraints about, say, the nature of the Eucharist, and rival Protestant Christian groups will differ with each other in a similar way. But as a formal matter, Christian thinkers who think philosophically about Christian doctrines typically do so inside the intellectual framework provided by what they regard as authoritative Christian orthodoxy. Obviously, it is not the case that everyone who wants to think philosophically about Christianity must accept the constraints of Christian orthodoxy, even in this more relativistic sense of \u201corthodoxy\u201d. Some modern and contemporary thinkers still identify as Christians even though they reject the very idea of normative orthodoxy, for example. And, of course, non-Christian thinkers, including non-theists, will reject any notion of Christian orthodoxy in its entirety. Yet they can still think philosophically about Christian doctrines.\n\nYet even after the parameters of orthodoxy were established, Christian thinkers continued to face difficult philosophical questions about the meaning, coherence, and plausibility of settled Christian doctrines. They continued to try to answer those questions using the best philosophy of their day\u2014from Scholastic Aristotelianism in the Medieval period to analytic metaphysics today. For Christian thinkers, the already settled doctrines of Christian orthodoxy provide a normative framework within which this philosophical reflection occurs, by demarcating the logical space that constrains the field of acceptable solutions. For example, it is not open to an orthodox Christian thinker to dispel the logical problem of the Trinity (the problem of how God can be both three and one) by arguing that there is in fact no God, or that God is not triune, or that the Father and the Son are two stages in the temporal life of the one God. These theoretical options are ruled out by virtue of the philosopher\u2019s own orthodox Christian commitments.\n\nOver the course of the Patristic period, as the early Church successfully established its own intellectual framework, it formally defined the boundaries of Christian orthodoxy through a series of ecumenical councils. These councils\u2014including the Councils of Nicaea (325 CE), Constantinople (381), and Chalcedon (451)\u2014established the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and its corollary, the doctrine of the Incarnation (see Kelly 1978).\n\nChristian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer these kinds of questions. In the earliest years of Christianity, running roughly from the second to the seventh centuries CE, and often called the \u201cPatristic\u201d period, the emerging Christian Church faced the daunting task of defining doctrinal orthodoxy in the face of internal and external challenges. In pursuing this task, Patristic thinkers typically did not understand themselves as \u201ctheologians\u201d in contrast to \u201cphilosophers\u201d. Indeed, they may not have endorsed any sharp distinction between philosophy and theology at all. But they still reasoned about their Christian commitments in the intellectual idiom of the ancient Mediterranean world, which was the idiom of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic philosophy.\n\nMany Christian doctrines raise difficult philosophical questions. For example, Christians have traditionally insisted that they worship a single God, while simultaneously identifying that God with a trinity comprised of three numerically distinct, fully divine persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not easy to see how three divine persons add up to one God. Similarly, Christians have also asserted that a human man, Jesus of Nazareth, is also God-the-Son, the second person of the divine trinity. It is not easy to see how a human man, who is born, lives, and dies, could also be a fully divine being. Consider also the relationship between divine providence and human freedom. Are human beings free to accept or reject God, or does God alone decide who will accept or reject God? Any answer to this theological question will also assume some specific philosophical account of human freedom and moral responsibility.\n\n1. The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition\n\nAlthough modern thought tends to assume a sharp disjunction between philosophy and theology, it is not at all obvious how to distinguish them in a principled way. Suppose that we take philosophy in the broadest sense to be the systematic use of human reason in an effort to understand the most fundamental features of reality, and suppose that we take theology in the broadest sense to be the study of God and all things in relation to God. Then we should expect to see considerable overlap between the two: after all, God, if there is a God, is surely one of the fundamental features of reality, and one to which all the other features presumably relate.\n\nIn practice, when we survey the history of Christian thought, we do see considerable overlap between philosophy and theology. With respect to their topics of inquiry, philosophers and theologians alike ask questions about epistemology, axiology, and political theory, as well as about metaphysics and fundamental ontology. Similarly, with respect to their methods of inquiry, philosophers and theologians alike interpret authoritative texts, deploy arguments, and marshal evidence to support their conclusions. Here one might insist that Christian theological claims are grounded by appeals to \u201cfaith\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d, whereas philosophical claims are grounded by appeals to \u201creason\u201d. This contrast is promising when suitably developed, but it is not as sharp as one might initially suppose. Theology also makes appeals to common sense and ordinary human reason, and philosophy also has its versions of faith and authority.\n\nOf the making of typologies there is no end, but it is still worth examining some of the most common ways that Christian thinkers throughout the centuries have understood the relationship between philosophy and theology. Without this historical background, it becomes all-too-easy to draw the relationship in na\u00efve, anachronistic, and overly simplistic ways. In fact, no single interpretation of the relationship between philosophy and theology can claim overwhelming support from the Christian tradition. From outside the Christian tradition, while many non-Christian thinkers see philosophy and theology as quite distinct, others deliberately blur the distinction between them\u2014because they think that theology is actually just misguided philosophy.\n\nAt the top-level of the proposed typology, we can distinguish between \u201cIntegration\u201d and \u201cContrast\u201d views. Integration views do not distinguish philosophy and theology at all, whereas Contrast views do. We can disambiguate the \u201cContrast\u201d category into \u201cCooperation\u201d views, \u201cDisjunction\u201d views, and \u201cConflict\u201d views. The most prominent Cooperation views treat philosophy as a valuable, perhaps even necessary, tool for theological inquiry, and still allow some degree of overlap between the two. Disjunction views, by contrast, regard philosophy and theology as non-overlapping forms of inquiry, which feature distinct and ultimately unrelated goals and methods. \u201cConflict\u201d views treat philosophy and theology as not only distinct but mutually antagonistic. In fact, however, few Christian thinkers have endorsed outright conflict between philosophy and theology. But it is still worth discussing the Conflict view explicitly, because some prominent Christian theologians throughout history\u2014for example, Tertullian, Martin Luther, or Karl Barth\u2014initially seem to advocate Conflict. Upon closer inspection, however, their views are closer to those in the Disjunction category.\n\nThese categories are crude. They could each be further divided, and subdivided again. They focus mainly on different Christian attitudes toward the interaction of philosophy and theology, rather than on the attitudes of non-Christian philosophers. Some non-empty categories are omitted altogether. But these categories do capture much of the landscape, and at least show that there are more options available than a na\u00efve conflict between faith and reason.\n\n1.1 Integration\n\nThe Integration model treats philosophy and Christian theology as continuous, integrated activities. On this model, rational inquiry about God does not sharply divide into discrete activities called \u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d. Instead, there is simply the single, continuous intellectual task of trying to understand God, and all things in relation to God, using all of one\u2019s intellectual resources. This account does not deny the importance of faith or revelation to the Christian intellectual life; rather, it denies that faith and revelation properly belong to a separate activity called \u201ctheology\u201d in distinction from another activity called \u201cphilosophy\u201d. According to this view, when we engage in rational inquiry of any sort, we should draw on every available source of knowledge that is relevant to that inquiry. So when we engage in rational inquiry about Christian topics, we should draw on scripture, Church tradition, and other such sources of knowledge, whether we call the resulting inquiry \u201ctheology\u201d, \u201cphilosophy\u201d, or something else. To do anything else would be to hobble our inquiry from the outset, according to the Integration view.\n\nThis account of the relationship between philosophy and theology has deep roots in the Christian tradition. Before the rise of the medieval university, it was the dominant view, and it still has contemporary defenders (discussed below). Patristic thinkers did not typically describe their own intellectual work as \u201ctheology\u201d. The term \u201ctheology\u201d already had a fixed meaning in late antiquity. It meant \u201cpoetic speech about the gods\u201d, and was in general associated with pagan story-telling and myth-making: the great \u201ctheologians\u201d, were Homer and Hesiod. Even though Christian thinkers like Gregory of Nazianzus sometimes acquired the honorific title \u201cTheologian\u201d, they did so because of the lyrical and poetic quality of their writing, not because they wrote about Christian doctrinal topics (Zachhuber 2020; McGinn 2008).\n\nThe general term that early Christian thinkers used to describe their intellectual work was, more often than not, simply \u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cChristian philosophy\u201d. Christianity was regarded as the \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d over against the false philosophical schools associated with pagan thought. (See Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 8.1; Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 1.28.3, 1.28.4 1.80.5,6; Augustine of Hippo, Against Julian, 4.14.72.) This usage is consistent with Pierre Hadot\u2019s (1995) claim that in Greco-Roman antiquity philosophy was understood as a comprehensive way of life. Christianity, on this model, is analogous to a philosophical school, in Hadot\u2019s sense (see also Zachhuber 2020).\n\nThe Integration account continued to be the default account of the relationship between philosophy and theology into the early Medieval period. Before the rise of scholasticism in the great Western universities, there was no sharp distinction between philosophy and theology. Anselm of Canterbury, for example, certainly has the concept of a line of inquiry that proceeds using reason alone, without appealing to revelation, but he does not label that inquiry \u201cphilosophy\u201d in distinction from \u201ctheology\u201d. Moreover, in his own writings, he frequently blurs any such distinction, as he seamlessly moves between rational reflection and argument, on the one hand, to prayers, meditations, and exclamations of thanksgiving, on the other (e.g., Proslogion 1\u20134). Like many premodern Christian thinkers, Anselm also held that intellectual inquiry and personal holiness are linked, so that the more one grows in Christian virtue, the more rationally one is able to think about God (Adams 2004; Sweeney, 2011). This understanding of inquiry and virtue is also a hallmark of the Integration account.\n\n1.2 Contrast\n\nUnlike the Integration model, the Contrast model insists that philosophy and theology are fundamentally different forms of inquiry. Strictly speaking, there can be many different Contrast models, because the relevant sense of \u201ccontrast\u201d comes in degrees. I focus on three: Cooperation, Disjunction, and Conflict. On the Cooperation account, philosophy and theology remain close cousins. When rightly pursued, they cannot really conflict, and they can even overlap in their respective topics of inquiry, sources, and methods. Nevertheless, the Cooperation account holds that the overlap between philosophy and theology is only partial, because they each begin from different intellectual starting points and appeal to different sources of evidence (Baker-Hytch 2016; Chignell 2009: 117; Simmons 2019). On another version of the Contrast model, Disjunction, philosophy and theology are even further apart: although they still do not conflict, and may even consider the same topics in an attenuated sense, their starting assumptions and methods of investigation are different enough that they share no significant conclusions. Finally, Conflict accounts assert that the conclusions of Christian theology are positively irrational from the point of view of philosophy. Although some historically important Christian thinkers might seem to endorse Conflict, closer inspection shows that they do not. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, a persistent assumption holds that Christianity requires a sharp conflict between theology and philosophy\u2014or at least faith and reason\u2014and so it is worth briefly discussing why Conflict has had few traditional defenders.\n\n1.2.1 Cooperation\n\nOn the Cooperation account, philosophy and theology are understood to be different, but mutually supporting, intellectual activities. For Christian thinkers who advocate Cooperation, philosophy and theology form a coherent, mutually supportive whole. They are not in conflict with respect to their conclusions, since truth cannot contradict truth, but they differ with respect to their foundational axioms, goals, and sources of evidence. Philosophy is understood as a preamble to theology, while theology completes and fulfills philosophy. Thomas Aquinas is a foundational advocate of the Cooperation account (Summa Theologiae 1.1.1\u20138, Summa Contra Gentiles 1.1.1\u20139, Hankey 2001). Often the relationship between philosophy and theology is described in hierarchical and instrumental terms: theology draws on philosophy as needed, because philosophy is instrumentally useful to theology. According to a traditional metaphor, philosophy is the servant of theology (ancilla theologiae, literally \u201chandmaid\u201d of theology; see Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 1.1.5). In a more contemporary idiom, theology uses conceptual tools provided by philosophy in the pursuit of its own distinctive intellectual task: elucidating the meaning and truth of revealed Christian doctrines.\n\nOn the Cooperation account, theology differs from philosophy chiefly because theology assumes the truth of divine revelation, whereas philosophy does not. Philosophy takes its foundational axioms and assumptions from generally available truths of human reason and sensory experience. Philosophy and theology also differ in the way they argue and in the kinds of intellectual appeals that are proper to each. Theologians can appeal to revelation\u2014scripture and authoritative Church tradition\u2014in order to generate new lines of inquiry, and can treat revealed truths as evidence in their investigations. For their part, philosophers must appeal only to premises and evidence that are in principle available to any rational inquirer.\n\nThis distinction between \u201crevealed truths\u201d and \u201ctruths of reason\u201d implies that at least some revealed truths are not also truths of reason. By hypothesis, such truths would have remained unknown and unknowable had they not been revealed by God. (It therefore follows that without revelation, Christian theology could not exist, on the Cooperation account.) Paradigmatic instances of revealed truths are the doctrine of the Trinity, and the doctrine of the Incarnation. Throughout the centuries, most, though not all, broadly orthodox Christian thinkers have held that human beings could not reason their way to the truth of these doctrines without the aid of divine revelation.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, theologians use the conceptual tools furnished by philosophy to elucidate the contents of revelation. Just like philosophers, theologians make arguments, and their arguments appeal to common standards of logic and rigor, even though they also draw on theology\u2019s own unique (revealed) axioms and sources of evidence (Summa Theologiae 1.1.1). Philosophical arguments cannot prove the foundational truths of revelation, according to Aquinas, but at the same time, revelation and reason cannot conflict. (That God exists is a truth of reason, not revelation, for Aquinas\u2014see Summa Theologiae 1.2.2, reply to obj. 1.) Theologians can therefore use common standards of philosophical reasoning to answer any putative objections to their theological claims, by showing that any alleged conflict is only apparent. So, for example, even though it is not possible to establish that God is triune by means of philosophical arguments, it is possible to use philosophical arguments in a defensive mode, to answer objections alleging that the doctrine of the trinity is logically incoherent. When arguing with other Christians, theologians can appeal to revelation to support their claims. When arguing with opponents who do not accept revelation, they cannot (Summa Theologiae 1.1.8). Yet this restriction is not really a disciplinary maxim designed to oppose philosophy to theology, but a pragmatic admission that one cannot successfully persuade opponents by appealing to premises they deny.\n\n1.2.2 Disjunction\n\nLike Cooperation, the Disjunction view holds that philosophy and theology are different forms of inquiry. Similarly, like Cooperation, the Disjunction view also that agrees that there can be no real conflict between the conclusions of philosophy (when true) and those of theology. But the Disjunction view goes further: Disjunction advocates deny that there is any significant overlap between philosophy and theology at all.\n\nDisjunction does not subordinate philosophy to theology or treat philosophy as an essential tool for theology. Instead, to borrow a term from contemporary science and religion debates, philosophy and theology are \u201cnon-overlapping magisteria\u201d (Gould 1997). In particular, Cooperation\u2019s appeal to the distinction between truths of reason and truths of revelation does not suffice to distinguish philosophy from theology, according to Disjunction advocates, who instead appeal to various more fundamental distinctions of method or approach (see discussion below). Of course, even those who explicitly advocate Disjunction will occasionally deploy some methods associated with philosophy: carefully defining terms, making formally valid arguments, uncovering contradictions in opposing views, etc. Yet these methods are found in any form of rational inquiry, and so (presumably) they do not belong to philosophy alone.\n\nAny given thinker\u2019s view of Disjunction will of course depend on their underlying construal of philosophy and theology. Some thinkers\u2014even some Christian thinkers\u2014endorse the Disjunction view because they deny that theology is really a propositional, truth-apt discourse that proceeds by way of arguments and evidence. Instead, theology is something else entirely\u2014poetry, perhaps; or a form of worship, praise, or prayer (Caputo 2015). This view of theology implies a sharp contrast with Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy, modern philosophy, and contemporary Anglo-American Analytic philosophy, though perhaps not with philosophy tout court. Philosophers might associate this view with the \u201cexpressivist\u201d or \u201cemotivist\u201d critiques of theology that were common in the heyday of logical positivism. But in fact, versions of the \u201ctheology as poetry\u201d view are found throughout the history of Christian thought (Beggiani 2014).\n\nOther versions of the Disjunction view figure even more prominently in the Christian tradition. The foundational Protestant reformers, Martin Luther and John Calvin, both advocate Disjunction, in part because they both reject the synthesis of philosophy and theology that characterized late medieval scholasticism. According to Luther, philosophy and theology proceed from entirely different perspectives, with different starting points and different goals (1539 [1966: 244]; Grosshans 2017). Philosophy considers its objects of inquiry from the perspective of common human reason and sense experience, with the goal of trying to understand things as they actually are in the real world. Theology considers its objects of inquiry from a creational and eschatological perspective, with the goal of trying to understand them in relation to God as their creator and final end. Furthermore, for Luther, \u201ccreation\u201d and its cognates are properly theological terms whose meaning derives from scripture and revelation, and which should not be identified with any philosophical notion of a first cause or prime mover; mutatis mutandis, the same point hold for creation\u2019s final end in God (1539 [1966: 245, 248]).\n\nEven when philosophy and theology do consider the same object of inquiry\u2014for example, the human being\u2014this difference in perspective ensures that the lines of inquiry remain completely separate. Luther\u2019s 1536 \u201cDisputation Concerning Man\u201d, for example opens with the thesis that \u201cPhilosophy or human wisdom defines man as an animal having reason, sensation, and body\u201d and then goes on to explore this definition. But his exploration only serves to contrast this philosophical view of the human being with the perspective of theology. Theology,\n\nfrom the fulness of its wisdom, defines man as whole and perfect\u2026 made in the beginning after the image of God\u2026 subject to the power of the devil, sin and death\u2026freed and given eternal life only through the Son of God, Jesus Christ. (1536 [1966: 137\u2013138])\n\nLuther\u2019s theological account of the human being does not contradict the philosophical account, but it also does not complete or augment that account, because (according to Luther) properly theological claims are simply unintelligible to philosophy (1536 [1966: 137\u2013140]; 1539 [1966: 240\u2013241, 242]). They do not belong to the same universe of discourse.\n\nCalvin shares Luther\u2019s basic understanding of the disjunction between philosophy and theology. Like Luther, Calvin holds that the Fall has corrupted the power of human reason, but has not destroyed it altogether (Institutes 2.2.12\u201317). When restricted to its proper sphere\u2014matters pertaining to the natural world\u2014philosophy remains valuable. But as a result of the Fall, \u201cheavenly things\u201d are inaccessible to unaided human reason (Institutes 2.2.13). By \u201cheavenly things\u201d, Calvin means the saving truths of the Gospel.\n\nSo far, Calvin\u2019s understanding might seem quite similar to the Cooperation view, which also denies that revealed truths are accessible to human reason. But Calvin further distinguishes philosophy from theology at the level of method, by denying that true theology engages in abstract, speculative reasoning, which he associates with philosophy, and insisting that any legitimate knowledge of God must be practical and affective (Institutes 1.12.1, 1.5.10). For example, according to Calvin, it would be impious and dangerous to speculate on all the actions that God could possibly do\u2014God\u2019s absolute power. Instead, we should focus our loving attention on what God has actually done, paradigmatically in the person and work of Christ (Institutes 3.24.2; Helm 2004: 24\u201326). Theology presupposes Christian faith, which is an affective response to Christ, and which requires \u201cconfidence and assurance of heart\u201d (Institutes 3.2.33). Yet scholastic philosophy, with its \u201cendless labyrinths\u201d and \u201cobscure definitions\u201d, has \u201cdrawn a veil over Christ to hide him\u201d (Institutes 3.2.2).\n\nFor Luther and Calvin, then, there can be no genuinely philosophical theology. Even though both agree that philosophical speculation can arrive at some limited truths about, e.g., a first cause, or about the nature of human beings, those truths are of no theological interest; even as bare propositional claims, they are already better and more fully known in theological inquiry. From the other direction, the properly Christian notions of God as creator and of the human being as imago dei, e.g., resist all philosophical speculation. Of course, Luther and Calvin can only hold these views because of the way they understand philosophy and theology. They both identify philosophy with late medieval scholasticism, and they both understand theology as a kind of existential encounter with God and Christ, as revealed in the scriptures. Different accounts of philosophy and theology would yield different construals of the underlying disjunction, or no disjunction at all.\n\n1.2.3 Conflict\n\nNone of the three views considered so far\u2014Integration, Cooperation, and Disjunction\u2014assume any real, essential conflict between philosophy and theology. All three views allow for apparent conflict, due to errors of reasoning or interpretation, or when either discipline departs from its own proper sphere, but they do not assert that Christian theology or Christian faith is irrational from the point of view of philosophy, nor do they hold that any significant Christian doctrinal claims can be falsified by sound philosophical reasoning. Throughout the history of Christian thought, many prominent Christian philosophers and theologians have criticized philosophy, or fulminated against what they regard as philosophical overreach, but few if any have regarded philosophy and theology as essentially incompatible, in the sense just outlined. Popular understandings of \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201creason\u201d often posit a deep and abiding conflict between the two, and so it is important to emphasize just how rare that position has actually been among major Christian philosophers and theologians. Key figures who are often regarded as Conflict advocates, turn out, upon closer inspection, to hold a different view.\n\nFor example, the Patristic theologian Tertullian famously asks \u201cWhat has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d but he never actually asserted the irrationalist credo \u201cI believe because it is absurd\u201d (De praescriptione haereticorum 7; De carne Christi 5.4; see also Harrison 2017). Instead, like all the Patristic fathers, Tertullian regarded human reason as one of God\u2019s greatest gifts; ratio (reason) is one of his most frequently used nouns, and his own writing draws heavily on the stoic philosophy of his day (Osborn 1997).\n\nTurning to a putative modern irrationalist, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard presents the incarnation as a paradox that offends human reason in his (pseudonymous) 1844 Philosophical Fragments, but close reading shows that \u201cparadox\u201d and \u201coffence\u201d do not equate to \u201cformal contradiction\u201d (1844 [1985: 53, 101]; Evans 1989). Rather, the incarnation seems paradoxical only to fallen, sinful human reason (1844, [1985: 46\u201347]). So the \u201coffence\u201d of the incarnation resolves into the claim that the doctrine of the incarnation had to be revealed, because its truth exceeds the limits of fallen reason. But, as discussed above, accepting this claim about the incarnation has been the norm throughout the Christian tradition. Moreover, according to Kierkegaard, even though the truth of the incarnation exceeds the limits of human reason, the claim that reason has limits is itself one that can be assessed by human reason (1846 [1992: 580]; Evans 1989: 355).\n\nFinally, the twentieth century theologian Karl Barth\u2019s famous \u201cNo!\u201d to philosophical reasoning about God is also best understood as a rejection of philosophical overreach rather than a rejection of philosophy per se (Brunner & Barth 1946). According to Barth, we cannot establish the truth of theological claims using generally persuasive arguments available to any rational enquirer. But Barth had no quarrel with using philosophy in an Anselmian mode, to elucidate and clarify the implications of divine revelation, and in principle he even allows that there could be a genuinely Christian philosophy (1932 [1975: 6]; Diller 2010).\n\nThese prominent Christian thinkers all criticize what they see as philosophical hubris, but they do not set philosophy and theology as such in essential opposition, and they do not agree that any belief-worthy Christian doctrines actually are irrational\u2014still less that they can be falsified by sound philosophical reasoning. In a way, this conclusion should be unsurprising. It is a basic claim of Christian orthodoxy that God is the very summit and source of rationality, and that human reason is one of God\u2019s greatest gifts (Turner 2004; A. N. Williams 2007; Crisp et al. 2012). Christian thinkers have differed about the degree to which sin and the Fall have caused human reason to malfunction, but the suggestion that theological truths conflict with properly functioning human reason is alien to the orthodox Christian tradition, and so it is unsurprising that few major Christian thinkers have endorsed it. Far more common is the claim that some theological truths are inaccessible to philosophy because they somehow surpass human reason. On this line, when there is an apparent conflict between a philosophical conclusion and some Christian truth, the conflict is treated as a sign that philosophy has overstepped its own proper boundaries, not a sign that Christian truth actually conflicts with human reason. By and large, even the sharpest Christian critics of philosophy have held this view.\n\n1.3 From Historical Models to Contemporary Philosophical Theology\n\nThis historical survey has focused on prominent models of the relationship between philosophy and theology in the history of Christian thought. The survey also illuminates some contemporary philosophical and theological debates about how to understand this relationship.\n\nNotwithstanding its Patristic origins, the Integrationist view has been especially prominent in recent philosophy of religion. For example, Alvin Plantinga\u2019s (1984) programmatic essay \u201cAdvice to Christian Philosophers\u201d intentionally blurs the distinction between philosophy and theology. Plantinga argues that Christian philosophers qua philosophers are entitled to base their arguments on revealed truths, and urges them to investigate distinctively Christian questions that may be of no interest to the wider philosophical community. More recent defenders of \u201canalytic theology\u201d have also taken an integrationist line. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of Enlightenment-style foundationalism has thoroughly blurred the distinction between philosophy and theology:\n\nWhat difference does [this distinction] make, now that analytic philosophers no longer believe that for some piece of discourse to be a specimen of philosophy, the writer must base all his arguments on public philosophical reason? Call it what you will. (Wolterstorff 2009: 168; see also Stump 2013: 48\u201349; Timpe 2015: 13)\n\nYet this prominent Integrationist line has been strongly criticized by other philosophers of religion, who implicitly endorse some version of the Contrast view, on which philosophy cannot legitimately appeal to theological sources of evidence like revelation and Church authority (Simmons 2019; Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2\u20134). At the same time, according to many Christian theologians, analytic philosophy as such is almost uniquely unsuitable for investigating properly theological questions (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013: 123\u2013134). On the view of these critics, analytic philosophical theology does not revive the Patristic integration of philosophy and theology at all; rather, it remains a distinctly anti-theological form of modern philosophy.\n\nContemporary philosophers and theologians continue to debate the proper relationship between philosophy and theology. Before considering these debates in further detail (in Section 3), however, it is useful to briefly survey recent work in analytic philosophical theology. The fact that the Integrationist view has been so prominent among contemporary analytic philosophers of religion has helped shape a philosophical climate in which self-identified philosophers, working in departments of philosophy, find it completely natural to investigate explicitly Christian theological questions, from within the framework of normative Christian orthodoxy, in the course of their academic work.\n\n2. Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology\n\nRecent work in analytic philosophical theology has engaged with nearly every major Christian doctrine. But work has focused on the most central doctrines: Trinity, Incarnation and Christology, Salvation and Atonement, and Sin and Original Sin. This section lays out the most significant philosophical problems associated with each doctrine and identifies some of the foundational philosophical responses from contemporary thinkers.\n\n2.1 Trinity\n\nAnalytic philosophical theology on the Trinity has focused primarily on the \u201clogical\u201d problem of the Trinity, the problem of how the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014construed as three really existing, really distinct divine entities\u2014can also be exactly one God (Cartwright 1987). The Church\u2019s first two ecumenical councils defined the orthodox terminology now used to state the doctrine, but the councils did not attempt a philosophical solution to the logical problem. In the traditional terminology, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct divine persons (personae in Latin; hypostases in Greek) who share a single divine nature (substantia in Latin; ousia in Greek; see Tanner 1990: 5, 24, 28). The logical problem then becomes the problem of how three divine persons (whatever we mean by \u201cpersons\u201d) can instantiate a single divine nature (whatever we mean by \u201cnature\u201d) while remaining numerically distinct.\n\nResponses to the logical problem can be grouped into several families, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. \u201cSocial\u201d trinitarians defend an account of the Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct centers of consciousness, with three distinct centers of knowledge, will, and action, who nevertheless count as a single God. Social trinitarians attempt to secure the divine unity by arguing that a single divine nature can support three separate consciousnesses. They may also claim that the three persons necessarily love each other so perfectly and act in such harmony that they are properly regarded as a single God. Prominent social trinitarians include Richard Swinburne (1994), William Lane Craig (2006), Keith Yandell (2009), and William Hasker (2013).\n\nBy contrast, \u201cLatin\u201d trinitarians deny that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct centers of consciousness. On Latin trinitarianism, even though the Father, Son, and Spirit are numerically distinct persons, they are not numerically distinct divine agents. When they act, they do not merely act in perfect harmony (as on social trinitarianism). Rather they are (somehow) a single actor, with a single will, carrying out a single action. The special challenge for Latin trinitarianism is to explain how it can be the case that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so construed, really do exist as concrete, distinct entities, and are not just different names for the same entity, or different phases in the life of a not-essentially triune God. Brian Leftow offers the most well-developed Latin model, which appeals to an extended analogy to a time-travelling chorus-line dancer (2004).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the sharpest critics of Latin trinitarianism are those who advocate a social trinity, and vice-versa: each side insists that the theoretical costs of the opposing view are too great. So Latin trinitarians charge that social trinitarians do not escape tri-theism (Leftow 1999; see also Merricks 2006); social trinitarians argue that their Latin counterparts cannot explain how the Father and Son could have a genuine, \u201cI\u2013you\u201d, personal relationship, as the Biblical account seems to suggest (e.g., Matt 3:17, Mark 14:36; Hasker 2013: 114\u2013118; McCall 2010: 87\u201388).\n\nPhilosophical responses to the logical problem of the Trinity do not divide exhaustively into social models and Latin models. \u201cRelative identity\u201d theorists argue that identity is kind-relative, so the Father can be the same God as the Son without being the same person as the son (van Inwagen 1995). \u201cConstitution\u201d theorists make a similar claim by drawing on the metaphysics of constitution. According to constitution theorists, a lump of bronze can constitute a statue without being identical to it, since we can destroy the statue (by melting it down) without destroying the bronze. So too, they argue, the divine nature can constitute the three divine persons without being identical to them, or without entailing that they are identical to each other (Brower & Rea 2005). The metaphysics of constitution requires a coherent notion of \u201cnumerical sameness without identity\u201d. The sharpest criticism of relative identity accounts of the Trinity takes aim at the underlying notion that identity is kind-relative in the relevant sense. Similarly, the sharpest criticism of constitution views expresses doubts about the cogency and usefulness of the metaphysics of constitution (Merricks 2006).\n\nScott Williams defends a hybrid \u201cLatin social\u201d model of the Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are each constituted by the single divine nature, without being numerically identical to the divine nature or to any other person (2013, 2017). Unlike other Latin models, on Williams\u2019s account each of the persons is a distinct agent; unlike other social models, they share numerically one set of powers, including one will (2017). Even so, according to Williams, the persons can each token the indexical \u201cI\u201d with different senses. Critics argue that Williams\u2019s model falters at precisely this point (Hasker 2018b; see also S. Williams 2020).\n\nFor an extended discussion, see the entry, Trinity.\n\n2.2 Incarnation and Christology\n\nBy the close of the fourth century, the early Church had agreed that God the Son, the second person of the Trinity, is no less divine than God the Father. But this Trinitarian settlement led directly to another, equally vexing question: how could Jesus of Nazareth, a human man, also be identical to God the Son? After another period of intense debate, the Church defined the doctrine of the Incarnation, which asserts that Christ is one person (or one hypostasis) who exists in two natures, one fully human, the other fully divine (Tanner 1990: 83; Kelly 1978: 338\u2013343). Yet, as with the doctrine of the Trinity, on its own, this conciliar terminology does not attempt to solve the underlying philosophical problem.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, this problem has been called the \u201cfundamental philosophical problem of Christology\u201d. As Richard Cross puts it:\n\nhow is it that one and the same thing could be both divine (and thus, on the face of it, necessary, and necessarily omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, immutable, impassible, and impeccable) and human (and thus, on the face of it, have the complements of all these properties)? (Cross 2009: 453)\n\nIn other words, the fundamental philosophical problem of Christology is the problem that arises when a single subject bears incompatible properties. Christ seems to be both necessarily omniscient, as the divine Son, the second person of the Trinity, and yet also limited in knowledge, as the human man, Jesus of Nazareth\u2014and so on for other divine and human attributes. Yet Christ is one person, not two: he just is the divine Son and he just is Jesus of Nazareth. On standard interpretations of logical consistency, nothing can have logically incompatible properties at the same time and in the same respect\u2014hence the problem.\n\nA venerable attempted solution to the problem of incompatible properties makes use of grammatical modifiers to index Christological predications to their respective natures: Christ is limited in knowledge qua his human nature, and omniscient qua his divine nature, where \u201cqua\u201d means \u201cwith respect to\u201d or \u201cin virtue of\u201d. More simply: Christ qua human is limited in knowledge; Christ qua divine is omniscient. The thought of Thomas Aquinas furnishes a foundational source for this solution (Summa Theologiae 3.16.1\u201312; for broader discussion of patristic and medieval uses, see Cross 2002: 192\u2013205). Thomas Senor forcefully argues that this grammatical solution does not work, for it cannot block the relevant entailment: since the one Christ really is human and really is divine, it follows that the one Christ is also limited in knowledge (qua human) and omniscient (qua divine), and so the contradiction remains (Senor 2002; see also Morris 1986).\n\nKenotic Christologies hold that at the point of incarnation, in order to become a human being, God the Son relinquished the divine attributes (Forrest 2000; Evans 2002, 2006). In a way, the kenotic option neatly solves the problem of incompatible properties, since Christ is not omnipotent and omniscient (etc.) at the same time as he is limited in power and knowledge. Kenotic Christologies have a venerable pedigree, as well as some clear Biblical warrant (Philippians 2; for discussion see Evans 2006; McGuckin 1994 [2004: 189]. But if omnipotence and omniscience are essential divine attributes, then it is not possible for God the Son to relinquish them during the incarnation and regain them after the incarnation while remaining self-identical.\n\nCompositional Christologies try to solve the problem of incompatible properties by appealing to the various \u201cparts\u201d that together compose the whole Christ. According to Thomas V. Morris, Christ is composed of the divine mind of God the Son, a human mind, and a human body. On his telling, Christ counts as fully divine, because he has a divine mind, which is the seat of his omnipotence and omniscience; he also counts as fully human because he has a human mind and a human body (Morris 1986). Morris seeks to dispel the contradiction between divine and human attributes by revising our understanding of Christ\u2019s human attributes. Morris denies that human beings as such are essentially limited in power and knowledge (etc.). This move clears the way for attributing omnipotence and omniscience (etc.) even to the human, incarnate Christ, while also denying that the human, incarnate Christ is limited in power and knowledge. Richard Swinburne (1994) defends a similar Christology, but according to Swinburne, Christ is composed only of God the Son and a human body, which together constitute both a human way of thinking and acting and also a divine way of thinking and acting.\n\nOther compositional Christologies appeal to supposed mereological facts about the incarnation to ground a more sophisticated version of the \u201cqua move\u201d (discussed above). If God the Son has human parts and divine parts, then perhaps the whole mereological composite can borrow properties from its constituent parts without violating the law of non-contradiction. Analogously, we might say that an apple is both colored and not colored, since it is red (colored) with respect to its skin, but white (not colored) with respect to its flesh. There is a sense in which the apple as a whole is both colored and not colored because it borrows properties from its parts. Perhaps something similar can be said about Christ, understood as a mereological composite of God the Son, a human body, and a human soul. Leading advocates of this sort of view include Brian Leftow (1992, 2011) and Eleonore Stump (2002).\n\nTimothy Pawl (2014, 2016) seeks to dispel the fundamental problem by revising the truth conditions of Christological predications like \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d and \u201cChrist is limited in knowledge\u201d. According to Pawl, it is incorrect that \u201cbeing omniscient\u201d and \u201cbeing limited in knowledge\u201d are logically contradictory properties at all. In fact, according to Pawl, once we correctly understand their truth conditions, we can see that they can both be true of the same subject after all. On Pawl\u2019s account, \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is omniscient and \u201cChrist is limited in knowledge\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is limited in knowledge. Because Christ, and only Christ (so far as we know) has two natures, only Christ can be both omniscient and limited in knowledge. At first glance, Pawl\u2019s proposed solution might seem to be the \u201cqua move\u201d once again, in different dress. But it is importantly different: Pawl is content to affirm the very entailments (e.g., \u201cChrist is omniscient and limited in knowledge\u201d) that the qua move seeks to block; he simply denies that this entailment is logically contradictory.\n\nJc Beall goes a step further and argues that some predicates really are both true and false of Christ, because Christ really is a contradictory being (2019, 2021). Beall defends a contradictory Christology because he accepts a non-standard model of logic, one on which some predicates can be neither true nor false of a subject, and other predicates can be both true and false of a subject. According to Beall, logic as such\u2014that is, his favored account of logic\u2014is neutral about whether any given substantive theory contains true contradictions. To determine whether it does, we must examine the theory\u2019s axiomatic statements. When we examine the axioms of orthodox Christology, according to Beall, we find that they include authoritative conciliar statements that are most naturally read as contradictory\u2014e.g., \u201cChrist is passible and impassible\u201d (2019: 415). Rather than revise or reinterpret such statements so that they are not contradictory, we should accept that they are.\n\n2.3 Atonement and Salvation\n\nArguably, the deepest and most fundamental Christian affirmation is that Christ saves. In traditional terminology, another way to express the same affirmation is that Christ \u201catones\u201d for the sins of human beings. Unlike the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation, however, the early Church never formally defined a single orthodox account of exactly how Christ saves or what it is about his life, death, and resurrection that accomplishes that saving work. As a result, a variety of theories or models of atonement have proliferated throughout the centuries. Contemporary work in analytic philosophical theology typically builds on these models, reformulates them in contemporary language, and seeks to defend them from criticism.\n\nSatisfaction models argue that as a result of their sinfulness, human beings have a debt or obligation to God that they cannot possibly repay. By becoming incarnate, living a sinless life, and voluntarily dying for the sake of humanity, Christ successfully discharges the debts and obligations that human beings owe to God. Anselm\u2019s \u201cWhy God Became Human\u201d (Cur deus homo) is the locus classicus for the satisfaction theory, which has more recently been defended by Swinburne (1988). Closely related to satisfaction models, penal substitution models claim that human beings deserve punishment from God as a result of their sinfulness. Christ saves by freely agreeing to be punished in their place. Mark Murphy (2009) proposes a similar model of \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d, on which Christ\u2019s suffering actually counts as the required punishment for guilty human beings, since knowing that a loved one suffers in one\u2019s place is itself a form of punishment.\n\nSatisfaction and penal substitution theorists must explain why a perfectly merciful God would require satisfaction or punishment from human beings at all, and why a perfectly just God would allow an innocent person to play the required role (Porter 2004). Accordingly, satisfaction and penal substitution views have been heavily criticized by modern and contemporary theologians for depicting God as a petty, wrathful tyrant. Adolph von Harnack\u2019s nineteenth-century criticism of Anselm remains representative. According to Harnack, Anselm\u2019s account depends on a\n\nmythological conception of God as the mighty private man, who is incensed at the injury done to His honor and does not forego His wrath till He has received an at least adequately great equivalent. (1899: 77)\n\nMore recently, feminist theologians and philosophers have criticized satisfaction and penal substitution views for valorizing suffering (Brown and Parker 1989).\n\nEleonore Stump (2018) argues that typical satisfaction and penal substitution accounts cannot address the sinner\u2019s persistent dispositions toward wrongdoing and concomitant feelings of shame. She dubs her positive proposal the \u201cMarian\u201d interpretation of atonement, and argues that it can explain how sinners are freed from shame and restored to fellowship with God. The proposal defies easy summary but it advances an account of atonement as union with God that is further explained using second-personal, psychological notions like \u201cmind-reading\u201d and empathy (2018: 138\u2013139). Christ on the cross mind-reads\u2014that is, psychically experiences\u2014the mental states of every human sinner. Sinful human beings are thereby united to Christ, and so to God. When the indwelling Holy Spirit leads sinners to respond to Christ with love, they also will what God wills. The resulting state of union with God also heals the stain on the soul that is the sinner\u2019s shame.\n\nSeveral other models, also prominent in the Patristic and medieval tradition, have so far received little attention from analytic philosophers of religion. These include \u201cransom\u201d theories on which human beings are freed from Satan\u2019s grasp, and especially \u201ctheosis\u201d or \u201cdivinization\u201d accounts of atonement and salvation, on which Christ\u2019s saving work consists in perfecting human beings so that they become as divine as a creature can be. (Jacobs 2009 and Mosser 2021 are important exceptions). Similarly, few contemporary philosophers defend the modern \u201cmoral exemplar\u201d model, on which Christ saves by being a perfect moral example for other human beings to imitate. (Quinn 1993 offers a highly qualified defense, but holds that Christ is more than just a moral exemplar).\n\n2.4 Sin, Original Sin, and the Fall\n\nThe doctrine of sin and the doctrine of atonement are correlative in the same way that a disease and its remedy are correlative. If sin is that from which Christ saves us, then the strength of the remedy (atonement) must vary according the severity of the disease (sin). As a first approximation, a sinful act can be thought of as a morally bad act for which the sinner is responsible. But the language of \u201csin\u201d adds something to the language of moral wrongdoing: a sin is a failure or fault with respect to God. Like other Christian doctrines, the doctrine of sin poses tricky philosophical problems. To see those problems more clearly, it is useful to disambiguate the doctrine of sin into several distinct components: the first sin, the Fall, original sin, and personal sin.\n\nFor extended discussion, see the entry sin in Christian thought.\n\n2.4.1 The First Sin\n\nThe problem of the first sin is the problem of how the very first sinful act is even possible, given various Christian axioms about the goodness and creative power of God, and various philosophical assumptions about the nature of freedom and moral responsibility. The problem of the first sin is sometimes treated as a question about the fall of Satan. It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to explain how Satan\u2014by hypothesis, an angel created by God with a rational intellect, an upright will, and wholly good desires and dispositions\u2014could ever make the sinful choice to reject God. Augustine (City of God, Book 12), Anselm (\u201cOn the Fall of the Devil\u201d De casu diaboli), and Duns Scotus (Ordinatio 2, dist. 6, q. 2 ) all wrestle with this problem. Contemporary philosophers who try to improve on their efforts include Barnwell (2009, 2017), MacDonald (1999), Rogers (2008), and Timpe (2012). Their responses all seek to explain how Satan\u2019s choice is metaphysically possible, by appealing to their own favored accounts of human freedom and conscious attention. Wood (2016) further distinguishes between the \u201chard problem\u201d of how Satan\u2019s sinful choice is metaphysically possible, and the \u201charder problem\u201d of how it can be subjectively rational\u2014rational from the point of view of Satan himself.\n\n2.4.2 The Fall of Adam and Eve\n\nThe biblical story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) recounts the story of the first human sin and its consequences. The traditional story of the fall of Adam and Eve does not seem consistent with either an evolutionary account of human origins or what we know about human history more generally. On some understandings, questions about the historicity of the Fall are not properly philosophical questions at all. Yet it does seem like a properly philosophical task to articulate a doctrine of the fall that is both internally consistent and consistent with other things we know to be true. Moreover, the doctrine of the Fall is conceptually connected to other aspects of the doctrine of sin as well as to the doctrine of salvation.\n\nPeter van Inwagen presents an account of the Fall that maintains many of its most important elements and, he claims, is consistent with evolutionary theory. Importantly, van Inwagen does not assert that this account is true, but only \u201ctrue for all we know\u201d (2004). In a similar vein, Hud Hudson (2014) offers an ingenious defense of a literal reading of the Genesis account that appeals to contemporary \u201cgrowing block\u201d theories of time. Despite initial impressions, neither van Inwagen nor Hudson are really concerned with defending quasi-literal readings of Genesis. Instead, they want to show that objections to those readings presuppose highly contestable philosophical\u2014rather than empirical or scientific\u2014assumptions.\n\n2.4.3 Original Sin\n\nIn Christian theology, \u201coriginal sin\u201d in the strictest sense refers to the human condition after the Fall and not to the first human sin itself. The fall is the cause of the condition of original sin: because of Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, subsequent human beings somehow \u201cinherit\u201d a disposition toward sin and an attraction toward evil that makes it inevitable that they will sin. On some stronger interpretations, all subsequent human beings are also justly regarded as guilty by God from birth, even before they have sinned themselves. Even apart from worries about the historicity of the fall, the philosophical challenges posed by this doctrine are obvious. How can people living now be morally responsible for the sins of the first human beings? What is the mechanism by which sin and guilt are \u201cinherited\u201d from past generations? If it is inevitable that all human beings will sin, can God justly punish them?\n\nSome Christian philosophers have simply rejected the stronger versions of the doctrine of original sin as incoherent. Swinburne, for instance, denies that all human beings are born guilty as a result of the sin of their first parents and argues that the condition of original sin only makes it very likely, rather than inevitable, that they will sin themselves (1989: 141\u201343). Other philosophers have attempted to show that even a strong doctrine of original sin can be philosophically coherent, given the right metaphysical framework. Michael Rea, for instance, draws on fission theory and the metaphysics of temporal parts to suggest a way that contemporary humans might bear responsibility for the sin of Adam by virtue of being counterparts or stages of Adam himself (2007). He also argues that a Molinist-inspired doctrine of \u201ctransworld depravity\u201d might accomplish much of what Christians want from the traditional doctrine of original sin (2007). John Mullen (2007) also constructs a Molinist account of original sin and inherited guilt. On Molinism, God knows all the true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, which means that God knows every free choice that every human being would make in every possible situation. According to Mullen, if it were true that every free creature would sin in an ideal, garden of Eden situation, then God could justly punish them in the actual world for what they would have done in that counterfactual world.\n\n2.4.4 Personal Sin\n\n\u201cPersonal sin\u201d refers to individual sinful acts. Because the philosophical problems associated with personal sin initially seem very similar to the problems associated with moral wrongdoing, there has been comparatively little philosophical work on personal sin. Still, important definitional questions remain about exactly how, if at all, sin should be distinguished from moral wrongdoing, whether there are sinful actions that are not immoral actions, and, conversely, whether there are immoral actions that are not sinful (Mitchell 1984; Dalferth 1984; Adams 1991; Couenhoven 2009).\n\n2.5 Other Topics\n\nThere are philosophical questions raised by nearly all Christian doctrines and practices, and so there are many fertile areas of inquiry that still remain comparatively underexplored. This brief survey has focused on the most widely treated areas of analytic philosophical theology. But some of the most creative work has branched out into other domains including the Eucharist (Arcadi 2018; Pickup 2015); liturgy, ritual, and worship (Cuneo 2016); bodily resurrection and personal identity (van Inwagen 1978; Merricks 1999; Zimmerman 1999; Rudder Baker 2001); heaven (Walls 2002; Ribeiro 2011), hell (Walls 1992; Adams 1993; Kvanvig 1993; Sider 2002; Buckareff & Plug 2005) and purgatory (Walls 2011; Dumsday 2014).\n\n2.6 The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n\nIn 2009 Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea published their edited volume Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology. The volume\u2019s contributors collectively try to make the case that analytic philosophy offers a valuable and neglected resource for Christian theologians. A new research program developed in its wake, and the ensuing years have seen the rise of a self-identified school of \u201canalytic theologians\u201d, who use the tools and methods of analytic philosophy to address Christian theological topics.\n\nAt present, it is not clear whether there is any meaningful difference between Christian \u201canalytic theology\u201d and Christian \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d, which has been treated as a kind of philosophy. As the discussion above indicates, analytic philosophical theology has been produced largely by Christian philosophers working in philosophy departments, rather than by theologians in departments of theology or divinity schools. Classic works of philosophical theology like Swinburne (1994) and Adams (2000) seem like analytic theology avant la lettre, for example, and much recent work called \u201canalytic theology\u201d seems quite similar to previous work called \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d or even \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d (e.g., Mullins 2016). Yet some self-described analytic theologians have also insisted that Christian analytic theology is really a form of theology (Torrance [Alan] 2013; Torrance [Andrew] 2019; Crisp, Arcadi, & Wessling 2019). They emphasize that Christian analytic theology is an internal project of faith seeking understanding that, as theology, holds itself accountable to scripture and Church tradition. Yet whether Christian analytic theology is properly regarded as a kind of philosophy or a kind of theology depends on how we draw the underlying distinction between philosophy and theology\u2014if indeed we draw such a distinction at all.\n\n3. Philosophy of Religion, Philosophical Theology, Christian Theology: Is There A Difference and Does it Matter?\n\nIt might seem odd that analytic philosophy of religion (APR) includes explicitly Christian philosophical theology of the sort discussed in Section 2. Yet most philosophers of religion working in the analytic tradition are Christian theists (Bourget & Chalmers 2014; De Cruz 2017). They avowedly want to explore their faith using analytic philosophical tools, and see no problem in calling their work Christian philosophy, philosophical theology, or more recently, \u201canalytic theology\u201d. Of course, philosophy of religion as such is broader than APR, and APR is broader than Christian APR. There are philosophers of religion whose work is analytic but not Christian (e.g., Lebens 2020; Mizrahi 2020; Steinhart 2020; Oppy 2018; Schellenberg 2018; Draper 2019), Christian but not analytic (e.g., Westphal 2001; Pattison 2011), and neither analytic nor Christian (e.g., Hammerschlag 2016; Burley 2016). Even so, the predominance of Christian philosophical theology\u2014or \u201cPlantinga-style Christian philosophy\u201d (Schellenberg 2018)\u2014within APR has recently reopened some contentious debates about the proper relationship between philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nThese debates can be grouped around two different\u2014and opposing\u2014lines of criticism. According to the first line, much APR is too Christian and too theological: not really philosophy at all, but a thinly-disguised form of Christian theology\u2014perhaps even a form of apologetics (Levine 2000; Knepper 2013: 9; Draper 2019: 2). Conversely, according to the second line, advanced by prominent theologians, APR is neither fully Christian nor fully theological. On this line of criticism, APR does not really wrestle with the transcendent God of Christian faith, but tends to construct and examine its own false \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013; Oliver 2010; see also Harris & Insole 2005, 17). Although mutually opposing, both lines of criticism raise an important methodological question: how\u2014if at all\u2014should we distinguish philosophy about Christian topics from Christian theology? Section 1 (above) surveyed important responses to this question in the history of Christian thought. This section addresses the question in the context of contemporary challenges to analytic philosophy of religion.\n\n3.1 Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Too Theological?\n\nThe charge that APR is \u201ctoo theological\u201d can be disambiguated into two distinct worries. The first worry concerns the scope of APR when considered as a whole: APR is too narrow, because it focuses excessively on Christian theological topics, to the exclusion of other equally important matters. The second worry concerns the sources and methods of Christian APR specifically: the sources and methods of Christian APR belong more properly to theology than to philosophy.\n\n3.1.1 Narrowness of Scope?\n\nThe charge that APR as a discipline is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d or \u201ctoo theological\u201d could be understood as a worry about its scope: perhaps APR focuses too much on Christian theological topics, or at least on versions of monotheism that are compatible with Christianity, and is therefore too narrow in scope. Critics who advance the narrowness worry include Trakakis 2008, Wildman 2010, Knepper 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Lewis 2015, Jones 2019, Draper 2019, Timpe & Hereth 2019, Mizrahi 2020. Although the narrowness worry has wide currency, it is not always clear how to understand it as a properly philosophical criticism. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the narrowness worry is more often aimed at the field of APR as a whole, rather than at individual instances of APR. After all, the general claim that APR is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d does not entail that any specific argument of any specific philosopher is unsound. Similarly, even if it is true that APR as a whole should be \u201cless Christian\u201d, it is hard to see why that fact would require any individual philosopher to change her research and teaching focus (Schilbrack 2014: 12).\n\nStill, some versions of the narrowness worry are more philosophical than others. According to more philosophical versions, Christian APR frequently fails as philosophy: as a result of their Christian-theological biases, analytic philosophers of religion inadvertently make bad arguments. On this line, Christian analytic philosophers are especially likely to engage in motivated reasoning and ignore counter-arguments or alternative points of view drawn from other religious traditions. Because APR is so narrow, Christian philosophers unwittingly work in an echo-chamber or an epistemic bubble (Schilbrack 2014: 14; Draper 2019: 5; De Cruz 2020). As a result, according to critics, the conclusions of their putatively philosophical arguments are often unwarranted for anyone outside the Christian community, even when they purport to be generally probative.\n\nLess philosophical versions of the narrowness worry assert the general principle that APR should be more capacious, and should include more non-Christian voices, without explicitly challenging the soundness of specific analytic arguments (Knepper 2013; Carroll 2016; Mizrahi 2020). Here the worry is simply that APR does not\u2014but should\u2014reflect the diversity of religious and non-religious viewpoints that actually obtain in the world. Phrased differently, APR as a field wrongly excludes too much good philosophical work that just happens not to fit into the dominant Christian, monotheistic paradigm. Yet one can hold this view without also agreeing that existing APR fails on its own terms or that any specific philosophers should alter their practices.\n\n3.1.2 Inappropriate Methods?\n\nThe charge that APR is too theological could also be understood as a question about philosophical methodology. On this version of the charge, Christian APR does not begin from generally accessible assumptions and argue toward generally acceptable conclusions, as good philosophy should. Instead, it typically begins from Christian assumptions and argues toward Christian conclusions, like theology.\n\nJ.L. Schellenberg, for example, argues that philosophy must seek solutions to philosophical problems that are in principle \u201cshareable\u201d by any member of the philosophical community. Because much Christian APR assumes the truth of Christianity, its solutions cannot satisfy this condition, and should properly count as theology rather than philosophy (Schellenberg 2018). J. Aaron Simmons agrees: even though theology \u201ccan and should\u201d appeal to evidence restricted to \u201cdeterminate communities defined by revelational authorities\u201d, philosophy should appeal to \u201cevidence that is, in principle, accessible by all members of the philosophical community\u201d (2019: 147). According to Simmons, the dominant strand of APR has ignored this criterion, and threatens to \u201cbecome simply a subset of Christian theological practice\u201d (2019: 149; see also Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2).\n\n3.1.3 Responses to the Worry that APR is \u201cToo Theological\u201d\n\nAnalytic philosophers of religion have a variety of ways to respond to the charge that APR is too theological. First, with respect to the narrowness charge, they can accuse critics of mistaking the part for the whole, by denying that the charge applies to APR as such, and by pointing to those analytic philosophers of religion who neither assume nor defend the truth of Christianity. Yet this response is undercut by the fact that non-Christian practitioners of APR often make the narrowness themselves (Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019). Second, its defenders also emphasize that much Christian APR does not actually assume the truth of Christianity at all, but instead argues for that truth. (Hasker 2018a: 90; citing Swinburne is a paradigmatic example). This kind of philosophy would clear even Schellenberg\u2019s \u201cshareable in principle\u201d bar. Similarly, even those philosophical projects that eschew Swinburne-style natural theology might still clear the \u201csharable in principle\u201d bar so long as they engage only in defensive maneuvers\u2014for example, by answering philosophical objections to the plausibility of Christian claims (e.g., van Inwagen 1995; Pawl 2014).\n\nOthers argue that even explicit appeals to Christian revelation could in principle still count as philosophical appeals, albeit indirectly. Suppose we agree that theology can appeal to revelation, while philosophy trades only in \u201cgenerally accessible\u201d arguments. We still must distinguish between direct, first-order appeals to revelation, and indirect, second-order arguments that it is sometimes permissible to appeal to revelation (Wood 2021: 213\u2013215). The second-order arguments could still be generally accessible philosophical arguments, even though the first-order appeals are not. For example, a first-order \u201ctheological\u201d appeal might be: \u201cThe New Testament asserts p; therefore p\u201d. But a philosopher might offer a general epistemological argument, accessible to anyone in the philosophical community, to defend the rationality of that same first-order appeal. (For example, she might offer a general argument that it is rational to form beliefs based on testimony, and the same general argument might establish that it is rational to treat the New Testament as testimonial evidence.) In a similar vein, Plantinga\u2019s claim that belief in God may be \u201cproperly basic\u201d is not itself presented as a Christian assumption or a revealed truth, but as a specific application of his general philosophical theory of warrant, which he has defended at length (1983, 1993a, 1993b).\n\nFinally, because there is no single uncontested way to understand the boundaries between philosophy and theology, it is open to Christian philosophers of religion simply to deny the sharp distinction presupposed by critics like Schellenberg and Simmons (see, for example, Plantinga 1984, Wolterstorff 2009). In so doing, they would implicitly endorse a more Patristic \u201cIntegration\u201d model instead of either the Medieval \u201cCooperation\u201d model or the modern \u201cDisjunction\u201d model (see Section 2 above).\n\n3.2 Or Not Theological Enough? Theological Critiques of Analytic Philosophy of Religion\n\nWhile one set of critics accuse APR of becoming too theological, another set takes the opposite line. According to several prominent theologians and philosophers, something about the analytic style of philosophizing makes APR particularly unsuitable for investigating Christian doctrines. On this line of criticism, far from becoming a species of Christian theology, APR is constitutively opposed to Christian theology, and the problem with analytic philosophical theology is not that it is too theological but that it is too analytic. This criticism takes several forms.\n\nSometimes, theological objections to APR simply reiterate Barthian objections to natural theology, presumably on the assumption that most APR is really a form of natural theology (Moore 2007). Other critics charge analytic philosophers of religion with historical anachronism and ignorance of the Christian tradition. Perhaps \u201ca-historical\u201d analytic philosophers of religion do not understand pre-modern ways of thinking and reading (so runs the charge), and so they wrongly believe that their own constructive work is congruent with the historic Christian tradition, when it in fact depends modern assumptions that are inimical to the Christian tradition (Hart 2013: 123, 129; Milbank 2009: 320). Other critics press the related worry that APR ignores the real Christian tradition altogether in favor of theorizing its own abstract, self-constructed version of the Christian god. Here APR\n\ndoes not deal with the God of any tradition or encounter, but with a conceptual construct, a simulacrum or \u2018the God of the philosophers\u2019\u2026. (Oliver 2010: 467\u2013468; see also Hyman 2010)\n\nAnother multi-faceted line of theological criticism criticizes APR for \u201cidolatry\u201d, \u201cunivocity\u201d, and \u201contotheology\u201d. This line reflects the general worry that APR does not take divine mystery or transcendence seriously enough. \u201cOntotheology\u201d is a theological term of opprobrium that, in its current usage, derives from Heidegger (1957; see also Marion 1982 [1995]). It means, roughly, treating God like \u201ca being\u201d or \u201ca thing in the world\u201d. According to its theological critics, APR constitutively assumes that God is a possible object of human knowledge, even apart from revelation, and therefore treats God as fundamentally similar to any other object \u201cout there\u201d passively waiting to be discovered. Yet a God like this (so runs the worry) is not really God at all, but something else\u2014an idol.\n\nThe worry about ontotheology and idolatry is also a worry about univocity\u2014the view that our terms bear the same meaning when applied to God and creatures (Trakakis 2010). According to opponents of theological univocity, precisely because God is not \u201ca being\u201d or a \u201cthing in the world\u201d, God and creatures differ absolutely; they share no properties and so cannot be described by univocal predications. (So, e.g., the word \u201cgood\u201d cannot have the same meaning in the statements \u201cGod is good\u201d, and \u201cSocrates is good\u201d.) Worries about theological predication and univocity date back to the Patristic period, but in contemporary philosophy of religion, they are best understood as continuations of the late medieval disputes between followers of Duns Scotus, who defends univocal predication, and his Thomist opponents (T. Williams 2005; Burrell 2008; Cross 2008). As a generalization, most contemporary analytic philosophers of religion endorse a univocal account of theological language, whereas contemporary Christian theologians are more likely to deny univocity in favor of analogical or metaphorical predication, or even non-predicative forms of theological language (Pickstock 2005; Marion 1999).\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp rhetoric, there has been very little direct engagement between analytic philosophers of religion and their theological opponents on these questions. T. Williams (2005), Cross (2008) defend univocal predication, and Adams (2014) tries to rehabilitate ontotheology. Other analytic thinkers offer their own positive accounts of divine transcendence (Crisp and Rea [eds.] 2009: 9\u201311; Rea 2015, 2020; Jacobs 2015). More generally, analytic philosophers and theologians have a variety of strategies for avoiding the deleterious consequences of univocity and ontotheology (Wood 2021: 130\u201374)."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christology", "page_content": "The underlying methodological assumption of Christology is that the New Testament contains the authentic and accurate record of Jesus, both explicitly and implicitly. The New Testament is taken to convey that the earliest followers of Jesus were convinced that God was revealed in him and that they attributed a number of titles to him, such as \u201cMessiah,\u201d \u201cSon of Man,\u201d \u201cSon of God,\u201d and \u201cLord.\u201d Christian discourse uses the portrayal of Jesus in the foundational documents of Christianity as a point of departure. Traditionally, Christological reflection has focused on two specific aspects of that portrayal\u2014namely, the person and the work of Jesus. It has also sought to clarify and systematize the meaning of the scriptural depiction of Jesus.\n\nChristology , Christian reflection, teaching, and doctrine concerning Jesus of Nazareth. Christology is the part of theology that is concerned with the nature and work of Jesus, including such matters as the Incarnation , the Resurrection, and his human and divine natures and their relationship.\n\nSources and concepts\n\nThe basic sources for the historical development of Christology are the New Testament, containing the foundational Christian writings; the creeds of Christianity, especially those from the first five centuries; and the reflections of theologians. Clearly, those three are interrelated, with theological reflection occupying a pivotal place. Theologians explicated what they understood to be the meaning of both the New Testament and the creeds. In so doing they played a crucial role in the formulation of the Christological creeds. The argument has also been put forward that the liturgy of early Christianity played an incisive role in the formulation of the creeds, including those of Christology.\n\nReflections about Jesus dominated Christian discourse from the apostolic age onward. Most of that Christological reflection took place in the eastern Mediterranean, where it utilized the language (Greek) and concepts of Classical antiquity. The Christological debate is quite unintelligible without an awareness of how it was shaped by that context. Since there seem to be echoes of Classical concepts in Scripture, it is not surprising that Christian theologians appropriated them in order to explicate the meaning of Christian affirmations. Two notions in particular played important roles: logos theology and preexistence.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 19 Things to Know About Christianity\n\nLogos theology, which was formulated by the Jewish philosopher Philo, sought to describe how God is active and effective through the divine will, reason, and power. That activity was named the logos (Greek: \u201cword\u201d) of God. Christian reflection understood Jesus as the manifestation of the divine will, reason, and power and therefore applied the concept of the logos to him\u2014dramatically so in the opening of The Gospel According to John. (\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\u201d) The startling newness of the Christian affirmation lay in the belief that the logos \u201cbecame flesh.\u201d\n\nThere are intimations of the concept of preexistence both in the Hebrew Scriptures and in the thought of Classical antiquity. That concept held that everything good on earth was preexistent with God, existing in God\u2019s cognition. The good thus existed with God before any earthly appearance, which is merely the transition from hiding to manifestation. The concept of preexistence is related to the notion that there is nothing that God does not know, that there is neither past nor future with God, and that God is the Lord of History. In the New Testament, notions of preexistence, which Christian exegetes have found expressed in the Hebrew Bible, are applied to Jesus. The Letter of Paul to the Philippians (2:7), for example, speaks of the preexistent Jesus who is sent down by God \u201cin human form,\u201d while the Second Letter of Paul to the Corinthians (8:9) portrays Jesus\u2019 Incarnation as an impoverishment, noting that he gave up his riches to become poor so that believers could become rich. According to the apostle Paul, Jesus is voluntarily obedient in his descent from heaven, which is followed by his return there."}, {"url": "https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-precious-power-of-the-blood", "page_content": "David Mathis is executive editor for desiringGod.org and pastor at Cities Church .

We sang them often in church when I was young \u2014 bobbing up and down on our toes. The best church songs in the South were toe-bobbers. And my father seemed to love \u201cPower in the Blood\u201d most of all. I could tell he would sing louder than normal on this one, and I\u2019d follow suit. I think the whole congregation sang with more gusto than usual, but I couldn\u2019t hear them well with the two of us both raising our voices.\n\nChristians of all stripes and leaning affirm there is indeed power in the blood of Jesus. Word- and Spirit-shaped souls feel that intuitively, but have you ever paused to ask how? Is the magic blood? If there is power in his blood, how do we explain the reality? What truths operate under the surface when we celebrate, in shorthand, this wonder-working pow\u2019r?\n\nWhat Does the Blood Do?\n\nThe New Testament epistle to the Hebrews builds the bridge from the Old Testament sacrificial system (and its blood) to the new covenant and Jesus\u2019s once-for-all sacrifice (Hebrews 9:7, 12). Throughout the Bible, blood represents life (for instance, Genesis 9:4), and the spilling or shedding of blood, in turn, depicts death (Leviticus 17:11, 14; Deuteronomy 12:23). Because the just penalty of human sin against God is death (Romans 6:23), the death of sanctioned animal sacrifices, through the presentation of their blood, stood in temporarily for the requirement of death for sinners. Yet the high priest had to return year after year, \u201crepeatedly\u201d (Hebrews 9:7; 9:25), because \u201cit is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins\u201d (Hebrews 10:4). The repeated animal sacrifices were delaying the inevitable, waiting on God\u2019s fullness of times. One day a final reckoning for sin must come.\n\nChristians, of course, believe and celebrate that now in Christ, and under the terms of a new covenant, the reckoning has come. Jesus willingly \u201coffered himself\u201d (Hebrews 9:14) by \u201conce for all\u201d shedding \u201chis own blood\u201d (Hebrews 9:12), bringing to its intended completion the temporary covenant that came before (the old covenant) and inaugurating in its place an \u201ceternal covenant,\u201d (Hebrews 13:30), which we call the new covenant.\n\nHebrews celebrates some of the specific benefits Christians enjoy because of Jesus\u2019s blood (Hebrews 10:19; 13:12), but it\u2019s the apostle Paul, in particular, who celebrates the manifold grace that comes to us because of his blood. In one sense, we can connect to Jesus\u2019s blood every divine grace that comes to us, but five times Paul makes the connection explicit, with both the mention of blood and a specific aspect of what Christ has secured for us with his death.\n\nPropitiation: To Remove God\u2019s Righteous Wrath\n\nRomans 3:25 says Jesus is the one whom \u201cGod put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.\u201d Because God is just, the sins of his people are no small obstacle. In his kindness and grace, he has chosen to love us, yet in his justice he cannot sweep our sins, which are acts of cosmic treason against him, under the rug of the universe. So, in his love, he devises a way to satisfy justice and still triumph with mercy.\n\nGod himself, in the person of his own Son, takes on human flesh and blood and offers himself in the place of sinful people, to receive the just wrath of God and pay our penalty in his death, all that we might live. His blood, then, signifying the sacrificial giving of his life in the place of those deserving death (and \u201creceived by faith\u201d), propitiates his righteous wrath, upholds divine justice, and opens the floodgates of his mercy.\n\nJustification: To Extend God\u2019s Full Acceptance\n\nRomans 5:9 says \u201cwe have now been justified by his blood.\u201d Justified is courtroom language. The prosecution and defense each present their case, and the judge or jury makes a declaration: either righteous or condemned. The defendant is either guilty as charged or declared to be in right standing with the law \u2014 justified.\n\nThe reason those who are united to Jesus by faith are justified is owing, in part, to his sacrificial and substitutionary death. He willingly shed his own blood not for his own sins (he had none), but for ours. The spilling of his blood to cover our sins made possible our sharing in his righteousness by joining us to him through faith. Without his blood, our unrighteousness would remain unaddressed. We could not stand with him at the final judgment and receive with him his Father\u2019s declaration, \u201cRighteous.\u201d\n\nRedemption: To Purchase Our True Freedom\n\nEphesians 1:7 says, \u201cIn him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses.\u201d To redeem means to buy back or secure the freedom of someone in bondage. Because of our sins, we all were (or continue to be) in spiritual captivity. Our violations of God\u2019s law mean we deserve his omnipotent, righteous wrath. But in Christ, by the shedding of his blood, which forgives our sins before God, he purchases our freedom from justice and from the power of Satan. \u201cHaving forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands\u201d (Colossians 2:13\u201314), through his self-offering at the cross, Jesus \u201cdisarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame\u201d (Colossians 2:15).\n\nThe decisive weapon the demons had against us was unforgiven sin, but when Jesus spilled his own blood in our place, to forgive our sins, he freed us from captivity. He redeemed us from Satan and the record of debt and legal demands against us.\n\nForgiveness: To Restore Our Best Relationship\n\nThese precious themes, of course, overlap. We\u2019ve already seen the importance of forgiveness, but Ephesians 2:13 puts it at the fore: \u201cnow in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\u201d At the heart of this \u201cbringing near\u201d is the restoration of humanity with the divine. On the individual level, it\u2019s the creation in Christ of personal access to and a relationship with God that we, born into sin, never could have secured. On the corporate level, it\u2019s the restoration in Christ of the relationship with God for which we were made.\n\nOur sin and rebellion against God has put distance between us and him. In his old-covenant grace, he drew near to his covenant people called Israel. But now, in the new covenant, he draws near not to a particular ethnic people, but to all who receive his Son in faith, no matter who they are or how far they had run. In fact, the phrase \u201cbrought near by the blood of Christ\u201d gets at the heart of what each of these divine gifts in Jesus\u2019s blood does for us: it brings us to God. There may be no better summary of what we\u2019ve seen so far about the power of Jesus\u2019s blood than 1 Peter 3:18: \u201cChrist suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God.\u201d\n\nPacification: To Make Peace with God Himself\n\nFinally, the God-centered aim of the effects of Jesus\u2019s blood is confirmed in its peace-making between God and his people. In Christ, God reconciles his people \u201cto himself . . . making peace by the blood of his cross\u201d (Colossians 1:19\u201320). That he shed his blood on the cross has been implicit in each instance, but here Paul makes it plain. It is \u201cthe blood of his cross\u201d that makes peace between God and man. He made peace with an instrument of intentional and horrific torture and execution.\n\nJesus did not shed his blood by accident. This was no random death. Tragic as it was, it was deliberate and voluntary. He was executed unjustly, and his blood was spilled on purpose at the cross, both by sinful men and the holy God-man. They took his life, and he gave it. In doing so, he absorbed the righteous wrath of God, granted us his full legal acceptance, purchased our true freedom, restored our most important relationship, and made peace for us with God himself. This is how, as Paul says elsewhere, he secured \u201cthe church of God, which he obtained with his own blood\u201d (Acts 20:28).\n\nPrecious Blood\n\nFollowing the trail of blood in Paul\u2019s letters, we begin to see an ocean of grace in that last line of the familiar chorus: There is pow\u2019r, pow\u2019r, wonder-working pow\u2019r / In the precious blood of the Lamb. Precious, indeed.\n\nThat pairing of precious with Jesus\u2019s blood comes from the apostle Peter:\n\nYou were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. (1 Peter 1:18\u201319)\n\nIt is fitting to sing of his blood and, in doing so, celebrate all the riches represented by it. When we add precious in that final line, we\u2019re not just adding two additional syllables to make the cadence work with the tune. His blood is truly precious to us. Infinitely valuable. Because Christ himself, and God himself in him, is precious to us. And because the blood of Christ, more precious than any other means, fulfills our deepest aches and longings in God, not just temporarily but finally and forever."}, {"url": "https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/things-the-bible-tells-us-about-the-blood-of-jesus.html", "page_content": "There are a plethora of hymns and worship songs that talk about the blood of Jesus. Some of my favorites include:\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus;\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus.\n\nThere is power, power, wonder working power\n\nIn the blood of the Lamb;\n\nO victory in Jesus,\n\nMy Savior, forever.\n\nHe sought me and bought me\n\nWith His redeeming blood\n\nWhat is the power of the blood of Jesus and why do we sing about it so much? If you think about the meaning of the blood of Jesus in Christianity - it is everything. In Hebrews 9:22 we are reminded that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. If Jesus did not die on the cross and shed his blood for our sins then we have no hope of forgiveness. That means that this blood that Jesus shed has power first and foremost to wash away sins and that should mean everything to a Christian.\n\nThe Blood of Jesus Is Life-Giving\n\nLeviticus 17:11 teaches us, \u201cFor the life of the body is in its blood. I have given you the blood on the altar to purify you, making you right with the LORD. It is the blood, given in exchange for a life, that makes purification possible.\u201d\n\nWhenever someone donates blood they are literally giving a part of their life so that another might live. The sacrifice a person makes of temporary pain and loss provides a greater gain of another. If a person has no blood running through their veins, the person has no life. Jesus Himself knew that His blood would be given in a greater way than a blood drive. Rather than giving life to one or a few other people, His blood gives life to all who accept Him.\n\nWe see from the beginning that the consequence of sin is death. Since life is in the blood, from the beginning we see God Himself teach humanity to sacrifice animals to cover their sins. (Genesis 3:21) The lives of sacrificed animals were the temporary offerings over the sins of the people performed by the high priests. Hebrews 5:1 says, \u201cFor every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.\u201d\n\nWe see that Abraham\u2019s faith made him well. It wasn\u2019t so much the sacrifice of sins but the obedience out of a heart of faith that the Messiah was coming. BibleStudyTools shares Bible verses that tell us that Jesus\u2019 blood gives us new life and redemption.\n\nEphesians 1:17 \u201cIn him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God \u2019 s grace.\u201d\n\ns grace.\u201d Hebrews 9:14 \u201cHow much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!\u201d\n\nHebrews 13:12 \u201cAnd so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.\u201d\n\nThe Blood of Jesus Was Necessary\n\nPure, perfect blood was a requirement to reconcile us back to God. We often do not like to think about our sins and the devastation of separation that they have caused us from the Creator, but in reality, we are under the punishment of sin which is death. As we read of blood sacrifices paid on behalf of the sins of the people of God, we are even more aware of what would have been required of us had Jesus not come. We are significantly blessed to be on this side of the cross. Jesus\u2019 blood covered all sins in one divine moment of death, He brought us eternal life.\n\nColossians 1:20, \u201cAnd through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.\u201d\n\nHebrews 9:22, \u201cIn fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.\u201d\n\nMatthew 26:28, \u201cThis is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\u201d\n\nI even ponder the time when the angel of death was going to take the first born sons in Egypt during the time of Moses. This was the final plague on Egypt because Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go. (Exodus 12:23) Blood from a pure animal was the necessary action to protect the first borns from death. This was a foreshadowing of the blood that Christ would one day shed on the cross to protect us all who accept Him from eternal death.\n\nThe Blood of Jesus Gives Freedom\n\nRevelations 1:5 \u201cAnd from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.\u201d\n\nWe all have had a death sentence. We have been trapped by the deception and luring of our sinful ways. Jesus\u2019 blood sets us free from the punishment of sin. We no longer have to live under the bondage and condemnation of sin. Because Jesus has the victory, those who follow Him share in His victory. (1 Corinthians 15:57)\n\nWe do not need to be fearful of the punishment of eternal death and separation from God. We have been justified by Jesus\u2019 blood and saved from the wrath of God. According to Webster\u2019s Dictionary, justified means, \u201cHaving or shown to have a just, right, or reasonable basis.\u201d This means that we have been made right by the blood of Jesus. What sins made wrong that caused us to be guilty, Jesus\u2019 blood took care of on our behalf.\n\nImagine being sentenced to prison and then death. The gut-wrenching moment of realizing that you were guilty and you could not pay your way, smooth talk your way, or argue your way out of it. Then, steps in a Man with a perfect track record who never did anything wrong. He says that he would like to take your place. So the guards bind him in chains that were meant to be yours, mock him, beat him, and ultimately kill him instead of you. This is what Jesus did for us through His bloody death. We no longer have to hold the weight of punishment from sins, but it is by His great love that we have been set free.\n\nRomans 5:9 \u201cSince we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God\u2019s wrath through him!\u201d\n\nThe Blood of Jesus Was Perfect\n\nIn order for Jesus\u2019 blood to make a difference, He needed to be perfect. Jesus\u2019 perfection was a result of Him being fully God and fully man. Whenever a sacrifice was made prior to Jesus, they were always \u201ca male without defect.\u201d The Hebrew word tamiym meaning, to be complete is from the root word tamam which means to be finished. Sinful people needed a sinless Savior. Jesus purified us whiter than snow with His perfect blood.\n\n1 Peter 1:18-19 \u201cFor you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.\u201d\n\nMaybe you are not feeling valuable or seen today? Perhaps you feel that you are too dirty for Jesus. I encourage you to take heart and believe His words that His sacrifice took care of every sin.\n\nJohn 1:29 says, \"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \u2018Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\u2019\u201d His blood gives life, it was necessary, it gives us freedom, and it was perfect. Because of His great love to lay down His life, we can believe in Him and now have eternal hope that we have been covered by the Lamb of the world.\n\nPrayer of Thankfulness for the Blood of Jesus\n\nJesus, thank You for leaving heaven and coming to earth to die on the cross for me. Thank You for shedding Your blood so I could begin each day in the joy of being cleansed and forgiven. Thank You for being the Lamb of God, my perfect Savior from sin!\n\nPhoto Credit: \u00a9iStock/Getty Images Plus/RomoloTavani\n\nEmma Danzey\u2019s mission in life stems from Ephesians 3:20-21, inspiring young women to embrace the extraordinary.

The problem lies in the fact that, whereas theology as a concept had its origins in the tradition of the ancient Greeks, it obtained its content and method only within Christianity. Thus, theology, because of its peculiarly Christian profile, is not readily transferable in its narrow sense to any other religion. In its broader thematic concerns, however, theology as a subject matter is germane to other religions.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Plato, with whom the concept emerges for the first time, associated with the term theology a polemical intention\u2014as did his pupil Aristotle. For Plato, theology described the mythical, which he allowed may have a temporary pedagogical significance that is beneficial to the state but is to be cleansed from all offensive and abstruse elements with the help of political legislation. This identification of theology and mythology also remained customary in later Greek thought. In contrast to philosophers, \u201ctheologians\u201d (e.g., the 8th-century-bce Greek poets Hesiod and Homer, the cultic servants of the oracle at Delphi, and the rhetoricians of the Roman cult of emperor worship) testified to and proclaimed that which they viewed as divine. Theology thus became significant as the means of proclaiming the gods, of confessing to them, and of teaching and \u201cpreaching\u201d this confession. In this practice of \u201ctheology\u201d by the Greeks lies the prefiguration of what later would be known as theology in the history of Christianity. In spite of all the contradictions and nuances that were to emerge in the understanding of this concept in various Christian confessions and schools of thought, a formal criterion remains constant: theology is the attempt of adherents of a faith to represent their statements of belief consistently, to explicate them out of the basis (or fundamentals) of their faith, and to assign to such statements their specific place within the context of all other worldly relations (e.g., nature and history) and spiritual processes (e.g., reason and logic).\n\nHere, then, the above indicated difficulty becomes apparent. In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of \u201cbelievers\u201d to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation\u2014in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination. If one attempts, nevertheless, such a transmutation\u2014and if one then speaks of a theology of primitive religions and of a theology of Buddhism\u2014one must be aware of the fact that the concept \u201ctheology,\u201d which is uncustomary and also inadequate in those spheres, is applicable only to a very limited extent and in a very modified form. This is because some Eastern religions have atheistic qualities and provide no access to the theos (\u201cgod\u201d) of theology. If one nonetheless speaks of theology in religions other than Christianity or Greek religion, one implies\u2014in formal analogy to what has been observed above\u2014the way in which representatives of other religions understand themselves."}, {"url": "https://www.ernestangley.org/read/article/the_divine_blood_of_jesus_controls", "page_content": "Have you received an outstanding miracle, healing or deliverance from God through this ministry? We would like to feature your testimony in an upcoming issue of The Power of the Holy Ghost magazine, as space permits.\n\nThe Divine Blood of Jesus Controls by Ernest Angley\n\nI love the study on divine blood that the Lord has given me; it works, it works. Without the divine blood, we have no control to stay out of sin or to keep from sinning, nor do we have control to yield to the divine will of God and to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. Divine blood control\u2014Jesus had it. Coming as very man as well as very God, He didn\u2019t use any of the powers of Heaven that we can\u2019t use. Jesus used divine blood control, proving that it worked.\n\nWithout sin, without guile, Jesus said to the Father: I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me (John 11:42). When you have divine blood control, the Lord always hears your prayers. You don\u2019t pray into empty air; you pray straight to the throne of God. With divine blood control, you can call Jesus any time and you can go before the throne of God to find grace in time of need. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nWith the control of divine blood in your life day and night, you\u2019re living in the Lord\u2019s presence. Jesus brought a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh (Hebrews 10:20). It was through divine blood that Jesus brought that new and living way.\n\nDivine Blood Was Lost through the Curse\n\nAlthough man and woman in Eden were created out of the dust of the earth, they were given divine blood. Never were they to have been sick, never were their bodies to have decayed, for never were they to have died. This meant they could not have had physical blood; only divine blood could have kept them alive throughout the ages. After the curse of sin entered, their destiny was different. Man and woman lost divine blood, and it was replaced with physical blood. With physical blood, sickness came, death. Now it would take the divine blood that only Jesus could bring to heal all manner of sicknesses and diseases.\n\nSin Can\u2019t Enter Heaven\n\nWhen you have Jesus blood control, you are led by the Spirit, not part-time but all the time. Walking in the Spirit, living in the Spirit with divine blood in control, you don\u2019t give over to the flesh or to any sin; you live free from sin all the time.\n\nSin can\u2019t enter Heaven. Only one speck of sin in Eden drove man and woman out. Adam and Eve lost everything because of one sin.\n\nThe devil is deceiving many people today, making them think they can sin a little and still be all right with God. Countless ministers preach that everyone sins a little\u2014everyone going to hell does. But everyone going to Heaven sins not at all; they\u2019re sinless Christians.\n\nBlood control tells us that if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (I John 1:9). We have to confess our sins and put ourselves under the control, the power, and the grace of the blood spilled on Calvary. That blood will work for you if you trust it. No matter what you have done wrong or how degraded your life has been, how steeped in sin: Freedom comes at the moment of salvation.\n\nMade in the Righteousness of God\n\nGod hath made him [Jesus] to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (II Corinthians 5:21). How exciting! Dwell on what it means to be the righteousness of God; get in His presence, linger there and let the Holy Spirit take over your mind in blood control.\n\nGod can take over my mind and use it as His very own. As I preach, the Lord will give me His very thoughts. In the healing lines, He will use my eyes and I see inside people; I see their diseases, their afflictions, their righteousness or unrighteousness. The Lord will let me look inside a soul to show me whether the person is saved or unsaved; there is no in-between. Only through the Cross are we redeemed. It took the shed blood of Calvary to make us the righteousness of God.\n\nPower to Resist the Devil\n\nJesus came, the second Adam, born of the Virgin Mary. Divine blood was in the veins of Christ; He never had human blood. As far as the flesh was concerned, He was human; but as for the blood, it was divine, not human. Blood comes from the father, and His Father was the Holy Ghost. With that divine blood, Jesus brought us blood control. He said, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19). That power comes through blood control. Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7). Blood control gives power to resist the devil and make him flee.\n\nWith blood control you have blood happiness, blood peace, blood joy, love, and faith. Everyone can have this blessed blood control, can be able to use the blood in his or her life. If you can\u2019t give over to the blood, then, of course, you don\u2019t have blood control. What you must do is to earnestly seek God and His Holy Spirit until you do have blood control, until you can put the devil underfoot in a split second, trample him down.\n\nOvercoming Blood\n\nThe saints of God overcame him [the devil] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11). By the blood and the Word of God, they overcame. The divine Word of God controls you if you have blood control. If not, the Word cannot control you. You give yourself completely to the Word of God when you receive that divine blood control. Not part of the time but all the time you yield yourself to Him. Follow hard after the Lord in His steps in this last and final hour.\n\nI rejoice over blood control; I delight in it. Blood control is one of the greatest privileges we have in life. With that blood control the devil cannot defeat us; there is no way. It matters not how many demons come against us at one time; we have blood control, our greatest weapon to use against the devil. The Lord has made it possible for you to control the blood, to use it just like Jesus used it.\n\nDrawn by the Spirit\n\nThe Holy Ghost used the divine blood to save your soul. Never would you have found salvation had the Holy Ghost not convicted you of your sins, not taken you by the hand and led you to Calvary. The Bible lets you know that you cannot be saved unless you are drawn to the Cross by the Spirit of God. Jesus said, No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him (John 6:44). This is the salvation that Jesus brought and taught. To obey the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, you must have blood control.\n\nPerfect in God\u2019s Love\n\nWith blood control you are made perfect in God\u2019s love. Jesus said, Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48). Perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love (I John 4:18). If you are carrying any fear, you either don\u2019t realize that you have blood control, or else you aren\u2019t using it the way you should. Give over to the Holy Spirit and let Him use the divine blood in your soul to flush out that fear as He sheds abroad blood love to deliver you.\n\nWhat great advantages you have! Why live below your privilege? Do you have that peace, that rest the Lord wants you to have? Where is the control of the blood? Is it hard for you to stay out of the world? If so, you don\u2019t have blood control. It has been offered to you; why not accept it? The Holy Spirit was sent to help us, but if we don\u2019t let Him guide and teach us, we won\u2019t have blood control.\n\nPeter Proved He Had the Blood\n\nThere was a time Peter walked afar off from Jesus; he even denied Him three times. How did he get back to the Lord? Through repentance and blood control. He had blood control when he met a man at the gate Beautiful who had never walked in more than forty years. To the man Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God (Acts 3:6-8). Peter proved he had the blood when he said, \u201cSuch as I have give I thee.\u201d He now had divine blood control just like the Master. The divine blood heals all afflictions and all diseases.\n\nPeter controlled the blood to the extent that people brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them (Acts 5:15). They were not healed by the shadow; a shadow can\u2019t heal; it simply is a point of contact. The people were healed by the blood anointing of God that touched those people, and what a mighty touch it was!\n\nThe Soul That Sinneth Shall Die\n\nUntil he lost sight of God and ate the fruit God had said not to eat, Adam had blood control. Adam, as head of the human race, had authority to sell us out and, unfortunately, he did. When he went to the tree of death, he died spiritually and later he died physically. Had he remained sinless in Eden, the world would be a different place today.\n\nJesus brought the new and living way. He said, The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (John 10:10). Since Eden, only a very few had abundant life. Then Jesus came with the divine blood that He had long before the first man walked the earth; He bought back everything that Adam had sold to the devil.\n\nMany today are deceived; while they\u2019re eating from the tree of death, the devil makes them think they will go to God\u2019s Heaven. About every funeral preached today claims the soul went to Heaven regardless of how sinfully that one had lived. While the services are being conducted, many of the dead are screaming in hell. The soul that sinneth, it shall die (Ezekiel 18:4).\n\nSalvation Makes the Blood Your Possession\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe you must live sin-free, you can\u2019t control the divine blood of Jesus; you have no say over that blood. In fact, you\u2019re not even carrying that blood. It\u2019s only through salvation that the blood becomes your possession. Divine blood in your soul is your eternal possession. How sad that such a few of God\u2019s people have understood the divine blood!\n\nMany think that joining a church, shaking the preacher\u2019s hand is salvation. It is not. Simply joining a church will not make you a new creature in Christ. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (II Corinthians 5:17). The born-new person is in Christ and has divine blood in the soul. That\u2019s the reason he or she becomes a member of the family of God, a son or a daughter.\n\nCome into the Paths of Righteousness\n\nJesus came to bring people into the family of God. But unless they accepted the divine blood in their souls to become sons or daughters of God, they were not related to Him; Jesus couldn\u2019t bring them in. Jesus told some people: Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it (John 8:44). There was no divine blood in the people Jesus was talking to; they wouldn\u2019t accept it.\n\nIf divine blood controls you, it will bring you into the paths of righteousness for His name\u2019s sake. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\u2019s sake (Psalm 23:3). You live holy not part-time but all the time, walking in the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nWhy are we emotional in serving the Lord, praising God victoriously? We come to a banquet of the Lord, a Holy Ghost divine blood banquet with the reality of signs, wonders, miracles, healings, salvation and deliverances of the Lord\u2014and it\u2019s glorious! We\u2019re fed through the Spirit and the power of God. How wonderful to be fed through the power of the Living Christ!\n\nWho Controls Your Spirit?\n\nBury the old man deep so he won\u2019t live anymore, won\u2019t be resurrected; get rid of him through the blood of Jesus. Let the blood take over the brand-new you with the characteristics of Jesus. Give control to the blood and have a mind to think the thoughts of Heaven, the thoughts of glory, a mind wonderful like the mind of Enoch. What was so special about Enoch? His mind blended with God\u2019s great mind to the extent that God took him to Heaven alive. One moment he was on Earth, the next in Heaven.\n\nElijah had control of the blood and people were healed, delivered, even raised from the dead. At the end of his life here on Earth, he was walking along talking to Elisha when suddenly he was caught up in a chariot of fire and taken to Heaven. Angels carried him to the throne of God alive. How wonderful that was!\n\nThose today who don\u2019t believe in the miracles of God do not have divine blood in their souls; they have no power over the blood to control the blood in any way. The enemy controls their spirit as they fight the power of God, the miracle ministry.\n\nUse the Blood\n\nUse the blood. Jesus taught His disciples to use the blood, His divine blood. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day (John 6:53,54). The blood is in you when you are born again; now use it, the Lord is saying.\n\nI speak through the blood and the blind receive sight, thedeaf, hearing, the crippled are delivered. People are healed of all manner of sicknesses and diseases. I use the blood. I fast through the blood; I believe through the blood; I love through the blood; I have compassion through the blood. I have been given control over the blood, control to use divine blood love, grace, peace, and control to serve it to others. I love the blood!\n\nWhen Jesus returned to the throne of God, He had conquered through blood control. As a human being He had control over divine blood, and He used it. He used it to destroy sin, to bring people into the Kingdom of God. He used it to wipe out the darkness of the souls of men and women, to turn their spiritual night into day. Jesus used the divine blood to bring people into the holiness of God. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14).\n\nAll Power Is in the Blood of the Lamb\n\nThat wonderful heavenly faith we can use brings about great miracles, great results; it comes through divine blood control. We\u2019re jubilant, knowing the blood will heal a person even before that healing takes place. Again and again I know people are going to be delivered before they actually are delivered\u2014all because of the blood control. The privilege has been given me to use that blood any time, and it\u2019s been given to you who are born again; it\u2019s in your soul.\n\nHow wonderful that we have divine blood in our souls, we who are saved, we who have been redeemed! Sin and divine blood will not mix, impossible; it can\u2019t be done and will never be done. If you have one speck of sin in your heart, willful sin, then you don\u2019t have the blood of Jesus in your soul. No need to try to fool yourself; it is not there.\n\nBut you can find the Lord. How? Through the blood. You can start living a different life through the control of the blood. All power you will find in the blood of the Lamb.\n\nPaul, once chief of sinners, thought he was doing God\u2019s will. But he didn\u2019t have that blood control. When the Lord knocked him down on the road to Damascus, he realized he didn\u2019t have it. I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks, Jesus said to him (Acts 9:5).\n\nPower in the Blood Is for the Obedient\n\nThe blood is your possession when you are born again, the divine blood. Stake your claim. As a new creature in Christ Jesus you have the blood as your very own. Use the blood. How wonderful to have control over the blood, to have power to use the blood love, the blood grace, power to deliver the devil possessed!\n\nThousands of people have come to me on drugs, alcohol and been set free of devil possession, instantly delivered by the power of God. Why? Because I use the blood. Every devil that is cast out is through the blood of Jesus. I control the blood; I use it against the enemy. I control the blood and I use it in my mind, in my voice, in my hands. I control the blood; it\u2019s mine to use, and it is yours, too. My salvation and your salvation is the same blood salvation.\n\nThe Holy Ghost baptism is power to use against the devil. God hates the devil. Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18). And that power He gives to His obedient ones to use.\n\nJesus Showed Us How to Use the Blood\n\nDo you control the blood of Jesus that\u2019s in your soul? Have you staked your claim? Do you use the blood against the devil? Do you use it to get the sick well? Do you use it to deliver the devil possessed? Do you use it to build the Kingdom of the Lord? If not, why? Jesus showed us how to use the blood.\n\nPaul used the blood wonderfully. You couldn\u2019t have a greater privilege than the control of divine blood, but you have to believe it. Sinner, you have to believe it. You can go to Calvary now; I\u2019ll lead you there through the blood control that\u2019s in my soul. I know the way to Calvary, and if you yield, the Holy Spirit will take you over and you will confess your sins through the blood. Then the Holy Spirit will use the blood to wash away those sins, take you by the hand and lead you into all grace, all goodness and mercy. He will lead you into the wonderful, sinless life that will never again commit another willful sin against your Creator.\n\nPrayer for Salvation and Healing\n\nPray this prayer with me, and give your heart to God: Oh, God, I am lost! I\u2019ve read the message about the divine blood of Jesus Christ; I know He died for me. He brought divine blood to destroy all my sins. Now I believe the blood of Jesus washes away all my sins! Come into my heart, Lord Jesus! Come on in!\n\nCan you now say, Hallelujah, Jesus is mine? When you say Jesus is yours, you\u2019re saying, Hallelujah, the blood is mine! I\u2019m going to walk the paths of Jesus. I\u2019m going to be like Jesus, to talk like Him, live like Him, pray like Him, and I\u2019m going to the Heaven He went to.\n\nJesus, in controlling the divine blood in His life, would ask people, Wilt thou be made whole (John 5:6)? And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole (Matthew 14:35,36). As many as accepted that divine blood were healed. It\u2019s just that simple.\n\nBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). By the blood stripes of Jesus we have physical healing. Through this divine blood you can be healed of HIV/AIDS, sugar diabetes, leprosy, blindness, deafness. You can be healed of any kind of heart or lung trouble, or delivered from paralysis. You can be made whole.\n\nYou who are sick and afflicted: I\u2019m going to use the blood for those death diseases in you; put them under the blood through faith. Keep them under the blood and you\u2019ll get well\u2014but you have to serve God.\n\nLord, I bring those with HIV/AIDS, I bring those suffering from all kinds of death diseases. Lord, it\u2019s time for them to be healed through the all-powerful blood of Jesus. Heal! in the blood name of Jesus! Heal! Heal! in the all-powerful blood name.\n\nBe thou made whole! Take a miracle from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. If you have divine blood in your soul, take control of that blood through the power of the Holy Ghost and use it for a miracle. Now, get well; watch your children get well. Write and tell me what happened to you today. God bless you is my prayer. Remember, the divine blood of Jesus brought for everyone the power of Heaven to use through divine faith and the love of Jesus."}, {"url": "http://www.pawcreek.org/born-again-ten-proofs-that-the-blood-of-christ-was-divine-blood/", "page_content": "\u201cBORN AGAIN\u201d: TEN PROOFS THAT THE BLOOD OF CHRIST WAS DIVINE BLOOD\n\n\u201d\n\nTHE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST IS DESPISED AND REJECTED IN OUR PRESENT WORLD BECAUSE IT IS DIVINE, PRECIOUS AND EVERLASTING.

This Blood does not cover over sin, it purifies and cleanses sin and wickedness from the repentant person.\n\n8. Every act of human rebellion has been atoned and can be cleansed when any sinner will repent.\n\n9. The Blood and Christ\u2019s death has borne the total impact of God\u2019s wrath because of sin.\n\n10. The entire defilement of this Universe was redeemed and purified (a future truth already paid for) by the supernatural death of the Lamb of God.\n\nIt is no wonder that the unredeemed world hates the name of Jesus Christ. Right here in America a school teacher can discuss the Muslim religion but she better not discuss Jesus Christ. No one is allowed to pray in most government buildings in the name of Jesus Christ. Demons and devils go berserk when someone that is really from God begins to proclaim the power of the Blood of Jesus Christ.\n\nI was asked to debate abortion in a big meeting being held in a Unitarian church here in Charlotte. As I spoke I told of Jesus Christ in Mary\u2019s womb and the effect of Elizabeth with John in her womb both being filled with the Holy Ghost. A demon possessed man began to scream right in front of the packed audience. That was a great testimony to the devil\u2019s hatred of Jesus Christ and His coming into our world to be a sin offering to God.\n\nThe New Birth is the greatest power in the Bible. There is no possibility of this life changing truth but the Divine Blood. Any minister that does not preach the Blood and not just Blood, but Divine Blood is helpless to save one soul. Every reader of this truth must decide where you will spend eternity and the decision must be decided by your faith in the Blood and your surrender to be \u201cBorn Again\u201d. We must learn to live our life under the claim of His Blood. When you pray it is by the Blood. When the devil attacks, claim the Blood against him.\n\nThe most powerful subject in Holy Scripture is, \u201cYE MUST BE BORN AGAIN\u201d. Yet it is so reduced in today\u2019s Church that the majority of Church members do not know the transformation that occurs. If a person is \u201cBORN AGAIN\u201d they are \u201cNew Creatures In Christ\u201d. Please take time to listen to the Sermons I am preaching on this subject. \u201cFor after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\u201d (I Corinthians 1:21) God\u2019s plan for saving souls is the preaching of the Gospel and there is no backup plan.

Klauser, 2:459).\n\nIn Mythology. In Norse myths, the skalds characterize blood as an intoxicant on the basis of the myth of Odin's drink of the poets (Edda, Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l 27). Blood itself is not personified, probably because, unlike water, it did not appear prominently as a great natural force or power. However, it was brought into numerous mythical relations with other things, and especially with the sun. In Egypt Ra (the Sun) was said to have originated from drops of blood. The association, blood and fire, is self-evident, but in Mexico it plays an especially significant role in Aztec religion. On the other hand, the blood of menstruation turned the imagination to the moon. The Bambuti, for example, call menstrual blood \"moon-blood\" [P. Schebesta, Die Bambuti. Pygm\u00e4en (4 v., Brussels, 1938\u201350) 3:190]. Practically the same idea is present in the Egyptian hieroglyph signifying the blood of Isis. Since this blood was shed to restore the dead Osiris to life, there is a clear association here of blood and life. The ideas of the connection between blood, fertility, and earth are firmly anchored in ancestor-worship. A Papuan group has a myth in which this combination is associated with that of blood and fire. Belief in the vampire is not found in this complex. It has perhaps a special origin, being found to some extent perhaps in animism. E. Rohde made animism the basis for his detailed exposition of the relations between blood and the soul in Greek religion (see E. Rohde, Psyche, English tr., H. B. Hillis, London 1925). In totemism, the blood of circumcision is regarded as a totem, at least in isolated instances [see Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie 76 (1951) 63].\n\nSociological, Cultic, and Magical Aspects. Incest is generally forbidden even in preethnic groups, the prohibition being based on a feeling of fear or dread. At the same time, in all such groups the duty of blood revenge is already in evidence. It originated out of the barbarous experiences of wanton bloodshed in the kinship group. An extension of the kinship group by the mingling of the blood of men of different family origins\u2014a procedure that may be described as a kind of primitive peace ritual (see K\u00f6nig, Rel Hdbch, \"Friedensritualien,\" 263)\u2014is realized through the blood brotherhood.\n\nThe blood dance of the Bushmen has less of the religious in itself than the practice of sprinkling themselves with their own blood found among the Pygmies and the Pomo, for this procedure approaches the central concept of sacrifice. But in such practices, even if animals are killed to secure blood, as among the Yukaghirs, there is not yet question of a cultic act. It is only when such killing is thought of as an essential part of worship that blood sacrifice, including human sacrifice, especially to the sun, enters upon its development. Blood magic likewise enters only at this stage. It serves especially to give greater strength or power to implements, vessels, actions, or persons, playing a special role in bier ordeals.\n\nIn the Bible. The Biblical significance of blood is summed up in Leviticus 17.11: \"The life of a living body is in its blood.\" This basic principle governs the Biblical theology of blood. Life belongs to God, and so blood belongs to Him. This explains both the moral and the cultic practices in which blood has a part. Some texts that refer to blood evoke also the idea of death. Hence, some scholars make blood the symbol of death. But blood is a sign of death only when it is poured out. This is precisely how blood came to stand for life. Once blood has gone out of a body, death follows. Because of this symbolism, the Biblical concept of blood affected the moral and cultic life of the Israelites.\n\nMoral Life. Men were forbidden to eat the blood of animals (Lv 3.17). Although the prohibition may have had its origin in hygienic considerations of the ancient world, the Mosaic Law assigned it a religious context. Because all life belonged to God, the blood of slain animals had to be poured on the altar, given to God (Lv 17.11). Those who lived too far from the sanctuary expressed their faith in God as the sole Lord of life by pouring the blood on the ground and covering it with earth (Dt 12.24; Lv 17.13).\n\nMen are forbidden to shed the blood of other men. Those \"who shed the blood of the innocent\" incur blood-guilt, a crime punishable by death (Nm 35.1634). A \"brother's blood\" shed unjustly cries to heaven for vengeance (Gn 4.8\u201316). \"Men of blood,\" i.e., men who unjustly shed blood, are wicked, and the anger of God falls on them. The punishment of the offender rests with the avenger of blood (Nm 35.19; see blood vengeance) and with the whole community (Dt 21.8\u20139). God demands the punishment of the murderer because no one but God has the claim on blood, the life of another.\n\nCultic Life. Blood held the central place in animal sacrifice. It signified the flow of life between God and man. Poured out on the altar (representative of God), it joined the offerer to God because he had placed his hand on the animal and had become one with it. The blood was not a substitute for that of the offerer but a ritual expression of the total surrender to God. God received the blood and returned it to the offerer in the form of divine life. Thus the desired effect of sacrifice, communion with God, was achieved.\n\nThe covenant sacrifice of Sinai was especially significant in underlining blood as the sign of a flow of life between God and man (see covenant [in the bible]). There God set up a special bond between Himself and His people. Moses took the blood of the sacrificial victims and sprinkled it partly on the altar and partly on the people, declaring, \"This is the blood of the covenant\" (Ex 24.8). The blood ratified the covenant and expressed externally what had happened. God and man had been joined together in an agreement of friendship, and the blood sprinkled on the altar and the people was a forceful expression of the union that had taken place.\n\nClosely associated with the covenant of Sinai was the slaying of the passover lamb and the sprinkling of the doorposts with its blood (Ex 12.1\u201313, 21\u201323). The blood of the lamb saved the Israelites from the death of their firstborn (Ex 12.26\u201330). The sacrifice of the lamb on the feast of the Passover became a ritual reminder that the people had been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Thus blood entered the theology of redemption. It became a symbol of liberation (from slavery) and of acquisition (by God). The blood of the paschal lamb was witness to the faith that God does enter into contact with man to bestow the divine favor that the blood ritual signified.\n\nAnother significant sacrifice was that of the Day of Atonement (Leviticus chapter 16). The blood rite was especially elaborate on this day. The high priest entered the Holy of Holies and sprinkled the propitiatory (the top of the ark) with blood. The altars of incense and of holocausts also were sprinkled. These rites underlined the special power of blood in expiating sin. In fact, its special value in expiatory sacrifices generally came to be highlighted: \"It is the blood, as the seat of life, that makes atonement\" (Lv 17.11). The blood of the victim should not be viewed as a punishment for sin. It forgave sins because it liberated life. The life poured out on the altar was received by God, who returned it to the repentant sinner in the form of divine life. This restored him to a state of friendship with God.\n\nThe blood rite illumines the vocabulary of expiation\u2014propitiation, atonement, justification. Blood is a propitiation for sin because it makes God propitious to the sinner. He looks favorably on him because the blood poured out symbolizes so well the broken heart of the sinner. Blood achieves the justification of the sinner because it makes him just or holy by bringing God's own life to him. Because it restores a relationship of friendship with God, it is blood of \"atonement\"; the sinner is set \"at one\" with God (see expiation [in the bible]).\n\nSacrificial blood played a large part also in the ordination to Old Testament priesthood. The blood was used to anoint the ear, hand, and foot of those ordained (Exodus 29.20). The anointing of these extremities of the body together proclaimed that the whole man was dedicated to God. Surely this is the meaning of the final anointing in which the blood mixed with oil was sprinkled on the priests and their vestments. This made them \"sacred\" (Ex 29.21). The blood was the bearer of God's life to the priests. Ordination made them holy because they were totally immersed in God's own life.\n\nOn the religious significance of blood in the New Testament, see precious blood.\n\nSee Also: sacrifice.\n\nBibliography: f. r\u00dcsche, Blut, Leben und Seele (Paderborn 1930). c. m. schr\u00d6der, Blutglaube in der Religionsgeschichte (Munich 1936). t. schifner, Blutzauber und Anderes (2d ed.

This is reflected not only in changes in this relationship over time but also in simultaneously expressed alternatives ranging from withdrawal from and rejection of the world to theocratic triumphalism. For example, early Christians so consistently rejected imperial deities that they were known as atheists, while later Christians so embraced European monarchies that they were known as reactionary theists. Franciscans, especially the Spiritual Franciscans, proclaimed that true Christians should divest themselves of money at the same time that the Catholic church erected magnificent churches and the clergy dressed in elaborate finery. Another classic example of this paradoxical relationship is provided by the monks, who withdrew from the world but also preserved and transmitted Classical culture and learning to medieval Europe. In the modern period some Christian communities regard secularization as a fall from true Christianity; others view it as a legitimate consequence of a desacralization of the world initiated by Christ.\n\nThe Christian community has always been part of the world in which it exists. It has served the typical religious function of legitimating social systems and values and of creating structures of meaning, plausibility, and compensation for society as it faces loss and death. The Christian community has sometimes exercised this religious function in collusion with tribalistic nationalisms (e.g., the \u201cGerman Christians\u201d and Nazism) by disregarding traditional church tenets. When the Christian community has held to its teachings, however, it has opposed such social systems and values. Given the inherent fragility of human culture and society, religion in general and the Christian community in particular frequently are conservative forces.\n\nHowever, the Christian community has not always been a conservative force. Twentieth-century Black theology and Latin American liberation theology shared the conviction that God takes the side of the oppressed against the world\u2019s injustices. From the perspective of theology or faith, the criticism of the world of which the Christian community itself is a part is the exercise of its commitment to Jesus Christ. For the Christian community, the death and Resurrection of Jesus call into question all structures, systems, and values of the world that claim ultimacy.\n\nThe relationship of the Christian community to the world may be seen differently depending upon one\u2019s historical, sociological, and theological perspectives because the Christian community is both a creation in the world and an influence upon it. This complexity led the American theologian H. Richard Niebuhr to comment in Christ and Culture (1956) that, \u201cthe many-sided debate about the relations of Christianity and civilization\u2026is as confused as it is many-sided.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.christianity.com/jesus/death-and-resurrection/the-crucifixion/what-is-the-power-in-the-blood-of-christ.html", "page_content": "Blood is throughout Scripture, but what does Christ's blood mean to us?\n\nBehold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by\u2026and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him. Joshua 2:18-19\n\nRahab, the woman spoken to in this passage, was a harlot in the city of Jericho. As the Israelites came to possess the land, her city was destined for destruction \u2014 and she along with it. But she was delivered, and her life transformed, simply by tying a scarlet cord in her window.\n\nThis cord represented the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it pointed toward the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. In fact, all of the Bible is about Jesus Christ and His blood redemption, and you will find this scarlet thread throughout the Word of God.\n\nThe Prophesy of the Blood of Jesus\n\nFrom the very beginning of human history, it is revealed. When Adam and Eve sinned, God shed innocent blood in order to make them clothes from animal skins (Genesis 3:21). This is a picture of the covering of righteousness that we receive when the Lord Jesus Christ died for us.\n\nIn Genesis four we read that Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel. They instinctively wanted to worship God. Cain sacrificed the fruit of the ground. Abel had already learned that God demanded blood, so he brought a lamb. God accepted the blood of Abel's lamb, but He did not accept Cain's offering. Why? Because \"without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin\" (Hebrews 9:22).\n\nAnd God told Abraham to sacrifice his long-awaited son Isaac (Genesis 22). Just before Abraham plunged the dagger into the quivering heart of his son, an angel stopped him. Abraham saw a ram caught in a thicket. Isaac was set free, but an innocent animal's blood was shed instead.\n\nThen, God wanted to deliver His people from bondage in the land of Egypt. On the night of the Passover, God instructed each house to slay a lamb and put the blood on their door. God said in Exodus 12:13, \"When I see the blood, I will pass over you.\"\n\nAnd in the tabernacle and later in the temple, thousands upon thousands of sheep, oxen, and turtle doves were killed and their blood spilt as sacrifices for sin.\n\nAnd finally, the Lord Jesus Christ died upon the cross. His death was the fulfillment of all the prophecy and promises. Revelation 13:8 proclaims that He was slain before the foundation of the world. He came to die; He planned to die; He lived to die; and He was born to die.\n\nAs we've seen - the blood of Jesus is throughout Scripture. What does the Blood of Jesus mean for us today?\n\nThe Power of the Blood of Jesus\n\nHis blood redeems us. There was a price against us that we could not pay, but the blood of Jesus redeemed us. 1 Peter 1:18-19 says, \"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things.... But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\"\n\nHis blood brings us into fellowship with God. According to Ephesians 2:13, \"But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.\" Without the blood of Christ, man is a long way from God.\n\nHis blood makes peace with God. Man, by nature, is at war with God; and we can only come to God on His peace terms \u2014 the blood atonement. The Bible says in Colossians 1:20, \"And, having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself....\"\n\nHis blood cleanses. Not only does it remove the punishment of sin, it removes the pollution. I don't care what sin you've committed; \"the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin (1 John 1:7).\n\nHis blood gives power over the devil. It's the blood that Satan fears. Revelation 12:11 says, \"And they overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb....\" The devil doesn't want you to learn about the blood. He hates it!\n\nBefore this planet was ever swung into space, God had determined in His heart that He would send His Son to die upon the cross. How wonderful it is to trace the scarlet thread of the blood of Christ woven throughout the Bible! How much more wonderful to experience its redemption personally. Praise God for the blood of His Lamb!\n\nTaken from \"The Scarlet Thread through the Bible\" by Love Worth Finding Ministries (used by permission)."}]}
