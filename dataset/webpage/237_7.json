{"Edward Synge was a strong supporter of the Church of Ireland.": [{"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-a8426", "page_content": "Synge, Edward (c.1614\u20131678), clergyman, was baptised 14 August 1614 in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England, second son of Richard Synge, tanner, and bailiff of Bridgnorth, and his wife Alice Rowley of Rowley, Shropshire. The original family name was Millington; it was apparently changed due to the singing abilities of the family. Synge came to Ireland at the suggestion of his elder brother George, Church of Ireland dean of Dromore and later bishop of Cloyne (1638\u201341), and was educated in Drogheda and at TCD , where he graduated MA .\n\nOrdained into the Church of Ireland, he was appointed rector of Killary in Meath (1638\u201360) and Drumully in Clogher (1640\u201360), and prebendary of Aghadowny, Co. Londonderry (1640\u201361). At some point he married Barbara Latham (d. 22 December 1677) of New Place, Co. Londonderry; they had at least three sons and five daughters. Noted as a preacher, Synge was chaplain general to the royalist forces in Leinster during the 1640s, and in July 1647 was one of a number of Dublin clergymen to sign a declaration stating their adherence to the Book of Common Prayer. Synge was appointed as a minor canon of St Patrick's cathedral (1647\u201360), and as vicar of Lusk, Co. Dublin (1648\u201361), and Inishannon, Co. Cork (1648\u201361), dean of Elphin (1648\u201360), and archdeacon of Cloyne (1648\u201361). Soon after, he may have been appointed chancellor of Christ Church cathedral by James Butler (qv), marquess of Ormond, but this remains uncertain. However, the potential privileges of these positions were offset by the parlous condition of the Church of Ireland at this time. After 1647 Synge had removed himself to his benefice in Donegal and spent most of the 1650s there. However, he occasionally ministered to Richard Boyle (qv), 2nd earl of Cork. He remained an episcopalian, continuing to use the Book of Common Prayer in the north-west throughout the 1650s. This prompted numerous complaints, but an association with Robert Gorges (qv), clerk of the Irish council, ensured that these were disregarded.\n\nSynge enjoyed good relations with many figures in the ruling elites of Ireland during the interregnum and after the restoration, a fact testified to by his plethora of appointments. His eldest son, Samuel, married a daughter of Archbishop Michael Boyle (qv). In 1660 Edward Synge was nominated to serve on the presidency council of Munster, and on 6 August 1660 was nominated as bishop of Limerick, being consecrated on 27 January 1661; he held the see in tandem with that of Ardfert and Aghadoe. In 1661 he also graduated DD from TCD. Of the ten bishops and two archbishops appointed in 1660, Synge was one of only three who had served in Ireland during the 1650s. In his new position, he was involved in a dispute with Ormond over the ownership of church lands in Limerick. On 21 December 1663 Synge was made bishop of Cork. As with his previous post, he held the sees in tandem. Synge's elder brother, George, who held Cloyne prior to 1641, had been ordered by the then viceroy, Thomas Wentworth (qv), earl of Strafford, to regain diocesan lands lost to figures such as Richard Boyle (qv), 1st earl of Cork, since the sixteenth century. The see was divided in two to facilitate this, but little progress was made prior to 1641; consequently more lands were lost during the interregnum, and the sees were reunited after the restoration. Throughout the 1660s Synge embarked on what became an acrimonious campaign via the acts of settlement and explanation, and the exchequer court, to regain these lands. A good relationship with the Boyle interest ensured that Roger Boyle (qv), earl of Orrery, acted as arbitrator in a number of the ensuing disputes. Synge's exertions were strongly opposed by Murrough O'Brien (qv), earl of Inchiquin, who now occupied some of the holdings; indeed, at one point Inchiquin's men assaulted Synge's son George. However, he succeeded in obtaining much of the outstanding diocesan land; by 1668 his income was calculated at \u00a31,400, and in 1677 he was still receiving leases under the terms of the act of explanation.\n\nIn October 1675 Synge was appointed to a commission dealing with the outstanding arrears of the \u201949 officers. He died 22 December 1678, and after his death the sees were divided. In 1679 Synge's eldest son Samuel attempted to transfer diocesan lands into the possession of the family, but in 1697 this was contested and reversed by the then bishop of Cloyne, Edward Jones. Two of Synge's sons entered the Church of Ireland: Samuel became dean of Kildare, and Edward (qv) enjoyed a distinguished career as archbishop of Tuam."}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-a8427", "page_content": "Synge, Edward (1659\u20131741), clergyman, was born 5 April 1659 at Inishannon, Co. Cork, second son of Edward Synge (qv), later bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and his wife Barbara Latham. Edward's elder brother was Samuel Synge (d. 1708), who became dean of Kildare. Synge was educated at the diocesan school, Cork, and in 1674 he went to Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he met William Wake, later archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout his life. He graduated BA in 1677.\n\nSynge's first incumbency was as rector of Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136). In 1686 he became vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork, which he held until 1706. He was also (1691\u20131714) rector of Rathclarin, Co. Cork, and held other parishes in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1695 William King (qv), then bishop of Dublin, put Synge's name forward for the diocese of Limerick. Synge expressed surprise that he had been considered, but he did not get Limerick, and when he was offered the deanery of Derry in 1699 he refused it on the grounds that his elderly mother could not accompany him. About four years later, the lord lieutenant, the 2nd duke of Ormond (qv) offered him the deanery of St Patrick's on behalf of the crown. However, a dispute between the crown and the chapter as to the right of presentation was only resolved when John Stearne (qv) was appointed dean and Edward Synge became chancellor of St Patrick's and vicar of St Werburgh's, where he was installed in April 1705. In 1714 King recommended Synge for the diocese of Raphoe, and he was consecrated in November that year. He remained at Raphoe for only eighteen months, and in June 1716 he was appointed archbishop of Tuam.\n\nInitially, Synge had resisted his removal from Raphoe, where he was engaged in disputes about presbyterian marriages and a campaign of conversion through education. He saw that there was a great deal of work and expense in Tuam, and there was nowhere to live, as the archbishop's palace had been burnt during the civil war. Tuam had other drawbacks: there were few resident clergy and many parishes were impropriate. Further, there was a long-running problem about the quarta pars episcopalis, that part of the tithes that had augmented the income of the archbishop, and not the parish clergy. It had been proposed to abolish this custom in Tuam, but before the necessary legislation was enacted the documents were lost in the 1641 rebellion. Synge was advised to encourage the Tuam clergy to petition for the abolition of the quarta pars, to supplement the incomes of clergy who were prepared to resign from pluralities, and to provide for parishes that had not been served since the reformation.\n\nOn the growing constitutional crisis arising from the Annesley v. Sherlock case (over the appellate jurisdictions of the Irish house of lords and its British counterpart) Synge told Wake that Ireland was \u2018a kingdom (not a county Palatine) exactly formd [sic] according to the model of England . . . \u2019 (Synge to Wake, 1 Nov. 1717 (Dublin City Library, Gilbert MS 28, f. 100)). With Archbishop King, he opposed actively but unsuccessfully the enactment by the Irish parliament of a toleration act for protestant dissenters. Here again Synge was said to have conducted himself \u2018with the greatest warmth and zeal for the nation's honour\u2019 (William Nicholson to Wake, 11 July 1719 (ibid., f. 236). In his speech on the bill, Synge observed that although he had always believed in limited toleration for dissenters, he saw that religion was a continuing cause of strife, wars, and rebellions. Citing the existence of 180 sects in England which had flourished during the civil war, he warned that it should be not thought that these \u2018wild sects and parties\u2019 had gone. If the bill were passed, he said, not only the Church of Ireland, but the civil state and even Christianity itself would be put at risk (Edward Synge speech on toleration, MS in private possession). Both Synge and King were out of favour as a result of their opposition to the bill.\n\nSynge acknowledged the difficulty that catholics had in taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, excluding them from full rights in a civil society. He believed that catholics and dissenters should be prosecuted only if they posed a real danger to the state, and proposed an oath of allegiance to meet the objections of both Roman Catholics and quakers. During his life, Synge published nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts, and he is now seen as one of the most influential religious commentators of his time. The Appendix to his Gentleman's religion (1698) is thought by Berman to have been written in answer to John Toland's (qv) Christianity not mysterious (1696). To some extent Synge shared Toland's rationalism and deism, but he rebutted Toland's case that religion possessed no mysteries. With William King, George Berkeley (qv), and Francis Hutcheson (qv), Synge discussed the problem of innate perception, using the analogy of a blind man's understanding of shape and form. In October 1714 he preached a sermon at St Werburgh's which was attacked for advocating deism and which resulted in a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Synge died in Tuam on 24 July 1741, where he was buried.\n\nHe married (1690) Anne, daughter of Nicholas Proude, dean of Clonfert. They had five children, two of whom became bishops. The eldest, Edward Synge (d. 1762), was given (1719) the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's cathedral. Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticised on the grounds that they encouraged a \u2018furious and blind zeal for religion\u2019 which could disturb the civil state, and in 1725 he preached on religious toleration to members of both houses of parliament. Made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was translated to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin, where he remained until his death. He was a close friend of Francis Hutcheson the philosopher, who acknowledged his debt to Synge's critique of the text of his An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue (1726). In 1749 Synge organised a census of the diocese of Elphin, which covers most of Co. Roscommon, and parts of south-east Co. Sligo and north-east Co. Galway. It was a remarkable undertaking: forms were specially designed and printed and clergy and churchwardens were persuaded to act as enumerators. The census is housed in the NAI (NAI, MS 2466). Synge married (1725) Jane Curtis and it is through his letters to their daughter Alicia that he is best known."}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-hutchinson-a9583", "page_content": "Synge, Edward Hutchinson (1890\u20131957), physicist, was born on 1 June 1890 in south Dublin, eldest child of Edward Synge and his wife Ellen (n\u00e9e Price). He had two brothers, Victor Millington Synge (qv) and John Lighton Synge (qv), and a sister. The Synge family was connected to notable personalities in Irish ecclesiastical and military life; John Millington Synge (qv) was a brother of Edward Synge senior. James Price (qv), father of Ellen Synge, was a distinguished engineer. John Lighton Synge, Edward's younger brother, made important contributions to relativity and mechanics. Edward Synge senior was a land agent for the Gormanston estates in Meath and elsewhere, and for a number of years the family lived at Rathe House, near Nobber, Co. Meath.\n\nThe family moved to Bray, Co. Wicklow, in 1903, and later lived in Sandycove and Dundrum, Co. Dublin. Edward Hutchinson Synge, known in the family as 'Hutchie', was educated by governesses, a tutor, and briefly at Corrig School, D\u00fan Laoghaire (Kingstown). He never studied physics in a university setting. He cut short a brilliant undergraduate career at TCD, in which he specialised in mathematics and Old Irish, when his uncle J. M. Synge died in 1909, leaving him a substantial legacy. Edward had won the Townsend prize in mathematics at the end of his first year, and won a foundation scholarship the next year. When he received his inheritance, he chose to retire from the world at large (apart from some travels to the Aran islands and the Continent), devoting himself to private scholarship in the family home, where he also built up a collection of books.\n\nUp to 1930 he engaged in some significant interactions with society at large. He was instrumental in having his uncle's Playboy of the western world republished in a special edition, with illustrations by Se\u00e1n Keating (qv). It was thanks to Edward H. Synge's forceful advocacy that the publication of the collected works of William Rowan Hamilton (qv) began; the first volume was edited by John Lighton Synge. Edward castigated his Dublin contemporaries for failing to support the publication, and corresponded with Albert Einstein, who concurred with his view.\n\nEdward lived almost as a recluse in the family home until 1936, at which time he was confined to a mental hospital, at first as a voluntary patient, but a year later he was made a ward of court and involuntarily confined. He remained in Bloomfield Hospital (despite appeals for release) until his death in 1957. His notebooks from the last period of his life and work have unfortunately been lost.\n\nA remarkable series of nine papers in the Philosophical Magazine, published between 1922 and 1932, forms the main record of his achievements. He was a visionary physicist who conducted his remarkable researches in self-imposed isolation. Among other things, he conceived the detailed design of the scanning near-field optical microscope, or SNOM. His ideas and a description of near-field microscopy predated, by almost fifty years, work carried out independently and patented by IBM and others, which led to the important instrumentation now widely used in nanotechnology. Before these developments, microscopy in the early twentieth century had reached a state which was regarded then as the most accurate possible; the scale at which microscopes could work was held to be limited by the width of the wavelength of light.\n\nIn Synge's paper, a revolutionary technique was envisaged in full practical detail. He proposed to call it 'hyper-microscopy' but this term was not taken up. The proposed ultra-microscope technique hyper-microscope was to use a light source of dimensions less than the wavelength of light. This light source, perhaps a tiny hole letting light through, was to be held extremely close to a sample. (Synge seems to have considered that the sample would routinely be a biological slide preparation.) The light transmitted through the hole was to be measured by a photoelectric detector, even at that date well-established technology, used for example by G. F. Fitzgerald (qv) to detect starlight (in 1892). Scanning or 'rastering' of the relative position of the source and/or sample would build up the image of the specimen. Synge proposed that the piezoelectric effect be used to facilitate the rapid scanning necessary to build the image. This was, like the theory on which the technique was based, a highly original suggestion. Only Einstein, with whom Synge again corresponded, seems to have understood what the Irishman was suggesting, and his response was encouraging, while recognising that the invention was much before its time.\n\nSynge was acutely aware of the great technical difficulties that would have to be faced in making the instrument. He discussed the major problems that he foresaw and proposed possible solutions. In this he showed an awareness of both available expertise and its limitations \u2013 precisely the same issues faced by the experimentalists who would eventually exploit the instrument in our own time. All this was done without any practical laboratory experience whatsoever, so far as we know.\n\nSynge also produced papers on stellar parallax, on the twinkling of stars, and on piezoelectricity. On account of his third paper in the Philosophical Magazine he is given full priority in the invention of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), another key modern technology now used to probe the Earth's atmosphere. He thought that light scattered from searchlight beams could be detected and used to characterise the gases composing the upper atmosphere; his idea had to wait until the invention of the laser before it became practicable.\n\nSynge's fifth paper suggests a solution to another problem of the time; as their size increased, astronomical telescopes were increasingly difficult to construct, because of physical difficulties with polishing and weight. Synge suggested using an array of smaller mirrors, and presented calculations to explain and justify his ideas. Multiple mirror telescopes on this principle were not constructed until the mid-twentieth century, when Synge's proposal had long been forgotten.\n\nSynge's troubled life ended years before he was given any credit for the scientific developments which his work presaged. Today we can guess that Synge suffered from a condition like Asperger's syndrome, in which social behaviour is highly inhibited, sometimes in favour of concentrated and productive study. It is increasingly recognised that such individuals have a unique contribution to make to our society. His was an extreme case; however, awareness of his condition may shed light on the personality of his uncle, who showed similar if milder tendencies, well documented by literary historians. Edward's early aspiration was to follow in his benefactor uncle's footsteps. What eventually caused him to switch the focus of his extraordinary genius to the technology of physical science we may never know. Much remains incomplete in our knowledge of his life.\n\nHe died 26 May 1957 in Bloomfield Hospital, Donnybrook, Dublin, of cerebral thrombosis, and was buried with his parents in Dublin's Mount Jerome cemetery, with only a few relatives attending. It was much later that his niece Cathleen Synge Morawetz (herself a distinguished mathematician) arranged to have 'Scientist and Inventor' inscribed on the gravestone. A symposium in TCD in 2012 revived the memory of Synge in the college that he had abandoned without graduating, and was accompanied by a biographical publication that includes Synge's main publications."}, {"url": "https://www.libraryireland.com/biography/ArchbishopEdwardSynge.php", "page_content": "An American widow\u2019s account of her travels in Ireland in 1844\u201345 on the eve of the Great Famine:\n\nIreland\u2019s Welcome to the Stranger\n\nSailing from New York, she set out to determine the condition of the Irish poor and discover why so many were emigrating to her home country.\n\nMrs Nicholson\u2019s recollections of her tour among the peasantry are still revealing and gripping today.\n\nThe author returned to Ireland in 1847\u201349 to help with famine relief and recorded those experiences in the rather harrowing:Annals of the Famine in Ireland.\n\nSee more of our books \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-peep-at-the-bishop-s-preoccupations-1.28226", "page_content": "EDWARD SYNGE, Bishop of Elphin (1740-62), was a member of perhaps the most famous ecclesiastical dynasty that the Church of Ireland produced in the 17th and 18th centuries. Based on this fascinating collection of his letters to his daughter, his reputation is destined long to survive as this work assumes its rightful place .alongside Delany's letters, Willes's description and Young's tour as one of the major avenues into 18th-century Irish Protestant society.\n\nElphin was not high in the ecclesiastical pecking order in the 18th century. Like many of his colleagues, Edward Synge had no intention of residing permanently in his diocese, and he was sufficiently wealthy to be able to divide his time between Dublin, where he kept a house and gardens, and Elphin, where he built an episcopal palace. It was an arrangement he enjoyed, though it obliged him (a widower) to leave his sole surviving child, Alicia, who was prone to ill-health, each summer and autumn, while he attended to diocesan and personal affairs in Co Roscommon.\n\nBoth father and daughter were devoted to each other and they corresponded closely when they were apart. Alicia was only 13 when their correspondence began, but with the exception of spelling and punctuation (on which he upbraided her obsessively because of his conviction that to write well was \"a great accomplishment, in a female particularly\") and a number of other matters, Bishop Synge did not conduct himself as if he was dealing with a minor. He compared their relationship when Alicia was 18 to that of a husband and wife, and it is a useful measure of the trust, confidence and openness that characterised their correspondence. It would be premature, however, to draw general conclusions about parent-child relations among the Anglo-Irish elite based on their marvellously empathetic and loving connection - though his advice to her on a myriad of household and personal subjects (friendship, marriage, diet and menstruation, for example) was balanced and appropriate - because it was probably untypical.\n\nWhat was not untypical were Edward's experiences in building and running houses. The complexities of building in the country are highlighted in fascinating detail by his continuous stream of instructions to Alicia for various retainers to ferry materials. (everything from wainscoting to chamber pots) from Dublin to Elphin.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nOne of the most compelling problems all members of the Anglo-Irish elite experienced was securing reliable servants. In Tom, his short-sighted manservant who was unable to shave him evenly, and Mrs Heap, his lazy cook, we have two memorable characters of those wham Synge describes, significantly, as his \"family\". There is a wealth of information on their acquisition and deployment, as there is on gardening, farming and dining, and a host of incidentals on household and personal management such as catching mice, making bread, and dental hygiene.\n\nThis is why this book is so compelling and so valuable: its focus is the Synge household in the 1740s and early 1750s. It seldom diverts into political or social issues, which dominate most narratives from this fern. Instead, we are offered an exceptional insight into the quotidian a fascinating perspective on the Anglo-Irish elite at its zenith; and a wonderful opportunity to explore an evolving human relationship in a superbly presented and lovingly edited testament of the pleasure of history."}, {"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/jm-synge-s-powerful-vision-of-ireland-still-provokes-and-inspires-1.4477203", "page_content": "The artist Jack B Yeats, a close friend and collaborator of JM Synge\u2019s, wrote a letter to the dramatist in the wake of the riots that greeted the Abbey Theatre\u2019s premiere of The Playboy of the Western World in late January 1907. He also drew a small cartoon.\n\nIn the first scene, a man, holding his hat behind him, his knees touched together in a posture of nervous modesty, leans against a window to talk with a young woman, a small bird perched on his arm. \u201cWill it be mild as milk?\u201d Yeats writes, \u201cor will it be\u2026\u201d\n\nIn the second scene, a jeering audience with raised fists watch the man being tossed off a high cliff into the sea. The man is upside-down, mid-air, his hat flying off into a tall wave.\n\nAs his career had progressed among the fraught cultural conditions of the Irish Revival, Synge increasingly gravitated towards the second option. His literary output began with a bucolic Romanticism, taking a turn of experiments through Decadence and symbolism. But it was the pressures of a modernising Ireland that urged him into what the scholar Mary Burke has recently called a form of \u201cmodernist provocation\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSynge moved to Germany as a young man, and then to Paris. The riots over the first performance of Alfred Jarry\u2019s Ubu Roi (1896), an avant-garde play considered to be an assault on the audience, would certainly have come to Synge\u2019s attention. In fact, Jarry\u2019s collapsing of the distinction between noble and ignoble, between \u201cprimitive\u201d and civilised, finds a striking afterlife in Synge\u2019s own riot-inducing masterpiece just over a decade later.\n\nFrom a letter to JM Synge from Jack B Yeats, February 19th, 1907. Photograph: The Board of Trinity College Dublin\n\nSynge\u2019s fantasy, imagination and lyric flights of poetry were the tender side of his vision; but for every sweet word there was a sharp, brutal undercurrent, a violence and earthiness that all poetry, and all life, should be rooted in. This was at the heart of his work.\n\nWhereas some writers and audiences wanted a \u201cpurely fantastic, unmodern, ideal, spring-dayish, Cuchulanoid National Theatre\u201d, what Synge valued most in the life of the peasantry was what he saw as their savage, ironic humour, their imaginative freedom, and their brutality. This, he saw, was their chief challenge to the homogenising tendencies of modernisation; their alterity was in their opposition to the values of the imperial project and also to the values of the middle classes, who were \u201can ungodly ruck of fat-faced, sweaty headed swine\u201d. If he was to hold a mirror up to the nation, it would not be while the people were \u201cgoing to Mass on a fine\u2026 Sunday morning\u201d.\n\nThis year marks 150 years since Synge was born in Rathfarnham, Co Dublin, into a wealthy Protestant family with long-held connections to the gentry and to the Church of Ireland. Members of the Plymouth Brethren, the Synge family were led by their mother, Kathleen.\n\nEarly on, Johnny (as he was known to his relatives) was uncomfortable with the practices of his Anglo-Irish family. In 1885 his brother Edward began evicting tenants in Cavan. Johnny, at the age of just 14, argued strongly with his mother about the rights of the tenants, until she asked him: \u201cWhat would become of us if our tenants\u2026 stopped paying their rents?\u201d\n\nHe did manage some small victories, among them was convincing his mother to change the family subscription from the Daily Express to the more liberal Irish Times, which she nevertheless considered \u201ca rebel paper\u201d.\n\nShock and outrage\n\nWhen Synge undertook the first in a series of trips to the Aran Islands, he went with the socialist ideas of William Morris and the philosophy of Spinoza in mind, and also with his reading in comparative folklore, anthropology and (perhaps surprisingly) occultism.\n\nThe Synge Papers, held in the archives of Trinity College Dublin, provide a rich insight into the influences of a writer who, despite the many books written about his work, has yet more to reveal. Indeed, these archives change the ways we read his published and performed works; in The Aran Islands alone, there are scenes and sentences that bear the influence of the French Symbolist writers, the major works of socialist thinkers, theories of occult initiation and telepathy, and the mystical practices of Sufism and theosophy.\n\nPhotograph of an Inis O\u00edrr family walking on the shore, taken by JM Synge. Photograph: The Board of Trinity College Dublin\n\nIn one memorable sequence, Synge seems to be possessed by the lure of the island itself. He writes about the \u201cpsychic memory\u201d of buildings, and dreams of being whirled into an uncontrollable dance, as though the island is puppeting him: \u201cI struggled to free myself, but seemed only to increase the passion of the steps I moved to. When I shrieked I could only echo the notes of the rhythm.\u201d\n\nSynge\u2019s idealisation of the peasantry came with a difficulty. His socialism kept the lived conditions of the people close in his mind. When he travelled with Jack Yeats in \u201cthe Congested Districts\u201d of Ireland on a commission from the Manchester Guardian, he lamented that the Irish peasant culture he loved was \u201cbound up with a social condition that is near to penury\u201d. In a notebook for his prose narrative The Aran Islands, he drafted an ironic dedication: \u201cTo the little Irish pigs that have eaten filth all their lives to enable me to wander in Paris these leaves are dedicated with respect and sympathy.\u201d\n\nWhen he came to write plays, Synge\u2019s depictions of the peasantry were often met with shock and outrage. Though his one-act tragedy Riders to the Sea went down well, his comedies were provocative and scandalous. Women walked out and left their husbands, priests were put into sacks and beaten, pious saints were mocked, murderers were exalted as heroes.\n\nOne of Synge\u2019s early critics, the American scholar Stuart Sherman, noted that the audience of Synge\u2019s plays is left in \u201cironical bewilderment\u201d. Whereas in classical comedy laughter might be a corrective, aimed at punishing the vices or mocking the affectations of various characters, Synge\u2019s was an \u201coutlaw comedy\u201d, with \u201cgypsy laughter coming from somewhere in the shrubbery by the roadside, pealing out against church and state, and man and wife, and all the ordinances of civil life\u201d.\n\nThat irony, his brand of harsh, irreverent satire, was born out of what he most valued in the peasant culture of Ireland. Subjected to what he saw as \u201cdemoralising\u201d relief works and schemes of modernisation that risked homogenising local cultures, Synge took heart in the laughter of the families he visited and the scenes he witnessed whilst reporting from the \u201cCongested Districts\u201d of the western seaboard: \u201cIt shows that, in spite of relief-works, commissions, and patronizing philanthropy \u2013 that sickly thing \u2013 the Irish peasant, in his own mind, is neither abject nor servile.\u201d\n\nPolitical radicalism\n\nOver the course of the last century, however, Synge\u2019s political radicalism was largely overlooked. His close friend WB Yeats described him as a man \u201cby nature unfitted to think a political thought\u201d, and that image took hold. Far from being merely an Anglo-Irish aesthete, or what Christy Mahon in a draft of Playboy calls a \u201ctweedy suited poet\u201d, Synge was a fierce writer. He sits within our prevailing image of the Irish Revival as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\nStill, many writers recognised his subversiveness, and many scholars have continued the project of his reassessment. Teresa Deevy carried his radicalism forward in The King of Spain\u2019s Daughter. Ezra Pound praised him; and Beckett thought him the finest Irish dramatist. As the scholar Susan Cannon Harris has shown, Synge\u2019s drama influenced leftist theatre groups across Europe and was adapted by Bertolt Brecht into a revolutionary narrative in his play Se\u00f1ora Carrar\u2019s Rifles (1937).\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams set Riders to the Sea to music, resulting in an opera with symphonic qualities that drew on the musicality of Synge\u2019s structuring and language. Synge had studied music and counterpoint, and was an excellent violinist. Djuna Barnes, author of Nightwood (1936), drew Synge\u2019s characters in a style more closely related to fin de si\u00e8cle decadence than peasant costume, and Synge\u2019s poems inspired some of Harry Clarke\u2019s most exquisite stained-glass windows.\n\nThough it was hardly meant as a compliment, Flann O\u2019Brien signalled Synge\u2019s influence when he noted that Synge\u2019s \u201cfakery\u201d wasn\u2019t long confined to the stage: \u201cthe curse has come upon us, because I have personally met in the streets of Ireland persons who are clearly out of Synge\u2019s plays\u201d.\n\nFor many years, Synge\u2019s drama was too close to home. Later, he was mistakenly aligned with an image of Romantic Ireland that a rapidly modernising nation found unpalatable. The power of his vision, and the image of the country he portrayed, was often too hot to handle, and so it was by turns rioted against, or neutralised.\n\nIn the year of his 150th anniversary, his shattering romances and his desolate, beautiful language have the power to provoke, to show us the sorrow of disillusionment and the importance of wildness, resistance and imagination. As WB Yeats wrote, Synge\u2019s writing was the \u201crushing up of the buried fire, an explosion of all that had been denied and refused, a furious impartiality, an indifferent turbulent sorrow\u201d.\n\nJM Synge: Nature, Politics, Modernism, by Se\u00e1n Hewitt, is published by OUP Oxford"}, {"url": "http://libraryireland.com/biography/ArchbishopEdwardSynge.php", "page_content": "An American widow\u2019s account of her travels in Ireland in 1844\u201345 on the eve of the Great Famine:\n\nIreland\u2019s Welcome to the Stranger\n\nSailing from New York, she set out to determine the condition of the Irish poor and discover why so many were emigrating to her home country.\n\nMrs Nicholson\u2019s recollections of her tour among the peasantry are still revealing and gripping today.\n\nThe author returned to Ireland in 1847\u201349 to help with famine relief and recorded those experiences in the rather harrowing:Annals of the Famine in Ireland.\n\nSee more of our books \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://triskelartscentre.ie/christchurch/famous-characters/edward-synge/", "page_content": "Edward Synge, a famous clergyman and preacher, was vicar of Christchurch in the late 17th and early 18th century. He was born in 1659 in Innishannon, Co. Cork, the parish where his father was at the time vicar. The family originated in Bridgnorth in Shropshire, where the name appears originally to have beenMillington. According to tradition, they acquired the name of Sing or Synge from the sweetness of voice of one of the family.\n\nSynge was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin. After a number of years in charge of the two small parishes of Laracor and Augher in the diocese of Meath, Synge was appointed to the vicarage of Christchurch. He remained there for more than twenty years. In 1705 he was appointed chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Dublin and during the next eight years he established a reputation for himself as one of the most industrious clergymen and popular preachers in the city.\n\nIn 1714 he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe in the church of Dunboyne, Co. Meath, by the archbishop of Cashel, and in 1716 was translated to the archbishopric of Tuam, Co.Galway. He died at Tuam in 1741, and was buried in the churchyard of the cathedral.\n\nAmongst other achievements Edward Synge established a dynasty of prominent ecclesiastics and literary figures closely integrated into the Protestant squirearchy in the west of Ireland. Interestingly, Synge is a distant relative of the famous Irish playwright John Millington Synge, author of The Playboy of the Western World."}, {"url": "https://www.irishphilosophy.com/2014/01/27/synge-friend-and-father/", "page_content": "Edward Synge was born around 1690 and died in Dublin on the 27th January, 1762. He was the son of the elder Edward Synge, who was himself involved in the philosophical debates of the time.\n\nHe was educated in Trinity College Dublin (M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728) and after being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s (1726), was successively bishop of Clonfert (1730), Cloyne (1731), Ferns (1733), and finally Elphin (1740 until his death).\n\nSynge was close to Francis Hutcheson and appears to have been a member of the Molesworth Circle. He assisted Hutcheson in developing revising his work and Hutcheson himself acknowledged that Synge had devised the general scheme of \u201cInquiry into Beauty and Virtue\u201d before Hutcheson. The connection seems to have continued after Hutcheson\u2019s departure for Glasgow and until his death, since his son dedicated the posthumous collection of his father\u2019s works to Synge . Letters from the 1760s from Edward Synge giving advice to the younger Hutcheson still exist.\n\n\n\nSynge was also friendly with George Berkeley who, like Hutcheson, was living in Dublin at the same time.\n\nDespite his connections, Synge\u2019s work in philosophy is minor, and is centred in the areas of moral and political philosophy. He argued for limited toleration (as his father before him had done), most notably in the sermon of 23rd October 1725 which he preached to the members of the House of Commons while prebendary of St Patricks. The sermon drew acclaim and was printed. It also drew vehement disagreement from the Church of Ireland vicar of Naas, Stephen Radcliffe, who wrote a 45 page pamphlet opposing the arguments of the sermon. Edward Synge wrote a vindication of his sermon in reply, along with a detailed outline of a possible oath that might be acceptable to Catholics\n\nStephen Radcliffe advocated using force against those who were unorthodox in their religious opinions. Synge argued that force ought not be used by magistrates against the religiously unorthodox \u201cif the publick civil interests are in no way affected\u201d, aligning himself with Locke (and Francis Hutcheson). Like Locke, however, while he says everyone has a right to worship according to his conscience, atheists are beyond the pale since their beliefs are destructive of society. But otherwise \u201call persons in a society, whose principles of religion have no tendency to hurt the public, have a right to a toleration.\u201d\n\nIn his reply to Radcliffe and following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Synge put forward his own version of an oath that might be acceptable to Catholics, and a proposal that the country accommodate 500 secular priests to serve the Catholic community. He made no other proposals regarding the Penal Laws, but noted that the limitations put on Catholic ownership of land meant they turned to trade, and held their wealth in money. Money was not as good a guarantor of their peaceful behaviour as money, and money could be used in revolt more readily\n\nSynge had six children, only one of whom, Alicia (1733-1807) survived into adulthood. Synge was widowed in 1737 and when he was promoted to Bishop of Elphin Alicia stayed in the family home in Kevin Street. Synge lived in Roscommon in the summer, and with her in Dublin for the parliamentary winter term. While separated he wrote her a series of letters, collected as The Synge Letters. Bishop Edward Synge to His Daughter Alicia, Roscommon to Dublin 1746-1752. Extracts have also been printed in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (extracts on google). These letters give insight into the paternal relationship to daughters, and education and care of girls in the 18th century.

Cork, second son of Edward Synge (qv), later bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and his wife Barbara Latham. Edward's elder brother was Samuel Synge (d. 1708), who became dean of Kildare. Synge was educated at the diocesan school, Cork, and in 1674 he went to Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he met William Wake, later archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout his life. He graduated BA in 1677.\n\nSynge's first incumbency was as rector of Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136). In 1686 he became vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork, which he held until 1706. He was also (1691\u20131714) rector of Rathclarin, Co. Cork, and held other parishes in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1695 William King (qv), then bishop of Dublin, put Synge's name forward for the diocese of Limerick. Synge expressed surprise that he had been considered, but he did not get Limerick, and when he was offered the deanery of Derry in 1699 he refused it on the grounds that his elderly mother could not accompany him. About four years later, the lord lieutenant, the 2nd duke of Ormond (qv) offered him the deanery of St Patrick's on behalf of the crown. However, a dispute between the crown and the chapter as to the right of presentation was only resolved when John Stearne (qv) was appointed dean and Edward Synge became chancellor of St Patrick's and vicar of St Werburgh's, where he was installed in April 1705. In 1714 King recommended Synge for the diocese of Raphoe, and he was consecrated in November that year. He remained at Raphoe for only eighteen months, and in June 1716 he was appointed archbishop of Tuam.\n\nInitially, Synge had resisted his removal from Raphoe, where he was engaged in disputes about presbyterian marriages and a campaign of conversion through education. He saw that there was a great deal of work and expense in Tuam, and there was nowhere to live, as the archbishop's palace had been burnt during the civil war. Tuam had other drawbacks: there were few resident clergy and many parishes were impropriate. Further, there was a long-running problem about the quarta pars episcopalis, that part of the tithes that had augmented the income of the archbishop, and not the parish clergy. It had been proposed to abolish this custom in Tuam, but before the necessary legislation was enacted the documents were lost in the 1641 rebellion. Synge was advised to encourage the Tuam clergy to petition for the abolition of the quarta pars, to supplement the incomes of clergy who were prepared to resign from pluralities, and to provide for parishes that had not been served since the reformation.\n\nOn the growing constitutional crisis arising from the Annesley v. Sherlock case (over the appellate jurisdictions of the Irish house of lords and its British counterpart) Synge told Wake that Ireland was \u2018a kingdom (not a county Palatine) exactly formd [sic] according to the model of England . . . \u2019 (Synge to Wake, 1 Nov. 1717 (Dublin City Library, Gilbert MS 28, f. 100)). With Archbishop King, he opposed actively but unsuccessfully the enactment by the Irish parliament of a toleration act for protestant dissenters. Here again Synge was said to have conducted himself \u2018with the greatest warmth and zeal for the nation's honour\u2019 (William Nicholson to Wake, 11 July 1719 (ibid., f. 236). In his speech on the bill, Synge observed that although he had always believed in limited toleration for dissenters, he saw that religion was a continuing cause of strife, wars, and rebellions. Citing the existence of 180 sects in England which had flourished during the civil war, he warned that it should be not thought that these \u2018wild sects and parties\u2019 had gone. If the bill were passed, he said, not only the Church of Ireland, but the civil state and even Christianity itself would be put at risk (Edward Synge speech on toleration, MS in private possession). Both Synge and King were out of favour as a result of their opposition to the bill.\n\nSynge acknowledged the difficulty that catholics had in taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, excluding them from full rights in a civil society. He believed that catholics and dissenters should be prosecuted only if they posed a real danger to the state, and proposed an oath of allegiance to meet the objections of both Roman Catholics and quakers. During his life, Synge published nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts, and he is now seen as one of the most influential religious commentators of his time. The Appendix to his Gentleman's religion (1698) is thought by Berman to have been written in answer to John Toland's (qv) Christianity not mysterious (1696). To some extent Synge shared Toland's rationalism and deism, but he rebutted Toland's case that religion possessed no mysteries. With William King, George Berkeley (qv), and Francis Hutcheson (qv), Synge discussed the problem of innate perception, using the analogy of a blind man's understanding of shape and form. In October 1714 he preached a sermon at St Werburgh's which was attacked for advocating deism and which resulted in a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Synge died in Tuam on 24 July 1741, where he was buried.\n\nHe married (1690) Anne, daughter of Nicholas Proude, dean of Clonfert. They had five children, two of whom became bishops. The eldest, Edward Synge (d. 1762), was given (1719) the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's cathedral. Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticised on the grounds that they encouraged a \u2018furious and blind zeal for religion\u2019 which could disturb the civil state, and in 1725 he preached on religious toleration to members of both houses of parliament. Made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was translated to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin, where he remained until his death. He was a close friend of Francis Hutcheson the philosopher, who acknowledged his debt to Synge's critique of the text of his An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue (1726). In 1749 Synge organised a census of the diocese of Elphin, which covers most of Co. Roscommon, and parts of south-east Co. Sligo and north-east Co. Galway. It was a remarkable undertaking: forms were specially designed and printed and clergy and churchwardens were persuaded to act as enumerators. The census is housed in the NAI (NAI, MS 2466). Synge married (1725) Jane Curtis and it is through his letters to their daughter Alicia that he is best known."}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-a8426", "page_content": "Synge, Edward (c.1614\u20131678), clergyman, was baptised 14 August 1614 in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England, second son of Richard Synge, tanner, and bailiff of Bridgnorth, and his wife Alice Rowley of Rowley, Shropshire. The original family name was Millington; it was apparently changed due to the singing abilities of the family. Synge came to Ireland at the suggestion of his elder brother George, Church of Ireland dean of Dromore and later bishop of Cloyne (1638\u201341), and was educated in Drogheda and at TCD , where he graduated MA .\n\nOrdained into the Church of Ireland, he was appointed rector of Killary in Meath (1638\u201360) and Drumully in Clogher (1640\u201360), and prebendary of Aghadowny, Co. Londonderry (1640\u201361). At some point he married Barbara Latham (d. 22 December 1677) of New Place, Co. Londonderry; they had at least three sons and five daughters. Noted as a preacher, Synge was chaplain general to the royalist forces in Leinster during the 1640s, and in July 1647 was one of a number of Dublin clergymen to sign a declaration stating their adherence to the Book of Common Prayer. Synge was appointed as a minor canon of St Patrick's cathedral (1647\u201360), and as vicar of Lusk, Co. Dublin (1648\u201361), and Inishannon, Co. Cork (1648\u201361), dean of Elphin (1648\u201360), and archdeacon of Cloyne (1648\u201361). Soon after, he may have been appointed chancellor of Christ Church cathedral by James Butler (qv), marquess of Ormond, but this remains uncertain. However, the potential privileges of these positions were offset by the parlous condition of the Church of Ireland at this time. After 1647 Synge had removed himself to his benefice in Donegal and spent most of the 1650s there. However, he occasionally ministered to Richard Boyle (qv), 2nd earl of Cork. He remained an episcopalian, continuing to use the Book of Common Prayer in the north-west throughout the 1650s. This prompted numerous complaints, but an association with Robert Gorges (qv), clerk of the Irish council, ensured that these were disregarded.\n\nSynge enjoyed good relations with many figures in the ruling elites of Ireland during the interregnum and after the restoration, a fact testified to by his plethora of appointments. His eldest son, Samuel, married a daughter of Archbishop Michael Boyle (qv). In 1660 Edward Synge was nominated to serve on the presidency council of Munster, and on 6 August 1660 was nominated as bishop of Limerick, being consecrated on 27 January 1661; he held the see in tandem with that of Ardfert and Aghadoe. In 1661 he also graduated DD from TCD. Of the ten bishops and two archbishops appointed in 1660, Synge was one of only three who had served in Ireland during the 1650s. In his new position, he was involved in a dispute with Ormond over the ownership of church lands in Limerick. On 21 December 1663 Synge was made bishop of Cork. As with his previous post, he held the sees in tandem. Synge's elder brother, George, who held Cloyne prior to 1641, had been ordered by the then viceroy, Thomas Wentworth (qv), earl of Strafford, to regain diocesan lands lost to figures such as Richard Boyle (qv), 1st earl of Cork, since the sixteenth century. The see was divided in two to facilitate this, but little progress was made prior to 1641; consequently more lands were lost during the interregnum, and the sees were reunited after the restoration. Throughout the 1660s Synge embarked on what became an acrimonious campaign via the acts of settlement and explanation, and the exchequer court, to regain these lands. A good relationship with the Boyle interest ensured that Roger Boyle (qv), earl of Orrery, acted as arbitrator in a number of the ensuing disputes. Synge's exertions were strongly opposed by Murrough O'Brien (qv), earl of Inchiquin, who now occupied some of the holdings; indeed, at one point Inchiquin's men assaulted Synge's son George. However, he succeeded in obtaining much of the outstanding diocesan land; by 1668 his income was calculated at \u00a31,400, and in 1677 he was still receiving leases under the terms of the act of explanation.\n\nIn October 1675 Synge was appointed to a commission dealing with the outstanding arrears of the \u201949 officers. He died 22 December 1678, and after his death the sees were divided. In 1679 Synge's eldest son Samuel attempted to transfer diocesan lands into the possession of the family, but in 1697 this was contested and reversed by the then bishop of Cloyne, Edward Jones. Two of Synge's sons entered the Church of Ireland: Samuel became dean of Kildare, and Edward (qv) enjoyed a distinguished career as archbishop of Tuam."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edward_Synge_(bishop_of_Cork,_Cloyne_and_Ross)", "page_content": "Edward Synge\n\nTable info: ... \u25bc 3 JUL 1621 Christening Place SAINT MARY MAGDALENE,BRIDGNORTH,SHROPSHIRE,ENGLAND Father's Name Humphrey Syng\n\nQuick facts: Styles of Edward Synge, Reference style, Spok... \u25bc\n\n(died 1678) was an Anglican clergyman who served in the Church of Ireland as the Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe (1661\u20131663) and subsequently the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross (1663\u20131678).\n\nA native of Bridgnorth in Shropshire, England, he was educated at Drogheda Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin.

There were three of them, all related. The Edward Synge who is the subject of this post was the son of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. He was also the nephew of George Synge (1594\u20131653), bishop of Cloyne; and the father of Bishops Edward Synge (1691\u20131762) and Nicholas Synge (1693\u20131771).\n\nEdward Synge the Elder, as we will distinguish him from his father and son, was born in Inishannon, Cork on 6 April 1659. After his education in Cork, Oxford and Dublin he was rector in Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136) and then vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork (1686-1706). In that period he wrote his first major work A Gentleman\u2019s Religion (1693), originally published anonymously.\n\nAfter the challenge of John Toland\u2019s Christianity Not Mysterious (1696), Edward Synge added an appendix to later editions of Gentleman\u2019s Religion (David Berman suggests as a direct response.) Toland had argued that religious mysterious such as the Holy Trinity could not be properly part of Christianity since they could not be believed, since they were contrary to or above reason.\n\n\n\nWhile Synge shares Toland\u2019s rationalism, he disagrees that there can be no mysteries in religion. Synge says that, though mysteries cannot be contrary to reason, they can be \u201cabove reason\u201d when the \u201cproposition is in itself true, but we are unable to clearly to apprehend or form a Notion or Conception of the things contained under the Terms of it.\u201d Such things a person may have sufficient reason to give assent to. Synge cites a conversation with a blind man, who had no memory of sight whatsoever. Synge asked him if he had any idea of colour or light at all; the blind man replied that he had often tried to gain such an idea, but had failed. He had theorised, says Synge, that others were attempting to fool him by speaking of colours and sight, but their ability to do things that the blind man could not eventually convinced him that they could indeed see. So, concludes Synge, in the same way Scripture can indicate truths that human reason cannot grasp itself.\n\nIn making a defence along these lines, Synge joined others such as Peter Browne. After recommendations from William King Archbishop of Dublin, Synge was promoted, becoming Chancellor of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Dublin (1705\u20131714) and then Bishop of Raphoe (1714\u20131716).\n\nHe wrote his second major work in 1715 A Plain and Easy Method whereby a Man of Moderate Capacity may arrive at Full Satisfaction in all Things that concern his Everlasting Salvation. This book aimed to present the Christian faith in an accessible and rational manner \u2013 so rational in fact that Browne attacked it as too close to Toland, since it left no room for faith. This suggestion that Synge had deistic leanings was sharply replied to by Synge. It didn\u2019t affect his career, since he was then elevated to Archbishop of Tuam (1716\u20131741).\n\nSynge argued for toleration in religion, despite joining Archbishop King in resisting the Toleration Act (1719) which gave rights to protestant dissenters. Synge believed that Catholics and Dissenters should not be prosecuted unless they were a real danger to the state and put forward an oath of allegiance that he hoped Catholics would be able to take, allowing them rights in civil society. This was supported with reservations by Cornelius Nary, a Catholic priest who replied to Synge\u2019s A Charitable Address to the Catholics of Ireland resulting in a series of printed tracts back and forth. In the introduction to Synge\u2019s last pamphlet in the debate, he put forward the following theory: \u201cThat men may live virtuously and holily in this life, and be eternally happy in the next, and that God may thereby be glorified in their salvation, is the only end and design of religion\u201d .\n\nLecky says that Synge had great influence with the gentry of Ireland, even more than Archbishop King. Modern commentators would agree he was one of the most influential religious commentators of his time, publishing nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts in his lifetime. Edward Synge bishop of Tuam died on 24th July, 1741.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.libraryireland.com/biography/ArchbishopEdwardSynge.php", "page_content": "An American widow\u2019s account of her travels in Ireland in 1844\u201345 on the eve of the Great Famine:\n\nIreland\u2019s Welcome to the Stranger\n\nSailing from New York, she set out to determine the condition of the Irish poor and discover why so many were emigrating to her home country.\n\nMrs Nicholson\u2019s recollections of her tour among the peasantry are still revealing and gripping today.\n\nThe author returned to Ireland in 1847\u201349 to help with famine relief and recorded those experiences in the rather harrowing:Annals of the Famine in Ireland.\n\nSee more of our books \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://www.irelandxo.com/ireland-xo/history-and-genealogy/ancestor-database/bishop-edward-synge", "page_content": "Edward Synge (1691\u20131762) was the Anglican Bishop of the Diocese of Elphin from 1740 until his death in 1762.

Christianity probably began to be practiced in England not later than the early 3rd century. By the 4th century the church was established well enough to send three British bishops\u2014of Londinium (London), Eboracum (York), and Lindum (Lincoln)\u2014to the Council of Arles (in present-day France) in 314. In the 5th century, after the Romans had withdrawn from Britain and the Anglo-Saxons had invaded it, St. Illtud and St. Patrick performed missionary work in Wales and in Ireland, respectively. Isolated from continental Christianity in the 5th and 6th centuries, Christianity in the British Isles, especially in the north, was influenced by Irish Christianity, which was organized around monasteries rather than episcopal sees. About 563 St. Columba founded an influential monastic community on the island of Iona in the Inner Hebrides islands of Scotland.\n\nAn important step in the history of the English church was taken in 596, when St. Augustine was sent on a mission to England by Pope Gregory the Great. He was charged with evangelizing the largely pagan southern English kingdoms and establishing Roman ecclesiastical organization. He successfully preached to the king of Kent, converting him and a large number of his followers in 597. Augustine\u2019s archbishopric at Canterbury soon became the symbolic seat of England\u2019s church, which established important ties to Rome under his leadership. Subsequent mission work, such as that of St. Aidan in northern England about 634, helped to solidify the English church. At the synod of Whitby in 664, the church of Northumbria (one of the northern English kingdoms) broke its ties with the Celtic church and accepted Roman usage, bringing the English church more fully into line with Roman and continental practices.\n\nThe early church in England was a distinctive fusion of British, Celtic, and Roman influences. Although adopting the episcopal structure favoured by the church of Rome, it retained powerful centres in the monasteries. The most important British sees were the archbishoprics of York and Canterbury, which often competed for primacy. Representatives of the church, such as the great historian and scholar Bede, played an important role in the development of English culture. The church sometimes found itself at odds with the English monarchy, as when St. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went into exile during controversies over the investiture of William Rufus and Henry I. The martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket, the most famous case of church-state conflict, demonstrated the church\u2019s concern to protect its integrity against the throne in the 12th century. The writings of John Wycliffe questioned the form of the medieval church and became an early protest against control of the English church by Rome.\n\nWhy did Henry VIII form the Church of England? See all videos for this article\n\nUnder King Henry VIII in the 16th century, the Church of England broke with Rome, largely because Pope Clement VII refused to grant Henry an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Wishing no reform\u2014except along the lines of Erasmus\u2019s Christian humanism\u2014Henry intended to replace Rome\u2019s authority over the English church with his own. Upon Henry\u2019s death, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer began changes that allied the Church of England with the Reformation. His The Book of Common Prayer revised traditional forms of worship to incorporate Protestant ideas. These efforts, however, were overturned by Queen Mary, who sought to restore Roman Catholicism in England. When Elizabeth I assumed the throne in 1558, the Reformation in England triumphed. The theologian John Jewel wrote that the Church of England had returned to ancient precedent. Richard Hooker defended the church against attacks by English Puritans and Catholics. Although the Puritans achieved political power in the Commonwealth in the mid-17th century, the subsequent Restoration (1660) marked the beginning of more than a century of great influence for the Church of England. The church dominated England\u2019s religious life, becoming a considerable social and spiritual force and closely allying itself with the power of the throne. It generated impressive forms of philanthropy, and clergy commonly performed the duties of civil servants.\n\nThe church\u2019s hold on English religious life began to wane in the 18th century, despite impressive reform efforts. John Wesley, Charles Simeon, John Newton, and other clergy associated with the Evangelical revival prompted a surge of new religious fervour. Evangelical laity such as William Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect fought slavery and encouraged social reform. In the early 19th century the Anglo-Catholic (High Church) Oxford movement, led by John Henry Newman, John Keble, and E.B. Pusey, attempted to recover the ancient liturgy and to respond to social concerns. The church made impressive efforts to encompass the diversity of modern English life while retaining its traditional identity."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/church-of-england", "page_content": "While the Church upholds many of the customs of Roman Catholicism, it also embraces fundamental ideas adopted during the Protestant Reformation. In recent years, the Church of England has been viewed as one of the more progressive sects of Christianity and is known for its relatively liberal policies, such as allowing the ordination of women and gay priests.\n\nThe Church of England, or Anglican Church, is the primary state church in England, where the concepts of church and state are linked. The Church of England is considered the original church of the Anglican Communion, which represents over 85 million people in more than 165 countries.\n\nChurch of England Facts\n\nThe British monarch is considered the supreme governor of the Church. Among other privileges, he or she has the authority to approve the appointment of archbishops and other church leaders.\n\nThe Church of England contends that the Bible is the principle foundation of all Christian faith and thought.\n\nFollowers embrace the sacraments of baptism and holy communion.\n\nThe Church claims to be both Catholic and Reformed. It upholds teachings found in early Christian doctrines, such as the Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed. The Church also reveres 16th century Protestant Reformation ideas outlined in texts, such as the Thirty-Nine Articles and the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nThe Church of England sustains a traditional Catholic order system that includes ordained bishops, priests and deacons.\n\nThe Church follows an episcopal form of government. It\u2019s divided into two provinces: Canterbury and York. Provinces are separated into dioceses, which are headed by bishops and include parishes.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is thought to be the most senior cleric in the Church.\n\nThe Church\u2019s bishops play a lawmaking role in Britain. Twenty-six bishops sit in the House of Lords and are referred to as the \u201cLords Spiritual.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the Church embraces a way of thinking that includes scripture, tradition and reason.\n\nThe Church of England is sometimes referred to as the Anglican Church and is part of the Anglican Communion, which contains sects such as the Protestant Episcopal Church.\n\nEach year, about 9.4 million people visit a Church of England cathedral.\n\nIn recent years, women and members of the LGBTQ community were given the opportunity to participate in the church\u2019s leadership roles.\n\nChurch of England History\n\nThe Church of England\u2019s earliest origins date back to the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s influence in Europe during the 2nd century.\n\nHowever, the church\u2019s official formation and identity are typically thought to have started during the Reformation in England of the 16th century. King Henry VIII (famous for his many wives) is considered the founder of the Church of England.\n\nHenry VIII\n\nHenry VIII broke ties with the Pope in the 1530s after the Catholic church wouldn\u2019t allow him to annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, who failed to produce any male heirs.\n\nHenry passed the Act of Succession and the Act of Supremacy, which essentially declared himself the supreme head of the Church of England.\n\nAfter Henry\u2019s death, Protestant reforms made their way into the church during the reign of Edward VI. But, when Edward\u2019s half-sister, Mary, succeeded the throne in 1553, she persecuted Protestants and embraced traditional Roman Catholic ideals.\n\nAfter Elizabeth I took the title of Queen in 1558, however, the Church of England was revived. The Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion became important texts that outlined moral doctrine and worship principles.\n\nChurch Movements\n\nThe Puritan movement in the 17th century led to the English Civil Wars and the Commonwealth. During this time, the Church of England and the monarchy were quelled, but both were re-established in 1660.\n\nThe 18th century brought the Evangelical movement, which promoted the Protestant customs of the Church. Conversely, the Oxford Movement in the 19th century highlighted the Roman Catholic heritage.\n\nThese two movements and their philosophies have endured in the Church and are sometimes referred to as \u201cLow Church\u201d and \u201cHigh Church.\u201d\n\nSince the 20th century, the Church of England has been active in the Ecumenical Movement, which promotes ideas of worldwide Christian unity.\n\nChurch of England in America\n\nMany of the early American colonists were Anglican Puritans. During the Colonial era, the Anglican Church set up establishments in Virginia, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, the Anglican Church became an independent organization in the United States and called itself the Protestant Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Episcopal Church, USA, is the official organization of the Anglican Communion in the United States. It\u2019s been a self-governing body since 1785 and has about 1.9 million members.\n\nWomen and LGBTQ in the Church of England\n\nIn 1992, the Church of England voted to ordain women as priests. This decision sparked debate within the clerical community but also opened the door for further empowerment of women within the church hierarchy.\n\nOver the next few years, several attempts to allow women to become bishops were put in place, but many of them were squashed by the opposition.\n\nFinally, in 2014, the Church passed a bill to consecrate women as bishops. The archbishops of Canterbury and of York\u2014the church\u2019s most elite officials\u2014approved the bill later that year. The first female bishop of the Church of England, Rev. Libby Lane, was consecrated in January 2015.\n\nSince 2005, the Church of England has allowed for the ordination of gay priests, under the condition that they remain celibate. LGBTQ individuals in celibate civil unions were permitted to become bishops in 2013.\n\nAlso, in 2013, the House of Commons passed legislation to legalize same-sex marriages but didn\u2019t allow the Church of England to perform them.\n\nMany consider the Church of England\u2019s elevation of women and LGBTQ people in the clergy as groundbreaking and long-awaited progress. Others in the church view it as sacrilegious and blasphemous.\n\nWhile the debate continues, experts agree that the Church of England has paved the way for conversations about expanding gender and sexual-orientation roles within Christianity.\n\nSources\n\nHistory of the Church of England, The Church of England.\n\nChurch of England, BBC.\n\nThe Church of England in Early America, National Humanities Center.\n\nEpiscopal Church Fast Facts, CNN."}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Synge,_Edward", "page_content": "\u200bSYNGE, EDWARD (1659\u20131741), archbishop of Tuam, second and younger son of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, was born on 6 April 1659 at Inishannon in co. Cork, of which parish his father was at the time vicar.\n\nThe family belonged to Bridgnorth in Shropshire, where the name appears originally to have been Millington. According to tradition, they acquired the name of Sing or Synge from the sweetness of voice of one of the family.\n\nGeorge Synge (1594\u20131653), uncle of the younger Edward, born at Bridgnorth in 1594. was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 16 Feb. 1610, graduated B.A. on 21 Oct. 1613, and M.A. on 12 June 1616. Subsequently he went to Ireland, where he found a warm patron in Christopher Hampton [q. v.], archbishop of Armagh, who constituted him vicar-general of his diocese and dean of Dromore; in which capacity his \u2018so eloquent, so godly, so very leaud, railing, cursing censure\u2019 of James Croxton\u2019s attempts at auricular \u200bconfession had, but for the generally disturbed state of the kingdom in 1638, drawn down upon him the vengeance of Archbishop Laud (see Prynne, Canterburies Doom, p. 195; Strafford, Letters, ii. 185, 212, 249). On 11 Nov. 1638 he was consecrated bishop of Cloyne at Drogheda; but on the breaking out of the rebellion in October 1641 he fled for safety to Dublin. In February 1644 he was sworn of the Irish privy council, and on the death of Dr. John Maxwell (1590?\u20131647) [q. v.] in February 1646\u20137 was nominated to the archbishopric of Tuam; but, failing to obtain possession on account of the war, he returned in the following year to Bridgnorth, where he died in 1653, and was buried on 31 Aug. in the church of St. Mary Magdalene. He was the author of a learned reply to the Jesuit Malone\u2019s answer to Archbishop Ussher, entitled \u2018A Rejoinder to the Reply, published by the Jesuits under the name of William Malone,\u2019 Dublin, 1632.\n\nIt was at his suggestion that his younger brother, Edward Synge (d. 1678), then a mere boy, but destined for the church, likewise repaired to Ireland. Having received a sound education at the school at Drogheda and Trinity College, Dublin, he was, after taking orders, preferred to the rectory of Killary in the barony of Lower Slane, co. Meath. In 1647 he was appointed a minor canon of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, and shortly afterwards vicar of Inishannon in co. Cork, and dean of Elphin. During the rule of the Commonwealth he persisted in using the English liturgy in all the public offices of his ministry, being secured from prosecution by his interest with Dr. Gorge, the then auditor-general. He was consecrated bishop of Limerick on 27 Jan. 1661, and on 21 Dec. 1663 translated to the united sees of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. He died on 22 Dec. 1678, having acquired a reputation as a singularly able preacher. Of his two sons, Samuel the elder, having graduated B.A. from Christ Church College, Oxford, on 26 Nov. 1674, proceeding M.A. on 3 July 1677, became dean of Kildare on 17 April 1679, and, dying on 30 Nov., was buried in the family vault in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard, near Archbishop Marsh\u2019s library, on 2 Dec. 1708.\n\nEdward, the younger son, after being educated at the grammar school at Cork, was admitted a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1674, and graduated B.A. in 1677, but on his father\u2019s death returned to Ireland, finishing his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was admitted ad eundem, and took the degree of M.A. Having been ordained priest and deacon, he was preferred to the two small parishes of Laracor and Augher in the diocese of Meath, being both together of about the yearly value of 100l. These he afterwards exchanged for the vicarage of Christ Church, Cork, of the same value, but one of the heaviest cures in Ireland. Here he remained for more than twenty years, his income having been in the meantime increased to about 400l. a year by the gift of certain small benefices tenable with his cure. In 1699 he was offered the deanery of Derry, but declined it out of regard for his mother, who was unwilling to leave Cork. He was chosen proctor for the chapter in the convocation summoned in 1703, and was shortly afterwards nominated by the lord-lieutenant, the Duke of Ormonde, to the deanery of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin. But the right of election being claimed by the chapter, a compromise was effected through the mediation of Archbishop William King [q. v.]; John Sterne [q. v.] (afterwards bishop of Clogher) succeeding to the deanery and Synge to the chancellorship, with the parish of St. Werburgh annexed. He was installed on 2 April 1705, and during the next eight years that he resided in Dublin he established a reputation for himself as one of the most industrious clergymen and popular preachers in the city. At the same time he took his degree of D.D., and on Sterne\u2019s promotion to the see of Dromore, having been appointed by Archbishop King his vicar-general, he was chosen to represent the chapter of St. Patrick\u2019s in the convocation that met in 1713. On 7 Nov. 1714 he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe in the church of Dunboyne, co. Meath, by the archbishop of Cashel, and on 8 June 1716 was translated to the archbishopric of Tuam, including the ancient sees of Enaghdune and Kilfenora, together with the wardenship of Galway. He was enthroned at Kilfenora on 7 Nov., and one of his earliest actions, and that which gained him the goodwill of his clergy, was the resignation, in pursuance of an old scheme of the Earl of Strafford for improving the livings in his diocese, of the \u2018quarta pars episcopalis\u2019 or fourth part of the tithes, which his immediate predecessors had nevertheless enjoyed [see Vesey, John, archbishop of Tuam, and for a full discussion of the subject Ware\u2019s Works, ed. Harris, i. 619]. To this end he procured an act of parliament in 1717 settling it permanently on such rectors, vicars, and curates as personally discharged their cures. In 1716 he was admitted a privy councillor, and in that and the two following years was one of the keepers of the great seal in the absence of the lord high chancellor. Like King himself, he \u200bfell into disfavour with the government owing to his opposition to the Toleration Bill in 1719, which he thought calculated to promote the growth of popery (Report of his speech, Addit. MS. 6117, ff. 107\u201321), and, in consequence of having in the following spring alluded to the act as a reason for greater zeal in preaching against popery, he was charged with stirring up disaffection against the state. But from this charge he \u2018acquitted himself so well that it dropped of itself,\u2019 and in 1721 he was again included in the commission for administering the great seal. He died at Tuam on 24 July 1741, and was buried in the churchyard of his cathedral at the east end of the church. He desired that no monument should be erected to his memory; but the capital of the ancient cross of Tuam placed over his grave testifies to the universal respect in which he was held.\n\nSynge was a man of considerable learning, but his writings, consisting of short tracts and sermons, of which there is a full if not complete list in Nichols\u2019s \u2018Literary Anecdotes\u2019 (i. 378), were chiefly devoted to the promotion of practical piety. A number of them (some thirty-four) were after his death collected and published in 4 vols. 12mo, London, 1744. Of these, several, having passed through many editions during his lifetime, have since been adopted, and frequently reprinted for general distribution, by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. It has been said of Synge that his life was as exemplary as his writings were instructive; that what he wrote he believed, and what he believed he practised. As the son of one bishop, the nephew of another, himself an archbishop, and the father of two other bishops, his position in ecclesiastical biography is probably unique.\n\nSynge\u2019s two sons, Edward and Nicholas, were both graduates of Trinity College, Dublin; the former proceeding M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728; the latter M.A. in 1715 and D.D. in 1734. Edward, from being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, was on 28 May 1730 elevated to the bishopric of Clonfert, being consecrated by his father in St. Werburgh\u2019s Church, Dublin, on 7 June. Subsequently he was translated to Cloyne on 21 March 1731, to Ferns on 8 Feb. 1733, and to Elphin on 15 May 1740. He died at Dublin on 27 Jan. 1762, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Feb. Nicholas, having been collated to the archdeaconry of Dublin in 1743, was on 26 Jan. 1746 consecrated bishop of Killaloe. He died in December 1770, the fifth and last prelate of the family, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Jan. 1771.\n\n[Biographia Britannica based on a memoir contributed by the archbishop\u2019s son Edward and practically reprinted in Chalmers\u2019s Biographical Dictionary; Wood\u2019s Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ed.
