Another feature of these presentations is suggested in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Australia:\n\nthe most popular way of avoiding censorship restrictions \u2013 and even baiting the censor \u2013 was with pantomime and burlesque, some adapting English pantomimes with local reference. ... The best-known authors of this genre were the British playwright and critic William Mower Akhurst \u2026 and Garnet Walch. (Bambrick 317)\n\n[t]he problem that besets so much delving into early Australian drama \u2013 that the texts have long since vanished \u2013 does not apply here, since the pantomime was usually printed in full as part of the theatre programme, with italics emphasizing the excruciating puns in which such pieces abounded, so that if one didn't see the joke at once, it could be worked out later at home. (Williams 64)\n\nAdd to that historian Geoffrey Serle's comment that \"[t]he theatre in the early fifties was little more than a branch of the liquor industry\" (362), and one gets the idea that these productions must have been raucous events!Akhurst was central to the growth of the theater during the tumultuous years leading up to Australian independence. The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature says \"[d]uring the 1860s he was the life-force of Melbourne\u2019s pantomime productions\" (Wilde 20). And, fortunately for us,Two of Akhurst's plays deal with the Arthurian legend, and they are very similar. King Arthur, or, Launcelot the Loose, Gin-ever the Square, and the Knights of the Round Table, and other Furniture (performed in Australia in 1868) and Arthur the King, or, The Knights of the Round Table and Other Funny-ture (performed in England in 1871) have the same plot and characters, and even the same dialogue. Both mention Lord Tennyson's Idylls and Gustave Dor\u00e9's Arthurian images. The same \" excruciating puns\" (Elaine on the barge is \"a gal on a bier\") appear in both. The essential difference is that the Australian version is heavily laden with references to local politicians and other characters. A political system in its infancy, a gold rush, and Akhurst's connection to the two major newspapers were all grist for the mill. An extreme example is given in this reference to Edward Langton, who had been appointed Treasurer of the newly formed government:Sir K. That trash! Some who such trash have soldHave risen to the trasherer, I'm told.Arthur. That's la'n'g't on thickAkhurst returned to London in 1871, where \"he produced another sixteen pieces, including nine pantomimes and four dramas\" (Wilde 20). He was returning Australia in 1878, but died at sea.Dr. Clay Djubal, founding contributor to the wonderful website The Australian Variety Theatre Archive, has written much about Austrailian theatre. He has also written a wonderful biography of Akhurst: http://ozvta.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/akhurst-wm-23122012.pdf .

From age 14 to 26 he worked for a firm of merchants in the manchester goods, but his real interest was in performing and writing for the theatre. In 1847 he wrote two pieces for Greenwood, the manager of the Cremorne Gardens theatre: A Barber's Blunders and The Bosjemans (Bosjesmen?), both of which were successfully staged that year.[1]\n\nHe emigrated to Australia, arriving in Adelaide by the barque Posthumous, in June 1849.[2] and found employment as reporter and sub-editor for James \"Dismal Jemmy\" Allen's newly launched Adelaide Times.\n\nHe came to public attention when he assisted the widow and orphan children of a fellow journalist, who died at sea after a long illness, leaving her destitute.[3] He gave the theatre-going public a taste of his play-writing talents with musical sketches or plays: Quite Colonial, and Romance and Reality at several of the concerts given by the Nelson family[4] while that troupe was in Adelaide May\u2013August 1853. A third, The Rights of a Woman, would be performed in Melbourne 24 July 1854. The songs were written by Akhurst to fit recognised tunes as played on the piano by Sidney Nelson.[lower-alpha 1]\n\nOn 15 October 1853 he launched a newspaper, South Australian Free Press, which failed to thrive and ceased publication with the issue of 1 April 1854. This was the era of gold fever, when much of South Australia's population had left for the goldfields of Victoria and New South Wales, to the detriment of their home colony's economy. Akhurst collected what outstanding subscriptions he could,[5] and joined the \"rush\". Melbourne was in its boom years, and Akhurst had no trouble finding employment; he joined the Melbourne Argus as sub-editor and music critic. Subsequently, he wrote fourteen pantomimes; one of his burlesques, the Siege of Troy, running for sixty nights, and Knights of the Round Table also popular, both starring Richard Stewart and H. R. Harwood with scene painting (in those days as much a drawcard as the acting) by John Hennings. In February 1870 he returned to England, and wrote pantomimes for Astley's, the Pavilion, and the Elephant and Castle theatres. He died on board the Patriarch, on the return voyage to Sydney.[6][7]"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/236190993/william-mower-akhurst", "page_content": "William was a son to Harriet nee Dickenson and William Akhurst.
