Mackenzie who was born in Naperville, Illinois started her gymnastics career at Aerial Gymnastics Club. When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards. She also earned All-Southeastern Conference honors, she won 7 event titles throughout the season, she also was selected as a SEC Community Service team member, a recipient of $5,000 scholarship as a nominee for SEC Brad Davis Community Service award, was named co-Gator Heart & Soul Award recipient and received the \u201cCommunigator\u201d award at her team banquet. She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World Championships:\n\n2010 Worlds Beam, 2010 Worlds Floor, 2010 Worlds Bars,\n\n2008 Olympic Trials Vault\n\n***Pictures provided by Google Search, Info & Bio provided by USA Gymnastics, Wikipedia, Gator Gymnastics and Videos from Youtube Gymcat67 & Gymnweb Account***"}, {"url": "https://www.flogymnastics.com/articles/5067401-catching-up-with-former-florida-gator-mackenzie-caquatto", "page_content": "FloGymnastics: What have you been up to since graduating in 2014?\n\nTell us about how teaching is going and what you enjoy the most.\n\n\n\nWhen you look back at your career at Florida, what moments stand out to you the most?\n\nWhat are you most proud of as a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat do you miss most about gymnastics and being a Florida Gator?\n\nWhat was it like competing with your sister, Bridgette?\n\nWhat was it like watching Bridgette compete after you had graduated?\n\nWhat personal accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n\n\nYou competed under former UF coach Rhonda Faehn -- what is the biggest thing you learned from her?\n\n\n\nWhat is next for you personally?

As a former elite who joined the Gators with a long list of accomplishments, she was part of two national and two SEC team titles in her time at Florida. Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on bars in her time at Florida and saw action consistently on all four events.FloGymnastics recently caught up with Caquatto to talk about her life after gymnastics:Caquatto: I graduated in 2014 with my bachelor's in elementary education. I then graduated in 2015 with my master's in elementary and special education. I got hired after graduation to teach fourth-grade math and science in Gainesville.I LOVE teaching and working with kids every day. I like to create my own atmosphere in the classroom and make it like a family. I like to do lots of hands-on activities and make their learning relatable. Each day is a new challenge, but I love that I can make an impact on their lives every day.Definitely winning two national championships and two SEC titles as a team! College was the best time of my life. I had amazing coaches who always wanted to best for you in all parts of your life. I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches. College gymnastics was the cherry on top for me.

She understands the Karolyi system, and knows that this will be a difficult challenge for Caquatto. Faehn told gatorzone.com, \u201cI really think she can stay disciplined and focused and give it a shot.\u2019\u2019\n\nCaquatto competed at the 2008 Olympic Trials where she was a long shot for the team, but she's much more of a contender after a solid showing at the 2010 World Championships in Rotterdam where she competed all around in the qualification round and bars and vault in the team final.

I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State.

I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20111110/news/711109967/", "page_content": "Naperville sisters among gymnastics elite\n\nSisters Bridgette and Mackenzie Caquatto, of Naperville, at ages 14 and 16, respectively.

Associated Press\n\nBridgette Caquatto competes on the balance beam in the women's artistic gymnastics individual all-around finals during the Pan American Games last month in Mexico. She won the gold in the women's individual all-around. Associated Press\n\nEighteen hardworking and talented athletes from all over the country comprise the U.S. women's senior gymnastics team this year.\n\nTwo of them come from the same Naperville family -- Bridgette Caquatto, 17, a senior at Naperville Central High School, and her sister Mackenzie, 19, a sophomore at the University of Florida.\n\nBoth sisters boast a long list of wins and accomplishments in gymnastics, claiming the uneven bars as their best routine.\n\nBridgette won three gold medals (individual all-around, uneven bars and team all-around) -- more than anyone else on her team or any other in the women's gymnastics portion of the Pan-American Games last month in Mexico. The Pan Am Games take place every four years and feature athletes from countries throughout the Americas.\n\nMackenzie won a silver medal with the U.S. team in 2010 at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, which feature athletes from all over the world and are held annually, except in Olympic years.\n\nSo how did they both manage to get so far in the sport? \"We must have good genes,\" Bridgette concluded during a recent interview at her home.\n\nA couple of days later, in a phone interview from Florida, Mackenzie's answer was ... exactly the same.\n\nBut the truth is a bit more complex, according to Kathy Kelly, vice president of programs for USA gymnastics.\n\n\"To reach the top at anything, I don't care if you're a concert pianist or a gymnast, first you need a little bit of God-given talent and a lot of personal drive that comes from the athlete, plus a little bit of luck that you can be with good coaches, and a lot of love from your parents, who are driving you around and taking you to meets,\" Kelly said. \"It's a big equation. It's not any one thing.\"\n\nAnd a measure of sisterly support goes a long way.\n\nKelly said she has always been impressed by how the Caquatto sisters treat each other. \"Their gymnastics speak for themselves. They are very, very loving and supportive to each other. They are truly happy for the other's success,\" she said.\n\nThe first time the sisters competed against one another was at the Visa Gymnastic Championships in August. Both made the U.S. national team, with Mackenzie taking 4th place all-around, and Bridgette close on her heels in 6th.\n\nThe sisters are quite different, both as athletes and as young women, said longtime coach Jiani Wu, who runs Legacy Elite Gymnastics with her husband, Yuejiu Li. Both are former Chinese Olympic gymnasts. Bridgette, who goes by \"Bridgey,\" is the more reserved of the two, a disciplined athlete who values steady, consistent practice, Jiani explained. Mackenzie, whom everyone calls \"Macko,\" is more outgoing, not always as intensely focused in training but able to step up her game in competition.\n\n\"Bridgey has a little bit more power; Macko is really coordinated. They are both really good on bars,\" said Jiani, whose daughter Anna Li, of Aurora, also is on the U.S. women's senior gymnastics team. \"They have a healthy way of pushing each other. I am very proud of them; they are great kids.\"\n\nThe Caquatto sisters agree that no one -- not their parents, not their coaches -- pushed them to put in thousands of hours of practice at the gym over the years. \"We do it because we love it,\" Bridgette said.\n\nBoth readily admit to making great sacrifices to get to the top. Training five to six hours a day and traveling to meets both nationally and internationally left little time to just hang out and be a teen, they said.\n\n\"I have given up a lot for gymnastics. You are always catching up with school and you have no time on your own, no time to relax. You are always constantly going,\" Bridgette said.\n\n\"You're basically just focusing your whole life around the sport because you can't really have distractions,\" Mackenzie said. \"The only dances I went to was homecoming and prom of senior year.\"\n\nFrustration has often been part of the equation, the sisters said.\n\nSome days, they just want to throw in the towel, but they always are there to support each other, they said. \"If you're having a bad day, we always have each other's back,\" Mackenzie said.\n\nDespite their packed schedules, both sisters managed to keep good grades. Bridgette has a 3.98 GPA on a 4.0 scale; Mackenzie, a 2010 graduate of Naperville Central, maintains a 3.5 or so GPA while studying elementary education. Next year, Bridgette will join her sister at the University of Florida.\n\nThe sisters took their first gymnastic tumbles when they were just 2 years old, as each took a \"mommy and me\" gymnastics class with their mother, Lin, at Elite Sports Complex in Downers Grove.\n\n\"They both loved it from the start. They did really good, and they just kept going,\" said Lin Caquatto, who works as an administrative assistant for an executive search firm. Their father, Dave, is a regional sales manager for a printing company. Both parents always have been athletic.\n\nAn integral part of being a top athlete is mental strength, the sisters said.\n\n\"It just comes with age and how confident you are in yourself and your skills,\" Bridgette said.\n\n\"'I've done it time and time again in practice' -- that's what I tell myself during competition. I keep bad thoughts out of my mind,\" Mackenzie said.\n\nBoth have suffered numerous injuries over the years -- stress fractures, muscle tears, the occasional sprained ankle -- but this has been a particularly tough one for Mackenzie.\n\nShe injured her ankle just before the SEC Gymnastics Championships, where she was primed for the challenge to win the national all-around title, said Rhonda Faehn, her coach at the University of Florida. \"She still competed, even though she could hardly walk,\" Faehn said. \"Mackenzie is a fighter.\"\n\nMackenzie then trained hard all summer to get back up to par, only to sprain both ankles in September during the selection camp for the world championship and the Pan-Am games.\n\nBoth Mackenzie and Bridgette would love to make the Olympic team that will compete in London next year. But they also are levelheaded about their prospects.\n\n\"I want to make it to the Olympic trials and do four of the best routines I have ever done, so I can leave and say I have no regrets,\" Bridgette said.\n\nMackenzie's immediate goal is to get healthy so she can rejoin her teammates by midseason. \"I want to win the NCAA championship with my team,\" she said. \"Making it to the Olympics in 2012 has always been a goal of mine. With my ankles I don't know how much of a possibility it is, but I am definitely still trying to make it.\"\n\nThe sisters say that getting to represent their country in international competitions is by far the biggest thrill of their lives.\n\n\"To compete for your country, after all that hard work, there is nothing like it,\" Bridgette said. \"And when you hear the U.S. national anthem play, that is the best part.\"\n\n\"That moment at worlds, it was all of it for me,\" Mackenzie said. \"All my hard work has paid off, all the hard days have paid off. And being with the team and the coaches, it all made sense why things had happened and how I got there.\"\n\n\u2022 Elena Ferrarin wrote today's column.

As a former elite who joined the Gators with a long list of accomplishments, she was part of two national and two SEC team titles in her time at Florida. Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on bars in her time at Florida and saw action consistently on all four events.FloGymnastics recently caught up with Caquatto to talk about her life after gymnastics:Caquatto: I graduated in 2014 with my bachelor's in elementary education. I then graduated in 2015 with my master's in elementary and special education. I got hired after graduation to teach fourth-grade math and science in Gainesville.I LOVE teaching and working with kids every day. I like to create my own atmosphere in the classroom and make it like a family. I like to do lots of hands-on activities and make their learning relatable. Each day is a new challenge, but I love that I can make an impact on their lives every day.Definitely winning two national championships and two SEC titles as a team! College was the best time of my life. I had amazing coaches who always wanted to best for you in all parts of your life. I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches.

I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State. I couldn\u2019t have been any happier for her.\u201d\n\nCall it balanced reciprocity, but the bar on the uneven bars already had been set for Bridgette, who witnessed Mackenzie score a perfect 10 in that event last season \u2013 something only six others Gators have done.\n\nMackenzie said her sister was in tears after seeing the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do the same thing when she gets a 10,\u201d big sister said.\n\nThe mutual support spills over into academics.\n\n\u201cI was always better at English and social studies, and Bridgey excelled in math and science,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been very disciplined when it comes to studying and academics, so she makes a great study buddy during midterms and finals.\u201d\n\nMackenzie also says that being in the ProTeach program has prepared her for the \u201creal life\u201d experiences she expects to encounter in her teaching career.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I presented lessons in front of 20 children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking, but not because it was difficult or I was scared of the kids. I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://www.flogymnastics.com/articles/5022488-mackenzie-caquatto-to-resume-ncaa-competition-at-florida-while-competing-elite", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n2010 USA World team member Mackenzie Caquatto of Legacy Elite Gymnastics in Illinois competed her freshman season at the University of Florida last season, then jumped right back into elite competition this summer, again representing Legacy Elite.

Mackenzie who was born in Naperville, Illinois started her gymnastics career at Aerial Gymnastics Club. When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards. She also earned All-Southeastern Conference honors, she won 7 event titles throughout the season, she also was selected as a SEC Community Service team member, a recipient of $5,000 scholarship as a nominee for SEC Brad Davis Community Service award, was named co-Gator Heart & Soul Award recipient and received the \u201cCommunigator\u201d award at her team banquet. She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World

As a former elite who joined the Gators with a long list of accomplishments, she was part of two national and two SEC team titles in her time at Florida. Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on bars in her time at Florida and saw action consistently on all four events.FloGymnastics recently caught up with Caquatto to talk about her life after gymnastics:Caquatto: I graduated in 2014 with my bachelor's in elementary education. I then graduated in 2015 with my master's in elementary and special education. I got hired after graduation to teach fourth-grade math and science in Gainesville.I LOVE teaching and working with kids every day. I like to create my own atmosphere in the classroom and make it like a family. I like to do lots of hands-on activities and make their learning relatable. Each day is a new challenge, but I love that I can make an impact on their lives every day.Definitely winning two national championships and two SEC titles as a team! College was the best time of my life. I had amazing coaches who always wanted to best for you in all parts of your life. I made friends for life and loved being with my teammates who understood what I was going through and always had my back.Representing the University of Florida and being able to wear the \"F\" on my chest. I am still proud to wear my Florida gear and be a part of the Gator community.I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and having someone to support me all the time. I also miss competing and the feeling of adrenaline with my teammates.I was so happy when my sister came to Florida. We trained our whole lives together, so when I came to Florida first, it felt like part of me was missing. She knows me better than anyone and was able to be there for me and push me and encourage me.I think the year after I graduated I was living vicariously through her. It was really hard to be up in the stands. I wanted to be down on the floor cheering her on. It was great to see her win another national championship and have her time to shine. I was also so nervous watching her.Being a part of a national championship team. As a junior, I was a member of the first-ever gymnastics team to win a national championship at Florida, so that was pretty special.Rhonda was a very calm and encouraging coach, which was very contagious. Every time we went to compete she told us we could do and you could feel that she believed in you and knew you could do it. That has stuck with me as I am now a teacher and I encourage my students and believe in them. Rhonda also knew our limits and knew how to get us where we needed to be. She cared about each of us as a person and was more than a coach to us.I plan to stay dedicated to teaching, as that is another passion of mine. I want to find a way to stay connected to the sport of gymnastics. I may want to try college coaching or judging to stay involved with the sport I love. I am currently coaching summer camps, and I love doing that.My time at Florida really was the best experience ever as I was surrounded by awesome girls and coaches. College gymnastics was the cherry on top for me.

I\u2019ve done a lot of homework on airplanes, and I\u2019ve had a lot of late-night study sessions \u2014 but I always get my work done.\u201d\n\nLast semester was particularly challenging for the aspiring special education teacher who helped lead the 2014 Gator gymnasts to their second straight national championship. While \u201cMacko,\u201d as her teammates called her, spent most of the fall semester teaching a fifth-grade class at Alachua Elementary School near Gainesville, she also attended four ProTeach classes and served as a student coach on the gymnastics team.\n\nShe also was a volunteer tutor for children with reading disabilities at a four-week summer camp last year, further demonstrating her resolve.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a teacher since I was 5 years old, so I\u2019ve been willing to do whatever it takes to get there,\u201d Caquatto said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m sacrificing anything because I love what I do.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-1 superstar from Naperville, Ill., expects to graduate with her M.Ed. degree in December and is thinking about ways to balance her considerable athletic talent with a teaching career.\n\n\u201cBeing a student coach has led me to think about coaching at the college level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think about coaching younger athletes. I love working with kids of all ages, whether it\u2019s 6-year-olds or 20-year-olds.\u201d\n\nCaquatto said she recently experienced the vicarious thrills that come with coaching when she witnessed her younger sister, Bridgette, a junior All-American gymnast for the Gators, score a 9.95 to share the uneven bars title during a season opening win against Ball State. Bridgette also won the floor exercise title for the first time in her career with a 9.925.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been supportive of each other all our lives, and sometimes it\u2019s tough to watch each other compete,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cSometimes we just have to look the other way or hide behind someone, but I managed to watch \u2018Bridgey\u2019 nail two of her routines against Ball State. I couldn\u2019t have been any happier for her.\u201d\n\nCall it balanced reciprocity, but the bar on the uneven bars already had been set for Bridgette, who witnessed Mackenzie score a perfect 10 in that event last season \u2013 something only six others Gators have done.\n\nMackenzie said her sister was in tears after seeing the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do the same thing when she gets a 10,\u201d big sister said.\n\nThe mutual support spills over into academics.\n\n\u201cI was always better at English and social studies, and Bridgey excelled in math and science,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been very disciplined when it comes to studying and academics, so she makes a great study buddy during midterms and finals.\u201d\n\nMackenzie also says that being in the ProTeach program has prepared her for the \u201creal life\u201d experiences she expects to encounter in her teaching career.\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I presented lessons in front of 20 children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking, but not because it was difficult or I was scared of the kids. I just wondered if they\u2019d understand.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a lesson is for all the students to understand the concept you\u2019re presenting, and you have to keep in mind the way each student learns and have a back-up plan if they don\u2019t understand. It feels like winning a competition when it works, but if it doesn\u2019t, well then it\u2019s kind of like going back to practice and fixing whatever went wrong and making it better.\n\n\u201cBut now that I\u2019ve got more experience creating lesson plans and using different teaching methods, I feel ready to handle my own classroom,\u201d Caquatto said with typical confidence. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m better prepared for becoming a winner in the classroom.\u201d\n\nChances are she\u2019ll score a perfect 10 there, too.\n\nContacts\n\nWriter: Stephen Kindland, College of Education Office of News and Communications; skindland@coe.ufl.edu; phone 352-273-3449."}, {"url": "https://floridagators.com/news/2010/10/17/18968.aspx", "page_content": "Incoming University of Florida freshman Mackenzie Caquatto competed as an all-around for the United State in Sunday's qualification round of the World Gymnastics Championships, held at the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Mackenzie who was born in Naperville, Illinois started her gymnastics career at Aerial Gymnastics Club. When Mackenzie, who also has a younger sister who was an Elite Gymnast, once told her mom during the 1996 Olympic Games that she one day would be an Elite with dreams of the Olympics, Mackenzie worked towards those goals everyday after that moment.\n\nWhile at Aerial Mackenzie was the 2007 JO National AA Champion, in 2007 Mackenzie would also compete in her first Elite competition the U.S. Classic held in Battle Creek, Michigan. Mackenzie then competed in the junior division at the 2007 Visa Championships finishing 16th in the AA. In 2008 the Olympic Year Mackenzie would become a Senior International Elite, which would now give her the opportunity to chase her Olympic Dream.\n\nIn the Olympic Year, Mackenzie competed at the U.S Classic finishing 1st on the Vault, 3rd on the Bars and 4th AA. This solid meet qualified her to the Visa Championships placing 10th in the AA securing her a spot on her first US National Team and a place at the U.S Olympic Team Trials. However, Mackenzie only competed in day 1 of the trials placing 12th in the AA on that specific day.\n\nIn 2009, Mackenzie began training along with her sister Bridgette at Naperville Gymnastics under two Chinese Olympians (Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li). Mackenzie had a breakout year in 2009 having successful competitions at the U.S Classic and the U.S Nationals placing 3rd on the Uneven Bars and 5th in the AA then 2nd\n\non the Vault, Uneven Bars, 8th on the Floor and 3rd in the AA respectively despite suffering a pretty serious knee injury in June of 2009. After a successful showing at the US Championships Mackenzie was named to the World Championship Selection camp. She would be named as an alternate to the 2009 World Team. Mackenzie was them selected to represent Team USA at a few international competitions. The Toyota International Competition in Japan (2nd on bars), the USA-Germany Friendly Exchange (1st team, 2nd uneven bars, 3rd AA & vault ), the USA-France Exchange (1st team, 2nd AA & Vault) and then the USA-Japan Friendship Meet (1st team, vault & 2nd AA).\n\nIn 2010 Mackenzie found herself at a new gym, her coaches Jiani Wu & Yuejiu Li opened their own training facility in Naperville called Legacy Elite. Mackenzie started off her season representing Team USA at the City of Jesolo Trophy meet in Italy, where she placed 1st with the Team & 7th AA. Macko also competed at the CoverGirl Classic placing 2nd on Vault, Bars and 3rd in the AA, thus qualifying herself to the 2010 Visa Championships. At Championships she was 4th on Bars, 7th on Beam and 5th AA. Her placing at Championships would qualify her again to the USA National Team and onto the World Championship Selection Camp. Having been an alternate last year to the World Championships, in 2010 Mackenzie would selected at a Worlds Team member, at the final selection camp she won the AA. Mackenzie traveled to Rotterdam, Netherlands as part of Team USA. In Rotterdam, Mackenzie competed in the AA placing 9th in the qualifications, unfortunately she did not advance to the finals because of the two per country ruling. However, she did compete in the team finals on Bars and Vault contributing scores for both to the team. The USA Team ended up finishing 2nd behind the Russians.\n\nAfter the World Championships Mackenzie, who had previously committed to the University of Florida on a full ride scholarship started her season with the Gators. In her freshman season Mackenzie faced some injuries, but still competed in the AA for her team at the NCAA Championships, however once the NCAA season was over Mackenzie decided to wanted to make an elite comeback, so she returned to Legacy Elite at competed two events at the 2011 CoverGirl Classic finishing 4th on the Uneven Bars. At the 2011 Visa Championships she\u2019s competed in the AA finishing 4th, she also placed 2nd on the Uneven Bars. Mackenzie earned herself a spot on her 4th US National Team and a spot at the Worlds Selection Camp. Unfortunately, while doing a dismount off the beam she injured both her ankles and had to withdraw from the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMackenzie returned to the University of Florida for her sophomore season, however she would only compete the Uneven Bars and eventually the balance beam. In 2012 the Gators placed 2nd as a Team at the NCAA Championships and Caquatto placed 6th on the Uneven Bars. In 2013, Mackenzie helped the Gators win their first NCAA National Championship in the schools history, she also placed 4th on the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam. In her final year as a Florida Gator Mackenzie once again helped lead her to their second NCAA Championship Team Title and placed 4th on the Uneven Bars.\n\nMackenzie had fought through injuries and adversity to find great success in her gymnastics career as an Elite & a Collegiate Student-Athlete. As a Florida Gator Mackenzie received many honors, as a Freshman she received SEC Freshman of the week honors, multiple event titles. As a sophomore she earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars, All SEC Second Team member and she was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In 2011 as a Junior Caquatto, earned All-America first-team honors at the NCAA Championships for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam, first-team All-American for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam in the first National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NACGC) All-America regular-season awards, she was also the fifth Gator Gymnast to score a perfect 10 on the Uneven Bars and first since 2009, she was named the SEC Specialist of the Week, she also shared team\u2019s Heart & Soul award and was again a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll and named to NACGC Scholastic All-America team.\n\nIn her final season she earned again first-team All-American honors for the Uneven Bars and Balance Beam at the NCAA Championships and the NACGC All-America regular-season awards. She also earned All-Southeastern Conference honors, she won 7 event titles throughout the season, she also was selected as a SEC Community Service team member, a recipient of $5,000 scholarship as a nominee for SEC Brad Davis Community Service award, was named co-Gator Heart & Soul Award recipient and received the \u201cCommunigator\u201d award at her team banquet. She was also a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the 4th year in a row.\n\nMackenzie graduated in 2014 with a bachelors degree in elementary education, she has wanted to become a teacher since she was very young. After graduation she would go onto her graduate degree from the University of Florida, in 2015 she graduated with her Masters in Elementary and Special education. Currently she is in the second year of of Florida\u2019s three-year ProTeach program. Mackenzie can be seen in the stands at Gator Gymnastics Meets cheering on her former team, but most importantly her younger sister who is also a Florida Gymnast.\n\nLike many Region 5 Athletes before her Mackenzie chased her Olympic Dream, she however was plagued by injuries, but she did work hard, persevere and did something super hard and special, competing in both NCAA & Elite at the same time, not many have achieved this feat. Mackenzie found success at the University of Florida, and on the world stage. Thank you Mackenzie for inspiring not only the Elite & Olympic Hopefuls of Region 5, but all gymnasts in general. I hope through your teaching that you continue to inspire and education young people for generations to come.\n\nHere are Mackenzie\u2019s routines from the 2008 Olympic Trials and 2010 World Championships:\n\n2010 Worlds Beam, 2010 Worlds Floor, 2010 Worlds Bars,\n\n2008 Olympic Trials Vault\n\n***Pictures provided by Google Search, Info & Bio provided by USA Gymnastics, Wikipedia, Gator Gymnastics and Videos from Youtube Gymcat67 & Gymnweb Account***"}, {"url": "https://floridagators.com/news/2011/8/29/485", "page_content": "To fully grasp what Gators sophomore gymnast Mackenzie Caquatto's schedule is going to be like the next several months, let's take a peek at her itinerary for just last week.\n\nIn an attempt to make the U.S. National Team, Caquatto competed in the Visa National Championships in St. Paul, Minn. Caquatto accomplished her goal, finishing fourth overall on the final day. Equally important, Caquatto earned an opportunity to make the U.S. team that will compete in the World Championships in Japan in October.\n\nThe next morning she packed her bags and drove seven hours with her family to their home outside Chicago. She was able to get a few hours sleep before the alarm went off. On Monday morning Caquatto woke up at 4 a.m. for an early-morning flight to Florida for the start of fall classes at UF.\n\nOn Tuesday she was back at the O'Connell Center with her teammates working out. Caquatto is headed out again in a few days to go to Houston for a training camp at the Karolyi Ranch, the national training center for USA Gymnastics.\n\nCaquatto and other members of the U.S. National Team will compete for a spot on the world team. The group meets in Houston once a month to work with Martha Karolyi, the team's coordinator since 2001, in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nThat's why Caquatto will keep such an insane schedule the next several months. And we haven't even mentioned she is planning to compete for the Gators once the NCAA season starts in January.\n\n\u201cSince I was little and watched the 1996 Olympics it's always been one of my goals,'' Caquatto said. \u201cBut it never really seemed a possible reality until last year. It's definitely something in the back of my mind, something that I want to do, but right now I'm just trying to take it one step at a time and see where it takes me.''\n\nIn elite-level gymnastics, it's rare a college athlete tries to earn a spot on the Olympic Team. The demands of class and training and practice and travel often seem like too much for most to even consider the challenge.\n\nNot Caquatto, who has already competed in international events in Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands during her career.\n\nGators coach Rhonda Faehn was an elite-level gymnast during her college career at UCLA and understands the difficult challenge Caquatto is undertaking. Caquatto is the only current member of the U.S. National Team competing in college.\n\n\u201cShe really has her mind set and we are going to do everything we can to help her achieve this goal,'' Faehn said. \u201cIt's very rare. There have been some athletes who have come back after college and have done it, but while trying to tackle a full [class] load and do this, it's very rare and extremely challenging.\n\n\u201cI really think she can stay disciplined and focused and give it a shot.''\n\nCaquatto has already surprised Faehn once this summer. After the Gators' season ended in April and classes concluded, Caquatto went home to Chicago and took time off to rest her injured ankle.\n\n\u201cIt was really in bad shape,'' Faehn said.\n\nIn June she started training heavily for the Visa Championships. Faehn traveled to Minnesota to watch the competition and was blown away by how much more confident Caquatto was in her routines compared to April when the ankle was hampering her at the NCAA Finals in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful to see what had transpired over the summer,'' Faehn said. \u201cShe really, really put the elite routines back together and had a very good performance at championships.''\n\nCaquatto's best routine in Minnesota was on bars, which is her top event. She didn't fare as well in the floor and vault, but with her ankle healed, she expects to improve in those events in Houston next week.\n\nCaquatto said her biggest task is sharpening the routines and slowly adding more difficult moves into them as she progresses.\n\n\u201cI feel at this stage that I'm at a good point in my training and competing,'' she said. \u201cWhen it comes to the Olympics, anything can happen. People get injured, stuff like that happens and so that's why you have to take it one step at a time. I feel like I'm in a good place in making this year's World Team, which is the first goal.\n\n\u201cIt's just a process of getting back in shape and getting my skills back after the injury. They have been coming back, but we just have to take it slowly so we don't injure my ankle.''\n\nInsane schedule and all, Caquatto is moving forward. When she isn't on campus, she'll take classes online and continue to practice with the Gators when she is in town.\n\nDespite the odds, her college coach isn't counting Caquatto out.\n\n\u201cShe has her mind made up. She is very set on doing everything she can to put it all out there,'' Faehn said. \u201cWe are really proud of her.''"}, {"url": "https://floridagators.com/news/2014/3/12/27575.aspx", "page_content": "University of Florida senior Mackenzie Caquatto is this year's Gator gymnastics representative for the Southeastern Conference Community Service Team, the league office announced Wednesday. The team is made up of one gymnast from each of the eight competing universities who gives back to her community through exemplary service efforts. Each of the 21 sports the league sponsors has its own Community Service Team.\n\nMackenzie Caquatto coaches a gymnast at the 2013 Harvest Food Drive. The event attracted 85 young gymnasts and also brought in more than 625 pounds of canned and non-perishable foods, which was donated to a Gainesville area food bank.\n\nOver her Gator career, Caquatto has totaled more than 210 hours of community service, including more than 100 hours since the beginning of the 2013-14 academic year. For the past three years, Caquatto \u2013 who hopes to pursue a career in education - has spent a large part of her time volunteering in various elementary schools around Gainesville. Starting in the fall of 2011, Caquatto has spent more than 130 hours working alongside the children of five different elementary schools. Caquatto has spent time in second grade classrooms and mentored students while helping them complete in-class assignments and homework. She has worked with at-risk students and after-school programs while guiding and helping the children remain on track by displaying the vital importance of school, self-motivation, and positive behavior.\n\nCaquatto has joined her teammates in events aimed to bring awareness to the fight against breast cancer. The Gators gymnastics team volunteered at events such as Gainesville's \u201cMaking Strides Against Breast Cancer Awareness Walk\u201d. Caquatto joined the Gator gymnastics team as they visited and shared stories with Hope Lodge residents each of the last three years. The Hope Lodge is a residence for cancer patients to stay while being treated at UF's Shands Hospital. She also was a counselor at the team's annual Harvest Food Drive, an event which collects food donations for area families.\n\n2014 Southeastern Conference\n\nGymnastics Community Service Team School Name Alabama Kim Jacob Arkansas Heather Elswick Auburn Megan Walker Florida Mackenzie Caquatto Georgia Cat Hires Kentucky Tiara Phipps LSU Kaleigh Dickson Missouri Mackenzie McGill\n\nNext up, the No. 3 Gators finish regular-season action Friday with a duel meet at Missouri.

The three U.S. National Team Members \u2013 Mackenzie Caquatto, Kytra Hunter and Alaina Johnson \u2013 bring a considerable amount of competitive experience from national and international levels. Liz Green and Brittney Noble have appeared on the Junior Olympic Level 10 National Teams with both picking up two J.O. national crowns.\n\n\u201cWe genuinely feel, with the combination of all of these exceptional athletes, that from top to bottom this is the strongest recruiting class we've ever had at the University of Florida,\u201d said UF Head Coach Rhonda Faehn. \u201cWe want to be in position to contend for the national title every year and this group will play a key part of that goal.\u201d\n\nBoth King and Green have applied for and have been accepted for admission to UF for the spring semester and will compete for the Gators in the 2010 season.\n\nMeet the New Gators\u2026\n\nMackenzie Caquatto \u2013 Naperville, Ill.\n\n2008-09 and 2009-10 U.S. National Team member\u2026 Senior International Elite competitor\u2026 2009 U.S. World Championship team alternate\u2026 2008 US Olympic Trial qualifier\u2026 third in uneven bars and fifth in all-around at 2009 Visa Championships\u2026 10th in 2008 Visa Championships' all-around\u2026 2007 Junior Olympic Junior C all-around champion\u2026 2008 U.S. Classic vault champion \u2013 also took third on bars and fourth in all-around\u2026 trains at the Naperville Gymnastics Club \u2026 coached by Jiani Wu and Yuejui Li\u2026 chose Florida over UCLA, Michigan, Alabama, Arkansas, LSU and Utah.\n\nCoach Faehn says\u2026\n\n\u201cMackenzie is the total overall package. She is a strong all-arounder and has no weaknesses. In the International Elite competitions, she is perhaps considered to be the best in bars and vault, but for the University of Florida and NCAA, she is going to be a contender for the all around title. Mackenzie is an amazing student with a very strong character. We felt instantly that she was very special and that she could definitely help lead this team to our continual goal of winning the national championship. She comes from a wonderful family and we welcome them to the Gator program.\u201d\n\nLiz Green \u2013 Coppell, Texas\n\n2009 Junior Olympics Senior A National Team selection\u2026 shared fourth in all-around and fourth in 2009 J.O.

Her strengths are balance beam and bars, but on floor she has beautiful dance combined with great tumbling, which is going to make our line-up even stronger. She brings the competitive experience from winning two JO National titles in a row. She's really solid under pressure situations, which we love. She has a bubbly personality and fit in instantly with the team. Liz is going to make an instant impact as well in the line-ups. She comes from an athletic family. Liz's older brother plays baseball for Texas so they are very familiar with NCAA competition. They are going to be a tremendous support system for Liz and for our program. We're thrilled because they fit in perfectly with the other signee families, which was really important as well to have that unity.\u201d\n\nKytra Hunter \u2013 Frederick, Md.\n\n2009-10 U.S. National Team member\u2026 Senior International Elite competitor\u2026 in 2009 Visa Championships competition, took third on floor exercise, fourth in all-around and shared eighth on balance beam\u2026 received first international assignment to compete on the 2009 European Tour and won floor at competition in Muelheim, Germany\u2026 2008 Junior Olympic Level 10 Senior A all-around, vault and floor exercise national champion\u2026 named to 2008 J.O. national team\u2026 first qualified as senior international elite in 2007\u2026 second in all-around and vault in 2006 J.O.

She will be very strong in the all-around, but her floor and vault should challenge immediately for NCAA titles. Kytra will definitely be a standout performer. Kytra is a great competitor and is very consistent. She's competed at the sport's highest level and knows how to perform under pressure situations. Kytra was a wonderful surprise during the recruiting process because we didn't think she had us in mind as a school. On her visit to our campus, she was very impressed and felt this is the school that had it all for her. Kytra wants to be a part of a class that can position Florida to consistently challenge for the national title. Kytra's family is absolutely wonderful. They feel very comfortable with Florida and really support our coaching staff and our program.\u201d\n\nAlaina Johnson \u2013 Tyler, Texas\n\n2008-09 and 2009-10 U.S. National Team member \u2026 eighth on uneven bars and ninth in all-around at 2009 Visa Championships\u2026 12th in all-around at 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials\u2026 ninth in 2008 U.S. Classic all-around\u2026 fourth on uneven bars at 2009 CoverGirl Classic\u2026 took 12th in 2008 Visa Championships' all-around\u2026 placed 18th in 2006 Visa Championships' all-around and 16th in 2007 meet\u2026 trains at Texas East Gymnastics under Martin and Stacy Parsley\u2026 considered many programs in the recruiting process, including Alabama, Georgia, Utah, Michigan, LSU and Oklahoma.\n\nCoach Faehn says\u2026\n\n\u201cAlaina is really strong in all four events, but she is known for her beautiful lines that are similar to (former Gator All-American) Corey Hartung's. She's a beautiful gymnast to watch, but at the same time she has a lot of power. The bars are considered her strongest event, but I really can't pick one event because she is great at all four. She did an amazing job this season on the elite scene by making the national team again. She has a wonderful personality with a very disciplined work ethic. We're absolutely thrilled she is going to be a Gator. She comes from another very strong family and they are looking forward to supporting this team in the seasons to come.\u201d\n\nMarissa King \u2013 London, England\n\n2008 Olympian for Great Britain, competing as an all-arounder\u2026 competed in vault and balance beam at 2009 World Championships held in London, England, in October\u2026 vault champion at the 2009 British Senior Championships \u2013 also took third in the meet's all-around, uneven bars and floor exercise competition\u2026 silver medalist at the 2008 Slovenian Grand Prix\u2026 placed fourth on the vault at the 2008 Glasgow Grand Prix and World Cup \u2026 2007 vault champion at the Glasgow Grand Prix \u2026 2007 vault champion in the apparatus finals of the Good Luck Beijing Event \u2026 vault finalist at the 2007 European Championships Amsterdam \u2026 2007 World Championships' team member, competing in vault and floor\u2026 trains at Huntingdon Olympic Gymnastic Club with coaches Adam Folwell and Aneta Desalermos.\n\nCoach Faehn says\u2026\n\n\u201cWe're really thrilled that Marissa has made the decision to join the Gator gymnastics team. She brings a great deal of international elite experience. She's an extremely tough competitor and we feel she's a perfect match with our team. She exudes so much enthusiasm and strength. She has the maturity and the competition experience at the highest levels, competing in the Olympic Games and the World Championships for Great Britain. Her biggest strengths are the vault, beam and floor.
