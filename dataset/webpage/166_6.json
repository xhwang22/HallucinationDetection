Those apple cheeks! Arms wide, head back, he radiates joy, even in antique black and white. That beautiful soprano flying high, talent and presence and just enough ham to sell it all. And it was a great story, too: Up from nothing! A shooting star! So when they found Frankie Lymon dead at the age of 25 one February morning in 1968, in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up, it was the end of something and the beginning of something, but no one was quite sure what.\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers were five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem. They sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam. They were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett while the kids were rehearsing in an apartment house. A few months later their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts. It was 1956. Overnight, Frankie Lymon was the hottest singer in America, off on a world tour. He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Their union lasted for a brief 18-month period.\n\nFrom here, the tide changed. Lymon was a heroin addict at 15 years old and despite his best efforts to straighten out, he relapsed. It didn\u2019t help when his mother died.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.

Frankie was the baby of the group, just 13 when they released their debut single, and his four bandmates were all aged 15 or 16.\n\nWith their of-the-moment sound mashing up doo-wop and rock 'n' roll to their racially integrated lineup (Frankie, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes were Black, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago were Puerto Rican), The Teenagers were groundbreaking.\n\nThey exploded on to the scene with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', which remained their biggest single, before the hits dried up all-too swiftly.\n\nFrankie Lymon left the group, but his solo career failed to launch. He had struggles in his personal life, and tragically died at the age of 25 after a drug overdose. Below, we mourn teen idol Frankie Lymon, while celebrating his life and legacy.\n\nWhen was Frankie Lymon born and how did he join the Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon was born to truck driver dad Howard and maid mum Jeanette on September 30, 1942 in Harlem, New York\n\nSinging was very much in Frankie's blood, as both his parents sang together in gospel group The Harlemaires.\n\nFrankie and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with Harlemaire Juniors, while Frankie worked as a grocery boy from the age of 10.\n\nWhen he was just 12 Frankie became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of local doo-wop group the Coupe De Villes, having first heard them at a school talent show.\n\nHe went on to join the group that became known as The Ermines, The Premiers and eventually The Teenagers.\n\nHow did Frankie Lymon end up fronting The Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers. Picture: Getty Images\n\nWith his stunning boy soprano voice, it seems obvious that Frankie Lymon would be the frontman (front-boy?) of The Teenagers, but it didn't start that way.\n\nAs said, it was Santiago who was leading the group when Lymon joined, but that all changed quickly.\n\nAfter impressing The Valentines singer Richard Barrett, The Teenagers got an audition with producer George Goldner. Santiago turned up late, Lymon stepped up and said he could take his place.\n\nFrom then on, the group was effectively Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon write 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love (Mastered HD)\n\n'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' was the debut single from The Teenagers, their signature song, and their biggest hit.\n\nIt topped the US R&B Chart, went to number 6 on the pop chart, and incredibly went all the way to number one in the UK singles chart, too.\n\nIt's endured to this day, and has also been covered by The Diamonds in 1956, the Beach Boys in 1964 and Diana Ross in 1981.\n\nAs for who wrote the classic song, it's a little bit complicated.\n\nHerman Santiago had written the basic song called 'Why Do Birds Sing So Gay?' for the audition with producer and Gee Records boss George Goldner, basing the words on some love letters given to the group by a tenant in bassist Sherman Garnes' apartment building.\n\nGoldner suggested some tweaks to the lyrics, while Frankie improvised and tweaked the melody.\n\nSo on the first pressings, the song was attributed to Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago, and George Goldner.\n\nAfter a while, Santiago's name was mysteriously dropped from the label. Then, after Goldner was bought out by Morris Levy his name was swapped in for the producers.\n\nA lengthy court battle saw Santiago and Jimmy Merchant being given songwriting credit in 1992, but further legal issues meant that this was overturned four years later.\n\nWhat happened to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers after 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - I'm not a Juvenile Delinquent (1956) - HD\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers are best known for their stunning number one single, but they were far from one hit wonders.\n\nBefore 1956 was out they had a string of charting singles: 'I Want You to Be My Girl', 'I Promise to Remember' and 'The ABC's of Love' were all top ten R&B hits and all reached the pop Top 100 too.\n\nIn the UK, 'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent' went to number 12. Even into 1957, 'Out in the Cold Again' reached number 10 in the R&B charts.\n\nBy then though, the Teenagers were beginning to fall apart,\n\nWhen did Frankie Lymon leave The Teenagers and what happened to his solo career?\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Goody Goody\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nAs is so often the case when one of a group has the main billing, there was pressure to push Frankie Lymon into a solo career.\n\nGoldner especially was advocating for a solo Frankie, giving the lead singer solo spots during their live show at the London Palladium and having him sing to pre-recorded backing tapes.\n\nIn fact, while it was credited to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the group's last official single 'Goody Goody' (with 'Creation of Love' on the flip) was effectively a solo Frankie single with session singers.\n\nFrankie formally left the band in September 1957, and the planned Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium LP was released as the solo Frankie Lymon \u2013 At The London Palladium.\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Little Bitty Pretty One\"\n\nSadly, Frankie failed to capture the magic and success of the Teenagers as a solo star.\n\nHis move to Roulette Records may not have helped, nor would an apparently \"scandalous\" incident when he danced with a white girl during his performance on Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat on July 19, 1957, prompting protests from racist Southern TV station owners\n\nAlong with his personal troubles, the incident caused his career to stall. As the years continued he had brief record deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records, but he failed to have a chart hit.\n\nHe even reunited with the Teenagers in 1965, but without success.\n\nWhat happened to The Teenagers after Lymon's departure?\n\nTeenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nAs well as Lymon's career failing to take off after he left the group, The Teenagers never really successfully replaced him.\n\nThe first replacement was Billy Lobrano, the first white member of the group. Meanwhile Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni died in the late 1970s and were replaced by Bobby Jay and Frankie's brother Lewis Lymon.\n\nIn the 1980s the group experimented with female singers, including Pearl McKinnon and Roz Morehead, before Jimmy Castor and then Timothy Wilson took lead.\n\nCurrently touring as Frankie Lymon's Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers, the group still plays today with the current lineup being Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward.\n\nWas Frankie Lymon married?\n\nFrankie Lymon and DJ Murray The K Kauffman. Picture: Getty Images\n\nFrankie Lymon's personal life was complicated to say the least.\n\nHe married his first wife Elizabeth Mickey Waters in January 1964. Technically though, this marriage was never legal because she was still married to her previous husband.\n\nThey had a daughter together \u2013 Frankie's only child \u2013 but Francine tragically died just two days after being born.\n\nAfter his first \"marriage\" failed, Frankie is then said to have wed The Platters singer Zola Taylor in Mexico in 1965. To this day, no-one has found any documentation of the wedding though, and it's been claimed that the whole story was a joke or publicity stunt.\n\nThe Platters - He's Mine (1957)\n\nLymon's third and final wedding came to schoolteacher Emira Eagle. The couple married in June 1967, but it's worth noting that Frankie hadn't actually divorced either of his two wives before.\n\nThe complex swirl of legal and illegal weddings that may or may not have happened caused issues long after Lymon's death, when Diana Ross's successful cover of 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' sparked a scramble for Frankie's royalties.\n\nHow and when did Frankie Lymon die?\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers - I Promise To Remember (1983)\n\nFrankie Lymon told Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had been introduced to heroin a woman twice his age when he was just 15, and he swiftly became addicted.\n\n\"I looked twice my age,\" Lymon said. \"I was thin as a shadow and I didn't give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.\n\n\"You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he's gambling with death and, yet, he's got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike.\"\n\nHis deepening dependency surely affected his performing and recording career, though he entered rehab in 1961 and attempted a comeback.\n\nLymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue and recorded some singles, but nothing really took off.\n\nBy 1966 he was in trouble again, being arrested on a heroin charge. Instead of going to jail, he was drafted in the US army, but after going AWOL he was discharged.\n\nFrankie Lyman - I'm Sorry - (Big Apple)\n\nThe army did the trick though, briefly. Lymon is said to have remained drug-free for two full years after being drafted.\n\nIn 1968 though, he was told a major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates. He had a recording session booked.

Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.\n\nThe Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://www.arkbh.com/celebrity-deaths/musicians/frankie-lymon/", "page_content": "Franklin Joseph Lymon was an African-American rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, doo-wop, and R&B soprano singer and songwriter.

At a young age, he became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of the Coupe De Villes, a local doo-wop group.\n\nLater, they would go on to form the band The Ermines and The Premiers. However, Lymon\u2019s career was forever changed when The Teenagers was formed.\n\nThe Teenagers\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers consisted of himself, Jimmy Merchant, Joe Negroni, Herman Santiago, and Sherman Garnes.\n\nCalling themselves The Teenagers, the group of talented teens auditioned for George Goldner, the record producer of Gee Records at the time. The Teenagers\u2019 first single was titled \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love,\u201d which became their first hit in 1956.\n\nIn addition to this popular song, there are a number of other hits from The Teenagers which include:\n\n\u201cGoody Goody\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Not A Juvenile Delinquent\u201d\n\n\u201cI Want You To Be My Girl\u201d\n\n\u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s Of Love\u201d\n\nSolo Career\n\nAfter a successful string of hit songs, Lymon began a solo career, at the pressure of the record producer. Lymon performed at the London Palladium for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAlthough still managing to have work, Lymon\u2019s success wasn\u2019t as much of a hit as his previous work with The Teenagers. Lymon experienced discrimination when he danced with a white woman on a the live ABC broadcast \u201cThe Big Beast.\u201d\n\nNot only was the television show canceled, at the time those living in the South objected to the content on their television sets.\n\nLymon then moved to Roulette Records later and accomplished a solo hit of a cover of Bobby Day\u2019s \u201cLittle Bitty Pretty One.\u201d\n\nFrankie Lymon\u2019s History Of Heroin Addiction\n\nDuring the 1960s, Lymon began to struggle with drug use. It\u2019s reported that Lymon suffered from heroin addiction since the age of 15.\n\nTo avoid a jail sentence due to a heroin charge in 1966, Lymon chose to join the Army. That same year, Lymon met his first wife, school teacher Emira Eagle in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nAlthough struggling with drug abuse throughout his life, Lymon was later signed by Big Apple label days before his death.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon Attend Addiction Treatment?\n\nDuring his time in the Army, Lymon did not participate in drug abuse. For two years, Lymon\u2019s drug use did not exist. It wasn\u2019t until receiving a promotion in the Army that Lymon decided to return to heroin as a form of indulgence or celebration.\n\nRecovery Is Possible\n\nAlthough Frankie Lymon tragically succumbed to his heroin addiction, recovery is possible with a variety of tools and treatment services.\n\nFor information on how we treat heroin addiction with multiple resources, including medication-assisted treatment, behavioral therapy, and ongoing support, please contact Ark Behavioral health today."}, {"url": "https://rockandrollroadmap.com/places/death-sites/north-east-u-s-death-sites/where-frankie-lymon-died-of-a-heroin-overdose/", "page_content": "Please Do Not Disturb Current Occupants\n\nFranklin Joseph Lymon, known professionally as Frankie Lymon, was a rock \u2018n roll/rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, best known as the soprano lead singer of the New York City based rock \u2018n roll group The Teenagers.\n\nThe Teenagers\u2019 first and biggest single was 1956\u2019s \u201c Why Do Fools Fall in Love .\u201d with Frankie singing lead.

Frankie was 13 years old and undeniably a talent - energy, innocence and falsetto combining for hit records, appearances on the Ed Sullivan show and a date at the London Palladium. Fame left, however, almost as quickly as it came. Frankie Lymon died of a drug overdose in 1968, age 26. His career is recalled in ''I Promise to Remember: The Story of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers'' on Channel 13 at 11 tomorrow night.\n\nThe program, part of public television's ''In Matters of Life and Death'' series, doesn't so much explain what happened to Frankie Lymon as it does reprise his career. He and the other Teenagers came out of Stitt Junior High School on Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem. They rehearsed on street corners. They wrote their biggest hit, ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' on the stoop of an apartment house. One surviving member of the group says it never paid them a dime.\n\n''By the time it came to make some money, their place in the sun was gone,'' a disk jockey says in an interview. Someone else says, ''Drugs were everywhere in the 50's - off stage, on stage. Drugs made Frankie a no-no.''\n\n''By the time he was 17,'' a former manager says, ''no one wanted a part of him.'' There is a film clip of Frankie Lymon making a brief comeback on the old Dick Clark Show. He is singing ''Why do Fools Fall in Love?'' but he is lip-syncing. The curious thing is that his voice may have gone, but he is still making his old moves. There is as much charm as ever. Frankie Lymon was one of the first black pop singers to cross the color line, and he was one of the first in the sad litany of entertainers, white or black, who died of drugs.

Drugs have always been a part of celebrity culture. Actors, singers, politicians, even social media influencers have all abused drugs, which has led to the deaths of some of our favorite celebrities. Imagine being poor, then one day you wake up with access to millions of dollars.\n\nYour fame and fortune can get you whatever you want, including drugs. For many Americans, a drug habit can set you back financially, but not celebrities. They have access to substances the average person can\u2019t get their hands on. Many entertainers feel the only way to escape is to numb their world by heavy drug use, which, many times, can lead to drug overdoses. Highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine have been drugs of choice by celebrities for decades. They also happen to be the most lethal.\n\nMORE: Why Are People Lacing Cocaine With Fentanyl And How Dangerous Is It?\n\nCocaine, which is also known as the \u201cparty drug\u201d is especially very popular among entertainers. Although not as lethal as the opioids, it is extremely addictive. Since it can be mixed with an opioid like fentanyl and go undetected, some celebrities have been unintentionally taking the opioid and overdosing by accident.\n\nComedian Fuquan Johnson was one of two people who overdosed on cocaine laced with fentanyl at a party in Los Angeles on Sept. 2. A third person survived the overdose. Johnson\u2019s recent death has sparked widespread concern in the broader entertainment industry that more celebrities could be at risk of the same fate because so many of them use cocaine from possibly the same source.\n\nOn top of that, actor Michael K. Williams was found dead in his Brooklyn penthouse on Sept. 6 from an apparent heroin overdose. Although an autopsy was not immediately performed, authorities reported that there was evidence Williams overdosed on heroin.\n\nEven though Williams\u2019 admitted fight with drug addiction is well documented, his death still caught people by surprise. Coupled with the death of Johnson in Los Angeles, the entertainment community was shocked and many folks were left asking questions that were going unanswered.\n\nTo be sure, drug overdoses aren\u2019t a new phenomenon to entertainers. Michael Jackson and Prince both overdosed on opioids, but they are far from the only ones who died in that or a similar manner.\n\nKeep reading to find a running list (that we, hopefully, won\u2019t need to update too often) of notable Black people who died following drug overdoses."}, {"url": "https://rockandrollparadise.com/frankie-lymon-21968/", "page_content": "February 27, 1968 \u2013 Frankie Lymon was born Franklin Joseph \u201cFrankie\u201d Lymon on September 30, 1942.\n\nFrankie Lymon was born in Harlem to a truck driver father and a mother who worked as a maid. Lymon\u2019s mother and father, Howard and Jeanette Lymon, also sang in a gospel group known as the Harlemaires; Frankie Lymon and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with the Harlemaire Juniors (a fourth Lymon brother, Timmy, was a singer, though not with the Harlemaire Juniors). The Lymon family struggled to make ends meet, and Lymon began working as a grocery boy at the age of 10.\n\nAt the age of 12 in 1954, Lymon heard a local doo-wop group known as the Coupe De Villes at a school talent show. He became friends with the lead singer, Herman Santiago, and he eventually became a member of the group, now calling itself both The Ermines and The Premiers. Dennis Jackson of Columbus, Georgia, was one of the main influences in Lymon\u2019s life. His personal donation of $500 helped start Lymon\u2019s career.\n\nOne day in 1955, a neighbor gave The Premiers several love letters that had been written to him by his girlfriend, with the hopes that he could give the boys inspiration to write their own songs.\n\nMerchant and Santiago adapted one of the letters into a song called \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d. The Premiers, now calling itself The Teenagers, got its first shot at fame after impressing Richard Barrett, a singer with The Valentines. Barrett, in turn, got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner. On the day of the group\u2019s audition, Santiago, the original lead singer, was late. Lymon stepped up and told Goldner that he knew the part because he helped write the song. The disc jockeys always called them \u201cFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers\u201d.\n\nThe group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of the Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes, and two Puerto Rican members, Herman Santiago and Joe Negroni.\n\n\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love?\u201d was released as a record by The Teenagers featuring Frankie Lymon. It made the top ten in the USA and it reached No.1 in the UK. The group appeared in the movies \u201cRock, Rock, Rock\u201d and \u201cMister Rock and Roll\u201d, and had 2 more hits with \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d and \u201cThe ABCs of Love\u201d.\n\nBut by 1957, the group was being billed as \u201cFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers\u201d. This caused in-fighting, and by September, Goldner had pulled Frankie out of the group to record solo. He released some songs of his own including the top twenty song Goody, Goody and eventually he signed with Roulette Records.\n\nBy the 60\u2019s Frankie had a serious drug problem. In 1961 he was forced into a drug rehabilitation program at Manhattan General Hospital. He attempted a comeback, but sadly could not kick his addiction and was convicted on a narcotics charge in 1964. The group was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and a film based on the life of Frankie Lymon titled Why Do Fools Fall In Love? was released in 1998.\n\nHe was found dead from a drug overdose on the bathroom floor of his grandmother\u2019s apartment on 27 February 1968. He was 25 years old.\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://howafrica.com/the-tragic-tale-of-teen-idol-frankie-lymon-who-died-from-heroin-overdose/", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon was America\u2019s first black teenage pop starbut by 1968, aged a mere 25 years, he was found dead from a heroin overdose in the same apartment building where he\u2019d grown up. Lymon\u2019s fate is tragic in that he was ill equipped to manage the fame that found him.\n\nLymon and the Teenagers, five kids from Washington Heights, just north of Harlem sang doo-wop under the streetlight on the corner of 165th and Amsterdam were discovered by the Valentines\u2019 lead singer Richie Barrett. Months later in 1956, their first record, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d made it to the top of the national charts.\n\nThe Teenagers comprised three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago.\n\nAt 13, Frankie Lymon became the hottest singer in America overnight with a world tour to boot. Lymon by that feat was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. His voice and style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants.\n\nThere\u2019s even talk Berry Gordy may have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nInterestingly just a few days before Frankie and his friends recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nThe 1950s American postwar economy was booming and music was part of that. Lymon told Ebony \u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away.\u201d\n\nBut that friendship will take a hit when Lymon and his record producers agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so the Teenagers were ditched. They landed another hit in \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d earlier done by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald. When Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. Their union lasted for a brief 18-month period.\n\nFrom here, the tide changed. Lymon was a heroin addict at 15 years old and despite his best efforts to straighten out, he relapsed. It didn\u2019t help when his mother died.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nIn 1966, fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor. He was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery but for years, Lymon\u2019s grave was unmarked until Emira Eagle, his third wife had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nFame has its gifts and young as Lymon was, he had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork about who was entitled to songwriting royalties from his best sellers. None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.\n\nIt was also said that to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother except keen observers noted different women emerged as mothers in various cities. He sang for Queen Elizabeth II at the London Palladium and performed in nightclubs and theaters worldwide. Lymon also served as an Army private at Fort Gordon.\n\nFrankie Lymon who could sing like an angel but was a troubled soul influenced Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Len Barry and Michael Jackson as well as a host of other singers."}, {"url": "https://www.arkbh.com/celebrity-deaths/musicians/", "page_content": "Over the years, numerous musicians have struggled with drug use.

He was 13 years old.\n\nThat made him the first black teenage pop star, a gap-toothed, baby-faced, angel-voiced paragon of show business ambition, and a camera-ready avatar of America\u2019s new postwar youth movement. He was a founding father of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll even before his voice had changed. That voice and that style influenced two generations of rock, soul and R&B giants. You heard his echoes everywhere. The high, clear countertenor, like something out of Renaissance church music, found its way from the Temptations to the Beach Boys to Earth, Wind & Fire. Even Diana Ross charted a cover of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d 25 years after its release. Berry Gordy may not have modeled the Jackson 5 on Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, as is often said, but it sure sounded as if he had.\n\nThat\u2019s the legend, anyway. Truth is, Frankie Lymon grew up too fast in every way imaginable. \u201cI never was a child, although I was billed in every theater and auditorium where I appeared as a child star,\u201d Lymon told Art Peters, a reporter for Ebony magazine, in 1967. \u201cI was a man when I was 11 years old, doing everything that most men do. In the neighborhood where I lived, there was no time to be a child. There were five children in my family and my folks had to scuffle to make ends meet. My father was a truck driver and my mother worked as a domestic in white folks\u2019 homes. While kids my age were playing stickball and marbles, I was working in the corner grocery store carrying orders to help pay the rent.\u201d\n\nA few days before Frankie and his friends from the corner recorded the song that made them famous, Rosa Parks was pulled off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Less than two years later, Frankie danced with a white girl on a national television show, and the show was swiftly canceled. Another part of the legend.\n\nRace integration in pop music was never going to be simple.\n\n**********\n\nAmerica in the 1950s: postwar economy roaring, a chicken in every pot and two cars in every garage of the split-level house in Levittown, every clich\u00e9 of union-made American middle-class prosperity held to be self-evident.\n\nAnd music was a big part of that. Raucous and brawny, electrified, it felt like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all fell from the sky at once. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, with their tight, upbeat harmony, were an important part of it, too. You can trace doo-wop back to the Psalms, hear it bubble up in the a cappella harmonies of Gregorian chant, or, by way of Africa and the Caribbean, from gospel quartets.\n\nIn America, beginning in the 1930s, the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots were the popularizers of those intricate harmonies we recognize today as proto-rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Doo-wop was among the inheritors, a thousand street-corner groups and a thousand one-hit wonders. The Spaniels and the Five Satins and the Vocaleers, the Drifters and the Fleetwoods and the Moonglows, the Coasters and the Platters and on to Frankie Valli and modernity. In the 1950s, every high school stairwell in this country was loud with four-part singing. Even today the \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d movie franchise owes its popularity to an a cappella tradition stretching back into pre-electric history.\n\n\u201cWe harmonized every night on the street corner until the neighbors would call the cops to run us away,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. But Frankie wasn\u2019t doo-wop, not really. Doo-wop was group music. \u201cFrankie Lymon was always different than that,\u201d Robert Christgau, great-granddaddy of American rock critics and historians, will tell you. \u201cHe was the star.\u201d\n\nFrankie and his record producers and managers soon agreed he\u2019d be a more profitable solo act, so off he went, leaving behind the Teenagers, and with them friendship and loyalty. He had another, lesser, hit\u2014a recording of \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d sung by Bob Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald before him\u2014before things cooled.\n\nThen came the long, slow slide.\n\nAsk any junkie and they\u2019ll tell what they\u2019re chasing is the feeling they got the first time they got high. But that first-time rush can never be recaptured, whether you\u2019re talking about heroin or cigarettes or hit records.\n\nFrankie was a heroin addict at 15 years old. He tried to kick, tried again and again and got straight for a while. Then his mother died, and he fell hard.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. Heroin was everywhere in New York by then, and methadone clinics run by the city were springing up in neighborhoods all over town. The failure rate was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cI looked twice my age,\u201d Lymon told Ebony. \u201cI was thin as a shadow and I didn\u2019t give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief. You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he\u2019s gambling with death and, yet, he\u2019s got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike. There\u2019s always the danger that some peddler will sell him a poisoned batch\u2014some garbage.\u201d Here young Frankie knocks on wood. \u201cI was lucky. God must have been watching over me.\u201d\n\nEven now you want to believe him.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie\u2019s neighborhood, just up the bluffs from the long-gone Polo Grounds, feels mostly unchanged even 50 years later. It was poorer then, sure, like the rest of New York City, and in the age before earbuds and headphones it was surely louder. You heard music in the streets.\n\nOutside Frankie\u2019s old address, on West 165th, there\u2019s a \u201cWet Paint\u201d sign on the door this bright autumn morning, and one building over a crew is painting the ancient fire escapes. The whole block smells of solvent, sharp and clean. It\u2019s a well-kept street of five- and six-story apartment houses in a tidy neighborhood of working-class folks who greet each other on the sidewalk, black and white and brown, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and Great Migration African-Americans and, like the rest of New York, folks from all over.\n\nYoung as he was, Lymon had three wives. He married them in quick succession, and there was plenty of confusion about the paperwork. He may have been married to more than one at a time, or not entirely married to one of the three at all. One of them may have still been married to someone else. Depends whom you ask. (In the 1980s, they all met in court, to settle Lymon\u2019s estate, such as it was, to find out who was entitled to songwriting royalties from best sellers like \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d None got much, but the third wife, Emira Eagle, received an undisclosed settlement from record producers.)\n\nIn 1966, there was a brief glimmer of hope. Fresh out of rehab at Manhattan General Hospital, Lymon appeared at a block party organized by a group of nuns at a Catholic settlement house in the Bronx. He told an audience of 2,000 teenagers, \u201cI have been born again. I\u2019m not ashamed to let the public know I took the cure. Maybe my story will keep some other kid from going wrong.\u201d\n\nOn February 27, 1968, he was booked for a recording session to mark the start of a comeback. Instead, he was found dead that morning on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor.\n\n**********\n\nFrankie Lymon was buried in the Bronx, at St. Raymond\u2019s Cemetery: Row 13, Grave 70. It\u2019s 15 minutes by car from the old neighborhood. His headstone is over by the highway. The grass is green and the ground is hard and uneven and on the left his stone is packed tight with the others. On the right there\u2019s a gap like a missing tooth. You can see the towers of two bridges from here, the Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and hear the traffic rush past on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Billie Holiday is buried here, and Typhoid Mary. This is where the Lindbergh ransom exchange happened. The wind comes hard off Eastchester Bay and shakes the pagoda trees.\n\nFor years Frankie\u2019s grave was unmarked. In the mid-1980s, a New Jersey music store held a benefit to raise money for a memorial, but it never made it to the cemetery. The headstone gathered dust in the record shop, then moved at last to the backyard of a friend of the owner.\n\nEmira Eagle had the current headstone installed sometime in the late 1990s.In Loving Memory\n\nOf My Husband Frank J. Lymon Sept. 30, 1942 \u2013 Feb. 27, 1968\n\nNot much room to tell his story. And what could anyone say? That the 1950s were long over? That innocence was dead? That by 1968 one America had vanished entirely, and another had taken its place?\n\nOr maybe that Frankie Lymon\u2019s America, doo-wop America, was never simple, never sweet, but was rather an America as complex and wracked by animus and desire as any in history. It was the same America that killed Emmett Till, after all, another angel-faced kid with apple cheeks and a wide, bright smile.\n\nSeen across the gulf of years, what we now think of as the anodyne, antiseptic 1950s America is revealed as an illusion. June Cleaver vacuuming in an organdy cocktail dress and pearls is a television mirage, a national hallucination. We had the postwar world economy to ourselves because so many other industrial nations had been bombed flat. And for every Pat Boone there was a \u201cHowl,\u201d an Allen Ginsberg, a Kerouac, a Coltrane, a Krassner, a Ferlinghetti. There were underground explosions in painting and poetry and music and prose. It was a kind of invisible revolution.\n\nA telling detail of that chaste 1950s mythology: to preserve his image as a clean-cut teenager, Frankie Lymon would pass off the women he dated in different cities as his mother. It gets told and told and told\u2014in fact, he told it himself\u2014that he once got caught by a reporter who went to shows in New York and Chicago and saw that his \u201cmom\u201d was two different women, each twice Frankie\u2019s age. A story too good to fact-check.\n\nIt was in these 1950s that Ralph Ellison wrote Invisible Man, and James Baldwin published Notes of a Native Son. After Rosa Parks was pulled off that bus, Dr. King led the Montgomery bus boycott and changed the trajectory of civil rights in America. The Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, and then came Little Rock and the lunch counter sit-ins at Wichita and Oklahoma City. What you saw of the \u201950s in America was all about where you stood. And with whom.\n\nWas the short, blinding arc of Frankie Lymon\u2019s career a morality play? A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cautionary tale? Or just another story of a young man gone too soon?\n\nMaybe it was a reminder that America changes in every instant and never changes at all. Our streets have always been filled with music and temptation; addiction has always been with us, long before \u201cus\u201d was even America, from the Lotus Eaters of The Odyssey to the opium dens of the Wild West to the crack epidemic and on to our own new opioid crisis.\n\nLooking at that headstone, you get to thinking maybe Frankie Lymon was the 1950s, man and myth, the junkie with an angel\u2019s voice, and that the stone stands as a monument to the lies we tell ourselves about America in the time before Frankie flew away.\n\nThe very night Lymon died Walter Cronkite went on the air and said of Vietnam, \u201cWe are mired in a stalemate.\u201d It was clear the center couldn\u2019t hold, and if you felt like the 1950s were five polite young men in matching letter sweaters, the rest of 1968 came at you like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The world lurched and suddenly spun too fast. Tet. My Lai. Chicago. Washington. Baltimore. Riots everywhere. Vietnam the pulse and drumbeat behind and beneath everything.\n\nSo when Frankie Lymon died that February morning you\u2019d have been forgiven for missing it. He was nearly forgotten by then, a five-paragraph item on page 50 of the New York Times, a casualty of the moment the future and the past came apart.\n\nIt was sad, but for a while, arms wide and head back, Frankie Lymon had bridged and bound all those opposing energies. That face! That voice!\n\nMan, he could sing like an angel.\n\nGet the latest History stories in your inbox?

Stitt Junior High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan (New York City, New York) by second tenor Jimmy Merchant and bass Sherman Garnes. They initially called themselves the Earth Angels. Eventually they added lead singer, Herman Santiago, and baritone, John Seda, to their lineup and evolved into The Coupe De Villes. By the end of 1954, Frankie Lymon joined the band and they changed their name to Ermines and later The Premiers.\n\nLymon was born in New York City on December 30, 1942. When he was 12 years old and working in a grocery store, he met The Premiers. Lymon, who was was already singing gospel music in his father\u2019s church, transitioned to secular music after meeting The Premiers.\n\nAfter joining the group Lymon helped lead singer Herman Santiago rewrite what would become their most popular song, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love.\u201d The song got the group an audition with Gee Records in 1955. On the day of the audition Santiago fell ill and was unable to sing. Lymon replaced him. After hearing Lymon sing, Gee Records agreed to sign the band as The Teenagers with Lymon as the lead singer.\n\nReleased in 1956, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d quickly became the number one R&B song in the United States and the number one pop hit in Great Britain. Music critics credit the song\u2019s success as the likely result of Lymon\u2019s agile, ingenuous, and utterly charming performance. The song remains one of the key records by which the doo-wop style is defined and remembered. Moreover, its success in an era of racial segregation allowed Lymon to become the first black teenage pop star.\n\nThe group went on to star in Alan Freed\u2019s package shows and movies and later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand. By the end of 1956, after touring through all of the United States and in Great Britain, the group was arguably the most popular band in the nation.\n\nIn 1956 and 1957 the Teenagers released five more singles which reached the Billboard R&B top ten list, and three of these songs \u2014\u201dI Want You to Be My Girl,\u201d \u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d and \u201cThe ABC\u2019s of Love\u201d\u2014 all reached the U.S. pop charts as well. As the band toured in 1957 Lymon left the group and began to record solo singles produced by Roulette Records.\n\nLymon continued to make records, as did the Teenagers but neither his solo career nor the Teenagers\u2019 career ever matched their early success in 1956. On February 27, 1968, Frankie Lymon was found dead of a heroin overdose in his grandmother\u2019s New York City apartment bathroom floor. He was only 25 years old. \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d and \u201cSeabreeze,\u201d the two songs Lymon had recorded for Big Apple Records before his death, were released later in 1968.\n\nIn 1993 Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Frankie was the baby of the group, just 13 when they released their debut single, and his four bandmates were all aged 15 or 16.\n\nWith their of-the-moment sound mashing up doo-wop and rock 'n' roll to their racially integrated lineup (Frankie, Jimmy Merchant and Sherman Garnes were Black, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago were Puerto Rican), The Teenagers were groundbreaking.\n\nThey exploded on to the scene with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', which remained their biggest single, before the hits dried up all-too swiftly.\n\nFrankie Lymon left the group, but his solo career failed to launch. He had struggles in his personal life, and tragically died at the age of 25 after a drug overdose. Below, we mourn teen idol Frankie Lymon, while celebrating his life and legacy.\n\nWhen was Frankie Lymon born and how did he join the Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon was born to truck driver dad Howard and maid mum Jeanette on September 30, 1942 in Harlem, New York\n\nSinging was very much in Frankie's blood, as both his parents sang together in gospel group The Harlemaires.\n\nFrankie and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with Harlemaire Juniors, while Frankie worked as a grocery boy from the age of 10.\n\nWhen he was just 12 Frankie became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of local doo-wop group the Coupe De Villes, having first heard them at a school talent show.\n\nHe went on to join the group that became known as The Ermines, The Premiers and eventually The Teenagers.\n\nHow did Frankie Lymon end up fronting The Teenagers?\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers. Picture: Getty Images\n\nWith his stunning boy soprano voice, it seems obvious that Frankie Lymon would be the frontman (front-boy?) of The Teenagers, but it didn't start that way.\n\nAs said, it was Santiago who was leading the group when Lymon joined, but that all changed quickly.\n\nAfter impressing The Valentines singer Richard Barrett, The Teenagers got an audition with producer George Goldner.

Then, after Goldner was bought out by Morris Levy his name was swapped in for the producers.\n\nA lengthy court battle saw Santiago and Jimmy Merchant being given songwriting credit in 1992, but further legal issues meant that this was overturned four years later.\n\nWhat happened to Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers after 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'?\n\nFrankie Lymon & The Teenagers - I'm not a Juvenile Delinquent (1956) - HD\n\nFrankie Lymon and The Teenagers are best known for their stunning number one single, but they were far from one hit wonders.\n\nBefore 1956 was out they had a string of charting singles: 'I Want You to Be My Girl', 'I Promise to Remember' and 'The ABC's of Love' were all top ten R&B hits and all reached the pop Top 100 too.\n\nIn the UK, 'I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent' went to number 12. Even into 1957, 'Out in the Cold Again' reached number 10 in the R&B charts.\n\nBy then though, the Teenagers were beginning to fall apart,\n\nWhen did Frankie Lymon leave The Teenagers and what happened to his solo career?\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Goody Goody\" on The Ed Sullivan Show\n\nAs is so often the case when one of a group has the main billing, there was pressure to push Frankie Lymon into a solo career.\n\nGoldner especially was advocating for a solo Frankie, giving the lead singer solo spots during their live show at the London Palladium and having him sing to pre-recorded backing tapes.\n\nIn fact, while it was credited to Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the group's last official single 'Goody Goody' (with 'Creation of Love' on the flip) was effectively a solo Frankie single with session singers.\n\nFrankie formally left the band in September 1957, and the planned Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium LP was released as the solo Frankie Lymon \u2013 At The London Palladium.\n\nFrankie Lymon \"Little Bitty Pretty One\"\n\nSadly, Frankie failed to capture the magic and success of the Teenagers as a solo star.\n\nHis move to Roulette Records may not have helped, nor would an apparently \"scandalous\" incident when he danced with a white girl during his performance on Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat on July 19, 1957, prompting protests from racist Southern TV station owners\n\nAlong with his personal troubles, the incident caused his career to stall. As the years continued he had brief record deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records, but he failed to have a chart hit.\n\nHe even reunited with the Teenagers in 1965, but without success.\n\nWhat happened to The Teenagers after Lymon's departure?\n\nTeenagers - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nAs well as Lymon's career failing to take off after he left the group, The Teenagers never really successfully replaced him.\n\nThe first replacement was Billy Lobrano, the first white member of the group. Meanwhile Sherman Garnes and Joe Negroni died in the late 1970s and were replaced by Bobby Jay and Frankie's brother Lewis Lymon.\n\nIn the 1980s the group experimented with female singers, including Pearl McKinnon and Roz Morehead, before Jimmy Castor and then Timothy Wilson took lead.\n\nCurrently touring as Frankie Lymon's Legendary Teenagers or The Legendary Teenagers, the group still plays today with the current lineup being Herman Santiago, Bobby Jay, Terry King and Terrance Farward.\n\nWas Frankie Lymon married?\n\nFrankie Lymon and DJ Murray The K Kauffman. Picture: Getty Images\n\nFrankie Lymon's personal life was complicated to say the least.\n\nHe married his first wife Elizabeth Mickey Waters in January 1964. Technically though, this marriage was never legal because she was still married to her previous husband.\n\nThey had a daughter together \u2013 Frankie's only child \u2013 but Francine tragically died just two days after being born.\n\nAfter his first \"marriage\" failed, Frankie is then said to have wed The Platters singer Zola Taylor in Mexico in 1965. To this day, no-one has found any documentation of the wedding though, and it's been claimed that the whole story was a joke or publicity stunt.\n\nThe Platters - He's Mine (1957)\n\nLymon's third and final wedding came to schoolteacher Emira Eagle. The couple married in June 1967, but it's worth noting that Frankie hadn't actually divorced either of his two wives before.\n\nThe complex swirl of legal and illegal weddings that may or may not have happened caused issues long after Lymon's death, when Diana Ross's successful cover of 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' sparked a scramble for Frankie's royalties.\n\nHow and when did Frankie Lymon die?\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers - I Promise To Remember (1983)\n\nFrankie Lymon told Ebony magazine in 1967 that he had been introduced to heroin a woman twice his age when he was just 15, and he swiftly became addicted.\n\n\"I looked twice my age,\" Lymon said. \"I was thin as a shadow and I didn't give a damn. My only concern was in getting relief.\n\n\"You know, an addict is the most pathetic creature on earth. He knows that every time he sticks a needle in his arm, he's gambling with death and, yet, he's got to have it. It\u2019s like playing Russian Roulette with a spike.\"\n\nHis deepening dependency surely affected his performing and recording career, though he entered rehab in 1961 and attempted a comeback.\n\nLymon appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue and recorded some singles, but nothing really took off.\n\nBy 1966 he was in trouble again, being arrested on a heroin charge. Instead of going to jail, he was drafted in the US army, but after going AWOL he was discharged.\n\nFrankie Lyman - I'm Sorry - (Big Apple)\n\nThe army did the trick though, briefly. Lymon is said to have remained drug-free for two full years after being drafted.\n\nIn 1968 though, he was told a major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates. He had a recording session booked. Lymon \"celebrated\" the news by injecting the drug while staying at his grandmother's house in Harlem.\n\nOn February 27, 1968 \u2013 the day he was meant to be in the studio Lymon was found dead on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom. He had died of a heroin overdose with a syringe by his side. He was only 25.\n\nLymon was buried at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx.\n\nWhat was Frankie Lymon's legacy?\n\nJoni Mitchell - Why Do Fools Fall In Love\n\nDespite dying at such a young age and only really being an active recording artist for a few short years, Frankie Lymon had a massive impact on the emerging pop and rock 'n' roll scene.\n\nAs we already noted, both The Beach Boys and Diana Ross showed their love for Frankie with their covers of his biggest hit.\n\nOther artists who have namechecked The Teenagers include Ronnie Spector, The Temptations, The Chantels, Smokey Robinson, Billy Joel and George Clinton.\n\nThe influence of Frankie and The Teenagers on Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 is as clear as day, as well as all of Berry Gordy's other Motown bands and stables.\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love movie trailer\n\nFrankie's influence went beyond the most obvious, with Joni Mitchell covering 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love', and artists as diverse as The Fall, Everything but the Girl and The Mountain Goats, referencing Frankie in their songs 'No X-mas for John Quays', 'Boxing and Pop Music' and 'Harlem Roulette', respectively,.\n\nFrankie's legacy was cemented with the 1998 biopic called (of course) Why Do Fools Fall in Love, which starred Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.\n\nThe Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."}, {"url": "https://www.arkbh.com/celebrity-deaths/musicians/frankie-lymon/", "page_content": "Franklin Joseph Lymon was an African-American rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, doo-wop, and R&B soprano singer and songwriter.

A syringe was located by his body.\n\nLymon was laid to rest at Saint Raymond\u2019s cemetery located in The Bronx, New York City. A song which was recorded before his passing was released the following year and titled \u201cI\u2019m Sorry.\u201d\n\nPosthumously, Lymon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Many well-known singers and songwriters have credited Lymon with their success and have acknowledged his influence.\n\nSome of these artists include:\n\nThe Temptations\n\nGeorge Clinton\n\nDiana Ross\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nBilly Joel\n\nSmokey Robinson\n\nAbout Frankie Lymon\n\nFrankie Lymon was born to the parents of Jeanette and Howard Lymon in Harlem, New York on September 30, 1942. At a young age, he became friends with Herman Santiago, the lead singer of the Coupe De Villes, a local doo-wop group.\n\nLater, they would go on to form the band The Ermines and The Premiers. However, Lymon\u2019s career was forever changed when The Teenagers was formed.\n\nThe Teenagers\n\nFrankie Lymon and the Teenagers consisted of himself, Jimmy Merchant, Joe Negroni, Herman Santiago, and Sherman Garnes.\n\nCalling themselves The Teenagers, the group of talented teens auditioned for George Goldner, the record producer of Gee Records at the time. The Teenagers\u2019 first single was titled \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall In Love,\u201d which became their first hit in 1956.\n\nIn addition to this popular song, there are a number of other hits from The Teenagers which include:\n\n\u201cGoody Goody\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Not A Juvenile Delinquent\u201d\n\n\u201cI Want You To Be My Girl\u201d\n\n\u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s Of Love\u201d\n\nSolo Career\n\nAfter a successful string of hit songs, Lymon began a solo career, at the pressure of the record producer. Lymon performed at the London Palladium for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAlthough still managing to have work, Lymon\u2019s success wasn\u2019t as much of a hit as his previous work with The Teenagers. Lymon experienced discrimination when he danced with a white woman on a the live ABC broadcast \u201cThe Big Beast.\u201d\n\nNot only was the television show canceled, at the time those living in the South objected to the content on their television sets.\n\nLymon then moved to Roulette Records later and accomplished a solo hit of a cover of Bobby Day\u2019s \u201cLittle Bitty Pretty One.\u201d\n\nFrankie Lymon\u2019s History Of Heroin Addiction\n\nDuring the 1960s, Lymon began to struggle with drug use. It\u2019s reported that Lymon suffered from heroin addiction since the age of 15.\n\nTo avoid a jail sentence due to a heroin charge in 1966, Lymon chose to join the Army. That same year, Lymon met his first wife, school teacher Emira Eagle in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nAlthough struggling with drug abuse throughout his life, Lymon was later signed by Big Apple label days before his death.\n\nDid Frankie Lymon Attend Addiction Treatment?\n\nDuring his time in the Army, Lymon did not participate in drug abuse. For two years, Lymon\u2019s drug use did not exist. It wasn\u2019t until receiving a promotion in the Army that Lymon decided to return to heroin as a form of indulgence or celebration.\n\nRecovery Is Possible\n\nAlthough Frankie Lymon tragically succumbed to his heroin addiction, recovery is possible with a variety of tools and treatment services.\n\nFor information on how we treat heroin addiction with multiple resources, including medication-assisted treatment, behavioral therapy, and ongoing support, please contact Ark Behavioral health today."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jan-01-ca-59429-story.html", "page_content": "TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC\n\n\u201cGreat\u201d and \u201ctragic\u201d are words that are invariably used when pop historians refer to \u201850s R&B; singers Clyde McPhatter and Frankie Lymon.\n\nIf such hits as McPhatter\u2019s \u201cMoney Honey\u201d and Lymon\u2019s \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d point to the glory and influence of these Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members, the dark side of their careers is underscored by substance abuse and early deaths.\n\nMcPhatter was 39 when he died in 1972 of a heart attack that was believed to have been caused by years of drinking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLymon, whose life story was outlined in the recent film \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d was only 25 when he was found dead in 1968 in the bathroom of his grandmother\u2019s apartment in New York, a syringe by his side.\n\nUnderstandably, it\u2019s the happier side of McPhatter\u2019s and Lymon\u2019s lives that are saluted in a pair of just-released CDs.\n\n*** 1/2 Clyde McPhatter, \u201cThe Forgotten Angel,\u201d 32 Records. From the album title to the passionate liner notes, there\u2019s a strong sense of crusade about this album, which was compiled by Grammy-winning record producer Joel Dorn and singer Aaron Neville.\n\nThe goal: to draw attention to McPhatter, who has never enjoyed the fame or critical recognition of such peers as Ray Charles, Sam Cooke and Otis Redding.\n\n\u201cLike a breath of fresh and emancipating air, McPhatter brought his soaring, gospel-drenched vocal approach to a buttoned-down era when such thrilling cross-pollinations were only beginning to be undertaken,\u201d Bill Dahl, in his somewhat breathless liner notes, declares of McPhatter\u2019s impact on R&B.; \u201cWhen Clyde first surfaced with Billy Ward\u2019s Dominoes in 1950, his delivery was fresh, daring and exciting, forever refuting the precise impeccably-modulated lead tenors of the Ink Spots\u2019 Bill Kenny and the Orioles\u2019s Sonny Til. . . .\u201d\n\nOddly, given this description of the Dominoes period, the album doesn\u2019t pick up McPhatter\u2019s career until after he left the group in the early \u201850s and formed his own group, the Drifters, at Atlantic Records--a gap that costs the collection half a star in the ratings.\n\nThough the Drifters would enjoy their greatest popularity after McPhatter left the group for a solo career, his records with the Drifters were hugely influential.\n\nElvis Presley recorded two of the group\u2019s biggest hits, \u201cMoney Honey\u201d and \u201cSuch a Night,\u201d and the Drifters\u2019 recordings of \u201cThe Bells of St. Mary\u2019s\u201d and \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d surely helped shape the musical vision that Phil Spector brought to his own legendary Christmas album in the \u201860s.\n\nMcPhatter\u2019s falsetto-edged vocal style lost some of its rawness after he left the Drifters and began aiming for more of a pop audience. Still, he continued to come up with some spectacular hits, including \u201cA Lover\u2019s Question,\u201d at Atlantic before he moved on to other labels and saw his career sputter. The only Top 10 hit he had after leaving Atlantic was \u201cLover Please\u201d for Mercury in 1962.\n\nIn his liner notes, Dahl chronicles McPhatter\u2019s post-Atlantic career, pointing to a \u201crespectable comeback effort\u201d in 1970 for Decca Records. But the only post-Atlantic track we hear on the album (aside from some welcome live recordings) is \u201cLover Please.\u201d\n\nDespite the omissions, \u201cThe Forgotten Angel\u201d is an extraordinary two-disc collection that achieves its goal of showing that McPhatter deserves to be on any list of America\u2019s great R&B; singers.\n\n*** 1/2 Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, \u201cThe Very Best of Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,\u201d Rhino. Lymon didn\u2019t leave as impressive a body of work as McPhatter, but he was an even more electric presence on the \u201850s pop scene, chiefly because of his age.\n\nLymon was only 13 when \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love\u201d broke into the national Top 10. The record\u2019s spirited vocal defined youthful R&B; so fully that it was only natural that Michael Jackson was frequently called the new Frankie Lymon when he surfaced with the Jackson 5 in 1969. In \u201cFools,\u201d Lymon put into a single song a sense of youthful exuberance that remains captivating today.\n\nAfter a series of hits with the Teenagers, he was persuaded by his managers to try a solo career, but it never took hold. In this single-disc album\u2019s liner notes, Bob Hyde points to various problems, both professional and personal. But, as in the case of \u201cThe Forgotten Angel,\u201d we don\u2019t get a chance to hear Lymon\u2019s subsequent efforts here.\n\n*\n\nAlbums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars (excellent)."}, {"url": "https://retronewser.com/2018/02/27/frankie-lymon-dies-in-harlem-apartment-50-years-ago-this-hour-onthisday-otd-feb-27-1968/", "page_content": "\n\nVideo: 'Mysteries n Scandals / Frankie Lymon (Part 1 of 2)'\n\n(Tuesday, February 27, 1968, Lymon\u2019s body was discovered in the morning EST) \u2014 Frankie Lymon, the 25-year-old rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singer who popularized \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d and \u201cGoody Goody,\u201d was found dead today of a heroin overdose in the apartment of his grandmother in the Harlem section of New York City.\n\n\n\nVideo: 'Mysteries n Scandals / Frankie Lymon (Part 2 of 2)'"}, {"url": "https://metrobiography.com/frankie-lymon/", "page_content": "Frankie Lymon is a famous American rock and roll/rhythm and blues singer and songwriter.

However, Frankie Lymon was, as Cub Koda stated in the All Music Guide, Volume 1, \u201cthe first black teenage star.\u201d From the streets corners of Harlem to the London Palladium stage, Frankie Lymon and The Teeagers, as noted in the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul, were a doo-wop vocal group whose \u201csaga... might be called a Cinderella story without a happy ending\u201d as well as a song without an answer to this eternal question: \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d\n\nIn the 1950s, a sweet-sounding musical craze swept across America\u2014doo wop. In 1955, one group, the Ermines\u2014school friends Herman Santiago, Joe Negroni, Sherman Games, and Jimmy Merchant stood on West 165th Street in New York City and harmonized because, as Merchant said in the New Yorker, \u201cIt was a fad at the time to be a vocal group. It wasn\u2019t just like roller skating. It was a higher-class fad\u2014a quality fad. It tied in to being known, and getting girls.\u201d Yet, it was not until another voice, the soprano boy voice of Frankie Lymo, joined the group that the Ermines, now renamed the Coupe de Villes, became more than a fad. Lymon, had already stepped into the public spotlight by singing with the Harlemaires, his father\u2019s gospel group, but how Lymon joined the Coupe de Villes is unclear. One version suggested by reporter Calvin Trillin in the New Yorker, was that Lymon, passing the group on the street, overheard Santiago struggling to hit some high notes. Lymon, as Santiago told Trillin, who was \u201cextremely talented and bright and very cocky,\u201d just jumped in with his \u201cgospel tenor\u2014a high strong voice of remarkable clarity.\u201d\n\nBy late 1955, the once Ermines and Coupe de Villes, changed their name again\u2014to the Premiers. Richard Barrett, a member of another vocal group, the Valentines and a part-time record company employee, heard the Premiers singing \u201cLily Maebelle\u201d\u2014a Valentine\u2019s hit\u2014outside his bedroom window. Barrett liked what he heard and promised to praise the group to his boss, Gee Records producer/promoter George Goldner, if they would stop waking him up every morning. Goldner, awed by one song\u2014\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d\u2014 asked Lymon, as quoted in the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock, and Soul, \u201cYou got any sheet music for it?\u201d Lymon replied, \u201cNope, we don\u2019t know anything about written-down music. This lack of \u201cwritten-down music\u201d knowledge would 30 years later create an intriguing court battle. However, on January 10, 1956, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d was released and as stated by Trillin in the New Yorker, \u201cIt was an instant, stupendous hit.\u201d\n\nMembers includ Frankie Lymon (born September 30, 1942, died February 28, 1968, married Elizabeth Waters, Zola Tayor, and Emira Eagle, never divorced), soprano; Sherman Garnes (born June 8, 1940, died 1978), bass; Jimmy Merchant (born February 10, 1940), second tenor; Joe Negroni (born September 9, 1940, died 1978), baritone; Herman Santiago (born February 18, 1941), first tenor.\n\nGroup began as the Ermines, a New York street corner quartet in 1955; changed name to Coupe de Villes and added a new member, Frankie Lymon later that year; became the Premiers and recorded \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d 1956; released \u201cWhy do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d under a new name: Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers; starred in rock and roll radio disc jockey, Alan Freed\u2019s rock concerts and movie, Rock, Rock, Rock singing, \u201cBaby, Baby\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d; Lymon left group in late 1956 and failed at solo career while the Teenagers continued; Lymon died of a drug overdose, 1968; in the 1980s, Lymon\u2019s three wives (whom he never divorced) sued and won lost royalties; Last two surviving Teenagers\u2014Jimmy Merchant and Herman Santiagao\u2014sued and won song writing credit and back royalties to \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love,\u201d 1993; released movie based on the group, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, 1998.\n\nAwards: Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 1993.\n\nWith the success of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d\u2014a gold record single\u2014Frankie Lymon, at the age of 14, and The Teenagers, all under the age of 16, became pop music superstars. However, it was not just their smooth vocal harmonies that made them popular. In the 1950s, due to race discrimination, crossover success from the rhythm and blues charts to the pop charts by black recording artists was uncommon. Yet, as stated by Trillin in the New Yorker, \u201cThe Teenagers came in a squeaky-clean package\u2014processed hair and the sort of clothes familiar from Hollywood campus movies of the forties, including letter sweaters.\u201d And with their smash hit spending 16 weeks on the pop chart, Lymon and The Teenagers rode a wave of success onto Ed Sullivan and Dick Clark\u2019s TV shows as well as onto rock \u2018n roll deejay Alan Freed\u2019s rock concerts and movies, such as Rock, Rock, Rock In that movie, Lymon and The Teenagers debuted two new, non-intimidating singles, \u201cBaby, Baby, Baby\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent.\u201d\n\nBy the middle of 1956, four more singles from the group\u2019s first album also hit the top ten: \u201cI Promise to Remember,\u201d \u201cI Want You to be My Girl,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Not a Know-it-All,\u201d and \u201cWho Can Explain?\u201d Trillin believed that, \u201cthe Teenagers were the model\u2014the proof that a miracle could happen.\u201d Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, five kids from the street corners of Harlem, played concerts at London, England\u2019s Palladium theatre and cruised in luxury. Merchant told Trillin that \u201cwe [the group] were the first people to get out of long limousines with sneakers and jeans on.\u201d Moreover, as Trillin further stated, the success of this vocal group was because \u201cThe Teenagers were not considered threatening to whites\u2014probably because of Frankie, who came across as the sassy, pint-sized kid brother who would never grow up.\u201d\n\nYet, the end of 1956, Lymon had grown up enough to catch a new wave\u2014a solo wave. The Teenagers replaced Lymon but never again rode the high wave of success. Neither did Lymon, as quoted in People, \u201che [Lymon] got trapped in his child-like image\u201d\u2014but his voice had changed. Thus, Lymon was forced to lip-synch his hits at sock hops. Lymon also was not, as Jerry Blavat, a deejay, told Trillin, \u201cthe mischievous kid, whose idea of back stage entertainment was to hide Paul Anka\u2019s shoes just before Anka had to be onstage\u201d\u2014Lymon had become a drug addict. Lymon, as quoted by People, admitted that the single, \u201cI\u2019m Not a Juvenile Delinquent\u201d was far from autobiographical, \u201c[I] \u2026 had been a pimp at age 10\u2026 [and] had been smoking marijuana when I was in grade school. But I didn\u2019t start using [heroin] until I got into show business.\u201d Lymon tried to get clean, but failed. As quoted in People, Lymon said, \u201cI didn\u2019t give a damn about drugs.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lymon despite a career cut short by his voice change and drugs, married three times\u2014first, in 1964 to Elizabeth Waters, a woman with arrests for theft and prostitution; In 1965, to Zola Taylor, the Platters girl singer, and in 1967, after a brief stint in the Army to get out of jail time, to Emira Eagle, an elementary school teacher. In 1968, Lymon attempted a comeback and had been promised a singing job in New York. Yet, on February 28, 1968, Lymon was found dead on his grandmother\u2019s bathroom floor. Lymon, only 25, had overdosed on heroin. Ten years later, two Teenagers\u2014 Garnes and Negroni also died\u2014Garnes from a heart attack and Negronia from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nOver the next 28 years, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, were a forgotten doo-wop quintet, however their hit single, \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d was not. In 1973, the song was featured in the popular coming-of-age movie, American Graffiti, and in 1981, Diana Ross recorded her version of the song, and it once again became a Top 10 hit on the pop music charts. In 1984, George Goldner, Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers\u2019 producer applied for an original copyright of the song to insure royalty money for Emira, Lymon\u2019s third wife. However, two questions arose with this application\u2014first, who was Lymon\u2019s legal widow, and second, who wrote \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d\n\nLymon\u2019s three wives\u2014Elizabeth Waters, Zola Taylor, and Emira Eagle\u2014had never met. That fact changed in 1997, almost 30 years after Lymon\u2019s death, when, at a Manhattan court house, the three women were called to testify. Because Lymon had never divorced Waters, Taylor, or Eagle, the question of who was Lymon\u2019s legal widow had to be answered before any royalty money was awarded. Each woman had their own memories of Lymon. Waters, as quoted in the New Yorker, knew \u201cFrankie at the time [in 1961] he was a very sad, lonely person.\u201d Waters also stated that,\u201d Frankie could fool you, he could fool me, Frankie could fool God.\u201d However, Waters seemed to fool Lymon. In 1964, when Lymon and she were married, Waters was already married to someone else. Taylor, Lymon\u2019s second wife, and the Platters girl singer, had dated Lymon when he was just 14, never produced a marriage license. Eagle, only married to Lymon for eight months, remembered, as quoted in People, that Frankie \u201ctreated me like I was his queen.\u201d\n\nThe judge decided that only Waters, seeing that Lymon could not legally marry anyone else after marrying his first wife, and overlooking the fact that she was already married, named Waters Lymon\u2019s legal widow. However, in 1990, this decision was overturned and Eagle was named Lymon\u2019s new legal widow and therefore entitled to his estate of back royalties for \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d However, another question had to be answered before any money was awarded\u2014who wrote that smash single?\n\nIn the early 1990s, another court battle began\u2014this time to decide who were the true author\u2019s of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d To answer this question, a time trip must be taken back through a maze of buyers and sellers (including Lymon himself). In 1956, the song\u2019s registered copyright listed Lymon and The Teenager\u2019s producer George Goldner as the hit song\u2019s writers. However, as stated by Trillin in the New Yorker, it was a \u201ccommon practice in the fifties for an R & B record producer to tell a group that he\u2019d have to have a writing credit if it wanted its song recorded.\u201d Richard Barrett, the man who brought Lymon and The Teenagers to the attention of Goldner further stated that, \u201cwe [doo-wop groups] had no idea of the value of a song then. We had no idea what the value of a copyright was. And they [record producers] weren\u2019t going to tell any black people about that anyway.\u201d\n\nHowever, Goldner, after amassing too many gambling debts, left his partner, Morris Levy, with control of the copyright. In 1965, Lymon, by that time a heavy drug user, needed money. So he sold his rights to Levy for, as reported in the New Yorker, \u201ca sum that was probably something like fifteen hundred dollars.\u201d Thus, when \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d appeared in the 1973 movie, American Graffiti, and when Diana Ross covered the hit in 1981, only Levy received 100 per cent of the royalties. Yet, in the late 1980s, Jimmy Merchant and Henry Santiago\u2014the last two surviving Teenagers\u2014 contested Levy\u2019s claim. At the trial, as stated in People, \u201cwitnesses testified that Merchant and Santiago were 15-year-old street corner harmonizers who came up with the tune before Lymon joined them.\u201d Merchant and Santiago also had, as reported in the New Yorker, an \u201cinteresting piece of evidence: the first 45-r.p.m. single of \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d [which] listed as the song\u2019s writers not just Frankie Lymon and George Goldner but also Herman Santiago.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Santiago and Merchant stated in the New Yorker that the idea for the song came when they picked through a groupie\u2019s letters to \u201cget ideas, just to see what we could come up with\u2026. That\u2019s basically what we had the idea from.\u201d Yet, another version of the song\u2019s origin, as reported by Trillin, was that one of the groupie\u2019s letters included a poem. That poem had \u201cone of its [\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d] main lines: \u201cWhy do birds sing so gay?\u201d [and] Santiago and Merchant\u2026 worked the sentiments of the letters into a song lyric and then Frankie Lymon helped with the tune.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lymon himself told three versions of how he wrote the song. The first version, as remembered by Emira Lymon in the New Yorker, said that Lymon \u201chad written the song at twelve because he had fallen in love with a teacher and she told him that he was nothing but a kid, he was too young for her. And that is why he wrote \u2018Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\u2019.\u201d Another version, as cited in the New Yorker, was that the song was \u201cinspired by Lymon\u2019s seventh grade essay.\u201d Yet, Elizabeth Waters, Lymon\u2019s first wife, offered that the song was just \u201coff the top of his [Lymon\u2019s] head.\u201d Finally, in 1992, over 30 years after \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d hit the charts, Santiago and Merchant, along with Frankie Lymon were named the writers of the song. Merchant told People, \u201cThirty-six years is a long, long, long time. But they [record producers] never really do get away with it.\u201d However, this verdict was later overturned.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Santiago, Merchant, and Lymon\u2019s brother Louis still performed as The Teenagers. Yet, it was in September of 1998, when Hollywood released Why Do Fools Fall in Love, a movie based on the life of Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers, that the group\u2019s doo-wop sound and hit single rose again. However, the movie, as stated in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \u201cmissed its mark \u2026 and never notes Frankie\u2019s voice changing\u2026 [nor how Frankie] lost his looks and charm.\u201d Bobby Jay, the Teenagers current bassist, further commented that Lymon \u201cwas begging on the street. The drugs took a huge toll. He was missing teeth. He looked bad. It was tragic.\u201d\n\nEven though the movie misrepresented Lymon and The Teenagers life, it had reminded the public of their sweet-sounding melodies. Moreover, as stated in the Rock \u2018n Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s online biography of the group, \u201cThe song [\u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d] has attained the status of a vocal-group classic owing to Lymon\u2019s agile, ingenuous and utterly charming performance.\u201d Thus, perhaps the saga of Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers and the eternal question: \u201cWhy Do Fools Fall in Love?\u201d was a fairy tale, albeit one without a happily-ever-after ending for Lymon\u2014or as Santiago told People, \u201ca natural superstar. There was nobody like Frankie.\u201d\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall in Love, Gee Records, 1956.\n\nAt The London Palladium, 1956.\n\nThe Teenagers For Collectors Only [Box Set], Collectables Records, 1994.\n\nThe Very Best of Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers, Wea/Atlantic/Rhino, 1998.\n\nBooks\n\nHitchcock, H.
