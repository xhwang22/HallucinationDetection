But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://ripbaseball.com/2018/12/06/grave-story-billy-barnie-1853-1900/", "page_content": "Here lies \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie, a catcher/outfielder who went on to manage until the day he died. Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "http://www.members.tripod.com/bb_catchers/catchers/mg_barnie.htm", "page_content": "TM/L\n\nG\n\nW\n\nL\n\nPCT\n\nM/Y\n\n\n\n\n\nW-EXP\n\n\n\nA-E\n\n\n\nStanding\n\nTeam and League\n\nGames managed (including ties)\n\nWins\n\nLosses\n\nPercentage of games won\n\nManager/Year (The latter number indicates how many managers the team employed that year, while the former indicates the chronological position of the manager [i.e. 1-2 would mean this manager was the first of two managers during that year]).\n\nExpected Wins.

Molitor is the only player in the post-integration era with at least 3,000 hits, a .300 lifetime average and 500 steals. -- Lauber\n\nHe could have played shortstop for the Brewers, but there was a guy named Robin Yount there. On offense, he had the shortest swing, the fastest hands and was one of the best baserunners in baseball history. His 39-game hitting streak for Team Streak in 1987 captured the nation's attention.

His '64 and '68 seasons are inner-circle awesome. -- Kahrl\n\nBrooks Robinson came before my time. I've seen the highlights, but I've never seen the man play live. But I know just how good he was at baseball's hot corner -- and you do, too -- because I have seen some pretty good third basemen play the game, and every time one of them makes an incredible play -- every time -- someone who has seen Robinson play says the EXACT same thing: \"Shades of Brooks Robinson.\" And there's no way they could all be wrong. -- Mullen\n\nBrooks Robinson drove in the only run in 10 1-0 victories in his career, a major league record.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/01/archives/billy-cox-58-a-dodger-standout-as-third-baseman-in-early-50s-born.html", "page_content": "Third base is known as the \u201chot corner\u201d because it is one of the most dangerous positions and balls are generally hit sharply that way. A third baseman has to be exceptionally quick and agile and gifted with sharp eyesight so that he can follow the ball's movement from the bat into his glove. Always there is the danger of a freakish hop that can injure any part of the face or body.\n\nCox could field the hot grounder from any direction, with gloved or bare hand. The other difficulty in playing third base is the ability to throw, swiftly and accurately, to first base. Cox made that long throw with a strong arm.\n\nCox helped the Dodgers win three pennants and he was especially outstanding, at the plate and at third base, in the 1952 World Series. George Kell, a third baseman with the Boston Red Sox, said \u201cI never dreamed third base could be played with such artistry until I saw Cox in that Series.\u201d\n\nStrangely, for all his ability with the glove, Cox once tied the National League record of three errors in one inning. It happened in the eighth inning of a game on Aug. 6, 1949, at Cincinnati, where the Dodgers lost to the Reds, 5\u20102.\n\nHis first mistake was a high throw to Gil Hodges at first.

In 1883 he became manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association; he appeared as a backup catcher that season, and also played two games in 1886, but otherwise did not take the field. After leaving the Orioles following the 1891 season, he managed the Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-1894) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-1898). His career managerial record consists of 632 wins and 810 losses. His best finish was third place with the 1887 Orioles.

But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://ladodgertalk.com/2019/10/23/dodgers-third-baseman-and-his-playmaker/", "page_content": "Last Wednesday, I wrote an article on Rube Walker \u2013 the Father of the Five-Man Rotation \u2013 which drew some comments for which I was grateful. Presently, I am not in mourning over the Dodgers untimely exit from post-season play. It happened, it is over, and life goes on. With my ninth decade now staring me in the face each year without one more WS victory is a bit problematic, but gifted with excellent health I plan to be around for a few more attempts to snatch the brass ring. I look forward to those attempts rather than looking back to a failed one.\n\nIn the meantime, my enthusiasm for baseball has not diminished because of a loss. The game, the Dodgers, my favorite players have given me so much over the years that there is always something to fall back on when things don\u2019t go as well as I had hoped. For me, I often fall back to the Boys of Summer but I also look ahead to the youngsters on the horizon in the minor leagues. Both of those venues are safe and still provide enjoyment.\n\nI love the game of baseball, I expect because I played some as a youngster and later played some fastball as a young man. It is an individual game played as a team. I was never much of a hitter but I could if you will permit some bragging, \u201cgo get \u2018em\u201d with the best players. That is, I was an excellent defender and loved playing in the field, especially leftfield as there were very few left-handed batters.\n\nBecause of my ability to play in the field, I reveled in Vin\u2019s descriptions as the Dodgers in the fifties made plays behind their pitchers. And, plays they did make. Duke scaling the wall at Ebbets Field or climbing the vines at Wrigley Field or hearing Vin describe Carl Furillo, the \u201cReading Rifle\u201d, taking caroms off the rightfield wall almost as a virtuoso uses the keys on a piano. I remember him describing Pee Wee and Jackie ranging wide and making double plays and his description of former catcher Gil Hodges at first base with hands \u201cas soft as silk\u201d. Oh yes, and Campy blocking balls in the dirt before blocking balls in the dirt was cool and throwing out 57 percent of all would-be base stealers.\n\nI also have another recollection, brought forward by some comments in response to the Rube Walker article on October 16.\n\nDodgerBlueMom wrote: \u201cAnd AC. You and I share something in common, Brooks Robinson. He is my favorite 3rd baseman. I called him \u201cthe vacuum cleaner at third\u201d! I was fortunate to see him play as a minor league player with the Mounties in BC. I followed his career with Baltimore along with being an avid Dodger fan and loved the antics of Earl Weaver.\u201d\n\n59inarow replied: \u201cBrooks was a little before my time. I always thought that Graig Nettles was the Gold Standard at the hot corner, but Ron Cey was my favorite Dodger growing up as a kid.\u201d\n\nAlways Compete added: \u201cAs DBMom said, Brooks is the one that everyone else is compared to.\u201d\n\nThose comments took me back to the little known and perhaps under appreciated complement to the Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese infield. He definitely was not underappreciated by his teammates. How many remember or have even heard of the third baseman that complemented that infield?\n\nMany of the LADT readers are too young to have witnessed him play or to have heard about him because he never achieved all-star status, even once, as all of his infield teammates have done. Three of them \u2013 Jackie, Pee Wee, and Campy \u2013 are in the HOF and Gil Hodges should be, at least in my opinion.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the invisible infielder, let me introduce you to Newport, Pennsylvania\u2019s favorite son, Billy Cox, who was the complement to that revered infield. He attended high school in his hometown and following graduation from high school he played with Harrisburg of the Interstate League and achieved All-Star status as a shortstop.\n\nIn 1941 Cox led the Interstate League in batting, hits, doubles and total bases for Harrisburg. He had a 22-game hitting streak, hit .368 and set a league record for most assists as a shortstop. He was called up to Pittsburgh and debuted on September 20 and hit .270 in 10 games with the Pirates.\n\nThat was all the professional baseball he would play until the spring of 1946, with one exception. In February of 1942, he had entered the military service and spent four years with the 814th Signal Corps. The one exception was an exhibition game on May 28, 1942, between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Harrisburg Senators of the Inter-State League. Billy Cox was given a special dispensation to play with the Pirates on that day and registered four runs in their 14-5 win.\n\nFor the next four years, he served his country seeing action in North Africa, Europe, and Guadalcanal. Dealing with the sands of North Africa and the swamps and mud of Europe, along with contracting Malaria, his weight fell to 132 pounds on his 5\u20199\u201d frame. His health never really fully recovered following the war.\n\nIntent on resuming his baseball career, the 26-year-old Cox never complained: \u201cI lost a good part of my career,\u201d he told The Sporting News on May 2, 1946, \u201cbut I\u2019m not kicking. I went through four years of the war and came out whole, so I guess I am lucky.\u201d\n\nHe returned to active duty as an MLB player with the Pirates in 1946 and played two seasons with them, as a shortstop, hitting a combined .280. In December of 1947, he was traded to the Dodgers, along with right-hander Preacher Roe, in a deal that sent Dodger\u2019s favorite, 37- year- old Dixie Walker, to Pittsburgh. Many Dodger fans were incensed to lose Walker known affectionately as, \u201cThe People\u2019s Choice\u201d. Walker apparently had demanded a trade because he did not want to play on a team that included Jackie Robinson.\n\nHowever, those same fans soon came to believe it was one of the greatest trades ever made by Branch Rickey. Both Billy Cox and Preacher Roe went on to have seven-year careers with the Dodgers. Dixie Walker had two with the Pirates before retiring.\n\nCox, a shortstop with the Pirates, came over to the Dodgers with Pee Wee Reese firmly entrenched as the shortstop. Reese would go on to play 16 years with the Dodgers, missing three war years, and with 2014 games played at short.\n\nInitially assigned to third base by manager Leo Durocher, and to a position he had never played, Cox quickly took over and played defense at the hot corner like no other third baseman at that time.\n\nCox later acknowledged that he didn\u2019t know anything about playing third base: \u201cThey just expected me to play it by ear.\u201d Like Carl Furrilo playing the caroms off the rightfield wall, Billy Cox was a virtuoso at third base snagging line drives and smothering ground balls most third baseman could only dream of corralling.\n\nWalter O\u2019Malley, then president of the Dodgers, said, \u201cWe regard Cox as the greatest gloveman Brooklyn ever had.\u201d That was not just the greatest third baseman but the greatest, \u201cgloveman.\u201d\n\nHis most productive year offensively with the Dodgers was 1953. During the regular season, he hit .291 in 100 games played and followed that up with a .304 average in the World Series against the Yankees and had a team-leading six runs batted in.\n\nDuring those seven years with the Dodgers, Billy Cox and his war-ravaged body only once was able to play more than 119 games in a single season. He struggled to maintain his weight and suffered from what we call PTSD nowadays. Cox didn\u2019t really talk about it but at times it did show. Harold Burr of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote about one incident when the Pirates were playing in Boston, and a ballpark fireworks display sent Cox plunging for cover in the dugout. The roar of the crowd could also trigger a moment of terror. Cox told his teammates he was never wounded in action, though his helmet was once blown off by an explosion.\n\nIn 1955 he was traded to the Orioles and played his last 53 games with Baltimore. Unfortunately, his trade to the Orioles meant he missed the Dodgers 1955 World Series victory over the New York Yankees.\n\nBilly Cox is not listed on any list of the Top 100 MLB third baseman and perhaps would not be among the top 150 or more. The shortness of his career pretty much excludes him and corner infielders are supposed to have thunder in their bats. The 5\u201910\u201d/150-pound right-handed hitter did not have thunder in his bat. What made him special was the lightening in his glove as testified by his teammates and opponents.\n\nHis teammate Duke Snider \u2013 on a Montreal Expo broadcast \u2013 commented on Billy Cox and his glove following Cox\u2019s death in 1978 at the age of 58. \u201cIf there was ever a better third baseman I\u2019d like to have seen him. The thing I remember about Billy was that little three-fingered glove he used. They called it the \u2018playmaker.\u2019 There would be a ball that looked like it was by him and somehow, he\u2019d come up with it. Then he\u2019d seem to look at it for a minute before throwing the runner out.\u201d\n\nFormer Dodger manager, Chuck Dressen, agreed with Duke Snider: \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s counting the stitches. But he never seems to get in trouble because he has such quick hands.\u201d\n\nA fan remembered a member of the Dodger announcing team describing Cox\u2019s hesitation with the ball: \u201cHe checks to see if it\u2019s broken, and throws to first for the out.\n\nHis hesitation in throwing to first just about drove Pee Wee Reese out of his mind. On more than one occasion he would shout, \u201cThrow the damn ball, Billy.\u201d, upon which Cox would deliver a strike to first base.\n\nBilly Cox was nicknamed, \u201cHoss\u201d, because of his long and perhaps somewhat appearing sad face. However, this was not a sad man, but a grateful man, one who loved the game and his teammates and one whose teammates and opponents marveled at his glovework with his little three-fingered glove.\n\nA story is told about the iconic Casey Stengel who had observed the third baseman at work from 1910 until 1975. You might say Casey knew something about third basemen. During a spring training game, one year Stengel in his gruff voice shouted out to Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson: \u201cYou\u2019re the second greatest third baseman of all time!\u201d\n\nPuzzled at the out of the blue comment Robinson naturally asked who was the best ever to play the position. Stengel replied: \u201cNumber three over there in Brooklyn. He was the best of all time.\u201d Number three happened to be Billy Cox.\n\nCasey Stengel also said when Cox was taking the Professor and his Yankees to school with his glove: \u201cHe\u2019s not a third baseman. He\u2019s a blankety-blank acrobat.\u201d\n\nGeorge Kell, a third baseman with the Boston Red Sox and not a slouch as a third baseman, supported Stengel\u2019s assessment of Cox: \u201cI never dreamed third base could be played with such artistry until I saw Cox in that series.\u201d\n\nWhen a statue of Brooks Robinson was unveiled at Camden Yards in 2012, Robinson told the Baltimore Sun that he was sorry he never got to meet Billy Cox in person. Robinson was signed the same summer Cox retired, and the former Dodger was one of only four or five men to wear the Orioles uniform whom the Baltimore third base magician has never met.\n\nWilliam Richard \u201cBilly\u201d Cox died on March 30, 1978, and was laid to rest in his hometown of Newport, Pennsylvania. He has not been forgotten as Newport\u2019s youth baseball complex is known as Billy Cox Field."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/7542963/there-easy-playing-third-base", "page_content": "Lou: What's the fellow's name on third base?\n\nBud: What is the fellow's name on second base.\n\nLou: I'm not askin' ya who's on second.\n\nBud: Who's on first?\n\nLou: I don't know.\n\nBud and Lou: Third base!\n\nOn the mythical St. Louis Wolves team in Abbott and Costello's famed routine, the third baseman's name is I Don't Know. Bud and Lou could not have used a more appropriate moniker for the poor fellow. In the history of Major League Baseball, third base has been the most misunderstood, misrepresented and underappreciated position on the diamond.\n\nAfter being the Marlins' shortstop for the past six seasons, Hanley Ramirez will move to third base for the 2012 season. Nick Laham/Getty Images\n\nNo other position has been more difficult to scout or been home to a wider spectrum of ability; after all, it is where the great Brooks Robinson and, for a while, Dave Kingman played. Third baseman is a place of contradiction, an orphan position, a lonely station where few players want to play but where many have, briefly and often, poorly. It is a position about which many questions are asked, and so often the answer is: I Don't Know.\n\nThis is relevant again because the Tigers are planning to play Miguel Cabrera at third base in 2012, and the Marlins will play shortstop Hanley Ramirez at third. This is not a story on whether Cabrera or Ramirez can play third, it is a story about the position and its understated degree of difficulty because it requires so much: offensive production, great hands, quick reactions and quicker feet, a strong arm and a very large dose of courage.\n\nI was there for the first game in spring training that Alex Rodriguez played at third base after his trade to the Yankees before the 2004 season. Rodriguez had moved from shortstop, a position he had played his entire career, a position that he was on his way toward becoming the best ever to play, someday replacing Honus Wagner. But Rodriguez moved to third in order to play for the Yankees. In his first game at third base, the second batter of the game, the Phillies' Jason Michaels, whistled a one-hopper past A-Rod's left ear. A-Rod never even moved.\n\n\"That was quite an introduction to third base,\" I said to him after the game.\n\n\"I never saw that ball,\" he said.\n\n\"Did that ever happen at shortstop?\" I asked.\n\n\"Never,\" he said.\n\nCal Ripken began his career as a third baseman, moved to shortstop for 15 years, then moved back to third. \"I used to get hit in the cup at third, then I moved to shortstop, and I never got hit in the cup,\" he said. \"Then I moved back to third, and got hit in the cup again.\"\n\nThat is what Ramirez is in for. That is what Cabrera is in for again in his move back to third base after four years away from playing the position. When Chipper Jones moved back to third base after a year in left field, the first chance he got was one of those diabolical, top-spin, in-between-hop smashes to his left. Miraculously, he handled it cleanly for the out, and later said, \"I'm glad I got a ball like that in the first game. The position was saying, 'Welcome back.'\"\n\nJones is an example of the lack of respect the position has received in baseball history. He is, by any definition, one of the five greatest third basemen of all time, and yet, it is amazing how many people question whether he is a Hall of Famer. That is not even a debate; he unquestionably is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, his numbers compare favorably to those of George Brett and no third baseman in history has a higher OPS than Jones. And yet, partly because of the position, people aren't sure what to do with those who play third base. That explains, in part, why there are fewer third basemen in the Hall of Fame than any position.\n\nJones was signed as a shortstop but was moved to third base after suffering a serious knee injury. Matt Williams was signed as a shortstop and was moved to third, as were Troy Glaus and many others. It is a difficult switch, especially late in a career. Just ask Rico Petrocelli and Jim Fregosi, who said it took a great deal of time getting used to being so close to the hitter. Doug Rader, a five-time Gold Glover at third, also was signed as a shortstop but was moved to third because of his size. He said playing third base \"was like recovering a fumble.\"\n\n\"I concentrated every pitch at shortstop, but you have to do it more at third,\" Ripken once said. \"You have to make yourself ready for your own safety. On a ball hit to third, you can't afford to take a step back. You have to be like a hockey goalie. There's some fear. And there is no comfort zone. You're on edge. It's a highly stressful, anxious position.\"\n\nNo one played it better than Robinson, who won 16 Gold Gloves. He had great hands, and his body was seemingly relaxed at all times. He often took ground balls from his knees to get himself ready, and he was semi-ambidextrous: He writes and eats with his left hand.\n\n\"It's much more difficult for a shortstop or second baseman to move to third than vice versa,\" said Robinson, who was signed as a second baseman and moved to third. \"At second and shortstop, you can position yourself after the ball is hit. You just don't have time at third.\"\n\nRon Santo, recently elected to the Hall of Fame as a third baseman, remembered playing deep at third one day in spring training in 1959 when the Dodgers' Frank Howard came to the plate. \"He was the biggest person I'd ever seen in my life,\" Santo said. \"He hit a one-hopper that hit me in the stomach and knocked me out. When I woke up in the hospital, there he was again, standing over me. I said, 'Am I in heaven? Who is this giant?'\"\n\nMiguel Cabrera will move from first base to third base to make room for Prince Fielder in the Tigers' lineup for the coming season. Tim Fuller/US Presswire\n\nAll sorts of players in major league history have tried to play third. For some, it didn't work as well as they hoped, so they moved to another position: Harmon Killebrew, Steve Garvey, Tony Perez and Richie Allen started at third and ended up at first. Near the end of his career, the Red Sox briefly put Carl Yastrzemski at third; it didn't go well, and Yaz desperately asked former Red Sox third baseman Frank Malzone, \"Can you help me?\"\n\nIn the late '80s, Yankees manager Billy Martin played Don Mattingly a few games at third; Mattingly throws left-handed. Ryan Braun, the Most Valuable Player of the National League in 2011, started his major league career at third but was moved to left field, where he has become very good defensively.\n\nIt's a cyclical thing, but the game has a number of very good third basemen these days, including Jones, Rodriguez, David Wright, Ryan Zimmerman, Evan Longoria, Adrian Beltre, Scott Rolen, Kevin Youkilis, Pablo Sandoval and Aramis Ramirez. The Blue Jays have perhaps a new young star at third in Brett Lawrie. The Phillies have Placido Polanco, who didn't wear a cup as a second baseman because it slowed him down making the double play, \"but I definitely wear one now that I'm playing third,\" he said with a smile. And the Cardinals have David Freese, who won the MVP of the 2011 NLCS and World Series.\n\nAnd now, two more stars will move to third base -- Ramirez and Cabrera. Will Ramirez adjust to being so much closer to home plate? Will Cabrera move well enough to play the position? Will they continue to hit at the same rate they did at their previous positions?\n\nI don't know.\n\nThat's third base.\n\nTim Kurkjian is a senior writer for ESPN The Magazine.

But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world.\" - from Sporting Life's obituary of Billy Barnie\n\nBilly Barnie played four seasons in the majors and managed 14 years. His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/prelude-to-the-formation-of-the-american-association/", "page_content": "This article was written by Brock Helander\n\nThis article was published in The National Pastime: From Swampoodle to South Philly (Philadelphia, 2013)\n\nSix of the eight most populous cities in the United States were not represented in the National League for the baseball season of 1881. New York, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Cincinnati were not members of the League, which included only two charter members (Chicago and Boston) and teams from the smaller cities of Cleveland, Buffalo, Detroit, Providence, Worcester, and Troy. Nonetheless, independent teams throughout the United States enjoyed both popularity and financial success and the need for a second major league became obvious. The prelude to the formation of the American Association in November 1881 is herein examined in the context of the September Western tours of the interregnum Atlantics and Athletics and the principals supposedly involved in a preliminary meeting in October.\n\nThe Atlantics of Brooklyn was a venerated name in the early history of baseball. The club, organized on August 14, 1855,1 was a member of the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) from 1858 to 1870, playing professionally in 1869 and 1870.2 An Atlantic club was also a member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) from 1872 through September 1875 when it disbanded. An entirely new Atlantic nine formed to play on the Capitoline Grounds in April 1878, but in less than two weeks, most of the team, including Candy Cummings and Bill Barnie, were spirited away to New Haven by Ben Douglas for his International Association team.3 Another Atlantic team, initially attributed to Barnie, was organized in April 1879 by manager Jack Chapman, but by the end of May he had left to manage an International Association team in Holyoke.4 Eventually, Barnie, in April 1881, organized yet another Atlantic team to play at the Union Grounds, joining the short-lived Eastern Championship Association.5\n\nThe Athletics of Philadelphia originally formed as a town ball club on May 31, 1859, and reorganized as a base ball club on April 7, 1860.6 The Athletics were members of the NABBP from 1861 to 1870, playing professionally in 1869 and 1870, in the NAPBBP from 1871 to 1875, and in the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1876.7 After being expelled from the NL for failing to complete their final Western trip, an independent Athletics team organized in 1877 as a stock company under new president Charles H. Downing and joined the League Alliance in order to protect the club from player raids by National League clubs.8 The Athletics reorganized for 1878 under manager Alfred H. Wright, utilizing 40 players en route to a 45\u201316\u20131 record as an independent team.9 Yet another Athletic club formed in 1879 under William W. Hincken and reorganized for 1880 with William Sharsig as president.10 With Sharsig as nominal president through 1883, the 1881 Athletics joined the Eastern Championship Association under manager Horace Phillips.11\n\nThe Westerners\n\nO.P. Caylor and Justus Thorner. Oliver Perry Caylor, born in Dayton, Ohio, on December 14, 1849, was admitted to the bar in Cincinnati in 1872, but opted for a journalistic career with the Cincinnati Enquirer in November 1874. Ascending to the position of sports editor, Caylor garnered a reputation for his clever, humorous, and often acerbic reporting.12\n\nJustus Thorner, a manager for local breweries, was president of the semi-professional Star Club of Cincinnati in 1879.13 After President J. Wayne Neff of the rival Cincinnati National League club announced that his players would be released on October 1, 1879, and forwarded the club\u2019s resignation from the League, Thorner met with National League president William Hulbert in Chicago, formally applying for membership in the League.14 At the annual meeting of the National League, held in December in Buffalo, New York, rather than Cincinnati, as originally scheduled, the organization\u2019s Board of Directors admitted the Star Club to membership and Thorner was elected to the Board of Directors.15 On December 22, the stockholders of the new Cincinnati club elected directors and officers, including Thorner as president.16 Thorner and Caylor represented the club at a special meeting of the National League on February 26, 1880, in Rochester, New York.17\n\nIn early July, the directors of the club requested and received the resignation of Thorner as president, and W.C. Kennett represented Cincinnati at the special meeting of the League on October 4 at Rochester, New York. Henry Root, president of the Providence club, proposed an amendment to the League constitution that would prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages on club grounds and the use of such grounds for Sunday baseball, both of which the Cincinnati club depended on. All except Kennett pledged to vote in favor of the amendment at the League\u2019s December meeting.18 On October 6, the membership of Cincinnati in the League was declared vacant.19\n\nBy late April 1881, a new baseball club had been formed in Cincinnati. It began play in St. Louis May 28, with Caylor reporting on the games.20 Only days earlier, the leasehold and grounds of the Cincinnati club had been sold to \u201cfour prominent Cincinnati gentlemen,\u201d later revealed to be Caylor, Thorner, Victor Long, and John Price.21 Caylor resigned his position with the Cincinnati Enquirer in August, ostensibly to return to the practice of law. Nonetheless, Caylor soon joined the staff of the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette.22\n\nAlfred Spink. Alfred Henry Spink was born on August 24, 1854, in Quebec, Canada. Moving with his family to Chicago after the Civil War, he moved in 1875 to St. Louis, Missouri, where his brother Billy was sports editor for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Soon thereafter, Alfred began covering baseball for the Missouri Republican, subsequently becoming sporting editor for a number of St. Louis newspapers, including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Becoming acquainted with saloon owner Chris Von der Ahe, vice president of the Grand Avenue Base Ball Club in 1877, Alfred and Billy began organizing semi-professional baseball teams in 1878. Their 1879 team, called the Browns or Brown Stockings, won 20 of 21 games.23\n\nBecause dates and sources conflict, the baseball situation in St. Louis becomes convoluted beginning in 1880. Most likely Al Spink, with veteran player Ned Cuthbert, organized the co-operative St. Louis Browns and, with a number of local men, organized the St. Louis Base Ball Association.24 In May, another team using the Brown Stockings name was organized under the presidency of Chris Von der Ahe.25 By the end of May, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat was referring to Cuthbert\u2019s club as the Reds or Red Stockings and Von der Ahe\u2019s club as the Browns or Brown Stockings.26\n\nIn October, Von der Ahe and others formed the Sportsman\u2019s Park and Club Association, with Spink as secretary, and secured the lease on Grand Avenue Park, which was to be enlarged and improved and would be known as Sportsman\u2019s Park.27 In March 1881 the Sportsman\u2019s Park and Club Association incorporated.28 The Brown Stockings were organized in April, formally opening Sportsman\u2019s Park on May 22 with a defeat of the rival St. Louis Red Stockings before at least 2,500 people.29 Five of the Browns players had been members of the Reds in 1880, most significantly Bill and Jack Gleason.\n\nThe Easterners\n\nHorace B. Phillips. Horace B. Phillips was born in Salem, Ohio, most likely on May 14, 1853, yet earlier reported as May 20, 1856.30 Growing up in Philadelphia, he began his baseball playing career with local amateur teams in 1870. Securing his first professional engagement with the Philadelphia club in 1877, Phillips soon succeeded Fergy Malone as manager. A baseball vagabond in his early career, he subsequently played for and managed clubs in Hornellsville and Syracuse, New York, before managing clubs in Troy and Baltimore in 1879 and Baltimore and Rochester, New York in 1880. Returning to Philadelphia in 1881, Phillips was reported managing the independent professional Athletics team by the end of May.31\n\nBilly Barnie. William Harrison Barnie, born in New York City on January 26, 1853, began playing for amateur baseball clubs in Brooklyn at an early age, manning the Nassau club for three years beginning in 1870 and the Atlantics of Brooklyn in 1873. He initiated his professional career with Hartford in 1874, playing with the Buckeye club of Columbus, Ohio, in 1876 and managing it in 1877. Barnie played for and managed the Buffalo club later in 1877 and was a member of the Atlantics team that moved to New Haven, then Hartford, in 1878. After playing for the Knickerbocker club of San Francisco in 1879 and 1880, he returned to Brooklyn and organized an independent professional Atlantics club in April 1881, becoming its secretary.32\n\nThe Pittsburghers\n\nAl Pratt. Albert G. Pratt was born on November 19, 1848, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and joined the Union Army at the age of 15, serving in the infantry. He helped form the Enterprise Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh in 1866 and later joined the Allegheny Club. After a season with the Riverside Club of Portsmouth, Ohio, Pratt pitched for the famous Forest City Club of Cleveland from 1869 to 1872. He returned to Pittsburgh and pitched for the Enterprise club from 1873 to 1875 and played with the Xantha club from 1876 to 1879.33 Pratt then served as a National League umpire in 1879 and substitute umpire in 1880.34\n\nH.D. \u201cDenny\u201d McKnight. Harmar Denny McKnight was born in 1847 in Pittsburgh and graduated from Lafayette College in 1869. Pursuing a business career, he became director of an iron manufacturing company in 1876. That year he helped organize the independent Allegheny baseball club, serving as one of its directors. The following year McKnight was instrumental in the formation of the International Association of Professional Base Ball Players and served as its president after Candy Cummings resigned. However, the Allegheny club disbanded in June 1878.35\n\nOut West\n\nAs Alfred Spink stated in his book The National Game: \u201cI wrote to O.P. Caylor, then the sporting editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer and I suggested to him the idea of picking up all that was left in Cincinnati of the old professional players, forming them into a nine, christening them the Cincinnati Reds and bringing them here to play three games on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday with my reconstructed St Louis Browns.\u201d Spink continued: \u201cMr. Caylor, accepting my suggestion, quickly got together a team of semi-professionals, called it the Cincinnati Reds and brought it here to help open the reconstructed St. Louis baseball grounds, which my brother William had named Sportsman\u2019s Park.\u201d36 Their Sunday, May 29 game, won by the Browns 16\u20132, drew an estimated four thousand spectators, making it a substantial success.37\n\nMore Spink: \u201cThe Dubuques, the Cincinnati Reds and the Chicago prairie teams came to St. Louis and the games drew such crowds, especially on Sundays, that soon news of the prosperity wave reached the East.\u201d38 Among the well-attended Sunday games in St. Louis were the July 3 game against the Eckfords of Chicago (4,000), the July 17 game against Dubuque (nearly 5,000), and the August 14 game against the Buckeyes of Cincinnati (over 5,000).39\n\nSpink: \u201cLater I wrote to Horace B. Phillips, then managing the Athletics of Philadelphia, and to William Barnie, then operating the Atlantics of Brooklyn. Both the Athletics and the Atlantics were free lances outside the pale of the National League and were willing to come all the way to St. Louis to meet the St. Louis Browns for a division of the gate receipts.\u201d40 Barnie later reminisced: \u201cHorace Phillips of the Athletics and myself then formed the idea of organizing a big league. We learned through the papers that large audiences were being attracted by base ball teams in Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis and began negotiating for a trip to those cities. The Western clubs guaranteed us more than enough to pay our expenses on the round trip. We accepted and both the Atlantics and Athletics took the journey.\u201d41\n\nIn late July, Cincinnati applied for admission to the National League for 1882.42 In mid-August Phillips was reported to be in Chicago, meeting with National League President William Hulbert to request admission for the Athletics, who withdrew the application within two weeks and released Phillips only days before the October meeting.43\n\nThe Atlantics of Brooklyn and the Athletics of Philadelphia formed one of the most intense rivalries during baseball\u2019s pioneer era. This graphic depicts a match between the clubs at Philadelphia from 1865.\n\nThe Tours\n\nThe Athletics were the first to embark on a Western tour. On September 2 in Louisville the Athletics defeated the Eclipse of Louisville, with manager Phillips playing in center field. The next day in St. Louis, the St. Louis Browns beat the Athletics. On Sunday, September 4, before an astounding 7,000 fans, the Browns proved victorious. The final game in St. Louis September 5 was won by the Athletics. Returning to Louisville, the Athletics on September 8 lost to the Eclipse morning and afternoon games. On September 9 the Athletics defeated an ad hoc team in Cincinnati.44 According to one source, Thorner found out about the game and joined the crowd of 200 in the eighth inning.45 Later, in a letter to the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette, Phillips stated that he did indeed consult Caylor on this occasion.46 The next day on their way home, the Athletics lost to the Detroit National League club in Allegheny (near Pittsburgh) before 2,000 fans, with Al Pratt serving as umpire.47\n\nAfter defeating the Athletics in Philadelphia on September 14 and 15, the Atlantics arrived in Louisville on September 17 and bested the Eclipse. The next day the Eclipse prevailed and again on September 19. On September 22 the Eclipse again won. Heading to St. Louis, the Atlantics prevailed over the Browns on September 24, scoring the winning run in the top of the ninth. On Sunday, September 25, the Browns were victorious. The game scheduled for September 26 was canceled due to the death of President Garfield. The third game, postponed due to rain, was played September 28, but was suspended due to darkness with the score Atlantics 13, Browns 12. The following day, the Atlantics beat the St. Louis Reds by the identical score. As the St. Louis Browns devolved into chaos at the beginning of October, the Atlantics defeated one of the clubs claiming the Browns\u2019 name on October 9. On their way home to Brooklyn, the Atlantics stopped over in Philadelphia and defeated the Athletics.48\n\nPhillips, upon his return to Philadelphia, stated that \u201cthe movement [to form a new league] was meeting with great favor in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Louisville, and Cincinnati\u2026.\u201d49 The Cincinnati Enquirer, probably Frank Wright, agreed: \u201cThe outlook is very promising. (A) scheme is on foot to organize a new association, to include St. Louis, Louisville, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and New York. Already the proposition has been entertained in St. Louis and Louisville, and a meeting will be held in Pittsburgh, October 10, to perfect arrangements.\u201d50 The Clipper reported: \u201cTHE NEW ASSOCIATION will hold a meeting Oct. 10 in Pittsburgh. Clubs who intend sending representatives will please communicate with H.B. Phillips, Great Western Hotel, Philadelphia Pa.\u201d51\n\nOne of the most enigmatic figures of nineteenth-century baseball, president Chris Von der Ahe led the St. Louis Browns to four consecutive pennants during the ten-year existence of the American Association.\n\nThe Meetings\n\nWho was actually at the meeting is a matter of conjecture. Justus Thorner\u2019s 1889 account of the meeting erroneously stated that Phillips was there. Later, Caylor stated: \u201cThe Association was christened at the Pittsburgh meeting, and neither Mr. Phillips nor Mr. Von der Ahe was present.\u201d52 Nonetheless Thorner recalled: \u201cWe called another meeting at the St. Clair Hotel, Pittsburgh and I brought on with me O.P. Caylor from Cincinnati and another reporter named Wright. These two, Mr. Phillips and myself were all the people who showed up\u2026. Phillips and I took a stroll into Diamond Street and there learned that a baseball crank named Al Pratt was working in one of the mills and we found him. He told us of Denny McKnight and he was also secured. [W]e organized for all practical purposes, and I suggested that we have baseball representatives at Louisville, Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and St. Louis to send me their proxy as to where the next meeting should be held. We led everyone wired to believe that he was the only one absent from the meeting, and that caused an immediate reply.\u201d53 In another account by Thorner from 1894, he stated: \u201cIt was during the latter part of 1881 that I read in some paper of a call for a meeting, at a Pittsburg hotel, of all those favoring a new baseball organization. In company with O.P. Caylor I took a run down to Pittsburg and\u2026found the call to be on the order of a hoax, as no one showed up outside Caylor and myself. I inquired of the hotel keeper whether any one in town was fond of baseball, and was referred to Denny McKnight and Al Pratt. We called on these gentlemen\u2026. We then declared the meeting adjourned to Cincinnati, November 2, and Caylor and I returned home.\u201d54\n\nThe day after the meeting, numerous newspapers published virtually identical accounts. Possibly authored by Frank Wright of the Cincinnati Enquirer, the report was replete with misspellings and name-dropping, perhaps in an effort to impress prospective league members. It stated, with the correct names in parentheses, that temporary officers chosen were M.F. Day (John B. Day), of the Metropolitan club, Christ Van Derahe (Von der Ahe), James J. Williams (James A. Williams), and H.D. McKnight. Justus Thorner and Charles Fulmer were appointed to a committee to draft a constitution and by-laws.55 John B. Day was owner of the highly-successful independent professional New York-based Metropolitan club and James A. Williams was a former pitcher and the secretary, treasurer, and main driving force behind the recently defunct (Inter)National Association.56 Charles Fulmer was a prominent Philadelphia baseball player who accompanied the Athletics on their Western tour.57 Despite the supposed selection of officers, none of the accounts specifically stated who was actually present at the meeting.\n\nThe New York Clipper was more circumspect: \u201cAn informal meeting was held Oct. 10 in Pittsburg in the place of the proposed convention of clubs to organize a new Association, at which there were but two or three of the representatives of the clubs present who were to have sent delegates. After some talk together it was resolved to hold a meeting for permanent organization at the Gibson House, Cincinnati, Nov. 2.\u201d58\n\nDespite numerous unanswered questions, conventional wisdom holds to Harold Seymour\u2019s account. That is, that Phillips instigated the meeting but dropped out; that Justus Thorner, Caylor, and Frank Wright went to Pittsburgh and met with Al Pratt and Denny McKnight; and that they sent to prominent non-National League clubs telegrams worded so as to give the impression that each absentee was the only one not present at the meeting.59\n\nThe American Association of Professional Base Ball Clubs formed on November 2, 1881, at the Gibson House in Cincinnati, Ohio, with six charter members; the Athletics of Philadelphia, the Atlantics of Brooklyn, St. Louis, Cincinnati, the Alleghenys of Pittsburgh, and the Eclipse of Louisville. Delegates to the convention included O.P. Caylor and Justus Thorner, Chris Von der Ahe, Billy Barnie, and Denny McKnight. Charles Fulmer represented the Athletics, and Horace Phillips represented the Philadelphia club of Al Reach. After some talk of consolidation, Fulmer was admitted as the representative of the Athletics, and Phillips was excluded. McKnight was made temporary chairman and Jimmy Williams was chosen temporary secretary.60 At the March 1882 meeting of the American Association, the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn resigned, to be replaced by a club from Baltimore.61\n\nThis 1865 photograph of the Atlantics of Brooklyn by Charles H. Williamson depicts the \u201cChampion Nine\u201d of 1864 and was given to opposing teams who played The Atlantic Club. In September and October of 1882 the club undertook a tour, making stops for multiple games in Philadelphia, Louisville, and St. Louis, with a second stop in Philadelphia on the way home. Such tours were part of the basis of formation of the league known as the American Association.\n\nAfterword\n\nWho should receive credit for the formation of the American Association? Alfred Spink and O.P. Caylor had been reporting baseball since 1875. Justus Thorner had been involved in Cincinnati baseball since 1879. Veterans Billy Barnie and Horace Phillips had faced each other on the field for years, including 1881, when their teams were members of the Eastern Championship Association. Spink helped form an independent team in St. Louis and encouraged Caylor to do the same in Cincinnati. Spink wrote to Philips and Barnie, inviting their teams west. Barnie and Phillips noted the success of teams in St. Louis, Cincinnati and Louisville. Caylor and Phillips met in September. Soon thereafter, Phillips issued the call for the first meeting. All these men deserve a measure of credit in this enterprise.\n\nBROCK HELANDER is the author of \u201cThe Rock Who\u2019s Who\u201d (1982), \u201cThe Rock Who\u2019s Who Second Edition\u201d (1996), \u201cThe Rockin\u2019 \u201950s\u201d (1998), and \u201cThe Rockin\u2019 \u201960s\u201d (1999).

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://researchworks.oclc.org/archivegrid/collection/data/56024769", "page_content": "Details\n\n1 folder\n\nPlayer file includes material documenting his baseball career and personal life.
