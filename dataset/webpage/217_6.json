I am also greatly appreciative of the support I have received over the years from the Engineering and Physical Research Council, The Defence Research Agency, the Leverhulme Trust, Merck KGaA, and Kingston Chemicals Ltd.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, when I read about the details of the medal, which dates back to 1826, and saw the list of the past winners, I was surprised by how few chemists there were, and yet how many of them were household names in chemistry. That I should be associated with such chemists is daunting and yet humbling!\u201d\n\nProfessor Duncan Bruce, Head of the Department of Chemistry, added: \u2018Working in the same field as John, I am very well aware of the impact that he has made and the esteem in which he is held in the field. I am delighted that the Royal Society has seen fit to recognise his achievements in this way.\u201d\n\nProfessor Goodby was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011 and in 2013 he was awarded the Derek Birchall Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry for creativity and excellence in materials chemistry for Industry. In 2014, he won the AkzoNobel UK Science Award for outstanding contributions in self-assembling and self-organizing materials.\n\nFurther information: The Royal Medal awarded to John Goodby is one of the Royal Society\u2019s six premier awards.

His main publication was that of the \u201c On the Origin of Species\u201d.\n\nAwards that he received were the Royal Medal in 1853 (The royal medal was awarded annually to only 3 people by the Royal Society) the royal medal is given to those for the most important contributions to the natural knowledge, The Wallaston Medal in 1859, the Wallaston medal is specifically scientific award for geology, it is the highest award that is granted award given by the Geological Society of London , and The Copley Medal in 1853 (Also distributed by the Royal Society) is given to those for outstanding achievements in the research in any of the branches of science, and it alternates between the physical sciences and biological studies. These are the some of the awards that recognized Charles Darwin for his work."}]}
