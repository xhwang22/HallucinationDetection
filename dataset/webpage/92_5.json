It adapts elements from several Don Camillo stories by Giovannino Guareschi. Ren\u00e9 Barjavel wrote the French dialogues.\n\nIn the early fifties in the small Italian town of Brescello, skirmishes are continuing between the priest Don Camillo (Fernandel) and the Communist mayor Giuseppe \"Peppone\" Bottazzi (Cervi). After staging a theft of Don Camillo's prized chickens in retribution for a political prank pulled by the priest, Peppone decides to enter the big game of politics by standing for national deputy. A winsome young lady comrade sent from the big city to assist him, but the mayor's wife suspects there's more and complains to Don Camillo, who endeavours to remedy the threatened domestic breakdown.\n\nFollowed by Don Camillo: Monsignor.\n\nDon Camillo's Last Round provides examples of:"}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonCamillo", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonCamillo\n\nDon Camillo (played by Fernandel ) and Peppone (played by Gino Cervi ) in the 1950s-1960s films.\n\nDon Camillo is a series of successful and much beloved books, movies, TV shows and audio dramas about the enmity and friendship between a Catholic priest and a Communist mayor in a small town in post-World War II Italy.\n\nThe Don Camillo stories were written by Giovannino Guareschi starting in 1945 for his satirical magazine Candido, and soon afterward compiled into books. The series is originally entitled Mondo piccolo, referring to the \"little world\" of the villages and small towns in the Po valley near Parma. Most of the stories published in periodicals, and all of those that were anthologized into books, center on the hotheaded priest Don Camillo (who often talks to Jesus... and with Jesus talking back to himnote According to the author, the voice of Jesus is his (the author's) conscience.) and his eternal rivalry with Giuseppe \"Peppone\" Bottazzi, the communist mayor of his little town. The town is not named in the stories, while in the films it is called Brescello after the one where the exterior shots were made. Both are authority figures for the town, both fought in the war together, and both like using their fists to decide their arguments. Most of the stories tell about the life in a small town, where everybody knows everybody, but many people do not like each other, which is pretty accurate as small towns go...\n\nIt is pretty much a historical document of a time when both the Italian Communist Party and the Roman Catholic Church had a grassroots-like basis in Italian society but were diametrically opposed to each other in quite a few teachings, but if you went down to their basics they were quite similar in many respects. Even if neither would have never admitted it to anyone.\n\nThe Don Camillo stories present this conflict on a smaller scale: a small, rural town in the Po valley. Both sides are represented by Don Camillo and his parishioners on the one side, and Peppone and his communists on the other. Of course even the most staunchly communist party member in Peppone's band still is a good Italian Catholic, and even if they might decry the church at every possible moment, they still will come to Don Camillo for everything important (baptisms, funerals, weddings...). Don Camillo on the other hand is not as staunchly against the Communist cause as some of his wealthiest parishioners would like: he sees the reasons why poor people turn to communism, and he decries the greed and avarice of the rich catholic landowners. \"I don't listen to you, you're a Bolshevik priest!\" one of them says when Don Camillo does not immediately take his side.\n\nDon Camillo and Peppone go back a long time, and they make a show of not liking each other, for political reasons. On the other hand, they both appreciate and even respect each other, and neither of them actually can live without the other. When don Camillo is Reassigned to Antarctica at the end of the first movie, Peppone tries to get him back. Even if Peppone would never admit to that.\n\nAll that plays out in front of typical small town stories: most of the stories are rather short, light reading; the movies are mostly collections of stories, weaving together the short tales from the books with meandering plots. But often they also provide a biting commentary on social ills of the time, with a healthy dose of humour.\n\nThe franchise consists of:\n\nBooks:\n\nMondo Piccolo \"Don Camillo\" (The Little World of Don Camillo, 1948)\n\nMondo Piccolo: Don Camillo e il suo gregge (Don Camillo and His Flock, 1953)\n\nIl Compagno Don Camillo (Comrade Don Camillo, 1963)\n\nDon Camillo e i giovani d'oggi (in USA: Don Camillo Meets the Flower Children, 1969, England: Don Camillo Meets Hell's Angels, 1970)\n\nGente cos\u00ec (1980)\n\nLo spumarino pallido (1981)\n\nNoi del Boscaccio (1983)\n\nL'anno di Don Camillo (1986)\n\nIl decimo clandestino (1987)\n\nCiao Don Camillo (1996)\n\nDon Camillo e Don Chich\u00ec (1996)\n\nFilms:\n\nThe 1950s-1960s movies starring Fernandel and Gino Cervi:\n\nA sixth film for the above series, fr. Don Camillo et les contestataires/ it. Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi (Don Camillo and the Red-Haired Girl), was in the making in 1971 when Fernandel collapsed while shooting. He died a month later, the movie unfinished. Out of respect for him, the studio completely remade the movie with different actors (Gino Cervi refused to make a new film without Fernandel) instead of showing the unfinished movie.\n\nThe World of Don Camillo (it. Don Camillo) was a remake by Terence Hill as director, producer and main actor, with his complete family in supporting roles.\n\nLive-Action Television:\n\nThe BBC made a TV series in 1980, with Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and BRIAN BLESSED as Peppone.\n\nThere is a Colombian series, which changes the setting to Colombia in the fifties.\n\nRadio Dramas:\n\nThe BBC made a radio drama series in 2001, starring starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as Jesus.\n\nComic Books:\n\nA comic-book adaptation authorized by Guareschi's children was launched in 2011. It is notable that every album also adapts a couple of the Mondo piccolo stories that do not contain Don Camillo or Peppone and that \u2014 not least for copyright reasons \u2014 the two main protagonists are not based on Fernandel and Gino Cervi, but on the author: Don Camillo was visually based on photographs of Guareschi as a clean-shaven young man, Peppone on the older, moustachioed Guareschi.\n\nTropes found in the Don Camillo series:"}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Don_Camillo_and_Peppone", "page_content": "Fictional characters\n\nLeft image: Peppone statue in front of the\n\nRight image: Don Camillo statue in Brescello. : Peppone statue in front of the Brescello city hall.: Don Camillo statue in Brescello.\n\nDon Camillo ( pronounced [\u02c8d\u0254\u014b ka\u02c8millo]) and Peppone ( pronounced [pep\u02c8po\u02d0ne]) are the fictional protagonists of a series of works by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi set in what Guareschi refers to as the \"small world\" of rural Italy after World War II. Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine Candido, founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca. These \"Little World\" (Italian: Piccolo Mondo) stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.\n\nDon Camillo is a parish priest and is said to have been inspired by an actual Roman Catholic priest, World War II partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, named Don Camillo Valota (1912\u20131998).[1][2] Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of Trepalle, near the Swiss border. Peppone is the communist town mayor. The tensions between the two characters and their respective factions form the basis of the works' satirical plots.\n\nCharacterisation [ edit ]\n\nIn the post-war years (after 1945), Don Camillo Tarocci (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the Po valley in northern Italy. He is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was Brescello (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.\n\nDon Camillo talking with Jesus . He is wearing a black biretta\n\nDon Camillo is constantly at odds with the Communist mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as Peppone (meaning, roughly, 'Big Joe') and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.[3] The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.\n\nWhat Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been partisan fighters during World War II; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \"the reactionaries\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches fire and brimstone against \"godless Communists\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the Virgin Mary and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.\n\nPeppone and his comrades are sometimes seen at odds with the city-based Communist bureaucrats, who are sometimes seen as \"barging in\" and trying to dictate policy to the local Communists without knowing the local conditions. This is paralleled by Don Camillo sometimes coming into serious conflict with his Bishop, on one occasion a case of flagrant disobedience leading to Camillo being exiled to a tiny village high in the mountains; however, the Bishop is soon forced to reinstate him at the strong demand of his parishioners (including the Communists).\n\nAs depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The Italian Christian Democratic Party, the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.\n\nMany stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal vendettas in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.\n\nPolitical forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small Italian Liberal Party has scheduled an election rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up\u2014only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.\n\nIn one story, Don Camillo visits the Soviet Union, pretending to be a comrade. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \"decadence\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the owner of several profitable dealerships, riding the \"Boom\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo \u2013 at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems: the Second Vatican Council has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chich\u00ec, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.\n\nDespite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \"political enemies\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).\n\nGuareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \"three marble balls\" or \"three billiard balls\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of Trepalle (literally \"three balls\"), a real town (near Livigno) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.\n\nBooks in chronological order [ edit ]\n\nThe following Italian language books have been published:\n\nMondo Piccolo: Don Camillo .

These were French-Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi, quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were:\n\nChristian-Jaque began filming the French-Italian film Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi[11] in 1970 but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 by Mario Camerini with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (The World of Don Camillo; Italian: Don Camillo) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.[12]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nA BBC Radio English-language radio dramatization of The Little World of Don Camillo was broadcast in 2001 starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on BBC Radio 7.\n\nFour further BBC Radio series of The Little World of Don Camillo were made, with the final series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006.[13] Ian Hogg replaced Armstrong as Don Camillo, while Prendergast, Ackland and Moffatt all continued to reprise their roles as Peppone, God and the Bishop respectively. BBC Radio 7 broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October.[14]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nIn 1980, the BBC produced a well-received television series, The Little World of Don Camillo, based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and Englishman Brian Blessed as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was Cyril Cusack. Thirteen episodes were screened on BBC 2 at 9pm on Thursday nights from January 8th 1981 to April 2nd 1981. As of 2023, the series has not been rebroadcast or released on DVD/Blu-ray.[15]\n\nIn Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called Don Camilo. The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called \"La Violencia\" when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred Carlos Benjumea as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), Hector Rivas as Peppone (Pep\u00f3n in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando M\u00fanera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego Le\u00f3n Hoyos and Manuel Pach\u00f3n as Peppone flunkies.

Scarpelli enjoyed a lengthy writing partnership, from 1949 until 1985, with Agenore Incrocci, also known as Age. The pair collaborated on the 1958 film I Soliti Ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street), about a team of makeshift thieves, which owed much of its success to the brilliant comic characterisations. The film, starring Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni, helped to launch the genre of commedia all'italiana (\"comedy Italian-style\").\n\nScarpelli was born in Rome. His Neapolitan father, Filiberto, was a satirical writer who founded a humorous magazine, Il Travaso delle Idee. Furio began his own career as a cartoonist. It was after the second world war, aged 30, that he began to work in the cinema, on a film by a little-known director, Giorgio Ferroni, called Vivere a Sbafo (A Life of Smears, 1949). The film was seen by the comedian Tot\u00f2, who brought together Scarpelli and Age to work on a script for him that year, Tot\u00f2 Cerca Casa (Tot\u00f2 Looks for a Home). Like most of the comedian's films over the following years, it is still popular with Italian TV audiences today. Tot\u00f2 e Carolina (1955), also co-written by Scarpelli and Age, ran into trouble with the censors of the time because it made fun of a policeman.\n\nScarpelli collaborated, uncredited, on the dialogue of Don Camillo e l'Onorevole Peppone (1955), starring Fernandel, the most popular comedy of those years when communism and the Catholic church were at loggerheads. In 1958 the producer Franco Cristaldi commissioned Scarpelli and Age to co-write Big Deal on Madonna Street with the director Mario Monicelli. The film enjoyed success at home and abroad.\n\nThe next year Dino De Laurentiis, who had Alberto Sordi under contract, obtained the rights to a script which Age and Scarpelli had written for another producer about two grotesque Italian soldiers in the first world war. La Grande Guerra (The Great War, 1959) was directed by Monicelli with Sordi and Gassman in the leading roles. The film pilloried the catastrophic conduct of the Italian military hierarchy during the war. It shared the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival in 1959 with Roberto Rossellini's Il Generale della Rovere.\n\nAge and Scarpelli continued working together on some of the most successful Italian films of the 1960s and 70s. Comencini's Tutti a Casa (Everybody Go Home, 1960) was another swipe at Italian military behaviour, this time after the armistice of 1943. In Monicelli's most popular film, L'Armata Brancaleone (The Brancaleone Brigade, 1966), Age and Scarpelli's target was the buffoonery of Italian medieval crusaders.\n\nThe comedy Casanova '70, produced by Carlo Ponti and intended to exploit Mastroianni's recently won international fame as a \"Latin lover\", earned Monicelli and his scriptwriters, including Scarpelli and Age, an Oscar nomination for original screenplay. The pair also collaborated on films with deeper social intentions, such as Monicelli's I Compagni, in which Mastroianni gave one of his most admired performances as an upper-class professor and socialist intellectual who wants to help organise a factory strike in Turin in the 1890s.\n\nAge and Scarpelli continued to work with many other leading Italian directors, including Pietro Germi on a spoof of Italian provincial life, Signore & Signori (The Birds, the Bees and the Italians, 1966); Sergio Leone on his colossal western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), a violent film quite outside their previous experience; and Dino Risi on In Nome del Popolo Italiano (In the Name of the Italian People, 1971), with Gassman and Ugo Tognazzi, which showed how corruption in Italian society was a disease that democracy had not cured.\n\nScarpelli would later comment bitterly: \"I'm afraid the Italian film comedy's influence on Italian society has been minimal. What flowered was a mass of commercial films destined just to amuse and make money.\" He admitted: \"We writers must accept some of the blame ... we're not Moli\u00e8res or Gogols.\" Even so, Scarpelli was a serious professional. His scripts for the director Ettore Scola included C'eravamo Tanto Amati (Those Were the Years, 1974), a sympathetic attempt to recount how some of those who fought nobly in the anti-fascist resistance were disillusioned with the comfortable bourgeois Italy in which they now lived.\n\nNeither Scarpelli nor Age was interested in directing. \"The scripts we write require a close collaboration with the director and often with the actors,\" Scarpelli explained. \"The profession of scriptwriter gives us ample satisfaction.\" After an amicable separation in 1985 with Age, who died 20 years later, Scarpelli carried on working with others. His collaboration on Il Postino was minimal but he shared an Oscar nomination with the other screenwriters: Michael Radford (the film's director), Massimo Troisi (the film's star), Anna Pavignano and Scarpelli's son, Giacomo.\n\nThe last script on which he worked was Stefania Sandrelli's directorial debut, Christine Cristina (2009). Sandrelli said that Scarpelli left an \"aura of magic on the set when he visited us\".\n\nHe is survived by his wife Cora, and their sons, Matteo and Giacomo."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Don_Camillo_and_Peppone", "page_content": "Fictional characters\n\nLeft image: Peppone statue in front of the\n\nRight image: Don Camillo statue in Brescello. : Peppone statue in front of the Brescello city hall.: Don Camillo statue in Brescello.\n\nDon Camillo ( pronounced [\u02c8d\u0254\u014b ka\u02c8millo]) and Peppone ( pronounced [pep\u02c8po\u02d0ne]) are the fictional protagonists of a series of works by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi set in what Guareschi refers to as the \"small world\" of rural Italy after World War II. Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine Candido, founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca. These \"Little World\" (Italian: Piccolo Mondo) stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.\n\nDon Camillo is a parish priest and is said to have been inspired by an actual Roman Catholic priest, World War II partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, named Don Camillo Valota (1912\u20131998).[1][2] Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of Trepalle, near the Swiss border. Peppone is the communist town mayor. The tensions between the two characters and their respective factions form the basis of the works' satirical plots.\n\nCharacterisation [ edit ]\n\nIn the post-war years (after 1945), Don Camillo Tarocci (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the Po valley in northern Italy. He is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was Brescello (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.\n\nDon Camillo talking with Jesus . He is wearing a black biretta\n\nDon Camillo is constantly at odds with the Communist mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as Peppone (meaning, roughly, 'Big Joe') and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.[3] The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.\n\nWhat Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been partisan fighters during World War II; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \"the reactionaries\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches fire and brimstone against \"godless Communists\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the Virgin Mary and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.\n\nPeppone and his comrades are sometimes seen at odds with the city-based Communist bureaucrats, who are sometimes seen as \"barging in\" and trying to dictate policy to the local Communists without knowing the local conditions. This is paralleled by Don Camillo sometimes coming into serious conflict with his Bishop, on one occasion a case of flagrant disobedience leading to Camillo being exiled to a tiny village high in the mountains; however, the Bishop is soon forced to reinstate him at the strong demand of his parishioners (including the Communists).\n\nAs depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The Italian Christian Democratic Party, the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.\n\nMany stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal vendettas in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.\n\nPolitical forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small Italian Liberal Party has scheduled an election rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up\u2014only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.\n\nIn one story, Don Camillo visits the Soviet Union, pretending to be a comrade. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \"decadence\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the owner of several profitable dealerships, riding the \"Boom\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo \u2013 at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems: the Second Vatican Council has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chich\u00ec, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.\n\nDespite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \"political enemies\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).\n\nGuareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \"three marble balls\" or \"three billiard balls\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of Trepalle (literally \"three balls\"), a real town (near Livigno) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.\n\nBooks in chronological order [ edit ]\n\nThe following Italian language books have been published:\n\nMondo Piccolo: Don Camillo .

These were French-Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi, quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were:\n\nChristian-Jaque began filming the French-Italian film Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi[11] in 1970 but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 by Mario Camerini with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (The World of Don Camillo; Italian: Don Camillo) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.[12]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nA BBC Radio English-language radio dramatization of The Little World of Don Camillo was broadcast in 2001 starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on BBC Radio 7.\n\nFour further BBC Radio series of The Little World of Don Camillo were made, with the final series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006.[13] Ian Hogg replaced Armstrong as Don Camillo, while Prendergast, Ackland and Moffatt all continued to reprise their roles as Peppone, God and the Bishop respectively. BBC Radio 7 broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October.[14]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nIn 1980, the BBC produced a well-received television series, The Little World of Don Camillo, based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and Englishman Brian Blessed as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was Cyril Cusack. Thirteen episodes were screened on BBC 2 at 9pm on Thursday nights from January 8th 1981 to April 2nd 1981. As of 2023, the series has not been rebroadcast or released on DVD/Blu-ray.[15]\n\nIn Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called Don Camilo. The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called \"La Violencia\" when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred Carlos Benjumea as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), Hector Rivas as Peppone (Pep\u00f3n in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando M\u00fanera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego Le\u00f3n Hoyos and Manuel Pach\u00f3n as Peppone flunkies. The series was broadcast on Mondays at 10:00 pm by Cadena 2 (Se\u00f1al Institucional now) and rebroadcast by Se\u00f1al Colombia in 2011 and Canal Uno in 2014.\n\nThai novel [ edit ]\n\nThe Little World of Don Camillo was adapted by the Thai writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj into his own 1954 novel, Phai Daeng (Red Bamboo).\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nSources [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://rateyourmusic.com/film/don_camillo_e_lonorevole_peppone/", "page_content": "Reviews\n\nThere are no reviews for this film.
