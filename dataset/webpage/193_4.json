I was talking with him and he said in the U.S. he had a big opportunity to do the [MotoAmerica], and he had Steve Scheibe doing a team, and it\u2019s quite good. We started to talk. After that, I get in touch with Steve and here we are right now.\u201d\n\nBarrier said he did not start following the racing in America until 2016, when riders he knew like Toni Elias and Claudio Corti started competing in the MotoAmerica series.\n\n\u201cYeah, for sure, because I know them from Europe. I was curious to see what was going on over here, and it was quite good,\u201d said Barrier. \u201cFrom last year, [MotoAmerica] get really famous in Europe, like a lot of people were talking about it.\u201d\n\nAs for his test at COTA, Barrier said there was a lot of new things to take in, so he focused on getting comfortable and not trying to do too much too fast.\n\nFinal lap for the #hayesbrakes #scheiberacing bmw #Barrier28 good couple of days of tire testing at #COTA. Full video coming soon. #bmwmotorrad #bmwmotorsport A post shared by Ryan Stephen (@freestylesupermoto) on Mar 30, 2017 at 6:59pm PDT\n\n\u201cToday was the first time on the bike and the first time on the track,\u201d Barrier said, after the first day of the test. \u201cI love the track. Really, I love the track. Also, first time on the U.S. Dunlops. It was quite interesting. There was a lot of things to learn, a lot of things to have sensation with, but it\u2019s ok. Every session we improve. In the last session we put on the new tires, but it\u2019s so easy to get in the air. I wanted to keep my foot on the ground just to be OK. I know I can go faster for sure, easy, but I wasn\u2019t ready to do it today. I just want to take my time. The first days, even the first race is very important [to make] the base really strong to come back more stronger and more faster for the future.\u201d\n\nIn spite of it being his first visit to COTA, his BMW being closer to Superstock than Superbike spec (except for a set of \u00d6hlins forks and Hayes brake calipers), and him not using a qualifying tire at the end of the test, Barrier finished with a best lap time of 2:12.155, which ranked him 13thoverall and ninth among Superbike riders."}, {"url": "https://www.worldsbk.com/en/news/2013/Sylvain%20Barrier%20dominates%20STK1000%20Aragon%20race", "page_content": "Sylvain Barrier dominates STK1000 Aragon race\n\nSylvain Barrier concludes the first battle of his FIM Superstock 1000 Cup Title defence campaign in the best way by winning the 12-lap race at Alcaniz MotorLand Aragon. The BMW Motorrad GoldBet rider, after he got the lead from Niccol\u00f2 Canepa (Barni Racing Ducati) on lap 3 at Turn 16, down the long straight, rode comfortably and kept a pace quick enough not to let the former WSBK rider close the gap.\n\n\n\nBarrier's 6th win in the series completes the perfect weekend for the French youngster, who has proved once again to be the man to beat in 2013, following yesterday's pole position. The STK1000 comeback for Niccol\u00f2 Canepa proved to be a successful one: the experienced rider from Genova led the early part of the race and tried not to lose contact with Barrier, but the lack of horsepower on the straight didn't help his mission.\n\n\n\n3rd rider on the podium was Argentinian Leandro Mercado (Team Pedercini Kawasaki), back for a full Superstock 1000 with some great confidence shown on track. Wasted opportunity for Jeremy Guarnoni (MRS Kawasaki), who early on during the race was closing the gap with the front but, due to a small mistake that pushed him back to 10th place, was forced to make his way back to a final 4th, snatched from Eddi La Marra (Barni Racing Ducati) on the last lap thanks to an overtaking manoeuvre at Turn 16 - and a 0.040 seconds margin on the finish line.\n\n\n\nPotential podium finisher Lorenzo Savadori (Team Pedercini Kawasaki) lost control of his ZX-10R on lap 7, while he was on 3rd position and closing the gap to the front.
