{"Paul Elliott has served on the Work and Pensions Select Committee since 2015.": [{"url": "https://www.ioshmagazine.com/2021/03/23/hse-grilled-over-its-covid-response-select-committee-hearing", "page_content": "Unions and the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) leaders clashed over the enforcement of COVID guidance at work last week, as MPs on the Department of Work and Pensions Select Committee heard diametrically opposing views on the regulator's activities as the two sides gave their accounts of the last 12 months.\n\nTUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak argued that the HSE had been 'found wanting' during the pandemic, where around 14,500 people of working age had lost their lives but the HSE had issued just two prohibition notices over COVID failures, plus a quoted figure of 235 improvement notices.\n\nIn 2019/20, the HSE issued 1,800 prohibition notices and 5,000 improvement notices across all risks. Prospect general secretary Mike Clancy set the figures in the light of the HSE\u2019s shrinking budget, telling the committee that the enforcement agency currently had just 390 full-time, warranted inspectors, while \u00a314 million from the DWP budget assigned last May and ring-fenced for its COVID response was 'less than 10% of the funding that\u2019s been cut' over the past decade.\n\n'You can\u2019t divorce the assessment of the HSE\u2019s performance in the last year from the journey it\u2019s been on in the previous ten years \u2026 it\u2019s experienced a 54% real terms reduction in its funding,' Clancy told MPs.\n\nBoth unions argued that the HSE\u2019s decision to categorise COVID-19 as a 'significant' occupational risk rather than a 'serious' one had dictated low enforcement levels.\n\nThe TUC also argued that there should have been a requirement for employers to publish their COVID risk assessments, with its own survey evidence finding that only half of workers were confident that their employer had carried out a risk assessment.\n\n'It's the opposite of complacent; we really have turned the organisation on its head to respond to COVID'\n\nBut HSE chief executive Sarah Albon countered that its approach \u2013 which included hiring two firms of COVID 'spot checkers' to boost presence on the ground while also relying on the soft power of policy and guidance \u2013 was broadly correct, with the relatively low number of notices explained by the fact that employers were far more aware of COVID-19 guidance than other workplace risks.\n\nSenior HSE executives, union leaders and representatives of the construction and manufacturing sectors gave evidence to a non-inquiry session of the DWP Select Committee, set up to revisit the committee\u2019s 2020 inquiry on the DWP\u2019s COVID response but not necessarily to produce a report.\n\nCommenting on the hearing, solicitor Rhian Greaves, director at Pannone Corporate, detected 'a clear disparity' between the perception of the regulator (and the industry representatives) and that of the unions, with polar opposite views on display.\n\n'The former talked about businesses trying to do the right thing, implementing familiar control measures in the workplace and with some success; Sarah Albon indicating that the level of compliance with COVID measures had been \u2018significantly better\u2019 than is routinely the case with typical health and safety risks.\n\nThe union representatives however felt the \u2018lived experience\u2019 of their members had not been reflected in the level of enforcement action taken and that there was an absence of any \u2018realistic chance of enforcement\u2019.\n\nCentral to the debate was the regulator\u2019s categorisation of COVID-19 as a 'significant' workplace health risk in its Enforcement Management Model (EMM) \u2013 a decision the HSE defended but Clancy described as 'failing to read the room of civic opinion' while Nowak said that it 'sends entirely the wrong message to employers across the country'.\n\nThe EMM is a 46-page guide to inspectors designed to standardise responses to workplace hazards, advising when to \u2018engage\u2019 employers and when to escalate to enforcement action.\n\nThe union representatives told the inquiry this limited inspectors\u2019 ability to enforce, and failed to create a deterrent effect. 'The reality is that employers need to know that if they breach that safe work guidance, there's a realistic chance of them being served an enforcement notice by the HSE,' Nowak said.\n\n'[The classification] limited the scope of the inspectors to issue prohibition notices, [as] there is a higher threshold to be met when issuing notices. Inspectors have raised this, through their own union, and it puts individual inspectors in a very difficult position.'\n\nHe added that the TUC was 'still seeing a significant numbers of workplace outbreak reports, just yesterday in terms of DHL facility in Trafford Park, in Greater Manchester'.\n\nHSE chief executive Sarah Albon countered that the regulator had 'surgically' targeted its resources at workplaces where it believed the risk was not controlled, and that inspectors were able 'elevate' the risk to serious if they thought that was justified.\n\n'The reality is that employers need to know that if they breach that safe work guidance, there's a realistic chance of them being served an enforcement notice by the HSE'\n\nShe defended the decision on 'significant' rather than 'serious' as based on the best endeavours of 'a group of very experienced inspectors and scientists and policy makers', pointing out that the HSE was 'not using these words in their normal English meaning' but to describe the likely outcomes for a typical, healthy worker of being exposed to the hazard.\n\nQuoting from HSE guidance, Clancy noted that a 'significant' risk might cause a 'non-progressive condition or temporary disability', while a 'serious' risk would cause a permanent, progressive or irreversible disability, lifelong restrictions on work capability or a major reduction to quality of life.\n\nClancy argued that COVID-19 matched the HSE\u2019s definition of a 'serious' workplace risk, 'given the number of people suffering from \u2018long COVID\u2019, and the fact that 14,500 have lost their lives'.\n\nAlbon acknowledged that the classification \u2013 made in early summer 2020 then reviewed in the autumn \u2013preceded emerging evidence on long COVID, and would be subject to further review.\n\nShe also suggested that it could have been too blunt an instrument. 'And I think with perfect hindsight, we could have said there's categories one, two, and three [of significant risk].'\n\nBut when Labour MP Debbie Abrahams suggested that the categorisation 'reflected a complacent attitude to the issue as a whole last year', Albon interjected heatedly.\n\n'It's the opposite of complacent; we really have turned the organisation on its head to respond to COVID.\n\n'We've put so much resource [into COVID], so much time from both our policymakers, our scientists, our inspectors, as well as a whole new set of people. Because we absolutely recognise the central importance of getting this right,' she told the panel.\n\nAbrahams then withdrew her comment on 'complacency'.\n\nQuoting from a letter from Albon to the committee that suggested the HSE had received 18,000 concerns on COVID at work but issued just 33 improvement notices as a result, Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms MP, chair of the DWP Select Committee, asked why this number was so low.\n\nDirector of field operations Samantha Peace argued that enforcement figures were low as compliance levels with COVID-19 guidance were unusually high.\n\n'Employers are far more open and educated than we normally find because they're living that experience themselves. Whereas normally \u2026 they\u2019re not actually living the risks themselves, they\u2019re governing the workers who do, and it's a very different conversation.'\n\nAccording to Public Health England (PHE), there have been around 1,400 confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces that were identified by the agency then referred to the HSE.\n\nProfessor John Simpson, PHE head of public health, guidance and expertise for the COVID-19 response, said that the interface between HSE and PHE on this issue could merit review.\n\nHe said: 'Some workplace issues were actually being picked up by the public health system, and then referred to HSE, rather than the other way around. And so that, again, is something else that may be worth thinking about [in terms of] future legislation.'\n\nProfessor Andrew Curran, chief scientific adviser to the HSE, said that it would 'take a while to understand the role of the workplace in the transmission of the virus' given the parallel roles of transmission on public transport, workers\u2019 accommodation and in the community.\n\nHowever, the HSE was currently leading a 'hugely intensive' national study to investigate workplace transmission, where workers\u2019 samples would be genomically tested to establish transmission routes.\n\nThe TUC also highlighted that the HSE guidance for workplaces had not been updated since March 2021 despite an evolving understanding of the risk. Albon confirmed that an update reflecting employers\u2019 responsibilities as workers return to their workplaces was underway, and would cover ventilation strategies, vaccination and the use of workplace testing.\n\nFor more information on this and other topics raised at the hearing, visit our dedicated COVID section."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/12/the-guardian-view-on-select-committees-chairs-of-power", "page_content": "Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn invariably make the big political headlines, even when they skip prime minister\u2019s questions, as they did on Wednesday in order to be with the Spanish royal visitors, leaving Damian Green and Emily Thornberry to deputise capably. But a hung parliament is a backbenchers\u2019 parliament as much as a party leaders\u2019 parliament. It gives individual MPs and alliances an influence they would not have in a house with a working majority. It enriches the political texture. That\u2019s why the most important event at Westminster on Wednesday was not something that centred on party leaders or manoeuvring ministers. It was the election of the select committee chairs.\n\nThe current select committee system is one of the best things about parliament. Ironically it takes the form it does because of the expenses crisis, when the stock of politicians plummeted to a new low. Public dismay about MPs meant there was political space to argue that backbenchers should have more power to shake some of the cosiness out of the system. As a result, MPs ramped up the departmental scrutiny system. Though the political complexion of the chairs was still divided between the parties on a pro rata basis, the power to elect each of them was extended to all backbench MPs. This means, for example, that when a particular committee gets a Conservative or Labour chair, the Tory or Labour candidates who compete for the post have to win votes \u2013 not just Tory or Labour votes but votes from MPs of other parties too.\n\nThe upshot has been that independence and experience are beginning to matter more in getting a chair than a record of party loyalism or the patronage of the whips. The quality of the chairs has improved, and so has the readiness of the committees to produce reports that cause problems for government. True, the independence of the committees should not be exaggerated or romanticised. But chairs like the Tories\u2019 Andrew Tyrie on the treasury committee and Sarah Wollaston on health and Labour\u2019s Iain Wright on the business committee and Frank Field on work and pensions all displayed tenacity and bold thinking that helped illuminate big policy issues in the last parliament.\n\nOn Wednesday MPs elected the chairs for the new parliament. Some of these were uncontested, a process that sees Ms Wollaston continue her good work on health and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper carry on as the home affairs chair unopposed. Ten of the chairs, however, were decided by contests. These covered six Tory chairs, three Labour and the sole Liberal Democrat allocation. Many of these contests were fascinating, pitting one wing of the relevant party against another but requiring plausible candidates to canvass support and nominations from rival parties too. In most cases the winners were well qualified. The contest for the coveted Treasury chair, vacated by Mr Tyrie\u2019s retirement, produced a six-way contest in which the liberal anti-Brexit former minister Nicky Morgan gratifyingly defeated the reactionary and pro-Brexit Jacob Rees-Mogg (whose proposers included the SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black). There were significant new winners on the foreign affairs and education committees with Tom Tugendhat and Robert Halfon victorious. The race for the Labour chair of the business committee saw Rachel Reeves defeat Liam Byrne and two others.\n\nBritish politics is often nastily partisan and many feel it is going through a dark period. This was illustrated on Wednesday by the arid claim and counter-claim by each main party that the other was uniquely prone to abusing and vilifying opponents. The reality is that abuse is too prevalent in all politics and that all parties need to raise their game. But the committee contests and the work of the committees show politics on a much more worthy level. Along with lawmaking, scrutinising the executive is the key purpose of parliament. With the mammoth EU repeal bill scheduled for publication on Thursday, that role is more important than ever."}, {"url": "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.elliott", "page_content": "Summary\n\nProfessor Paul Elliott, CBE, FMedSci, FRCP, FPH trained in clinical medicine and epidemiology as a Wellcome Trust Clinical Fellow at St Mary's Hospital London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

The race for the Labour chair of the business committee saw Rachel Reeves defeat Liam Byrne and two others.\n\nBritish politics is often nastily partisan and many feel it is going through a dark period. This was illustrated on Wednesday by the arid claim and counter-claim by each main party that the other was uniquely prone to abusing and vilifying opponents. The reality is that abuse is too prevalent in all politics and that all parties need to raise their game. But the committee contests and the work of the committees show politics on a much more worthy level. Along with lawmaking, scrutinising the executive is the key purpose of parliament. With the mammoth EU repeal bill scheduled for publication on Thursday, that role is more important than ever."}, {"url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-mps-reward-failure-post-election-payouts/", "page_content": "Frank Field has formed a new party to fight for his seat against Labour. If Field loses, his parliamentary payout will cushion the blow | Niklas Halle'n/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 British MPs worried \u2014 in some cases almost certain \u2014 that they will lose their seat in a general election have an incentive to stand anyway: lots of cash.\n\nWith the major parties on a war footing for an election that could come as soon as the day after October 31 \u2014 when Boris Johnson has promised the U.K. will leave the EU, \"do or die\" \u2014 a host of lawmakers face an uncertain future. But the humiliation of losing their seat could be soothed by a redundancy payment that's double the statutory payout given to members of the public who lose their jobs.\n\nWhile there's no suggestion that any MPs are standing just to get the money, the choice facing them is clear: Quit before the election and get nothing; or stand, and if they fail to get reelected, get a check. It's been called a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d to contest elections.\n\nFrank Field, who resigned from the Labour Party last year after almost 40 years as the MP for Birkenhead in the northwest of England, announced earlier this month that he would stand at the next general election.\n\nThe 77-year-old chair of the work and pensions select committee has formed a new party, Birkenhead Social Justice, to fight a seat that had a Labour majority in 2017 of more than 25,000 votes.\n\n\u201cAt a time when distrust in politics is running high, it seems odd that defeated MPs can get double the maximum redundancy available to ordinary voters\" \u2014 Willie Sullivan, senior director at the Electoral Reform Society\n\nIf the people of Birkenhead choose the new Labour candidate over Field, he would get a \u00a331,500 \u201closs of office\u201d payment, plus up to two months of his MP salary (worth \u00a313,244) for the time spent winding up his office and any other administrative tasks needed to be done.\n\nWith the political climate being so volatile, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (a House of Commons watchdog that makes the redundancy payments) could be writing a number of checks.\n\nIPSA rules say that MPs who have served for at least two years and lose their seats get double the statutory redundancy pay that members of the public get, as well as the two-month salary allowance, plus winding-up expenses for staff or removal costs.\n\nStatutory redundancy is calculated based on age and the number of years a person has held a job, up to a certain limit. Field\u2019s payout would be the maximum possible for an MP.\n\nWillie Sullivan, a senior director at the Electoral Reform Society, a pressure group, said it is right that MPs put out of a job are compensated like any other public servant, \u201cparticularly if we want to see more diversity in politics.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, while there is no evidence the current situation is being abused, clearly it will need to be reassessed if there is a perverse incentive for MPs to always re-stand even if they do not wish to win.\"\n\n\u201cAt a time when distrust in politics is running high, it seems odd that defeated MPs can get double the maximum redundancy available to ordinary voters. There are many reasons people feel disenchanted, including a feeling of \u2018one rule for us, another for them.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndependents' fears\n\nIndependent MPs might seem at risk \u2014 for having left a party and for being away from the election machines of the Tories and Labour \u2014 but they could still hold on.\n\nJoe Twyman, co-founder and director at Datapoll, pointed to research showing that \u201cold, tribal loyalties to parties are not what they once were thanks to Brexit,\u201d with more people ready to vote along Leave/Remain lines.\n\n\u201cThat could mean that in certain circumstances, MPs who have switched to become independents could hold on depending on the constituency profile and indeed their own position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn normal circumstances you would expect an independent candidate to get absolutely nowhere at a general election\u201d \u2014 Joe Twyman, co-founder and director at Datapoll\n\nTwyman said that Field \u2014 a pro-Brexit candidate in a pro-Brexit constituency he has represented since 1979 \u2014 \u201cstands a very good chance of holding on.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank Field is the obvious example because he\u2019s been in so long and his margin of victory [in 2017] was so large,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the other candidates it\u2019s more difficult.\u201d\n\nOther new independents are yet to confirm whether they will stand again.\n\nEx-Labour MPs Ian Austin (Dudley North), Ivan Lewis (Bury South) and Angela Smith (Penistone and Stocksbridge) are in line for redundancy payments worth \u00a321,500, \u00a326,800 and \u00a323,000 respectively, plus the two months of salary, if an election comes before the end of the year.\n\nTheir former colleagues Luciana Berger (Liverpool, Wavertree), Gavin Shuker (Luton South) and John Woodcock (Barrow and Furness) are all in line for \u00a39,400.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) has racked up a \u00a35,800 redundancy pot, while Nick Boles (Grantham and Stamford) has amassed \u00a314,200.\n\nFormer Change UK then independent MP Sarah Wollaston joined the Lib Dems this week, but is highly unlikely to win her Totnes seat back. She would be due \u00a314,200 in redundancy payments if she stands in the seat and loses.\n\nElsewhere, the MPs that make up the Independent Group for Change \u2014 the successor to Change UK, which performed dismally at the European Parliament election in May \u2014 are also facing possible defeat.\n\nFormer Labour MPs Mike Gapes (Ilford South) and Ann Coffey (Stockport) are in line for the maximum \u00a331,500 loss-of-office payment if they stand in their existing seats and lose.\n\nChange leader and ex-Tory Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) has built up a \u00a314,200 redundancy pot, while former Labour MPs Chris Leslie (Nottingham East) and Joan Ryan (Enfield) have \u00a312,600 and \u00a36,300 waiting in the IPSA bank.\n\n\u201cIn normal circumstances you would expect an independent candidate to get absolutely nowhere at a general election,\u201d Twyman said. \u201cIndependents usually get about 100 votes and nobody pays very much attention to them.\u201d\n\nBut, he added: \u201cObviously this is a different case because in a lot of instances what we are looking at are sitting MPs who are then running as independents or indeed as groups of independents or as minority parties and all that sort of thing.\n\n\"Even then you would expect them to have very little chance in normal circumstances, but these are far from normal circumstances.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect Sarah Wollaston's new party affiliation.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
