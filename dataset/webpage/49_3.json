Two British Queens \u2014 Elizabeth II who will celebrate 70 years on the throne in 2022 and her great-great-grandmother Victoria (who reigned for 63 years) also had lengthy reigns. But few know that the fifth prince of Monaco is also on the list of the longest-reigning European monarchs: after coming to the Monegasque throne in 1733 he reigned for nearly 60 years and so passed his ancestor Honor\u00e9, Lord of Monaco, who ruled for 58 years in the XVI century.\n\nAscension to the Throne at the age of 13\n\nHonor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi was born on November 10, 1720. He was the son of Louise-Hyppolite, and the grandson of Prince Antoine I, who both died in 1731. Honor\u00e9 came to the throne just after turning 13 when his father, Prince Jacques I, abdicated. Prince Honor\u00e9 III spent much of his time away on campaign with the Royal French Army fighting the English in the War of the Austrian Succession. Honor\u00e9 III was wounded fighting in the French victory at Rocoux. Later, he earned the Cross of St Louis for his conduct and after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 he was given the rank of Marshal of France.\n\nWhat is interesting is that despite the heroic service of Honor\u00e9 III in the wars, the Principality of Monaco was neutral in the conflict and, administered by the Chevalier de Grimaldi, assisted both French and English ships in need of help. The Austrians and Sardinians did blockade the Monegasque coast for a time and much of the countryside was pillaged by Croat soldiers of the Austrian army but French forces later cleared the region of all invaders in 1748.\n\nThe Royal Marriage\n\nIn 1757 Honor\u00e9 III married Maria Caterina di Brignole-Sale who was descended from the Doges of Genoa and called \u201cthe most beautiful woman in France\u201d. They were a very proud family and the arrival of the bride-to-be in Monaco turned into a disaster as many of the bridal attendants were seasick and the future mother-in-law insisted that Honor\u00e9 III come onboard to greet his fianc\u00e9 and escort her ashore. However, as a monarch in his own right, Honor\u00e9 III refused as it was considered a breach of protocol for a prince to go to meet someone rather than them being brought to meet him. A stand-off ensued and eventually the Genoese fleet sailed away and stopped farther up the coast before a compromise was negotiated by which the couple would meet in the middle of a bridge extended between ship and shore. Nonetheless, the two were married and in 1758 the future Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was born followed by Prince Joseph some years later. In 1770, though, Honor\u00e9 III and Princess Maria Caterina divorced, and she later married the Prince de Cond\u00e9 in 1798.\n\nIn 1767 the British Duke of York was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa when he was suddenly taken ill and had to put in at Monaco. Prince Honor\u00e9 III quickly offered all the help he could and put his palace at the disposal of the Prince who died after 11 days in what has forever after been known as the York Room of the Princely Palace.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Honor\u00e9 III did what he could to guide his little principality along, improving trade and the economy which was heavily dependent on growing citrus fruits such as lemons in those days. His reign also saw the establishment of the first printing press in Monaco and the first newspaper the \u2018Courrier de Monaco\u2019. Prince Honor\u00e9 III did take the initiative in pushing for some reforms, the most major of which was the repeal of the law that the Sovereign Prince would receive the inheritance of anyone who died on his property. On August 18, 1770 Honor\u00e9 saw the practice, which he viewed as barbaric, abolished.\n\nThe French Revolution, Arrest and Imprisonment\n\nAs France slipped increasingly rapidly towards revolution things in Monaco remained calm and peaceful until the fateful day of July 14, 1789; the date of the storming of the Bastille. The shock spread to Monaco where crowds embraced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, influenced by the rise of republicanism in France as well as some newly introduced nostalgia for the Genoese Republic. Honor\u00e9 III was concerned with the loss of his noble titles in France at the hands of the French National Constituent Assembly which was intent on abolishing all aristocratic privileges and soon he rushed to Paris to try to defend his titles there before the Constituent Assembly.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was extremely convincing when dealing with the French revolutionaries. His estates were, he insisted, not the gift of the King of France alone but payment for services rendered in the cause of French national glory. He struck just the right cord and the Assembly voted a generous pension for the Prince of Monaco in reparation for his confiscated properties.\n\nUnfortunately, before the order could be carried out, Danton came to power and the republic was declared. In all the turmoil France lost interest in Monaco and ultimately all Honor\u00e9 was able to gain was recognition from the republican government of Monegasque neutrality. Unfortunately, that was a promise that would never be respected.\n\nThe French Republic declared their expansionist policy at the end of 1792. Monaco quickly fell victim to this policy and on January 13, 1793 Prince Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed by the Monegasque National Convention. Members of the Convention immediately filed a petition for accession to France. Some people in France however did protest on the grounds that Honor\u00e9 III had always been a loyal friend and ally of the French, but republican hatred of monarchy prevailed and Monaco was absorbed into the French Republic and renamed Fort Hercules.\n\nAt the height of the Reign of Terror Honor\u00e9 III was arrested as was his son, Honor\u00e9 IV, who had been in Paris at the time and who would remain imprisoned for 15 months. Honor\u00e9 III had suffered greatly from his own imprisonment and after his release had to stay in his house on the rue de Varennes as the Princely Palace in Monaco had been confiscated by the revolution though, thankfully, there was no \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019 or mass arrests and bloodshed in Monaco. Overcome with sadness, suffering, a number of ailments and the ravages of old age Prince Honor\u00e9 III of Monaco died on March 21, 1795.\n\nIn 2020, the Principality paid a tribute to Prince Honor\u00e9 III by having issued a 2\u20ac commemorative coin celebrating the 300th anniversary of his birth. At the time of writing, the price of the coin, which was issued in 15,000 copies, has reached in the region of \u20ac300."}, {"url": "https://en.gouv.mc/Government-Institutions/History-and-Heritage/Personalities/Honore-III", "page_content": "Possessed of a modern, well-informed outlook and sensitive to Enlightenment thought, Honor\u00e9 III (1720 - 1795) aspired to make Monaco a part of the ideas that were sweeping up the capitals of the time. While he was spending his time increasing the recognition of the Principality in the courts of Europe, particularly the French and English courts, the Prince was faced with the failure of his industrialisation attempts, which were aimed at diversifying the Principality\u2019s resources, which were too seriously impacted by weather conditions.\n\nDue to France (whose support of the Prince\u2019s interests was feeble) being in an unfortunate situation, the borders between Monaco and the neighbouring States of Savoy were definitively established, in 1760, to the detriment of the Principality\u2019s legitimate plans.\n\nFinally, the last years of his reign were marked by the influence of French revolutionary ideas. Though the demands of the people were not comparable with those of France, the \u201cClub of the defenders of liberty and equality\u201d managed to sow the seeds of sedition among the population, to the extent that the Prince was removed, and a \u201cfree and independent republic\u201d was quickly united to France at the beginning of 1793."}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iii-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco is the longest-reigning sovereign of Monaco but the French Revolution had dire consequences for his family and caused the Principality of Monaco to be annexed to France from 1793 until the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814.

Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques; Credit \u2013 Wikipedia\n\nBecause of the poor relationship of his maternal grandparents, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s parents Louise-Hippolyte and Jacques decided to live in France. They spent their time between Jacques\u2019 mansion in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France where the de Goyon de Matignon family chateau, Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon, was located. Honor\u00e9 was mostly raised at the French court under the supervision of Anne Louise B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon, Duchess of Maine, the wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, King Louis XIV\u2019s legitimized son by his official mistress Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan.\n\nOn February 20, 1731, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s maternal grandfather Antonio I, Prince of Monaco died and his mother Louise-Hippolyte was now the Sovereign Princess of Monaco. Louise-Hippolyte had a very short reign of ten months. Several weeks before Christmas of 1731, a smallpox epidemic spread through the Mediterranean coastal areas. Louise-Hippolyte died from smallpox at the age of 34, on December 29, 1731.\n\nUpon Louise-Hippolyte\u2019s death, her husband Jacques was now the legal guardian of their ten-year-old eldest son Honor\u00e9 and had a plan. Jacques should rule as Prince of Monaco until Honor\u00e9 reached his twenty-fifth birthday. At that time, Honor\u00e9 would abdicate in favor of his father following the example of sons who gave up to their fathers land they had inherited through their mothers. Although the plan was initially accepted, it met with increasing opposition.\n\nFinally, in May 1732, Jacques handed over the rule of Monaco to his brother-in-law Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi, an illegitimate son of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco. Jacques\u2019 official abdication date was November 7, 1733, but he had long since returned to Paris with his eldest son who was now technically Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco. Antonio Grimaldi, Chevalier de Grimaldi became Governor-General of Monaco, was the de facto ruler of Monaco from 1732 until he died in 1784, and ably served as regent for more than fifty years for his nephew Honor\u00e9 III. Honor\u00e9 resided at his father\u2019s Paris home the H\u00f4tel de Matignon and spent much time at the French court at the Palace of Versailles. His father Jacques lived the remainder of his life in France, dying aged 61, on April 23, 1751, at his Paris home, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon.\n\nAs Colonel of the Regiment of Monaco, part of the French army, Honor\u00e9 III took part in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 \u2013 1748) and was wounded at the 1746 Battle of Rocoux and then at the 1747 Battle of Lawfeld. Honor\u00e9 had close ties to the French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. In 1756, Honor\u00e9 decreed that Monaco would be ceded to the King of France if the Grimaldi dynasty was to die out.\n\nOver the years, Honor\u00e9 III had declined many marriage proposals. In 1755, a marriage was proposed between 35-year-old Honor\u00e9 and 18-year-old Maria Caterina Brignole, daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi. Maria Caterina\u2019s parents came from two of the most powerful families in the Republic of Genoa. Her paternal grandfather Anton Giulio Brignole Sale, 5th Marquis of Groppoli had been Ambassador of the Republic of Genoa to France. Two of her paternal uncles were Doges of the Republic of Genoa. Maria Caterina\u2019s maternal grandfather Francesco Maria Balbi also had been a Doge of the Republic of Genoa.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III had previously been the lover of Maria Caterina\u2019s mother but wished to marry to provide an heir to the throne of Monaco. However, Maria Caterina\u2019s father opposed the marriage because of Honor\u00e9\u2019s bad reputation and because of his fear that Honor\u00e9 might inherit his fortune. In 1756, only after the intervention of King Louis XV of France and his mistress Madame de Pompadour did Maria Caternina\u2019s father consent to the marriage.\n\nThe wedding of Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina was to occur on July 5, 1757, in Monaco, and it got off on a bad foot. Maria Caterina traveled to Monaco by boat accompanied by a contingent of Genovese nobility. When they arrived, Honor\u00e9 did not come aboard the ship to welcome his bride. He said his status as a monarch demanded that Maria Caterina come to him. The Genovese contingent refused, saying that Maria Caterina was a member of a ruling family of the Republic of Genoa. The ship was stranded offshore for several days while a bridge was built between the port and Maria Caterina\u2019s ship. Honor\u00e9 and Maria Caterina walked towards each other at the same distance and met each other over the sea.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina had two sons:\n\nHonor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9\u2019s death, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for Honor\u00e9 III and his family. The Grimaldi family lost all aristocratic privileges in France and was dispossessed of their French property. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 III was arrested and imprisoned in Paris. Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 (IV) was also arrested as were Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s wife Louise d\u2019Aumont and his son Florestan. Honor\u00e9 (IV) was released after fifteen months in prison and his wife and son were saved by their family doctor.\n\nThe last victims of the Reign of Terror on their way to the guillotine \u2013 Among them was Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s daughter-in-law Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul\n\nThe wife of Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s other son Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution in Vend\u00e9e. His wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III was eventually released from prison. He died soon afterward in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. At 59 years, the reign of Honor\u00e9 III remains the longest in the history of Monaco. Following the defeat of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French in 1814, Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s son Honor\u00e9 IV, aged 56 and in ill health since his imprisonment during the Reign of Terror, returned to Monaco where he reigned as Sovereign Prince until his death in 1819.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Image via Wikimedia Commons. Zorn Anders, Mrs. Potter Palmer, 1893. Courtesy of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nImpressionist art looks irrefutably appealing today. Given the movement\u2019s beautiful landscapes, lush color palettes, and delicate brushwork, it\u2019s not surprising that one exemplar\u2014a haystack painting by Claude Monet\u2014recently sold for $110.7 million. Yet Impressionism was once a radical departure from realist, academic painting. In 1874, artists such as Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro abandoned the annual Parisian salons, which formalized European artists\u2019 ranks, to organize their own exhibitions. Even Monet\u2019s soft, light-filled canvases took years to catch on. Once they did, in the late 1880s, they helped pave the way for the modernist avant-garde and its fractured picture planes to dominate European art in the early 1900s. In the late 19th century, however, one woman from Chicago, Bertha Honor\u00e9 Palmer, made a bold move for her time to become a champion and major collector of Impressionist art. \u201cFew American women, if any, have in modern days appeared in the public eye in as distinctive a way as Mrs. Palmer,\u201d read an obituary in a 1918 issue of the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society. Before women even gained suffrage in the United States (in 1920), Palmer asserted her power through business dealings and art acquisitions. Her patronage ensured that Chicago became an essential city for viewing Impressionist masterpieces\u2014second only, perhaps, to Paris.\n\n\n\nFrom Louisville to Lake Michigan\n\nHiram Powers, Mrs. Potter Palmer, 1871.

Courtesy of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in Kentucky in 1850, Palmer followed the traditional aristocratic rituals of the 19th century American elite. Her father, Henry Hamilton Honor\u00e9, who did business in Chicago, made a canny social move by \u201cdebuting\u201d his daughter as an eligible bachelorette in the Windy City, instead of in Louisville. Her 1871 marriage to the wealthy Chicago businessman and hotelier Potter Palmer offered her more opportunities than a life in the sleepy South. Early in her marriage, Palmer displayed a commitment to the arts. She became a founding member of the Chicago Society of Decorative Art (later known as the Antiquarian Society of the Art Institute) in 1877, which helped impoverished women gain skills as artisans. The group sponsored education, teacher training, and, eventually, the development of the decorative arts collection at the Art Institute of Chicago. The group is still extant today, bringing the foremost scholars in the field to the city. In the early 1880s, the Palmers started construction on a new home on Lake Shore Drive that approximated the extravagant style of a European castle. Mrs. Palmer made it a destination for the Chicago aristocracy, throwing an annual New Year\u2019s bash that was a must-attend on the city\u2019s social calendar. An 1889 introduction to Paul Durand-Ruel, the most important dealer of Impressionist art at the time, laid the groundwork for her art education and purchases. Later that year, she bought her first Impressionist work for $500\u2014Edgar Degas\u2019s pastel On the Stage (1876\u201377), which features sprightly ballerinas in costumes represented by baby blue and delicate pink blurs. The Palmers eventually built an addition onto their home that served as a gallery for their art collection.\n\n\n\nA world\u2019s fair\u2013class collection\n\nClaude Monet, Meules, 1890. Courtesy of Sotheby's,\n\nPalmer got her major break as a cultural steward in 1890, when her peers elected her president of the Board of Lady Managers for the forthcoming World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893. For the event, she directed a chef to develop a brand-new \u201cladies dessert\u201d that would be less messy than pie\u2014and thus, the brownie was born. Palmer began traveling to Europe, meeting artists, looking at paintings and sculptures, and planning the exhibition. Throughout her transatlantic trips over the next couple of years, Palmer amassed most of her collection, eventually acquiring works by Pissarro, George Inness, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Mary Cassatt\u2014an American woman who, like Palmer herself, had absorbed the tenets of French Impressionism. Over her lifetime, Palmer purchased around 90 works by Monet, including nine haystack paintings\u2014one of them, Meules (1890), is the luminous example Sotheby\u2019s sold earlier this year for $110.7 million. She wasn\u2019t precious about the collection, though. Adopting lessons from her real-estate magnate husband, she sold paintings to make profits and fund new acquisitions. Yet Palmer\u2019s relationships with the artists she acquired could be deeply personal. Cassatt became a friend and advisor to Palmer, shaping her patron\u2019s taste and appreciation for Impressionism. Palmer also commissioned a major mural from Cassatt that decorated the Woman\u2019s Pavilion at the Columbian Exposition. Featuring women and nude babies, the massive, 58-foot-long triptych was a critical flop and disappeared just after the exposition closed. But the mural was a major step forward for the Chicago art scene: For the first time, the new Impressionist mode was on public view in the city. In the ensuing decades, Cassatt would become famous.\n\n\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nEdgar Degas, On the Stage, 1876\u201377. Courtesy of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nU.S. president William McKinley took note of Palmer\u2019s taste and diplomatic skills. In 1900, he appointed Palmer as the only woman to serve on that year\u2019s national committee for the Paris Exposition. Five years later, she became the only American woman to ever model for Auguste Rodin, after her friend and dealer, Sarah Hallowell, convinced Palmer to sit for the sculptor. Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e Rodin now owns five busts in plaster and marble of Palmer, plus a preparatory drawing. Despite Palmer\u2019s ambitions and connections, she was limited by the day\u2019s sexism and her own conservative mindset. She declined a prestigious designation from the Legion of Honor, believing that American women shouldn\u2019t take the foreign award. Her once-radical tastes also had their limits, and she was unimpressed after seeing work by Pablo Picasso and the German Bauhaus at the 1900 Paris Exposition. As if retiring from cultural stewardship, she moved to Sarasota, Florida, in 1910, and gave up art collecting for fruit farming. But by then, she\u2019d already made a definitive mark on the Chicago art scene. She made two bequests, totalling $500,000, to the Art Institute of Chicago, and sponsored a $1,000 prize for the best work shown at the museum\u2019s annual exhibition. Two of the museum\u2019s galleries are still devoted to works from Palmer\u2019s collection, which initially totalled 51 French paintings. An 1893 portrait of Palmer by Swedish artist Anders Zorn currently hangs in the Ryerson Reading Room, part of the European Painting and Sculpture Wing. In the picture, Palmer wears a white gown and tiara. Her likeness presides over the gallery like that of a fairy godmother, bestowing her blessing on the museum she helped build."}, {"url": "https://kids.kiddle.co/Honor%C3%A9_III,_Prince_of_Monaco", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco (Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor; 10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795) was a reigning prince of the small state of Monaco.

From 1862 to 1868 she worked under the guidance of Camille Corot. She first exhibited paintings at the Salon in 1864. Her work was exhibited there regularly through 1874, when she vowed never to show her paintings in the officially sanctioned forum again. In 1868 she met \u00c9douard Manet, with whom she developed a working friendship. He did several portraits of her (e.g., Repose, c. 1870). Manet had a liberating effect on her work, and she in turn aroused his interest in outdoor painting. In 1874 she married Manet\u2019s younger brother, Eug\u00e8ne, a writer and painter.\n\nBritannica Quiz Can You Match These Lesser-Known Paintings to Their Artists?\n\nMorisot\u2019s insistence on design aligns her work closer to Manet\u2019s than to that of her fellow Impressionists, whose interests in colour-optical experimentation she never assumed. Her paintings frequently depicted private moments (e.g., Woman at Her Toilette, 1875/80) and included members of her family, particularly her sister, Edma (e.g., Reading, 1873; and The Artist\u2019s Sister Edma and Their Mother, 1870). Delicate and subtle, exquisite in colour\u2014often with a subdued emerald glow\u2014they won her the admiration of her Impressionist colleagues. Like that of the other Impressionists, her work was ridiculed by many critics. Never commercially successful during her lifetime, she nevertheless outsold Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley. She was a woman of great culture and charm and counted among her close friends St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Edgar Degas, Charles Baudelaire, \u00c9mile Zola, Emmanuel Chabrier, Renoir, and Monet."}, {"url": "https://kids.kiddle.co/Honor%C3%A9_III", "page_content": "Honor\u00e9 III (Honor\u00e9 Camille L\u00e9onor Grimaldi; 10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795) ruled as Prince of Monaco and was Duke of Valentinois from 1731 to 1793.
