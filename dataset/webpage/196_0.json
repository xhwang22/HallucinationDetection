Because of his distinguished, above-reproach demeanor, Keane was often effectively cast as confidence men, shady attorneys and mystery murderers: after all, if he can convince the gullible folks people on-screen that he`s honest, it`s likely the audience will fall for the same line. Keane is warmly remembered by Laurel and Hardy fans for his roles in three of the team`s 20th Century-Fox films of the `40s, playing con artists in two of them (A-Haunting We Will Go and Jitterbugs). In the early `50s, Keane played Captain Brackett in the national touring company of Rodgers and Hammerstein`s musical triumph South Pacific.
