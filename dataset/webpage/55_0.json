That locks up resources by prolonging the lives of doomed ventures and making it difficult for VCs and employees to know where best to invest their money or labor. The Reason Founders aren\u2019t bad people. But when they lie, they fall back on flawed justifications, such as the need to protect investors and employees. They might tell themselves that because all entrepreneurs stretch the truth, they must do so to stay competitive. The Solution Moral philosophy can help founders remain truthful. They can dream big, but they must be honest about the evidence and assumptions underpinning their vision. And they should seek out partners, investors, and others who will help them be their best selves.\n\nIn the early days of Vice Media, cofounder Shane Smith sent a few copies of the Montreal-based start-up\u2019s fledgling publication to a record store in Miami and a skate shop in Los Angeles so that the company could tell advertisers its readership was distributed across North America\u2014an act befitting the monicker \u201cBullshitter Shane,\u201d reportedly bestowed on him by a friend and colleague.\n\nSuch chicanery is too common in the start-up world. The norms of entrepreneurship encourage founders to be hustlers and evangelists for their companies. Indeed, legendary founders are celebrated for their ability to inspire others, even if that means stretching the truth. Consider Steve Jobs, the quintessential start-up pitchman. Early Apple employees describe him as able to \u201cconvince anyone of practically anything.\u201d In the words of engineer Andy Hertzfeld, Jobs had a \u201creality distortion field, a confounding m\u00e9lange of a charismatic rhetorical style, an indomitable will, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a vital skill for founders, who must persuade their audiences to temporarily suspend disbelief and see the opportunity the entrepreneur sees: a world that could be but is not now. However, reality distortion is a slippery slope. Enthusiasm can lead to exaggeration, exaggeration to falsity, and falsity to fraud. This descent is embodied in Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder and Jobs devotee who allegedly deceived investors and customers by marketing bogus blood tests.\n\nThe Holmes case is rare; few entrepreneurs face criminal fraud charges, as Holmes did when this article went to press. But lesser indiscretions are common, including obfuscation, lies of omission, exaggeration, embellishment, evasion, bluffs, and half-truths. And they come at a cost. Deception results in market inefficiencies; it locks up resources by prolonging the lives of doomed ventures and making it difficult for VCs and employees to know where best to invest their money or labor. We believe it also takes a personal toll on founders, given the debilitating stress that often accompanies lying.\n\nReality distortion is a slippery slope. Enthusiasm can lead to exaggeration, exaggeration to falsity, and falsity to fraud.\n\nHow can we drive deception out of the start-up culture while also encouraging entrepreneurs to take risks and dream big? We have spent decades researching this question, and we bring a multidisciplinary approach to answering it. One of us (Kyle) is a successful founder turned academic; one (Jon) teaches business and philosophy; and two (Tom and Laura) hold academic appointments focused on ethical entrepreneurship. In this article we first explore why deception is so prevalent among entrepreneurs and then explain why common justifications for it are invalid. Finally, we suggest guidelines for behavior that can help entrepreneurs be both successful and honest\u2014to the benefit of all.\n\nWhy Entrepreneurs Lie\n\nThe Chicago economist Frank Knight was one of the first scholars to study the role of entrepreneurs in the modern capitalist system. In his 1921 book Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, he distinguishes entrepreneurs from other businesspeople by their willingness to act in the face of uncertainty. Of course, established businesses face uncertainty too\u2014but start-ups must navigate through a particularly dense fog. Entrepreneurs often don\u2019t know whether their product will work, how it will be manufactured, who the customers will be, or how they can be reached. For Knight, an entrepreneur is someone who, facing all this uncertainty, acts while others dither.\n\nBut action alone is insufficient. An entrepreneur needs others\u2019 help and must therefore be a persuasive cheerleader\u2014when pitching VCs for funding, wooing prospective employees away from cushy jobs, persuading customers to take a chance on a new product, and instilling confidence in the team amid the start-up\u2019s vacillating fortunes.\n\nThat\u2019s the first reason some entrepreneurs are less than truthful: They transgress because they have many opportunities to do so. More than most other businesspeople, they are always \u201con.\u201d\n\nThe second reason is that entrepreneurs have a lot on the line. As a group they stand to gain great wealth, but it\u2019s unevenly distributed. Research shows that the median entrepreneur has poor risk-adjusted returns\u2014statistically, founders would be better off working at an established company or holding a diversified index fund than holding their own equity. But what the median lacks, the maximum makes up for. A small percentage of entrepreneurs become enormously wealthy. Indeed, entrepreneurs dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nA thousand things must go right to earn such outsize rewards, and in any one meeting, a founder\u2019s fortunes might balance on a knife\u2019s edge. Failure can mean not just missing an enormous windfall but also letting down friends, family, employees, and investors. With stakes that high, it can be tempting to bend the truth.\n\nMark Laita\n\nThe third reason entrepreneurs are prone to deception is that it\u2019s relatively easy for them to get away with it. Entrepreneurship has a great deal of what economists call \u201cinformation asymmetry.\u201d Typically, founders lead private, closely held companies and possess lots of information that others\u2014investors, customers, employees\u2014don\u2019t have. The leaders of public companies have extensive transparency requirements and are under intense scrutiny; if they tell a lie, many people are in a position to discover it. But even in a venture-backed start-up with board oversight, only a tiny circle of people are privy to the company\u2019s internal workings, so deceptions can easily evade detection or go unchallenged. And because start-ups are, on average, staying private longer than they used to, such opacity is increasingly common and persistent.\n\nNone of this is to say that entrepreneurs are less ethical than other businesspeople. What little research is available suggests that on average, they have higher moral standards than corporate managers do. But the pressures that might tempt them to be less than completely truthful are enormous\u2014and decades of psychological study have shown that even people with high moral standards are likely to transgress in contexts in which ethical lapses are common and tolerated.\n\nHow Entrepreneurs Rationalize Their Lies\n\nMost founders who shade the truth under such pressures probably don\u2019t see themselves in a poor light. They often justify their actions through some combination of three rationalizations that are closely related to common ethical theories about what makes actions right or wrong. But each falls apart under even casual philosophical scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 Entrepreneur interviewed Gary Hirshberg, who built Stonyfield Farm from a two-person (and seven-cow) side hustle into one of the world\u2019s leading purveyors of organic yogurt. Stonyfield\u2019s success didn\u2019t always seem destined. Hirshberg recounted a series of dire moments and the deceptions that saved the company, including lies to vendors and a loan officer at the Small Business Administration. He offered several rationales, all common among entrepreneurs and related to well-known theories of ethics.\n\n\u201cI think lying, if we want to call it that, which I guess is what it should be called, for the common good, because in the end it didn\u2019t help the vendors for me to go under either, is OK as long as you ultimately do deliver,\u201d Hirshberg explained. This \u201cends justify the means\u201d rationalization harks back to the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, according to which an action should be judged solely on the basis of its consequences. \u201c[I]t is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong,\u201d Bentham wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m protecting my people.\u201d\n\nA variant of the \u201cends justify the means\u201d rationalization, this was invoked by Hirshberg as well. \u201cYou do whatever the heck you have to do to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were fighting for employees\u2019 jobs and our mothers\u2019 and mothers-in-laws\u2019 and friends\u2019 investments. Fighting for our lives. And I think anything goes, as long as you\u2019re not injuring anybody.\u201d Friends, family, and early equity investors and employees are often prioritized over stakeholders appearing on the scene later and at a further remove\u2014in Hirshberg\u2019s case, the SBA and his vendors.\n\nOf course, entrepreneurs can\u2019t know whether their lying will lead to better outcomes for their stakeholders or result in the greatest happiness for the greatest number. They are subject to forces beyond their control, and many who lie \u201cfor the common good\u201d will see their ventures fail. When that happens, it comes at the expense of stakeholders who were tricked into supporting them or harmed by risks they weren\u2019t given full and honest knowledge of.\n\n\u201cEverybody does it.\u201d\n\nHirshberg said of his vendors, \u201cIt\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t seen it before.\u201d According to this view, reality distortion is merely part of the game, like \u201cpuffery\u201d in advertising and bluffing in poker; it\u2019s not prohibited by the rules, and each person playing is responsible for knowing those rules. Sometimes the obfuscation is vague: During tech bubbles, some start-ups with only a small IT component tried to classify themselves as tech companies, because that would boost their valuation. Other times the fudging is more explicit, as when founders exaggerate anticipated revenue because they expect that investors will discount their numbers. In that scenario, a founder might reason, I have to say we will generate $50 million a year, because investors are going to discount the figure and hear $5 million a year; everybody knows that. Founders might also massage their financial models to produce outcomes they think VCs expect: a 10x return, a multibillion-dollar market. Those who don\u2019t exaggerate may rightly fear putting themselves at a disadvantage.\n\nMark Laita\n\nHirshberg is a successful entrepreneur, a prolific philanthropist, and no doubt a well-meaning soul. His comments capture the pressures all entrepreneurs feel and the rationales that can lead them to shade the truth. But they ultimately fail to hold water; they are excuses rather than sound arguments. They shift the responsibility for decision-making onto the supposedly uncontrollable and sometimes immoral norms of abstract institutions. \u201cBusiness is business,\u201d founders might say, absolving themselves of murky choices. But in our view, the business and start-up domains are no different from the rest of life, and they should be governed by the same ethics.\n\nThe Honest Entrepreneur\n\nMost entrepreneurs want to engender trust in others and prove themselves worthy of that trust. Few aspire to be scoundrels. Evidence suggests that for the vast majority of people, lying and deception cause considerable stress. For example, studies have shown that stress related to ongoing ethical dilemmas decreases job satisfaction and is a leading cause of burnout.\n\nThere is a better way, and it involves fostering virtue in all aspects of life, including the professional realm. In this Aristotelian worldview, actions are right if they are what a good (virtuous) person would do. In what follows we offer two practices from exemplary entrepreneurs whom we\u2019ve had the pleasure of teaching, hosting, or collaborating with.\n\nShow your evidence and assumptions.\n\nWhen entrepreneurs paint a picture of what could be, that picture is not fabricated wholesale; it\u2019s an evidence-based guess. The evidence consists of the entrepreneurs\u2019 experiences, primary data collected through experiments, traction gained, and third-party data\u2014in short, things they know. The guesses are things they don\u2019t yet know but believe or hope to be true.\n\nNot everyone draws the same conclusions from such inputs. Entrepreneurs owe transparency and truthfulness to those being asked to commit themselves or their resources to the venture. Of course, they should present a compelling vision. But they should also present the evidence and assumptions that support that vision. The principle is similar to the instructions given by eighth-grade algebra teachers: Show your work. A good venture capitalist will question a founder\u2019s assumptions at pitch meetings\u2014but not all VCs do, especially if they\u2019re courting a start-up that\u2019s in high demand. And prospective employees, partners, and other stakeholders often aren\u2019t given an opportunity to closely examine the evidence and assumptions and form their own conclusions about the company, team, or product they\u2019re being asked to support.\n\nBeing compelling and being forthright can seem at odds with each other. In some contexts, caveats and discussions of risks are inappropriate. A founder who lucks into an elevator ride with an investor simply conveys the compelling story. And in casual conversation, what\u2019s relevant is the vision. Leaving out the risks and the downside potential is expected and not in any way deceptive.\n\nBut in a context where analysis and evaluation of the opportunity are the focus, such as a formal pitch or a conversation with a potential hire, entrepreneurs must articulate evidence and assumptions and yet still be persuasive. We propose a \u201cconclusion sandwich.\u201d The best entrepreneurs begin and end with their conclusion\u2014the extrapolation\u2014 and place their evidence and assumptions in the middle. A founder might say, \u201cWe\u2019ll make about $X million next year in gross revenue. Let me show you the evidence we have and the assumptions that support this.\u201d After running through the calculations, the founder might finish by asserting, \u201cTherefore, we believe $X million is a reasonable estimate.\u201d Listeners won\u2019t miss the takeaway but are free to reach their own conclusions.\n\nSurround yourself with people who will help you be your best.\n\nA mountain of psychology research shows that our social circles influence our morality. Acts that those around us commit or condone become acceptable to us over time, while acts they condemn become unacceptable. So wise entrepreneurs surround themselves with cofounders, mentors, board members, and investors who will help them become their best selves.\n\nInvestors are particularly important in this regard. An entrepreneur might launch a handful of ventures in a lifetime, but the most experienced investors participate in hundreds. They witness the ordeals of many founders in many markets over many years and accumulate wisdom that founders can\u2019t replicate. A good investor is able to \u201cpattern match,\u201d is sensitive to the moral dimensions of particular ordeals, and knows what courses of action are \u201cright\u201d and have the best outcomes. The best investors help entrepreneurs heed the better angels of their nature.\n\nWise entrepreneurs surround themselves with cofounders, mentors, board members, and investors who will help them become their best selves.\n\nThe wrong investors can be a disaster. This is especially apparent among those who prioritize growth above all else. Consider the pairing of WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann with SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. In their first meeting, Son is said to have expressed dissatisfaction with Neumann\u2019s level of intensity and urged him to be even crazier. Neumann obliged. The ensuing SoftBank-funded expansion of WeWork was outlandish, to say the least; it included self-dealing (Neumann trademarked the word \u201cWe\u201d and sold it to the company for nearly $6 million) and extravagant expenditures (a $60 million private jet). WeWork became the United States\u2019 most valuable unicorn, fueled in part by Neumann\u2019s messianic charisma and powerful reality distortion field. It reportedly took just moments for him to persuade investors to fund his vision. He was known, and is now lampooned, for over-the-top claims about the company (for example, framing it not as a real estate subletter but as a \u201cstate of consciousness\u201d) and what it could accomplish (solving the problem of orphaned children, for one). Still, Neumann\u2019s WeWork nearly reached its IPO before imploding. (As of this writing, a far more modest incarnation of the firm, under new leadership, was preparing to go public in a merger with a special-purpose acquisitions company.)\n\n. . .\n\nIt may be tempting to think that departures from the truth are just part of doing business\u2014that we operate in a no-holds-barred capitalist arena in which all contestants are responsible for their own welfare and know the rules of the game. Unfortunately, such cynicism feeds on itself; when we encounter dishonesty or scandal, we become disillusioned and are more likely to engage in such behavior ourselves.\n\nEntrepreneurs face particular pressures to lie. Vying for a fixed pool of VC money, often working to secure returns for friends and family, and chasing dreams of greatness, they may feel they will be disadvantaged if they pursue their ventures with a vigorous dedication to the truth. Understanding the forces that tempt them to lie and the tactics that may help them remain virtuous can reduce the deception that\u2019s all too common in this crucial part of the economy."}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/steve-ridzik/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nSteve Ridzik estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

His first year in the big leagues in 1950 was an auspicious one, as his club, the Philadelphia Phillies, won the National League crown. The Highlight of his career came in 1952 when he pitched a no hit-no run game against the Saint Louis Cardinals.\n\nSteve also played Winter League Baseball in Puerto Rico and in the Venezuelan and Dominican Republic Leagues.

vibrant, diverse city of Macau in China for #EOGLC2019. And we\u2019re continuing to profile some of the event\u2019s premier speakers. Today: Steve Wozniak, who will be featured at EO GLC\u2019s inaugural Learning Day.\n\nSteve Wozniak is an entrepreneur and inventor who likely needs no introduction. For anybody who doesn\u2019t recognize his name, he co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs and is known as the developer of the 1976 Apple I\u2014the computer that launched the now-ubiquitous brand.\n\nWhile his engineering prowess is groundbreaking in the realm of technology, Woz has managed to maintain his innate curiosity, positivity and desire to solve problems\u2014not merely make products\u2014making him unique in today\u2019s Silicon Valley scene.\n\n\u201cMy dream was actually just to have a computer some day. If I\u2019d imagined that it meant starting a company to sell them, I probably would have avoided the whole thing.\u201d He continues, \u201cMy goal wasn\u2019t to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s kept it old-school in a time when financial gain has become a primary goal for many tech startups. \u201cWhat Steve Jobs and I did\u2014and at the same time Bill Gates and Paul Allen did\u2014we had no savings accounts, no friends that could loan us money, but we had ideas, and I wanted all my life to be part of a revolution.\u201d\n\nSmiles minus frowns\n\nConsider what he terms \u201chis original formula,\u201d which dates back to his 20s: Happiness = smiles \u2013 frowns.\n\nDoing things in your life and your work that make you happy is how he defines the smiles factor. Creating humor, he says, is an important part of his life\u2019s work. Avoiding frowns, he explains, is equally important. It means being constructive, not frustrated, when things don\u2019t go your way. \u201cThis kind of resilience is one of the most critical skills for success,\u201d Woz once said.\n\n\u201cI think about resilience as the speed and strength of your response to adversity. When you encounter a difficulty or challenge, how quickly and how effectively are you able to marshal strength and either overcome that challenge or persevere in the face of it?\u201d\n\nGiving without strings\n\nCreating happiness and providing opportunities go hand in hand for Wozniak. He generously gives without restrictions or conditions. His philanthropic efforts include supplying computers to schools, providing funds for people to go to college and developing ways to make technology more accessible.\n\nMaking significant investments of both his time and resources in education, he adopted the Los Gatos School District where he provided hands-on teaching and state-of-the-art equipment. He founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and was the founding sponsor of the Tech Museum, Silicon Valley Ballet and Children\u2019s Discovery Museum of San Jose.\n\nAs EO advances its efforts to make an impact and support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we\u2019re honored to host Steve Wozniak, one of today\u2019s most giving, smart, and hands-on entrepreneurs."}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp", "page_content": "What Is an Entrepreneur?\n\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship.\n\nEntrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and bring new ideas to market. Entrepreneurship that proves to be successful in taking on the risks of creating a startup is rewarded with profits and growth opportunities.\n\nKey Takeaways A person who undertakes the risk of starting a new business venture is called an entrepreneur.\n\nAn entrepreneur creates a firm to realize their idea, known as entrepreneurship, which aggregates capital and labor in order to produce goods or services for profit.\n\nEntrepreneurship is highly risky but also can be highly rewarding, as it serves to generate economic wealth, growth, and innovation.\n\nEnsuring funding is key for entrepreneurs: Financing resources include Small Business Administration loans and crowdfunding.\n\nThe way entrepreneurs file and pay taxes will depend on how the business is set up in terms of structure.\n\n1:37 Entrepreneur\n\nWhy Are Entrepreneurs Important?\n\nEntrepreneurship is one of the resources economists categorize as integral to production, the other three being land/natural resources, labor, and capital. An entrepreneur combines the first three of these to manufacture goods or provide services. They typically create a business plan, hire labor, acquire resources and financing, and provide leadership and management for the business.\n\nEconomists have never had a consistent definition of \"entrepreneur\" or \"entrepreneurship\" (the word \"entrepreneur\" comes from the French verb entreprendre, meaning \"to undertake\"). Though the concept of an entrepreneur existed and was known for centuries, the classical and neoclassical economists left entrepreneurs out of their formal models. They assumed that perfect information would be known to fully rational actors, leaving no room for risk-taking or discovery. It wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that economists seriously attempted to incorporate entrepreneurship into their models.\n\nThree thinkers were central to the inclusion of entrepreneurs: Joseph Schumpeter, Frank Knight, and Israel Kirzner. Schumpeter suggested that entrepreneurs\u2014not just companies\u2014were responsible for the creation of new things in the search for profit. Knight focused on entrepreneurs as the bearers of uncertainty and believed they were responsible for risk premiums in financial markets. Kirzner thought of entrepreneurship as a process that led to the discovery of opportunities.\n\nFast-forward to today, entrepreneurs commonly face many obstacles when building their companies. The three that many of them cite as the most challenging include overcoming bureaucracy, hiring talent, and obtaining financing.\n\nWhat Are Different Types of Entrepreneurs?\n\nNot every entrepreneur is the same and not all have the same goals. Here are a few types of entrepreneurs:\n\n\n\nBuilder\n\nBuilders seek to create scalable businesses within a short time frame. Builders typically pass $5 million in revenue in the first two to four years and continue to build up until $100 million or beyond. These individuals seek to build out a strong infrastructure by hiring the best talent and seeking the best investors. Sometimes, they have temperamental personalities that are suited to the fast growth they desire but may make personal and business relationships difficult.\n\nOpportunist\n\nOpportunistic entrepreneurs are optimistic individuals with the ability to pick out financial opportunities, get in at the right time, stay on board during the time of growth, and exit when a business hits its peak.\n\nThese types of entrepreneurs are concerned with profits and the wealth they will build, so they are attracted to ideas where they can create residual or renewal income. Because they are looking to find well-timed opportunities, opportunistic entrepreneurs can be impulsive.\n\nInnovator\n\nInnovators are those rare individuals that come up with a great idea or product that no one has thought of before. Think of Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. These individuals worked on what they loved and found business opportunities through their vision and ideas.\n\nRather than focusing on money, innovators tend to care more about the impact that their products and services have on society. These individuals are not the best at running a business as they are idea-generating individuals, so they often leave the day-to-day operations to those more capable in that respect.\n\n\n\nSpecialist\n\nThese individuals are analytical and risk-averse. They have a strong skill set in a specific area obtained through education or apprenticeship. A specialist entrepreneur will build out their business through networking and referrals, sometimes resulting in slower growth than a builder entrepreneur.\n\n4 Types of Entrepreneurship\n\nAs there are different types of entrepreneurs, there are also different types of businesses they create. Below are the main different types of entrepreneurship.\n\nSmall-business\n\nSmall business entrepreneurship refers to opening a business without turning it into a large conglomerate or opening many chains. A single-location restaurant, one grocery shop, or a retail shop to sell goods or services would all be examples of small business entrepreneurship.\n\nThese people usually invest their own money and succeed if their businesses turn a profit, which serves as their income. Sometimes, they don't have outside investors and will only take a loan if it helps continue the business.\n\nScalable startup\n\nThese are companies that start with a unique idea that can be built to a large scale\u2014think Silicon Valley. The hopes are to innovate with a unique product or service and continue growing the company, continuously scaling up over time. These types of companies often require investors and large amounts of capital to grow their idea and expand into multiple markets.\n\nLarge-company\n\nLarge company entrepreneurship is a new business division created within an existing company. The existing company may be well placed to branch out into other sectors or it may be positioned well to become involved in new technology.\n\nCEOs of these companies either foresee a new market for the company or individuals within the company generate ideas that they bring to senior management to start the process and development.\n\n\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nThe goal of social entrepreneurship is to create a benefit to society and humankind. This form of business focuses on helping communities or the environment through their products and services. They are not driven by profits but rather by helping the world around them.\n\nHow to Become an Entrepreneur\n\nAfter retiring her professional dancing shoes, Judi Sheppard Missett became an entrepreneur by teaching a dance class in order to earn some extra cash. But she soon learned that women who came to her studio were less interested in learning precise steps than they were in losing weight and toning up. Sheppard Missett then trained instructors to teach her routines to the masses, and Jazzercise was born. Soon, a franchise deal followed and today, the company has more than 8,300 locations worldwide.\n\nFollowing an ice cream\u2013making correspondence course, two entrepreneurs, Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, paired $8,000 in savings with a $4,000 loan, leased a Burlington, Vt., gas station, and purchased equipment to create uniquely flavored ice cream for the local market. Today, Ben & Jerry\u2019s hauls in millions in annual revenue.\n\nIn the 21st century, the example of Internet giants like Alphabet, the parent company to Google (GOOG), and Meta (META; formerly Facebook), both of which have made their founders wildly wealthy, have been clear examples of the lasting impact of entrepreneurs on society.\n\nUnlike traditional professions, where there is often a defined path to follow, the road to entrepreneurship is mystifying to most. What works for one entrepreneur might not work for the next and vice versa. That said, there are seven general steps that many successful entrepreneurs have followed:\n\nEnsure financial stability\n\nThis first step is not a strict requirement but is definitely recommended. While entrepreneurs have built successful businesses while being less than financially flush, starting out with an adequate cash supply and stable ongoing funding is a great foundation.\n\nThis increases an entrepreneur's personal financial runway and gives them more time to work on building a successful business, rather than worrying about having to keep raising money or paying back short-term loans.\n\n\n\nBuild a diverse skill set\n\nOnce a person has strong finances, it is important to build a diverse set of skills and then apply those skills in the real world. The beauty of step two is it can be done concurrently with step one.\n\nBuilding a skill set can be achieved through learning and trying new tasks in real-world settings. For example, if an aspiring entrepreneur has a background in finance, they can move into a sales role at their existing company to learn the soft skills necessary to be successful. Once a diverse skill set is built, it gives an entrepreneur a toolkit that they can rely on when they are faced with the inevitability of tough situations.\n\nMuch has been discussed about whether going to college is necessary to become a successful entrepreneur. Many well-known entrepreneurs are famous for having dropped out of college: Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Ellison, to name a few.\n\nThough going to college isn't necessary to build a successful business, it can teach young individuals a lot about the world in many other ways. And these famous college dropouts are the exception rather than the norm. College may not be for everyone and the choice is personal, but it is something to think about, especially with the high price tag of a college education in the U.S.\n\nConsume content across multiple channels\n\nAs important as developing a diverse skill set is, the need to consume a diverse array of information and knowledge-building materials is equally so. This content can be in the form of podcasts, books, articles, or lectures. The important thing is that the content, no matter the channel, should be varied in what it covers. Aspiring entrepreneurs should always familiarize themselves with the world around them so they can look at industries with a fresh perspective, giving them the ability to build a business around a specific sector.\n\nIdentify a problem to solve\n\nThrough the consumption of content across multiple channels, an aspiring entrepreneur is able to identify various problems in need of solutions. One business adage dictates that a company's product or service needs to solve a specific pain point, either for another business or for a consumer group. Through the identification of a problem, an aspiring entrepreneur is able to build a business around solving that problem.\n\nIt is important to combine steps three and four so it is possible to identify a problem to solve by looking at various industries as an outsider. This often provides an aspiring entrepreneur with the ability to see a problem others might not.\n\nSolve That Problem\n\nSuccessful startups solve a specific pain point for other companies or for the public. This is known as \"adding value within the problem.\" Only through adding value to a specific problem or pain point does an entrepreneur become successful.\n\nSay, for example, you identify that the process for making a dental appointment is complicated for patients, and dentists are losing customers as a result. The value could be to build an online appointment system that makes it easier to book appointments.\n\nNetwork like crazy\n\nMost entrepreneurs can't do it alone. The business world is a cutthroat one and getting any help you can will likely help and reduce the time it takes to achieve a successful business. Networking is critical for any new entrepreneur. Meeting the right people who can introduce you to contacts in your industry, such as the right suppliers, financiers, and even mentors, can mean the difference between success and failure.\n\nAttending conferences, emailing and calling people in the industry, speaking to your cousin's friend's brother who is in a similar business, will help you get out into the world and discover people who can guide you. Once you have your foot in the door with the right people, conducting a business becomes easier.\n\nLead by example\n\nEvery entrepreneur needs to be a leader within their company. Simply doing the day-to-day requirements will not lead to success. A leader needs to work hard, motivate, and inspire their employees to reach their best potential, which will lead to the success of the company.\n\nLook at some of the greatest and most successful companies; all of them have had great leaders. Apple and Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Microsoft, Bob Iger and Disney, are just a few examples. Study these people and read their books to see how to be a great leader and become the leader that your employees can follow by the example you set.\n\nEntrepreneurship Financing\n\nGiven the riskiness of a new venture, the acquisition of capital funding is particularly challenging, and many entrepreneurs deal with it via bootstrapping: financing a business using methods such as using their own money, providing sweat equity to reduce labor costs, minimizing inventory, and factoring receivables.\n\nWhile some entrepreneurs are lone players struggling to get small businesses off the ground on a shoestring, others take on partners armed with greater access to capital and other resources. In these situations, new firms may acquire financing from venture capitalists, angel investors, hedge funds, crowdfunding, or through more traditional sources such as bank loans.\n\nResources for entrepreneurs\n\nThere are a variety of financing resources for entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. Obtaining a small business loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA) can help entrepreneurs get the business off the ground with affordable loans. Here, the SBA helps connect businesses to loan providers.\n\nIf entrepreneurs are willing to give up a piece of equity in their business, then they may find financing in the form of angel investors and venture capitalists. These types of investors also provide guidance, mentorship, and connections in addition to capital.\n\nCrowdfunding has also become a popular way for entrepreneurs to raise capital, particularly through Kickstarter or Indiegogo. In this way, an entrepreneur creates a page for their product and a monetary goal to reach while promising certain givebacks to those who donate, such as products or experiences.\n\nBootstrapping for entrepreneurs\n\nBootstrapping refers to building a company solely from your savings as an entrepreneur as well as from the initial sales made from your business. This is a difficult process as all the financial risk is placed on the entrepreneur and there is little room for error. If the business fails, the entrepreneur also may lose all of their life savings.\n\nThe advantage of bootstrapping is that an entrepreneur can run the business with their own vision and no outside interference or investors demanding quick profits. That being said, sometimes having an outsider's assistance can help a business rather than hurt it. Many companies have succeeded with a bootstrapping strategy, but it is a difficult path.\n\nSmall business vs. entrepreneurship\n\nA small business and entrepreneurship have a lot in common but they are different. A small business is a company\u2014usually, a sole-proprietorship or partnership\u2014that is not a medium-sized or large-sized business, operates locally, and does not have access to a vast amount of resources or capital.\n\nEntrepreneurship is when an individual who has an idea acts on that idea, usually to disrupt the current market with a new product or service. Entrepreneurship usually starts as a small business but the long-term vision is much greater, to seek high profits and capture market share with an innovative new idea.\n\nHow entrepreneurs make money\n\nEntrepreneurs seek to generate revenues that are greater than costs. Increasing revenues is the goal and that can be achieved through marketing, word-of-mouth, and networking. Keeping costs low is also critical as it results in higher profit margins. This can be achieved through efficient operations and eventually economies of scale.\n\nHow do taxes work for entrepreneurs?\n\nThe taxes you will pay as an entrepreneur will depend on how you structure your business.\n\nSole proprietorship: A business set up this way is an extension of the individual. Business income and expenses are filed on Schedule C on your U.S. personal tax return and you are taxed at your individual tax rate.\n\nPartnership: For tax purposes, a partnership functions the same way as a sole proprietorship in the U.S., with the only difference being that income and expenses are split amongst the partners.\n\nEntrepreneurs operating as sole proprietors can deduct any legitimate business expenses from their income to lower their tax bill. This includes expenses such as their home office and utilities, mileage for business travel, advertising, and travel expenses.\n\nC-corporation: A C-corporation is a separate legal entity and has separate taxes filed with the IRS from the entrepreneur. The business income will be taxed at the corporate tax rate rather than the personal income tax rate.\n\nLimited liability company (LLC) or S-corporation: These two options are taxed in the same manner as a C-corporation but usually at lower amounts.\n\n7 Characteristics of Entrepreneurs\n\nWhat else do entrepreneurial success stories have in common? They invariably involve industrious people diving into things they\u2019re naturally passionate about.\n\nGiving credence to the adage, \u201cfind a way to get paid for the job you\u2019d do for free,\u201d passion is arguably the most important attribute entrepreneurs must have, and every edge helps.\n\nWhile the prospect of becoming your own boss and raking in a fortune is alluring to entrepreneurial dreamers, the possible downside to hanging out one\u2019s own shingle is vast. Income isn\u2019t guaranteed, employer-sponsored benefits go by the wayside, and when your business loses money, your personal assets can take a hit; it's not a corporation\u2019s bottom line. But adhering to a few tried and true principles can go a long way in diffusing risk. The following are a few characteristics required to be a successful entrepreneur.\n\n1. Versatility\n\nWhen starting out, it\u2019s essential to personally handle sales and other customer interactions whenever possible. Direct client contact is the clearest path to obtaining honest feedback about what the target market likes and what you could be doing better. If it\u2019s not always practical to be the sole customer interface, entrepreneurs should train employees to invite customer comments as a matter of course. Not only does this make customers feel empowered, but happier clients are more likely to recommend businesses to others.\n\nPersonally answering phones is one of the most significant competitive edges home-based entrepreneurs hold over their larger competitors. In a time of high-tech backlash, where customers are frustrated with automated responses and touch-tone menus, hearing a human voice is one surefire way to entice new customers and make existing ones feel appreciated\u2014an important fact, given that a significant percentage of business is generated from repeat customers.\n\nParadoxically, while customers value high-touch telephone access, they also expect a highly polished website. Even if your business isn\u2019t in a high-tech industry, entrepreneurs still must exploit internet technology to get their message across. A startup garage-based business can have a superior website to an established company valued at $100 million. Just make sure a live human being is on the other end of the phone number listed.\n\n2. Flexibility\n\nFew successful business owners find perfect formulas straight out of the gate. On the contrary: ideas must morph over time. Whether tweaking product design or altering food items on a menu, finding the perfect sweet spot takes trial and error.\n\nFormer Starbucks Chair and CEO Howard Schultz initially thought playing Italian opera music over store speakers would accentuate the Italian coffeehouse experience he was attempting to replicate. But customers saw things differently and didn\u2019t seem to like arias with their espressos. As a result, Schultz jettisoned the opera and introduced comfortable chairs instead.\n\n3. Money savviness\n\nAt the heart of any successful new business, is steady cash flow, which is essential for purchasing inventory, paying rent, maintaining equipment, and promoting the business. The key to staying in the black is rigorous, regular cash flow management. And since most new businesses don\u2019t make a profit within the first year, by setting money aside for this contingency, entrepreneurs can help mitigate the risk of falling short of funds. Related to this, it\u2019s essential to keep personal and business costs separate, and never dip into business funds to cover the costs of daily living.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to pay yourself a realistic salary that allows you to cover essentials, but not much more\u2014especially where investors are involved. Of course, such sacrifices can strain relationships with loved ones who may need to adjust to lower standards of living and endure worry over risking family assets. For this reason, entrepreneurs should communicate these issues well ahead of time, and make sure significant loved ones are on board.\n\n4. Resiliency\n\nRunning your own business is extremely difficult, especially getting one started from scratch. It requires a lot of time, dedication, and often failure. A successful entrepreneur must show resilience to all the difficulties on the road ahead. Whenever they meet with failure or rejection they must keep pushing forward.\n\nStarting your business is a learning process and any learning process comes with a learning curve, which can be frustrating, especially when money is on the line. It's important never to give up through the difficult times if you want to succeed.\n\n5. Focus\n\nSimilar to resilience, a successful entrepreneur must stay focused and eliminate the noise and doubts that come with running a business. Becoming sidetracked, not believing in your instincts and ideas, and losing sight of the end goal is a recipe for failure. A successful entrepreneur must always remember why they started the business and remain on course to see it through.\n\n6. Business smarts\n\nKnowing how to manage money and understanding financial statements are critical for anyone running their own business. Knowing your revenues, your costs, and how to increase or decrease them, respectively, is important. Making sure you don't burn through cash will allow you to keep the business alive.\n\nImplementing a sound business strategy, knowing your target market, your competitors, and your strengths and weaknesses will allow you to maneuver the difficult landscape of running your business.\n\n7. Communication skills\n\nSuccessful communication is important in almost every facet of life, regardless of what you do. It is also of the utmost importance in running a business. From conveying your ideas and strategies to potential investors to sharing your business plan with your employees and negotiating contracts with suppliers\u2014all require successful communication.\n\nEntrepreneurship in Economics\n\nIn economist-speak, an entrepreneur acts as a coordinating agent in a capitalist economy. This coordination takes the form of resources being diverted toward new potential profit opportunities. The entrepreneur moves various resources, both tangible and intangible, promoting capital formation.\n\nIn a market full of uncertainty, it is the entrepreneur who can actually help clear up uncertainty, as they make judgments or assume risk. To the extent that capitalism is a dynamic profit-and-loss system, entrepreneurs drive efficient discovery and consistently reveal knowledge.\n\nEstablished firms face increased competition and challenges from entrepreneurs, which often spurs them toward research and development efforts as well. In technical economic terms, the entrepreneur disrupts the course toward steady-state equilibrium.\n\nIn 2022, there were 33.2 million small businesses in the United States.\n\nHow entrepreneurship helps economies\n\nNurturing entrepreneurship can have a positive impact on an economy and society in several ways. For starters, entrepreneurs create new businesses. They invent goods and services, resulting in employment, and often create a ripple effect, resulting in more and more development. For example, after a few information technology companies began in India in the 1990s, businesses in associated industries, like call center operations and hardware providers, began to develop too, offering support services and products.\n\nEntrepreneurs add to the gross national income. Existing businesses may remain confined to their markets and eventually hit an income ceiling. But new products or technologies create new markets and new wealth. Additionally, increased employment and higher earnings contribute to a nation\u2019s tax base, enabling greater government spending on public projects.\n\nEntrepreneurs create social change. They break tradition with unique inventions that reduce dependence on existing methods and systems, sometimes rendering them obsolete. Smartphones and their apps, for example, have revolutionized work and play across the globe.\n\nEntrepreneurs invest in community projects and help charities and other non-profit organizations, supporting causes beyond their own. Bill Gates, for example, has used his considerable wealth for education and public health initiatives.\n\nEntrepreneurial ecosystems\n\nResearch shows that high levels of self-employment can stall economic development: Entrepreneurship, if not properly regulated, can lead to unfair market practices and corruption, and too many entrepreneurs can create income inequalities in society. Overall, though, entrepreneurship is a critical driver of innovation and economic growth. Therefore, fostering entrepreneurship is an important part of the economic growth strategies of many local and national governments around the world.\n\nTo this end, governments commonly assist in the development of entrepreneurial ecosystems, which may include entrepreneurs themselves, government-sponsored assistance programs, and venture capitalists. They may also include non-government organizations, such as entrepreneurs' associations, business incubators, and education programs.\n\nCalifornia's Silicon Valley is often cited as an example of a well-functioning entrepreneurial ecosystem. The region has a well-developed venture capital base, a large pool of well-educated talent, especially in technical fields, and a wide range of government and non-government programs fostering new ventures and providing information and support to entrepreneurs.\n\nQuestions for Entrepreneurs\n\nEmbarking on the entrepreneurial career path to \u201cbeing your own boss\u201d is exciting. But along with all your research, make sure to do your homework about yourself and your situation.\n\nA few questions to ask yourself:\n\nDo I have the personality, temperament, and mindset of taking on the world on my own terms?\n\nDo I have the required resources to devote all my time to my venture?\n\nDo I have an exit plan ready with a clearly defined timeline in case my venture does not work?\n\nDo I have a concrete plan for the next \"x\" number of months or will I face challenges midway due to family, financial, or other commitments? Do I have a mitigation plan for those challenges?\n\nDo I have the required network to seek help and advice as needed?\n\nHave I identified and built bridges with experienced mentors to learn from their expertise?\n\nHave I prepared the rough draft of a complete risk assessment, including dependencies on external factors?\n\nHave I realistically assessed the potential of my offering and how it will figure in the existing market?\n\nIf my offering is going to replace an existing product in the market, how will my competitors react?\n\nTo keep my offering secure, will it make sense to get a patent? Do I have the capacity to wait until I receive it?\n\nHave I identified my target customer base for the initial phase? Do I have scalability plans ready for larger markets?\n\nHave I identified sales and distribution channels?\n\nQuestions that delve into external factors:\n\nDoes my entrepreneurial venture meet local regulations and laws? If not feasible locally, can I and should I relocate to another region?\n\nHow long does it take to get the necessary license or permissions from concerned authorities? Can I survive that long?\n\nDo I have a plan for getting the necessary resources and skilled employees, and have I made cost considerations for the same?\n\nWhat are the tentative timelines for bringing the first prototype to market or for services to be operational?\n\nWho are my primary customers?\n\nWho are the funding sources I may need to approach to make this big? Is my venture good enough to convince potential stakeholders?\n\nWhat technical infrastructure do I need?\n\nOnce the business is established, will I have sufficient funds to get resources and take it to the next level? Will other big firms copy my model and kill my operation?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Be an Entrepreneur? An entrepreneur is an individual who starts their own business based on an idea they have or a product they have created while assuming most of the risks and reaping most of the rewards of the business.\n\nWhat Is the Best Definition of Entrepreneurship? Entrepreneurship is the process of setting up a business, taking it from an idea to realization.\n\nWhat Are the Four Types of Entrepreneurs? Four types of entrepreneurs include builders, opportunists, innovators, and specialists.\n\nWhat Are the Seven Characteristics of Entrepreneurs? Seven primary characteristics among entrepreneurs include versatility, resilience, flexibility, money-savviness, business smarts, focus, and having strong communication skills.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAn entrepreneur is an individual who takes an idea or product and creates a business, a process known as entrepreneurship. Creating a business requires a lot of work and dedication, which not everyone is cut out for. Entrepreneurs are highly motivated risk-takers who have a vision and often sacrifice a lot to achieve that vision.\n\nEntrepreneurs enter the market because they love what they do, believe their product will have a positive impact, and hope to make profits from their efforts. The steps entrepreneurs take fuel the economy; they create businesses that employ people and make products and services that consumers buy today."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ridzist01", "page_content": "Steve Ridzik was born on Monday, April 29, 1929, in Yonkers, New York.

He attended School Seven, Longfellow Junior High school. He began his baseball career at the age of nine on the sandlots of Yonkers and played for the Glenner AC in the Yonkers Recreation League; with Saint Nicholas of Myra in the Catholic Youth Organization League; and with the Hollows AC and the Boilermakers AC in other local leagues.\n\nHe was an outstanding athlete at Saunders, starring both basketball and baseball, and here he pitched his team to three successive city championships. His coach was Alex Joyner, who he recalls as \u201cone of the finest men I ever knew.\u201d After high school he pitched in the fast Hudson Valley League where he attracted the attention of scout Fred Mathews of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League who signed him to a contract in 1945. This began a professional baseball career that spanned twenty-two years, eleven in top minor league competition, and eleven in the major circuits. Thus, Steve Ridzik played longer in the major baseball leagues than any Yonkers athlete.\n\nOn reporting to Philadelphia he was farmed to the Wilmington Blue Rocks, who after a short trial period, transferred him up the baseball ladder to Greenboro in the Carolina State League. His minor league experiences encompassed such clubs and leagues as Schenectady in the Canadian American League; Toronto and Baltimore in the International League; Utica in the Eastern League; Wilmington in the inter-State league; Minnesota and Fort Worth in the American Association; and San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. During this time his tams won five league championships and Steve was named on five minor league all star teams.\n\nHis major league career covered five clubs-the Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, Cleveland Indians, and the Washington Senators, from which club he retired from baseball in 1966. His first year in the big leagues in 1950 was an auspicious one, as his club, the Philadelphia Phillies, won the National League crown. The Highlight of his career came in 1952 when he pitched a no hit-no run game against the Saint Louis Cardinals.\n\nSteve also played Winter League Baseball in Puerto Rico and in the Venezuelan and Dominican Republic Leagues. Here he pitched on two championship clubs, with the Santurce Crabbers in Puerto Rico in 1955 and with the Red Team in Dominican Republic League in 1957."}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/i/Steve_Ridzik", "page_content": "Steve Ridzik Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 \u2013 January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1966, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators.

He was a VERY small part of the 1950 pennant winning Philadelphia Phillies known aka The Whiz Kids. Being a fan and player of Strat-O-Matic\u2019s past seasons, I was somewhat familiar with Ridzik\u2019s accomplishments. RIP\n\nBRADENTON \u2014 Former professional baseball player Steve Ridzik never forgot the fans who helped him fulfill his dream for more than a decade.\n\nThe former pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, the New York Giants and several other teams, who died Jan. 8 of heart disease at 78, helped create a players\u2019 alumni association that raises money for charity.\n\nRidzik helped organize a Bradenton golf tournament with former baseball players that raised more than $50,000 for Manatee Memorial Hospital in the early 1990s, said his wife, Nancy Ridzik of Bradenton. The ex-ballplayer had undergone open-heart surgery there for a triple bypass a couple of years earlier, she said.\n\nIn addition to taking part in several other fundraisers over the years, Ridzik also regularly granted fans\u2019 requests for autographs by signing baseball cards and blank cards that arrived by mail on almost a daily basis, his wife said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve even had baseball bats and baseballs sent here\u201d and he obliged, she said.\n\nBorn April 29, 1929, in Yonkers, N.Y., Ridzik was signed by the Phillies\u2019 in 1945 at age 16 and pitched his first major league game in 1950, the same year the Phillies went on to win the National League pennant for the first time in 35 years.\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe Whiz Kids\u201d that year because their average age was 26, the Phillies were the youngest team to ever reach the World Series, which they lost to the New York Yankees.\n\nRidzik subsequently played for the Cincinnati Redlegs, the Giants, the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Senators before retiring from baseball in 1966. He later worked for a food distributor in the Washington, D.C., area before retiring and moving to Bradenton in 1988.\n\nHe helped former Senators teammate Chuck Hinton establish the nonprofit Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association in 1982 for former players to serve as goodwill ambassadors of the sport.\n\nRidzik returned to Philadelphia in 2000 for a 50th anniversary reunion of his pennant-winning team before a crowd of 40,000 in Veterans Stadium.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world,\u201d his wife said. \u201cI think there were 13 of the original \u2018Whiz Kids\u2019 still around back then, and now there are only about six left.\u201d\n\nIn retirement, he enjoyed golfing and watching horse and dog racing.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nRecent Stories:\n\nNOTE: My spam filter automatically deletes any TrackBacks that do not actually link and refer to this post.

Upon the news of his death, we think it\u2019s worth another read.\n\nA student at one of my talks on the nonprofit sector asked if I could name a for-profit company that was making a difference on the scale that nonprofits do. I said I\u2019d be hard-pressed to name one that wasn\u2019t.\n\nOur youth are growing up with the strange notion that the only way to make a big difference in this world, or to be of service, is to work for a nonprofit organization, or become the next Bill Gates and establish a private foundation, or to start some kind of \u201csocial enterprise,\u201d often without any understanding of what that means.\n\nThe word philanthropy comes from the Greek philanthropos which comes from philein for \u201cto love\u201d and anthropos for \u201chuman being.\u201d Philanthropy means love of humanity.\n\nWhich brings me to Steve Jobs.\n\nShortly after he returned to Apple in 1997 Jobs allegedly ended all of the company\u2019s corporate philanthropy programs to cut expenses until the nearly bankrupt enterprise regained its footing. Some have claimed the programs were never reinstated.\n\nA 2006 Wired article on Jobs, \u201cGreat Wealth Does Not Make a Great Man,\u201d reported that even though his wealth was estimated at $3.3 billion, Jobs\u2019s name did not appear on Giving USA\u2019s list of gifts of $5 million or more for the previous four years, nor on another that list showing gifts of $1 million or more. (The article acknowledged that he could have been giving anonymously.)\n\nThe article took a cheap shot: \u201cJobs can\u2019t even get behind causes that would seem to carry deep personal meaning\u2026he is a cancer survivor. But unlike [Lance] Armstrong, Jobs has so far done little publicly to raise money or awareness for the disease.\u201d It went on, \u201c\u2026he\u2019s nothing more than a greedy capitalist who\u2019s amassed an obscene fortune. It\u2019s shameful\u2026[Bill] Gates is much more deserving of Jobs\u2019 rock star exaltation. In the same way, I admire Bono over Mick Jagger, and John Lennon over Elvis, because they spoke up about things bigger than their own celebrity.\u201d Yes, but in part their own celebrity was connected to the things they spoke up about.\n\nIn a 1985 Playboy interview, Jobs acknowledged that it takes enormous time to give money away, and stated that, \u201cin order to learn how to do something well, you have to fail sometimes\u2026the problem with most philanthropy-there\u2019s no measurement system.. you can really never measure whether you failed or succeeded\u2026So\u2026it\u2019s really hard to get better.\u201d He added that, \u201cWhen I have some time, I\u2019m going to start a public foundation.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, he did, but closed it after 15 months. According to the man he hired to run it, \u201cHe clearly didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d Jobs\u2019s friends told one reporter, \u201che figures he can do more good by expanding Apple.\u201d And thank God for that.\n\nWhat a loss to humanity it would have been if Jobs had dedicated the last 25 years of his life to figuring out how to give his billions away, instead of doing what he does best.\n\nWe\u2019d still be waiting for a cell phone on which we could actually read e-mail and surf the web. \u201cWe\u201d includes students, doctors, nurses, aid workers, charity leaders, social workers, and so on. It helps the blind read text and identify currency. It helps physicians improve their performance and surgeons improve their practice. It even helps charities raise money.\n\nWe\u2019d be a decade or more away from the iPad, which has ushered in an era of reading electronically that promises to save a Sherwood Forest worth of trees and all of the energy associated with trucking them around. That\u2019s just the beginning. Doctors are using the iPad to improve healthcare. It\u2019s being used to lessen the symptoms of autism, to improve kids\u2019 creativity, and to revolutionize medical training.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t say someone else would have developed these things. No one until Jobs did, and the competitive devices that have come since have taken the entirety of their inspiration from his creation.\n\nWithout Steve Jobs we\u2019d be years away from a user-friendly mechanism for getting digital music without stealing it, which means we\u2019d still be producing hundreds of millions of CDs with plastic cases.\n\nWe would be without Pixar. There\u2019s a sentence with an import inversely correlated to its length.\n\nWe would be without the 34,000 full-time jobs Apple has created, just within Apple, not to mention all of the manufacturing jobs it has created for those who would otherwise live in poverty.\n\nWe would be without the wealth it has created for millions of Americans who have invested in the company.\n\nWe would be without video conferencing for the masses that actually works. Computers that don\u2019t keep crashing. Who can estimate the value of the wasted time that didn\u2019t get wasted?\n\nWe would be without a whole new way of thinking. About computers. Leadership. Business. Our very potential.\n\nLast year Change.org wrote of Steve Jobs, \u201cIt\u2019s high time the minimalist CEO became a magnanimous philanthropist.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve got news for you. He has been. What\u2019s important is how we use our time on this earth, not how conspicuously we give our money away. What\u2019s important is the energy and courage we are willing to expend reversing entropy, battling cynicism, suffering and challenging mediocre minds, staring down those who would trample our dreams, taking a stand for magic, and advancing the potential of the human race.\n\nOn these scores, the world has no greater philanthropist than Steve Jobs. If ever a man contributed to humanity, here he is. And he has done it while battling cancer.\n\nIn a statement Bono defended Jobs, noting that Apple has been Product (RED\u2019s) \u201clargest contributor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \u2014 giving tens of millions.\u201d More important, Bono stated that, \u201cJust because he\u2019s been extremely busy, that doesn\u2019t mean that he [has] not been thinking about these things.\u201d Steve Jobs has traded his time for human progress. Not for personal pleasures. This is not a man who spent his time building homes or custom yachts or who otherwise obsessed with how to spend his billions on himself. And no one would say of him that he ever seemed to have a lot of spare time on his hands.\n\nWerner Erhard used to say that he wanted his gravestone to say, \u201cBurned out.\u201d By all appearances, Jobs has burned out just about every ounce of fuel he was given trying to bring new possibilities into this world. God willing, he has more fuel in reserve. If so, he should expend a little of it on himself. To do more than he has done for humanity already, no human could ever be asked.\n\nFor more commentary on Steve Jobs, see our special section, The Legacy of Steve Jobs."}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/i/Steve_Ridzik", "page_content": "Steve Ridzik Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 \u2013 January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1966, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators.

As a philanthropist, the billionaire's contributions to society have been called into question.\n\nFew records exist of Jobs' charitable contributions, according to the International Business Times. The 43rd-richest person in the United States, Jobs, who died last week after a struggle with pancreatic cancer, accumulated a fortune of an estimated $8.3 billion.\n\nUnlike peers in the technology business like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Jobs did not sign Warren Buffet's Giving Pledge, which challenged the world's richest billionaires to give at least half their wealth to charity. In the 1980s, Jobs started up the Steven P. Jobs Foundation only to close it down a little over a year later. In recent years, friends told the New York Times Jobs felt he could do more good expanding Apple than giving money to charity.\n\n\"The lack of public philanthropy by Mr. Jobs \u2014 long whispered about, but rarely said aloud \u2014 raises some important questions about the way the public views business and business people at a time when some 'millionaires and billionaires' are criticized for not giving back enough while others like Mr. Jobs are lionized,\" Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in the New York Times shortly after the Apple CEO stepped down in August.\n\nSome have called Jobs out.\n\n\"It's high time the minimalist CEO became a magnanimous philanthropist,\" Change.org urged in 2010. \"As the 43rd-richest person in the United States, Jobs is a prime target for Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's Giving Pledge.\"\n\nOthers gave him the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"Of course, Jobs and his wife may be giving enormous sums of money to charity anonymously,\" wrote Leander Kahney of Wired.com. \"For a person as private as Jobs, who shuns any publicity about his family life, this seems credible. If so, however, this would make Jobs virtually unique among moguls.\"\n\nJobs' apparent lack of giving is surprising considering the lack of emphasis he placed on money, Sorkin wrote.\n\n\"You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that's happened to me,\" Jobs said in a 1985 interview with Playboy magazine.\n\nSince the entrepreneur's death, focus has turned to his wife, Apple Inc. cofounder Laurene Powell Jobs. Jobs' 47-year-old widow declined to comment on how she intends to spend the fortune she will likely inherit, the Wall Street Journal reported. However, her involvement with a number of causes, including education reform and women's issues, suggests she is deeply committed to philanthropy.\n\n\"She is very much of the school of 'to whom much is given, much is expected,'\" said Carlos Watson, who cofounded an educational reform organization called College Track with her in 1997. \"She is focused on ways to expand opportunity.\"\n\nPowell Jobs sits on the boards for NewSchools Venture Fund, Teach for America, Stand for Children, New America Foundation and Conservation International. The Jobs family donated millions to NewSchools Venture Fund, said chief executive Ted Mitchell, noting her work \"is even more effective because she does this work quietly, constantly, with incredible integrity and great insight.\"\n\nPowell Jobs also founded a nonprofit that helps low-income students prepare for college in 1997. The program, called College Track, has since helped more than 1,000 students get into four-year colleges. More recently, she founded Emerson Collective, a philanthropic organization that aims to help entrepreneurs effect international and domestic social reform.\"\n\nEMAIL: estuart@desnews.com TWITTER: elizMstuart\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.tonyrobbins.com/giving-back/famous-philanthropists/", "page_content": "10 Famous Philanthropists\n\nThe secret to living is giving. As Tony says, When you serve something greater than yourself, whether it be your family, your local community or at a global level, you discover a deeper purpose and and create more meaning in your life. In the U.S. there is a strong culture of philanthropy \u2013 high net worth individuals who have chosen to donate financial resources to communities and causes that need support. Tony is one of many people making a positive impact in the world by supporting causes that matter to him personally. For years, Tony has given to others, from leading the 1 Billion Meals Challenge with Feeding America (which has helped provide more than 850 million meals so far to those in need), to working with Operation Underground Railroad to prevent child trafficking, Tony\u2019s learned that the key to fulfillment lies in giving. Famous philanthropists make their impact in the world by giving back a portion of their monetary wealth. Even if you don\u2019t have large pools of capital to deploy into nonprofits or other recipients, you can still give \u2013 your time, your energy, or whatever resources you have that you\u2019d like to share. In this way, everyone can become a philanthropist.\n\nYou can make a positive difference in the lives of others right now Start giving back today\n\nWhat is a philanthropist? To find the keys to becoming a philanthropist, no matter your financial means, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the question, \u201cWhat is a philanthropist?\u201d Let\u2019s start with the philanthropist meaning straight from the dictionary: phi\u00b7lan\u00b7thro\u00b7pist /f\u0259\u02c8lanTHr\u0259p\u0259st/ noun: philanthropist; plural noun: philanthrophists 1. a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. In short, a philanthropist is someone who donates their money, experience, time, talent or skills to help others and create a better world. Though we often think of them as people who have millions of dollars to donate, you don\u2019t have to be a famous philanthropist with a huge net worth to qualify. This is just one of a few misconceptions about how to be a philanthropist.\n\nWhat are the benefits of being a philanthropist? Most philanthropists aren\u2019t in it for fame or recognition. The biggest benefit of being a philanthropist is that it fulfills some of our deepest human needs. We all have these needs: certainty, significance, variety, love/connection, growth and contribution. Which of these needs is most important to us and the ways we go about fulfilling them are what make us who we are. Philanthropy fulfills our need for contribution. Have you ever reached a major milestone in your life \u2013 your dream job, starting a business, financial freedom \u2013 and wondered why you still feel like something is missing? It\u2019s likely because you\u2019re not fulfilling your need for contribution. As Tony says, \u201cIt is not what we get, but who we become and what we contribute that gives meaning to our lives.\u201d Being a philanthropist can actually improve your own life, too. The law of attraction states that we get back the energy we put into the world. By focusing on giving back, making a difference and creating positive change, you\u2019ll create a cycle that brings abundance back to you tenfold.\n\nIs there a difference between charity and philanthropy? Charity is the actual action that is taken to improve someone\u2019s life: stocking shelves at a food bank like Tony\u2019s Feeding America project, building shelters for refugees or providing medical care after a disaster. As an organization, a charity is the entity that coordinates and supplies these on-the-ground services. Philanthropy is what supplies charities with the funds, personnel and equipment they need. So what is a philanthropist versus a volunteer? They share many similarities, but philanthropy is a strategic process in which donations of time, skills and/or money are made in order to address a systemic or social issue.\n\nIs philanthropy considered a career? Yes, you can absolutely build a career in philanthropy. There are many different paths you can take, from grant writingand program directing to corporate social responsibility and cause marketing. You\u2019ll find consultants and CEOs in philanthropy, just as in the typical business world. For a career in philanthropy, you\u2019ll need a few essential skills: adaptability and perseverance, passion, people skills and a growth mindset. The world of philanthropy can be competitive, but is also one of the most fulfilling careers. Looking for tips on how to become a philanthropist?

Serve at a soup kitchen or stock donations at a food pantry. Make boxes for a meal delivery service. Volunteer with an after-school program, become a mentor to at-risk youth or work at a community center. Find a local cause that speaks to you and donate your time. Raise awareness What is a philanthropist if not someone who uses their position to help better the lives of others? You may not have as much money as famous philanthropists, but you still have plenty to be grateful for. Advocating for a group less fortunate than yourself is the ultimate way to become a philanthropist without spending a cent. Use your skills or experience Everyone has gifts, and many of those gifts are useful when it comes to how to become a philanthropist. Use writing skills to create marketing materials or write grants for a nonprofit. Teach math or reading to disadvantaged kids. If you have knowledge about a specific topic, like the law, accounting or regulations in a certain industry, use it for good. Set aside a small portion of your paycheck Even five dollars a week adds up to more than $250 per year. Save a small amount each week, then make an annual donation at a certain time of year.
