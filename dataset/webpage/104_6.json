{"Tony La Russa Jr. also won three pennants and six division titles with the three teams for which he managed.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tony-La-Russa", "page_content": "Tony La Russa, byname of Anthony La Russa, Jr., (born October 4, 1944, Tampa, Florida, U.S.), American professional baseball manager who led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) and was one of the winningest managers in major league history.\n\nLa Russa signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or \u201cA\u2019s\u201d) out of high school. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A\u2019s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.\n\nBritannica Quiz I Am the Greatest (Athlete)\n\nThe cerebral La Russa\u2014who earned a law degree shortly before assuming managerial duties in Chicago\u2014proved to be a natural leader in the clubhouse. He developed a managerial style that consisted of frequent in-game situational substitutions that came in response to the great attention he paid to the nuances and flow of a particular game (which occasionally led to criticism that La Russa \u201covermanaged\u201d). In 1983 he guided the White Sox to a 99-win season and the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in 24 years. However, a slow start to the 1986 campaign and a strained working relationship with the team\u2019s new general manager (former outfielder Ken Harrelson, who left the announcing booth to spend only one tumultuous season running the White Sox) led to La Russa\u2019s being fired three months into the season. He was out of work for less than a month before he was hired to manage the A\u2019s.\n\nLa Russa quickly turned the A\u2019s into the most-dominant team in baseball. He led Oakland to the highest win total in the major leagues for three straight seasons (1988\u201390), each of which also ended with the Athletics\u2019 winning the American League (AL) pennant. The team was upset in two of its World Series appearances during that period, but the A\u2019s did defeat the San Francisco Giants to win a championship in 1989. La Russa and the A\u2019s won another division title in 1992, but after the team posted three consecutive losing seasons (1993\u201395), he opted out of his contract and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s third managerial stint was even more successful than his first two. In his initial season in St. Louis, he guided the Cardinals to the first of seven division titles the team would win during his tenure. The Cardinals won a National League (NL) pennant in 2004, and in 2006 the team beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series. In 2011 La Russa led St. Louis on improbable comebacks to clinch a postseason berth (after trailing in the Wild Card standings by 8 1/2 games with a month remaining in the regular season) and to win the World Series (after twice being one strike away from elimination). La Russa retired soon after earning his third championship ring. He had been named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year three times (1983, 1988, and 1992) and won the NL\u2019s version of the award in 2002.\n\nThree years after his retirement from managing, La Russa joined the Arizona Diamondbacks as the team\u2019s chief baseball officer. He was demoted to an advisory role with the franchise following the 2016 season after the Diamondbacks ran off three consecutive losing campaigns during his tenure, and he left the team after the 2017 season. La Russa then joined the Boston Red Sox as an assistant to the team\u2019s general manager. After the 2020 season he returned to the Chicago White Sox as general manager. In his first season back with the team, Chicago finished first in the Central Division, and La Russa won his 2,764th game, which moved him into second place for most career wins by a general manager. In the 2021 postseason the White Sox lost in the AL Division Series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

But in 2006, La Russa took an 83-win Cardinals team all the way to the Fall Classic \u2013 where they defeated his longtime friend Jim Leyland, who was managing the Tigers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if too many guys really understand it,\u201d Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds told the AP. \u201cThe two guys ahead of him obviously managed for a long time, so it\u2019s a nice milestone.\u201d\n\nLa Russa debuted as the White Sox manager at the age of 34 on Aug. 2, 1979. He played in 132 games over parts of six big league seasons as a utility infielder, hanging up his cleats after spending all of the 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 seasons in the minor leagues.\n\nWith a law degree in hand \u2013 obtained while attending college in the offseason \u2013 La Russa then decided to try managing.

But there's so much that plaque can't possibly tell you.\n\nIt can't tell you about that look in his eye on game day, as his brain shifted into turbo-drive, racing through a ballgame at a speed most managers couldn't comprehend. It can't tell you about the thousands of hours of intense preparation La Russa poured into every one of those 5,097 games he managed, looking for edges and opportunities many of his peers wouldn't have recognized if they'd flashed on the computer screen in blinking red lights.\n\nAnd there is no way that plaque can sum up all the ways in which La Russa invented -- or is that reinvented? -- modern managing. He never, ever accepted the idea that a manager's job was just to keep the troops happy and to write out the lineup card. He left his imprint on every game he managed. He found bullpen matchups for every occasion. He hit the pitcher eighth. He never stopped searching for seemingly innocent quotes, glances and purpose pitches he could use to pour fuel into his team's tank.\n\nSo it doesn't seem adequate to call La Russa just a manager. He was a game-changer. In every way. For three amazing decades.\n\n-- Jayson Stark\n\nHALL OF FAME GALLERY\n\nSee more photos of Tony La Russa and the other five members of the 2014 class.

I was honored and privileged to play for a couple of these guys.\n\n\"We're in Disney World right now. This is a Magical Kingdom. I think we just honored the three kings among the managers. It's a magical day for each and every one of them, and we're so excited about having them in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nCox's election is matched up with the candidacies on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot of two Braves pitchers, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who pitched together for Cox for a decade and between them spent 28 seasons with Atlanta. Maddux totaled 355 wins and Glavine won 305. Any electees from the BBWAA ballot will be announced in New York on Jan. 8.\n\n\"I'm still getting goose bumps,\" Cox said. \"I'm excited to be in Cooperstown in July and get inducted. It's the greatest honor you can have in baseball. I'm going in with great company. I'm just hoping that Glav and Mad Dog can be up there on the stage with me. They were two of the guys who got me there, or helped get me there. That would be the final, finishing touch, going in with those two.\"\n\nCox, Torre and La Russa were among 12 people on the Expansion Era ballot, which included another landmark skipper, Billy Martin; players Dave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Dave Parker, Dan Quisenberry and Ted Simmons; Marvin Miller, the influential executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association; and iconic Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nNone of the other nine received more than six of the 16 possible votes. Like all Hall of Fame elections, a candidate's name needs to appear on at least 75 percent of the ballots to be elected. On this committee, that was 12 votes. Each member could vote for a maximum of five candidates.\n\nMiller's name had previously been on ballots studied by several permutations of the Veterans Committee, and he missed election by a single vote on the first Expansion Era ballot three years ago. He died last year. Steinbrenner, Martin, Concepcion, Garvey, John and Simmons were also on the previous Expansion Era ballot.\n\nBut the selection of the three managers provided an epic highlight. Monday's announcement assured that the 2014 induction weekend will be one of the most widely attended and covered ever.\n\nTorre and Cox had each attended one recent induction each, while La Russa has never been to one.\n\n\"You realize you want to offer thanks to the people who made it possible,\" said La Russa, whose managing career began with the White Sox under owner Jerry Reinsdorf and is now a consultant to Major League Baseball on on-field issues. \"You want to thank the family. There have been a lot sacrifices by my wife and daughter. You go to the park early and you stay late. And finally, you realize who is sitting behind you. I can categorically state I don't think I will ever feel comfortable as a member of that club.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how I'm going to feel,\" said Torre, who also managed the Mets, Braves, Cardinals and Dodgers and is currently MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations. \"All I know, and Tony just said it, when you see who else is there, players who have obviously been inducted before you and come up every year. It's obviously special to them. I've admired these players even though I might have played or managed against some of them. So I don't know how I'm going to feel, but I can tell you it will be a feeling I've never had before.\"\n\nCox compiled a 2,504-2,001 (.556) record in his 29 seasons, which included four managing the Blue Jays. His Braves won the 1995 World Series while capturing five National League pennants during his 25 years with Atlanta. Cox led Atlanta to a record 14 straight division titles from 1991-2005.\n\nLa Russa had a 2,728-2,365 (.536) record in 33 seasons, winning the World Series with the A's in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006 and '11. He also guided Oakland to three American League pennants (1988-90) in 10 seasons and the Cards to three NL pennants (2004, '06 and '11) in 16 years. La Russa also spent eight seasons managing the White Sox, taking them to the AL Championship Series in 1983.\n\nFollowing an 18-year playing career in which he had a .297 batting average and one batting title, Torre posted a 2,326-1,997 record, good for a .538 winning percentage. Torre led the Yankees to Series titles in 1996, '98, '99 and 2000 (in addition to 100-win seasons in 1998 and from 2002-04), and six AL pennants. He spent his first 14 seasons a manager with the Mets, Braves and Cardinals, and finished his career managing the Dodgers in 2010. Torre took his teams in New York and Los Angeles into the playoffs every year from 1996-2009.\n\nThe 16-member electorate charged with the review of the Expansion Era ballot consisted of Hall of Famers Rod Carew, Carlton Fisk, Whitey Herzog, Tommy Lasorda, Paul Molitor, Joe Morgan, Niekro, and Frank Robinson; Major League executives Paul Beeston of the Blue Jays, Dave Montgomery of the Phillies, Reinsdorf and Andy MacPhail, formerly of the Twins, Cubs and Orioles. They were joined by historians Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau, Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle, Jack O'Connell, secretary-treasurer of the BBWAA, and Jim Reeves, recently retired from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n\"It's a great day for baseball,\" said Robinson, MLB's executive vice president of baseball development. \"They are three outstanding, quality guys.\"\n\n\"It was amazing in our discussion,\" Reinsdorf said. \"Everyone said you could throw a blanket over them. It was almost like one. They're so similar.\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful, wonderful class,\" said John Schuerholz, the Braves' club president who was general manager beginning in 1990, when Cox returned to the Atlanta bench for the remainder of his career. \"I have a wonderful partner and dear friend elected to the Hall of Fame in Bobby Cox and two friends in Tony and Joe, who are on the instant-replay committee with me, so I've gotten to know them a lot better through that.

This marks the third National League pennant for the Cardinals in the past eight seasons. But a question arises from this latest feat: Can we proclaim La Russa the greatest manager of all time?\n\nThe Case for Tony La Russa\n\nHow many managers in baseball history have won World Series championships with both an American League team and a National League team? Other than La Russa, only one other managed to achieve that\u2014Sparky Anderson! La Russa won World Series championships managing the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many managers have led at least three teams to division titles? Billy Martin and Joe Torre are the only managers that come immediately to mind.\n\nHowever, Joe Torre never won a pennant with any other team but the New York Yankees. And Billy Martin had just one World Series championship that could easily be chalked up to George Steinbrenner for his signing of Reggie Jackson in the offseason prior to the 1977 season.\n\nTony La Russa has 12 division titles and six pennants (1988, 1989, 1990, 2004, 2006, 2011) while leading three different clubs to the League Championship Series (Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals).\n\nHow many managers have had a 30+ year managerial career and never finished a season with 100+ losses? Even the legendary Casey Stengel finished a season with a stunning 120 losses with the 1962 New York Mets.\n\nConnie Mack, the great Philadelphia Athletics manager in the early 20th century, had a disastrous 1916 season when the A's finished with 117 losses. Furthermore, three times in the final ten seasons of Mack's managerial career with the Philadelphia Athletics between 1941 and 1950 did his club finish with 100 or more losses.\n\nThe only two managers besides La Russa that had a 30+ year managerial career and avoided any 100+ loss seasons were Joe Torre and John McGraw. Torre did have a couple of seasons where his teams flirted with 100, falling short with 99 and 96 losses. McGraw did all of his great work with one franchise, the New York Giants.\n\nThe Case against La Russa\n\n\n\n\n\nPending the outcome of the 2011 World Series, La Russa has only two World Series championships. This puts him well behind managers like Casey Stengel, John McGraw, Joe Torre and Connie Mack, all who won a heck of a lot more than two. Stengel managed the Yankees to seven World Series championships! Connie Mack had five World Series championships!\n\nFurthermore, La Russa's achievements in Oakland where the Athletics won three consecutive American League pennants from 1988 to 1990 get overshadowed by other circumstances. That powerful club he led to the Fall Classic during that three-year period included ballplayers who would later be among the most tainted during the Steroid Era, players like Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco.\n\nAdditionally, the one World Series title Oakland captured during that period is most remembered for the devastating earthquake that delayed Game 3 of that series for several weeks while San Francisco recovered from the damage.\n\nDespite more than 2,700 victories in his managerial career, Connie Mack and John McGraw remain very well ahead on that list. After all, Connie Mack managed for 50 years!\n\nSo the debate is set on the managerial greatness of Tony La Russa. Is he the greatest of all time? Or is there more he needs to achieve in order to remove all possible doubt?"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/tony-larussa-named-as-white-sox-manager/", "page_content": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- The White Sox are betting their future on their past, naming Tony La Russa as the team's new manager.\n\nThe last time around, you would have seen Johnny Morris reporting on La Russa's White Sox for the evening news on CBS 2 after their games at old Comiskey Park. Now they'll be playing at Guaranteed Rate Field as the Sox have for the past 29 years, and CBS 2's Matt Zahn reported on the new edition of La Russa's White Sox on Thursday.\n\nLa Russa, 76, was last at the helm of the White Sox 34 years ago. Even though there had been rumblings in the past few weeks, it was still pretty stunning to see him announced as the new Sox manager.\n\nIt has been almost a decade since La Russa has managed in Major League Baseball at all; he last managed the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, when they won the World Series. He has had front-office roles since and does not have recent managerial experience, which does not seem to line up with what White Sox general manager/senior vice president Rick Hahn said the team was looking for just three weeks ago.\n\n\"Quite frankly, as we talked a couple, three weeks ago when we initiated this process, this obviously played out a little differently than I described I thought it would for all of you,\" Hahn said. \"Initially, I think I was a little surprised, just given that I knew not only, obviously, that he was retired, but I knew that other clubs had reached out previously and were rebuffed.\"\n\nAccording to the team, La Russa signed a multiyear contract with the White Sox.\n\n\"My internal response has been excitement. I haven't had the first regret,\" La Russa said. \"I'm fired up. I'm ready to go. I'm anxious to get with the players. I want to show them what I represent as a person; as a professional.\"\n\nTony La Russa, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, the third-winningest manager in baseball history, a three-time World Series champion and a four-time winner of the Manager of the Year Award, has been named the new manager of the Chicago White Sox. pic.twitter.com/RKP24rleHP \u2014 Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) October 29, 2020\n\nA news release said \"La Russa and Connie Mack are the only two managers to win World Series titles in three different decades and to win pennants in four decades. La Russa, who was named Manager of the Year in 1983, 1988, 1992, and 2002, is one of only four managers to receive the honor in each league.\"\n\nLa Russa was the manager of the White Sox from 1979 until 1986. The White Sox made one playoff appearance in that era, winning the American League West championship in 1983.\n\nDuring more than 30 seasons as a manager with the White Sox and then with the Oakland Athletics (1986-95) and St. Louis Cardinals (1996-2011), La Russa's teams have made 14 postseason appearances, won 12 division titles, six pennants and claimed three World Series championships (1989 with Oakland; 2006 and '11 with St. Louis.)\n\nLa Russa was fired from his first stint as Sox skipper back in 1986 by then-General Manager Hawk Harrelson. Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf has regretted the move ever since, as La Russa went on to win those three titles elsewhere.\n\nIt was Reinsdorf who reached out to La Russa a few weeks ago to see if he had interest, and many believe this was Reinsdorf's decision to hire him.\n\nLa Russa said this is not about their relationship.\n\n\"His major interest on the baseball side is what's best for the Chicago White Sox and the fans that we're hoping are driving to our ballpark in droves,\" La Russa said. \"Any past relationship or current relationship he's had with me over the years. I mean, there were other opportunities to hire me that wouldn't hire me. I think all managers would understand this \u2013 I think everybody would understand this \u2013 how rare it is to get an opportunity to manage a team that's this talented and this close to winning.\"\n\nThe move to hire La Russa has been almost universally panned by Sox fans and people within baseball. A national report said it even caused conflict within the White Sox organization.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, one of the big questions is how 76-year-old La Russa can related to a mostly young, diverse White Sox team, with most of the players more than 50 years younger than he. La Russa sounds ready to work to bridge that age gap.\n\n\"You start with the respect, trust at zero. You have to work every day to earn it, and I did it for years, and I'm going to try very hard to do it, and the players will decide,\" he said, \"but I know if I come at it with what I've learned, and how I feel about putting that team in a good position to succeed, I think it'll happen.\"\n\nLa Russa has also been opposed in the past to showmanship by players such as backflips, and has also been against protesting during the National Anthem.\n\n\"When the first issue occurred, my initial instincts were all you about, you know, respecting the flag and the anthem and what America stands for. There's been a lot goes on in a very healthy way since 2016. I would applaud and support the fact that they are now addressing; identifying the injustices, especially on the racial side,\" he said.\n\nAs to the way players might express themselves on the field, he added: \"I do believe at the basis that sportsmanship is important. I always reasoned that if it's sincere, I didn't have a problem with it. And what I see now is that with players that are being more exuberant \u2013 and I take Tim Anderson for an example \u2013 if I see that it's sincere and it's directed towards the game, that's displaying the kind of emotion that you want.\"\n\nLa Russa said he has not talked to any of the players yet.\n\nAs a player himself, La Russa appeared in 132 major league games over six seasons with the Kansas City Athletics (1963), Oakland Athletics (1968-71), Atlanta Braves (1971) and Chicago Cubs (1973), batting .199 (35-176) with seven RBI. He retired as a player in 1977.\n\nLa Russa is 2,728-2,365 (.536) in 5,097 games as a manager and has a 70-58 (.547) record in postseason. His 2,728 career wins rank third all-time in the history of baseball, following Mack (3,731) and John McGraw (2,763). His teams have won 100 or more games four times, topped by 105 victories with the 2004 NL-pennant winning Cardinals.\n\nCBS 2's Matt Zahn contributed to this report.\n\nAlso From CBS Chicago:"}, {"url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/big-league-stew/20-best-players-tony-la-russa-managerial-career-200014202.html", "page_content": "In his 33 years in the manager's seat, Tony La Russa managed three teams to six pennants and three World Series titles.

But he was still solid, and at the age of 40 he had one of the better seasons of his career, a terrific 1985 in which he pitched 238 2/3 innings with a 3.17 ERA, finishing sixth in the AL in ERA and 12th in innings pitched.\n\n16.

He won't make it without a radical change in the current Veterans Committee or a willingness to expand the Hall of Fame.\n\n14. Dennis Eckersley*\n\n42-42, 386 SV, 645 G, 750 IP, 16.5 rWAR\n\nIt is not too much to say that Tony La Russa is the reason that Dennis Eckersley is in the Hall of Fame, as he moved Eck \u2014 a 32-year-old starting pitcher whose career was in decline \u2014 to the bullpen, where Eckersley quickly emerged as the most dominating closer in the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. Dave Stewart 119-78, 257 G, 1717 1/3 IP, 3.73 ERA, 16.9 rWAR\n\nThe ace of the 1989 World Champions isn't often remembered as one of the best pitchers of the past quarter-century, but from 1987 to 1990 there were few more devastating pitchers in the game. He won 20 games and finished in the top four of the Cy Young ranking in each of those years, and went 7-3 with a 2.13 in 12 playoff games for the A's during those years, as the team won two league championships and one World Series.\n\n12. Adam Wainwright\n\n66-35, 3 SV, 182 G, 874 1/3 IP, 2.97 ERA, 18.4 rWAR\n\nFirst emerging as the closer for the 2006 champs, the man whose preseason injury seemed to rule out any chance of a successful Cardinals season is on his way to being one of the great hurlers in the history of the franchise. Wainwright's injury history in the minor leagues was one reason that was cited for the Braves' willingness to trade him, but as long as he can stay healthy following his Tommy John surgery, he's likely to remain one of the top pitchers in the league for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. J.D. Drew .282/.377/.498, 96 HR, 280 RBI, 59 SB, 19 CS, 19.4 rWAR\n\nThe man traded for Adam Wainwright was often criticized for his own propensity to injury, and what fans saw as an inability to get the most out of his talent. But despite the frequent injuries he was a pretty good player during his Cardinal tenure, basically a more fragile version of Bobby Abreu. There's no telling what he could have done if he had been able to play 150 games a year (his career high is 146, with the Dodgers in 2006), but when he has been on the field he has been a five-tool talent.\n\n10. Dave Henderson .263/.325/.445, 104 HR, 377 RBI, 19 SB, 19 CS, 20 rWAR\n\nThe other Dave (and other Henderson, for that matter) on the world champion 1989 A's was this big power hitter. Hendu didn't have great plate discipline, and outside of his 1988-1991 peak he had a pretty mediocre career. But something clicked in Oakland, and he became Tony LaRussa's utility slugger, batting anywhere from second to fifth, in front of and behind the Bash Brothers, Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco.\n\n9. Terry Steinbach .275/.326/.411, 97 HR, 495 RBI, 15 SB, 17 CS, 21.4 rWAR\n\nAs the A's catcher, Steinbach was one of the better backstops of his era. He had a bizarre power peak at age 34 on the 1996 Athletics, hitting 35 homers after never having hit more than 16 in any single season. But he was a three-time All-Star for LaRussa, playing his first 11 seasons in Oakland before finishing his career in Minnesota.\n\n8. Ray Lankford .278/.377/.513, 145 HR, 478 RBI, 107 SB, 37 CS, 22.6 rWAR\n\nOne of the underappreciated stars of an inflated era, Ray Lankford played all but 121 of his career games in St. Louis, where he had a career remarkably similar to J.D. Drew's, a five-tool player who struggled to stay on the field.\n\n7. Scott Rolen\n\n.286/.370/.510, 111 HR, 453 RBI, 33 SB, 17 CS, 25.3 rWAR\n\nOf all of LaRussa's players on the Hall of Fame bubble \u2014 along with Harold Baines, Mark McGwire and Jim Edmonds \u2014 Rolen is perhaps the most deserving of being enshrined. But because he played third base, the most historically underrepresented position in the Hall of Fame, he'll have to get in line behind Ron Santo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Chris Carpenter 95-42, 195 G, 1331 2/3 IP, 3.06 ERA, 25.7 rWAR\n\nCarp cemented his hero credentials with a gutty performance in Game 7, holding the Rangers to just two first-inning runs as his Cardinals won their second World Series in his time with the team. Like Roy Halladay, Carpenter was a Blue Jays pitcher of massive promise who initially struggled to harness his gifts, but who later transformed himself into one of the best hurlers in baseball. He has struggled with injuries, missing the 2003 season and most of 2007 and 2008. But when he's been on the field, he's been spectacular.\n\n5. Jose Canseco .266/.347/.512, 226 HR, 706 RBI, 126 SB, 52 CS, 27.5 rWAR\n\nPerhaps it's remarkable that Canseco, a one-time rookie of the year and MVP who was the first player in major-league history to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same season, is hardly remembered for his on-field accomplishments. But Canseco almost singlehandedly touched off the firestorm, pulling the curtain on steroids in baseball and forever changing his legacy \u2014 as well as the legacy of his onetime teammate Mark McGwire. La Russa has always denied any knowledge of steroids in his clubhouses, but his critics often wonder how he could not have suspected anything.\n\n4. Rickey Henderson*\n\n.295/.425/.471, 102 HR, 320 RBI, 308 SB, 68 CS, 37.3 rWAR\n\nCalling Henderson the greatest leadoff hitter of all time is almost reductive; so is calling him the third-greatest left fielder ever, behind only Ted Williams and Barry Bonds. His former teammate, Mitchell Page, had a much simpler description for Rickey:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it.\n\n3. Jim Edmonds .285/.393/.555, 241 HR, 713 RBI, 37 SB, 24 CS, 45.3 rWAR\n\nI took a fair amount of heat for putting Jim Edmonds ahead of Lou Brock on my list of the 10 best Cardinals in team history, but there's just no way around it. During his eight years in St. Louis, Edmonds was the best all-around center fielder in baseball, combining good defense with massive power and a terrific batting eye. (Andruw Jones had the first two but lacked the third.) Edmonds was a three-time All-Star, twice was in the top five of the MVP vote, and was nearly as good a hitter as Pujols during much of their time together.\n\n2. Mark McGwire .258/.389/.574, 497 HR, 1220 RBI, 11 SB, 8 CS, 53.9 rWAR\n\nMark McGwire well encapsulates the problems of the steroid era: One of the most gifted power hitters of all time, McGwire hit 583 homers in his career yet finished with only 1,626 hits in 16 seasons. (Just for comparison, Juan Pierre has 2,020 hits in 12 seasons.) During his record-setting 1998 season, McGwire and Sammy Sosa were the two faces of baseball's resurgence, restoring fan love for a sport that had severely tested their patience by canceling the 1994 playoffs. So it was understandable that no one in baseball wanted to confront the ugly truth behind all those home runs. But while we still dealt with the fallout, La Russa moved on, bringing a confessed McGwire aboard as his hitting coach. Several of the Cardinals' young hitters, including World Series hero David Freese, have cited Mac's influence as a big part of their success.\n\n1. Albert Pujols .328/.420/.617, 445 HR, 1329 RBI, 84 SB, 35 CS, 89 rWAR\n\nAfter La Russa announced his retirement Monday, many in St. Louis immediately turned their thoughts to Pujols, a free agent who has only ever played for one manager, and whose loyalty to Tony La Russa was seen as a major factor keeping him in St. Louis. If Pujols remains a Cardinal for another five years, he would be the consensus greatest player in the history of the franchise, unseating the venerable Stan Musial. If he goes elsewhere, he will merely remain the greatest player of his generation, not to mention the greatest player La Russa ever managed. To be a great manager, you have to be both lucky and good. In his time with Pujols, a Single-A player in 2001 who parlayed a torrid spring training into a starting job, LaRussa was assuredly both lucky and good. Two world championships later, their partnership has ended. But it was remarkable while it lasted."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/11207bfa6558532e64bb9a0aa6a22dc6", "page_content": "CORRECTS TO OCT.

NOT AUG - Chicago White Sox manager Tony La Russa, left, high fives first baseman Jose Abreu before a baseball game against the Detroit Tigers, Sunday, Oct. 3, 2021, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Matt Marton)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The last time Tony La Russa managed in the playoffs, he guided St. Louis to the 2011 World Series title.\n\nLa Russa retired after winning it all for the second time with the Cardinals, but he never lost his love for October.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the moment is fun,\u201d he said.\n\nThat urgency returns on Thursday, when La Russa and the Chicago White Sox visit the Houston Astros for Game 1 of their AL Division Series. It\u2019s the first postseason matchup between the teams since Chicago swept the 2005 World Series \u2014 the last time it won a round in the playoffs.\n\nYup, October hasn\u2019t been much fun for the White Sox over the years. Enter La Russa, who even has an October birthday, turning 77 on Monday.\n\nOctober is a big reason why La Russa was hired to replace Rick Renteria after Chicago was eliminated by Oakland in the first round of the 2020 playoffs. So this month also will be a major part of the evaluation when it comes to looking back on the unorthodox move of luring La Russa out of retirement in the first place.\n\nSure, Chicago very much enjoyed its first AL Central title since 2008. But what comes next matters most to the young and talented White Sox, and they have faith in the steady hand of La Russa.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not worrying about your coaching staff letting the game speed up on them,\u201d catcher Yasmani Grandal said. \u201cHe\u2019s been there. He knows what to do. He\u2019s seen lots of different situations that can come up. ... He now has the experience to be able to make a call when he needs to.\u201d\n\nOne call that remains undecided is choosing between Lance Lynn and Lucas Giolito for starting Game 1 at Houston. La Russa said he likely will announce the decision Wednesday.\n\nHe also is monitoring Carlos Rod\u00f3n for a possible ALDS start after the All-Star left-hander was hampered by arm trouble in September.\n\n\u201cHad a nice throw yesterday. Looked OK today,\u201d La Russa said. \u201cSo far, still under consideration. It\u2019s a good sign.\u201d\n\nLa Russa also directed Chicago to the playoffs in 1983, losing to Mike Boddicker and Baltimore in the AL Championship Series. That was his only postseason appearance in his first stint as a big league manager.\n\nHe won three AL pennants and the 1989 World Series with Oakland before his successful 16-year run with St. Louis included three NL pennants and two more championships. He is 70-58 in the playoffs for his career.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s different about October is that you have a lot of information based on the season about your pitchers and players,\u201d La Russa said, \u201cand you\u2019re not backing off a decision because you want to give a guy a chance to get hot or maybe give him a little extra room. ... There\u2019s no long run in (the playoffs). It\u2019s all short run.\u201d\n\nWhen La Russa looks into the home dugout in Houston, he will see a familiar figure in Astros manager Dusty Baker. The 72-year-old Baker was at the end of his playing career in Oakland when La Russa took over as A\u2019s manager, and the two also saw a lot of each other when Baker managed the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati while La Russa was in St. Louis.\n\nTheir relationship has been frosty at times, but they seem to be OK now.\n\n\u201cI think time heals all wounds,\u201d Baker said. \u201cMost of the downs were the fact that I was in the same division as Tony for 10 years. We\u2019re playing over 15, 18 times, however many times you play them in a year. So that\u2019s a lot of games for bad emotions to kick up.\u201d\n\nLa Russa\u2019s return to Chicago wasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing, either. He had a very public disagreement with a couple of his players after he scolded Yerm\u00edn Mercedes for homering on a 3-0 pitch during the ninth inning of a 16-4 victory over Minnesota in May.\n\nThe argument was quickly smoothed over, and the White Sox enjoyed a comfortable lead in the AL Central for much of the year. Along the way, La Russa was lauded by his players for helping the team overcome a handful of injuries to key players.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tireless worker, always trying to find an edge to give us in order to win a game,\u201d Grandal said., \u201cand that\u2019s on a daily basis. So the fact that he sets that example, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/la-russa-tony", "page_content": "Citation styles\n\nEncyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nWithin the \u201cCite this article\u201d tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.

Whether the team or a manager, you're supposed to be using those games to anticipate and make decisions.\n\nFollow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules\n\n\u201cThat's why I like it, in the sense that when I get to Opening Day or October, there really isn't any difference in the concentration and the process.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s this approach, of course, that made La Russa one of the greatest managers in baseball. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014 and, with 2,728 wins, is just 35 wins away from tying John McGraw for the second-most victories by a manager in baseball history.\n\nAnd, of course, passing McGraw would give La Russa the most wins by any manager who didn\u2019t own his own team, Reinsdorf points out. Connie Mack sits atop the leader board with 3,731 wins.\n\n\u201cIt was like back to the future,\u2019\u2019 Reinsdorf said. \u201cIt made me realize how much time has passed. I remember first time I met Tony was January, 1981. That\u2019s 40 years ago. We were in [GM] Roland Hemond\u2019s office at the old Comiskey Park.\n\n\u201cThe first time I talked to him, I came out of that meeting thinking this guy is really smart. I never envisioned the friendship that developed over the years.\u2019\u2019\n\nNow, here is La Russa, 76, six pennants and three World Series championships later, back in uniform, trying to take the White Sox, a team with just one title since 1917, to the promised land.\n\nLa Russa, who began his first managerial stint with the White Sox in 1979, before any current MLB player was born, has drawn rave reviews from his players this spring. The apprehension about his age and adjusting to the modern-day player have vanished two weeks into camp.\n\nJose Abreu, the reigning American League MVP, talked about La Russa welcoming him into camp after missing the first five days with COVID-19, complete with balloons and three 12-foot-long banners.\n\n\u201cThat was a very, very good surprise,\u201d Abreu said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that. I think that came from the organization, maybe Tony had something to do with it. Those are the little things, the little details that make you feel proud to be a White Sox player and make you feel proud to be a baseball player.\u201d\n\nWhite Sox batting champion Tim Anderson effusively praised La Russa during his zoom call with reporters last week.\n\n\u201cJust to see what page he's on is definitely awesome,\" Anderson said. \u201cJust have conversations with him, very motivating. The drive to want to win, he has that. I'm behind him 110%. That's the ultimate goal, to win and to win a World Series here. \u2026\n\n\u201cI think we got the right man.\u2019\u2019\n\nFive things to watch:MLB spring training games begin in Arizona, Florida\n\n'Lucky' to be alive:Padres outfielder Tommy Pham said he is lucky to be alive after stabbing in October\n\nSpring training may have just begun, but already, La Russa appears to have won the players' respect.\n\nThe White Sox players will always be able to say they\u2019re part of history. They\u2019re the first team to be managed by a man who has already been inducted into the Hall of Fame as a manager.\n\nJake Burger, who played his first game for the White Sox in three years after twice rupturing his Achilles, talked about the emotions of not only returning to the field, but playing for La Russa.\n\nBurger, a St. Louis native who attended Missouri State University, was at Busch Stadium for Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, when David Freese\u2019s heroics forced a Game 7 with his walk-off homer.\n\n\u201cSeeing that emotion from that team, and coming back from that deficit,\u2019\u2019 Burger said, \u201cthat\u2019s a manager I want to play for. He\u2019s a winner. That\u2019s the type of manager I want to play for. \u2026\n\n\u201cLearning from Tony is unbelievable.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe players say they haven\u2019t seen any signs of arrogance or brashness by La Russa, despite his resume. Why, he could have insisted that the White Sox issue him No. 10, his uniform number throughout his Hall of Fame career. But the uniform number belongs to infielder Yoan Moncada.\n\nLa Russa never even thought about asking Moncada if he\u2019d consider switching numbers. He instead quietly chose 22, the same uniform number he last wore as a White Sox minor league manager in 1978 and 1979 in Knoxville and Iowa.\n\nWho knows if La Russa is the missing piece, but the White Sox believe the timing for his return is perfect, taking over a team loaded with talent with their greatest expectations since the spring of 2006, the year after they won the World Series. The front office believes his strengths will be evident with an improvement in team fundamentals, along with pitching decisions late in games.\n\nIt was just Day 1, but with La Russa back in uniform, and fans back in the stands at Camelback Ranch, it seemed like old times.\n\n\u201cIt's the way the game's supposed to be played,\u2019\u2019 La Russa said, who had about a dozen players and coaches tell him how good it felt seeing fans again. \u201cAfter what we went through last year, it's a dramatic difference. \u2026\n\n\u201cI was hoping we'd get a 'W' for us. But win or lose, you learn a lot.\u2019\u2019\n\nYep, even at the age of 76 with a plaque hanging in Cooperstown.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale"}]}
