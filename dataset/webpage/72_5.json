{"Thutmose III led campaigns into Nubia.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thutmose-III", "page_content": "Thutmose III , (died 1426 bce), king (reigned 1479\u201326 bce) of the 18th dynasty , often regarded as the greatest of the rulers of ancient Egypt . Thutmose III was a skilled warrior who brought the Egyptian empire to the zenith of its power by conquering all of Syria, crossing the Euphrates (see Tigris-Euphrates river system ) to defeat the Mitannians , and penetrating south along the Nile River to Napata in the Sudan. He also built a great number of temples and monuments to commemorate his deeds.\n\nIn the 22nd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, a formidable coalition was formed against Egypt , led by the king of Kadesh in northern Syria and no doubt supported by the Mitanni. At this moment of crisis, Hatshepsut died, and Thutmose as sole ruler began a series of annual military campaigns aimed at Nubia and the Levantine powers.\n\nAs he grew up, Thutmose may even have been entrusted with command of the army on campaign in Nubia ; he may have also fought in Gezer in Palestine . His grandfather Thutmose I had penetrated into northern Syria; Thutmose II, though far from a weakling, had not followed this success, and Hatshepsut may have been unwilling to send an army into the field. Thus, through inaction, Egyptian influence in Syria and Palestine declined. The sons and grandsons of the Syrian princes who had surrendered to Thutmose I no longer sent tribute, and the king of Mitanni , a powerful Mesopotamian kingdom with its capital beyond the Euphrates, was able to extend his control westward to the Mediterranean .\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II ; his mother was one of the king\u2019s secondary wives or a lesser harem queen, named Isis . Since there was no prince with a better claim to the throne, the boy was crowned king on the early death of his father; he was very young at the time. Hatshepsut \u2014the daughter of Thutmose I , the wife and sister of Thutmose II, and the mother of Thutmose III\u2019s half-sister Neferure\u2014acted as regent. By the seventh year of his reign this strong-minded and ambitious woman herself assumed the attributes, dress, and insignia of a king and to all intents and purposes reigned in his stead. As one of her courtiers says, \u201cshe directed the affairs of the whole land according to her wishes.\u201d Still, Thutmose was given an education befitting his royal station. He was taught all military skills, especially archery, which he demonstrated in public display, and horsemanship, in which he showed considerable prowess . He was later to boast that none among his followers could equal him in physical strength and in marksmanship.\n\nMilitary campaigns\n\nAfter a few months\u2019 preparation the king was ready to march at the head of his army. The first campaign is recorded in some detail on the walls of the temple he built at Karnak in Thebes, which describe the march to Gaza and thence to Yahmai south of the Carmel Range, the council of war, and the king\u2019s bold decision to surprise the enemy encamped at Megiddo, northeast of Carmel and about 18 miles (29 km) southeast of the modern city of Haifa. Thutmose\u2019s approach was by the route least expected\u2014a narrow defile over the mountain. It was successful: the enemy was defeated, and Megiddo was taken after a siege of eight months. In subsequent campaigns, which are less fully described in the annals, ports on the Phoenician coast were converted into Egyptian supply bases, and Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biq\u0101\u02bf (Bekaa) valley were taken.\n\nIn the 33rd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, the time was at last ripe for his most audacious move, an attack on the kingdom of Mitanni itself, which had grown stronger since the day when Thutmose I had taken its army by surprise. Thutmose planned the campaign well; pontoon boats were transported across Syria on oxcarts for the crossing of the Euphrates River. The ensuing encounter, which must have taken place on the eastern bank, is not described by the annalist; it resulted in the precipitate flight of the Mitannian king and the capture of 30 members of his harem and some hundreds of his soldiers. Triumphantly, Thutmose set up his commemorative inscription by the river\u2019s edge, next to that of his grandfather Thutmose I. It was his farthest point of advance. On the homeward journey he hunted elephant in the land of Niy, in the Orontes valley, and on his return he celebrated a great triumph at Thebes and dedicated prisoners and booty to the temple of the state god, Amon.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Native rulers, members of local ruling dynasties, were henceforward set to govern their own territories as vassals of Egypt and were bound by solemn oath to keep the peace, render annual tribute, and obey the Egyptian representative in the region, the \u201coverseer of foreign lands.\u201d Their sons were sent as hostages to Egypt and educated at court, so that in due course they might return to rule their inheritance, Egyptianized in outlook and sympathies. Fortresses were built, and Egyptian garrisons were stationed at key points along the coast and in the highlands.\n\nTo the south, Thutmose reaffirmed the southern boundary of Egyptian domination over Nubia as far as Kurgus, and at Napata, near Mount Barkal, he built a temple to Amon. He thoroughly subdued the turbulent Nubian tribes and employed many of them in the gold mines, which from his reign on became the basis of Egyptian wealth in foreign exchange with the princes of western Asia. For the last 12 years of his reign, he was content to enjoy the fruits of his victories. The tribute of Syria and Palestine and of the Sudan poured into his treasury; the annals list huge quantities of timber and metal ores, cattle, and grain delivered by the conquered. Minoan Crete and Cyprus, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites sent gifts. The tombs of high officials of the reign are decorated with scenes depicting the reception of foreign envoys coming from places as far away as the Aegean and the Greek mainland to lay their rich and exotic gifts at the feet of the pharaoh. The prestige of Egypt had never been so great."}, {"url": "https://www.archaeology.org/issues/393-2009/features/8919-sudan-kerma-nubian-kingdom", "page_content": "Excavations at a city on the Nile reveal the origins of an ancient African power\n\nBy MATT STIRN\n\nSeptember/October 2020\n\nAs the Nile slices through the barren desert of North Africa, it runs straight north, with the exception of one magnificent curve, reminiscent of a giant S. This stretch of the river winds through northern Sudan approximately 250 miles south of the Egyptian border. Known as the Great Bend of the Nile, it marks the southern boundary of Nubia, a region that stretches from Sudan into southern Egypt and has been home to the Nubian people for millennia. The modern Nubian town of Kerma sits at the northern end of the Great Bend. It is a bustling riverside community teeming with animated produce markets and fishing boats piled high with six-foot Nile carp. At the center of the town rises a five-story mudbrick tower, or deffufa in the Nubian language, which has kept watch there for more than 4,000 years. Consisting of multiple levels, an interior staircase leading to a rooftop platform, and a series of subterranean chambers, the Deffufa once functioned as a temple and the religious center of a Nubian city that was founded there around 2500 B.C. on what was once an island in the middle of the Nile. Also known as Kerma, it was the earliest urban center in Africa outside Egypt. Below the Deffufa, archaeologist Charles Bonnet of the University of Geneva has spent five decades excavating Kerma and its necropolis. Much of what scholars know of early Nubian history comes from ancient Egyptian sources, and, for a time, some believed Kerma was simply an Egyptian colonial outpost. The pharaoh Thutmose I (r. ca. 1504\u20131492 B.C.) did indeed invade Nubia, and his successors ruled there for centuries, just as later Nubian kings invaded and held Egypt during the 25th Dynasty (ca. 712\u2013664 B.C.). The ancient history of Egyptians and Nubians is, thus, closely intertwined. But Bonnet\u2019s excavations are offering a markedly Nubian perspective on the earliest days of Kerma and its role as the capital of a far-reaching kingdom that dominated the Nile south of Egypt. His finds there and at a neighboring ancient settlement known as Dukki Gel suggest that this urban center was an ethnic melting pot, with origins tied to a complex web of cultures native to both the Sahara, and, farther south, parts of central Africa. These discoveries have gradually revealed the complex nature of a powerful African kingdom. Bonnet began working at Kerma in 1976, some 50 years after Egyptologist George Reisner, the first archaeologist to dig at the site, closed his excavations. As the leader of the joint Harvard University\u2013Boston Museum of Fine Arts Expedition, Reisner had spent many years directing excavations at the Great Pyramid of Giza and working in southern Egypt, where he developed an interest in ancient Nubian culture and in connecting its history to that of the Egyptians. \u201cReisner thought the place to find new Egyptian art would be in northern Sudan,\u201d says Larry Berman, curator of Egyptology at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In 1913, by request of the Sudanese Antiquity Center in Khartoum, Reisner was directed to Kerma, which, at the time, was only vaguely known to Westerners from the accounts of nineteenth-century European explorers. He was completely unprepared for what was to come. \u201cWhen Reisner arrived at Kerma, he accidentally discovered a civilization the scope of which was unknown to the Western world,\u201d says Berman. Slideshow: New Look at Ancient Nubia\n\nIn his early years at the site, Reisner focused on excavating the giant Deffufa and investigating tombs in the city\u2019s necropolis two miles to the east. Dozens of royal tombs he uncovered there date to between 1750 and 1500 B.C., when the city was at its height. These tombs contained hundreds of human and animal sacrifices, jewelry crafted from quartz, amethyst, and gold, and preserved wooden funerary beds inlaid with scenes of African wildlife fashioned of ivory and mica. In one of the tombs Reisner unearthed a large, elegant granite statue depicting Lady Sennuwy, the wife of the prominent Egyptian governor Djefaihapi, who ruled a district north of Luxor sometime between 1971 and 1926 B.C. Nearby, Reisner found a broken bust of Djefaihapi himself. Most artifacts Reisner excavated were distinct from what he had seen in Egypt, which led him to determine that the inhabitants of the site were from a different culture, which he named Kerma after the surrounding modern town. Reisner also recognized that different African cultures had coexisted in the ancient city. One of these he called the C-Group, a somewhat enigmatic culture that would become key to understanding the site\u2019s origins. Despite recognizing that Kerma was populated by ancient Nubians, Reisner did not believe that the Kerma people had been capable of constructing such a magnificent site, and assumed that they had received help from the Egyptians. The Deffufa, he thought, was most likely the palace of Kerma\u2019s Egyptian governor. Of the thousands of artifacts that Reisner discovered at Kerma, the sculpture of Lady Sennuwy in particular cemented his Egyptocentric interpretations. \u201cThe statue was, at the time, the most beautiful Middle Kingdom statue that any American museum had ever found, and its discovery reinforced Reisner\u2019s ideas that Kerma was ruled and influenced by Egypt,\u201d says Berman. \u201cScholars at the time were completely unprepared to admit the existence of an indigenous civilization in Nubia that could rival that of Egypt.\u201d Bonnet\u2019s work at Kerma quickly showed that Reisner was wrong. His team\u2019s surveys of the city\u2019s necropolis revealed 30,000 burials in addition to those Reisner had excavated, making it one of the largest cemeteries yet discovered in the ancient world. And after unearthing tombs, buildings, and pottery that predated the 1500 B.C. Egyptian invasion of Nubia, Bonnet realized that Kerma was not merely an Egyptian colony, but had been built and ruled by Nubians. \u201cThe country was wrongly believed to have only depended on Egypt,\u201d says Bonnet. \u201cI wanted to reconstruct a more accurate history of Sudan.\u201d In addition to determining that Nubians had founded the city, the team began to identify evidence of other African cultures at Kerma. They discovered round huts, oval temples, and intricate curved-wall bastions that were distinct from both Egyptian and Nubian architecture, and instead mirrored buildings archaeologists have unearthed in southern Sudan and regions in central Africa. \u201cWe realized that the tombs, palaces, and temples stood out from Egyptian remains, and that a different tradition characterized the discoveries,\u201d says Bonnet. \u201cWe were in another world.\u201d Slideshow: New Look at Ancient Nubia\n\nThe Swiss team, now under the direction of University of Neuchatel archaeologist Matthieu Honegger, gradually started to piece together the history of that previously unknown world. They found that beginning around 3100 B.C., driven in part by an increasingly arid climate, people began to settle on the island in the Nile where Kerma would rise. These new arrivals lived in small settlements and used red brushed ceramics of a type that their descendants at Kerma would also use, and placed their huts in a distinctive semicircular pattern. Fortifications that had been unearthed by Bonnet\u2019s team showed that around 2500 B.C., the people of Kerma constructed a large fortress, and that a dense urban landscape quickly grew up around it. The city\u2019s residents built circular huts, larger communal wooden structures, bakeries, and markets. Large ceramic vessels throughout Kerma seem to have provided public drinking water, likely for both citizens and visitors. A small chapel was constructed where the Deffufa would later stand, and the entrance to the city was marked by a mudbrick-and-wood gate built in a style still evident in Nubian houses today. Royal quarters with an elaborate courtyard were constructed near the city center. Around this time, nobles were first entombed in the necropolis to the east of the site. In several ceramic workshops nearby, artisans created a style of ornate dining ware only found in the nobles\u2019 tombs. Bonnet believes these dishes were used during funeral rituals that involved meals held between mourning families and the recently deceased. The discovery of ceramic Egyptian trade seals, faience artifacts, and ivory and jewelry from southern Sudan, shows that Kerma was growing into an important trade center. Farmers contributed to the economy during this time by raising cattle and planting legumes and grain in irrigated ditches surrounding the city walls. Bonnet\u2019s team uncovered well-preserved evidence of this in traces of wooden plowshares, holes dug in the soil for as-yet-unplanted crops, and the footprints of both people and of oxen teams, along with thousands of domesticated cattle prints pressed into the hardened mud as if they had been made only a few weeks before. In addition to evidence of ambitious building projects and a growing economy, finds dating to early in the city\u2019s history indicate the arrival of the C-Group identified by Reisner, possibly from Darfur in western Sudan or modern-day South Sudan. Their emergence in Nubia, marked by the sudden appearance of incised black-and-white ceramics and distinctive grave decorations, suggests that they immigrated quickly into the region. Shortly after their arrival, these new people rapidly integrated with the local Nubians and began to assimilate into the city\u2019s culture, while maintaining a number of their own traditions. Slideshow: New Look at Ancient Nubia\n\nSome of the best evidence that Nubians and the people of the C-Group coexisted at Kerma has been uncovered by Honegger\u2019s team in the necropolis. They found that graves of Kerma people from this early period were generally small pit burials in which the dead were placed in a fetal position on a mat made from either leather or woven plants. Small rows of cattle skulls were often placed in an arc outside the grave, and additional objects such as ceramic vessels, jewelry, and sacrificed animals were arranged around the body. Most men were buried with an ostrich-plume bow, and most women had a wooden staff in their graves. Honegger\u2019s team has also discovered that during the necropolis\u2019 earliest phases, graves from the C-Group culture were surrounded by multiple stelas, and those of the Kerma culture were covered in a decorative pattern of black and white stones. Honegger was surprised that the style of ceramics found in the graves did not always correspond to the culture suggested by the decorations on the outside. In several instances, Honegger observed that Kerma pottery was found in graves marked by C-Group stelas, and C-Group pottery was excavated from graves marked by Kerma pebbles. For him, the mixture of funerary styles indicates that the two groups not only coexisted, but probably intermarried, and that upon their death, a person could be buried in a way that honored both traditions. Although evidence shows that the C-Group suddenly disappeared from Kerma around 2300 B.C. and moved north toward Egypt, their brief presence helped establish a multicultural foundation that would endure throughout Kerma\u2019s history. Some buildings Bonnet has unearthed at Kerma suggest that African influences from outside Nubia endured, and that foreign people continued to live at Kerma even after the C-Group departed. To him, the building styles there represent a conglomeration of cultures, with architecture not only influenced by Egyptian practices, but also inspired by other African traditions. In particular, a courtyard in the southern part of the city surrounded by circular structures and a small fort featuring curved defensive walls allude to African traditions that resemble modern architecture in Darfur, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. Much like the C-Group, however, the precise identity of these later African populations at Kerma remains unknown. Little archaeological research has been conducted in southern Sudan, and there are very few known sites with which to compare Kerma. Slideshow: New Look at Ancient Nubia\n\nKerma continued to thrive after the departure of the C-Group people. Bonnet and Honegger\u2019s excavations in the necropolis show that around 2000 B.C., Kerma\u2019s kings initiated construction of elaborate royal tombs surrounded by thousands of cattle skulls. This signaled the beginning of a new phase in the city\u2019s history as it grew in size and its rulers began to exert their influence across northeast Africa. Bonnet\u2019s analysis of the multiple building stages of the Deffufa shows that it was enlarged from a chapel into a multistory temple and became the city\u2019s religious center. Cults devoted to the sun likely worshipped atop the Deffufa and those dedicated to the underworld practiced rituals in a nearby windowless chapel. Excavations throughout the city show that the number of bakeries, workshops, religious structures, courtyards, and houses increased dramatically at this time. Bonnet also discovered that there was a significant increase in the number of wealthy houses, and that the royal quarters were expanded. The construction of increasingly robust fortifications suggests there were frequent military clashes with Egypt as both powers competed for control of the Nile Valley. Now firmly established in a fortified capital, around 1750 B.C., the kings of Kerma ordered an even more massive palace to be built. Their royal tombs also became even more lavish. At the southern end of the necropolis, Bonnet and Honegger have unearthed very large tombs, some measuring 200 feet in diameter and each containing more than 100 human sacrifices. An abundance of Egyptian artifacts and the discovery of ceramic trade seals bearing the names of Egyptian pharaohs in Kerma\u2019s necropolis suggest that, despite their military clashes, the two powers maintained close economic connections during this time. According to contemporaneous Egyptian inscriptions, however, this relationship deteriorated for good after a failed invasion of Egypt by Kerma in 1550 B.C. Following that campaign, the Egyptians responded with a series of invasions under Thutmose I around 1500 B.C., and Thutmose II (r. ca. 1492\u20131479 B.C.) some 20 years later. These resulted in brief Egyptian occupations of Nubia that were subsequently rebuffed by revolts and counterattacks. In 1450 B.C., Thutmose III (r. ca. 1479\u20131425 B.C.) launched a final campaign into Nubia. He successfully conquered Kerma and established a firm rule over the region. Scholars had long assumed that after the Egyptians conquered Kerma they moved the capital half a mile north to the site of Dukki Gel, where Bonnet and his team have excavated in recent years. The obvious presence of Egyptian buildings at Dukki Gel from the time of Thutmose I and later had always suggested that the city was founded by Egyptians, and that it functioned as a colonial center in much the same way Reisner once assumed Kerma had. But when Bonnet and his team began digging at the site, they unearthed fresh evidence of African architecture postdating the Egyptian invasion, a find that suggests African traditions continued at Dukki Gel perhaps after Kerma was abandoned. Even more surprising, once the team dug below the Egyptian settlement at Dukki Gel, they uncovered circular African buildings dating to before the Egyptian conquest. These buildings were defended by walls that have no known prototypes in the Nile Valley. Even though ancient cities were rarely built as close together as Kerma and Dukki Gel, for Bonnet the conclusion was inescapable\u2014this was an urban center that dated to the same time that Kerma was at its height. Bonnet wondered how an entire city built using non-Nubian African traditions and presumably serving a different population could have existed so close to Kerma. He notes that Egyptian sources say that their armies often contended not just with Nubians, but with coalitions of enemies to the south. Perhaps, he suggests, the kings of Kerma occasionally led a kind of federation of Nubians and Africans from farther south against Egypt. Leaders from the south may have brought their armies to Dukki Gel, which they built according to their traditions, and which might have functioned as a ceremonial and military center. Geomagnetic surveys at the site have yielded images of installations that might have been troop encampments, but these have yet to be excavated.

His reign, which spanned from around 1479 to 1425 BC, was one marked by his unrelenting thirst for dominance and power. Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns? And how did Thutmose III bring the mighty Mitannians to submission?\n\nBelow, World History Edu explores the life, family tree, military campaigns, and major achievements of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nQuick facts about Thutmose III\n\nBirth: c. 1481 BC\n\nDied: c. 1425 BC\n\nAged: 56\n\nBurial place: Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt\n\nReligion: Ancient Egyptian religion\n\nFather: Thutmose II\n\nMother: Iset\n\nSiblings: Neferure\n\nSpouses: Satiah, Nebtu, Menwi, Menhet, Merti, Nebsemi\n\nChief consort: Merytre-Hatshepsut\n\nChildren: Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, Siamun, Nefertiri, Amenemhat, Amenhotep II\n\nReign: 1479-1425 BC\n\nDynasty: 18th\n\nPredecessor: Queen Hatshepsut\n\nSuccessor: Amenhotep II\n\nEpithets: \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d, \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d\n\nOther names: Thutmosis (\u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d or \u201cThoth is born\u201d)\n\nMost known for: Steering ancient Egypt to its zenith ever\n\nConquests: northern Syria, parts of Nubia, Palestine, Niya Kingdom\n\nBirth and early life\n\nSon of Egyptian ruler Thutmose II and Queen Iset, Thutmose III was born around 1481 BC. Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://www.havefunwithhistory.com/thutmose-iii-accomplishments/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, often referred to as the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt,\u201d was a powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom who ruled from approximately 1479 BCE to 1425 BCE. He ascended the throne after a co-regency with his stepmother, Hatshepsut, and went on to become one of ancient Egypt\u2019s most renowned warrior pharaohs.\n\nThutmose III is best known for his military conquests, which expanded the Egyptian empire to its greatest territorial extent. His victories at the Battle of Megiddo and numerous other campaigns secured Egyptian dominance in Canaan, Syria, and Nubia.\n\nThutmose III was also an astute statesman, implementing administrative reforms, promoting trade and diplomacy, and fostering cultural and artistic development.\n\nHis reign marked a golden age in Egyptian history, characterized by military triumphs, territorial expansion, and the flourishing of arts and culture.\n\nAccomplishments of Thutmose III\n\n1. Thutmose III led numerous successful military campaigns, expanding the Egyptian empire through conquests\n\nThutmose III\u2019s military conquests were a defining aspect of his reign. He inherited a stable kingdom from his predecessor, Hatshepsut, but it was during his rule that Egypt witnessed an era of unprecedented military expansion.\n\nThutmose III led at least 17 military campaigns over the course of his reign, focusing on territories in Syria, Canaan, and Nubia.\n\nAlso Read: Facts About Thutmose III\n\nHis campaigns in Syria and Canaan aimed to secure Egyptian control over key trade routes and valuable resources. Thutmose III successfully captured and controlled major cities, such as Megiddo, Kadesh, and Joppa.\n\nThese conquests not only expanded Egypt\u2019s borders but also ensured Egypt\u2019s dominance in the region and provided access to crucial trade networks.\n\n2. Victory at the Battle of Megiddo\n\nThe Battle of Megiddo, fought in 1457 BCE, was a significant triumph for Thutmose III. The battle took place near the city of Megiddo, strategically located in the Jezreel Valley of modern-day Israel. Thutmose III faced a coalition of Canaanite and Syrian city-states, led by the King of Kadesh.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Thutmose III employed superior military tactics and effectively utilized chariots and infantry. The Egyptian forces surprised the coalition army and achieved a decisive victory.\n\nThe battle resulted in the capture of the King of Kadesh and the submission of numerous Canaanite city-states. This victory secured Egyptian control over Canaan, opening the way for further campaigns and solidifying Thutmose III\u2019s reputation as a skilled military commander.\n\n3. Thutmose III significantly expanded the Egyptian empire\n\nThutmose III\u2019s conquests significantly expanded the Egyptian empire. In addition to his successes in Syria and Canaan, he also turned his attention southward, pushing the borders of Egypt further into Nubia (modern-day Sudan).\n\nThutmose III launched a series of campaigns into Nubia, capturing and incorporating several major cities, including Kerma and Napata. These conquests allowed Egypt to control the lucrative trade routes along the Nile and gain access to valuable resources, such as gold and precious stones.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s territorial expansion not only increased Egypt\u2019s wealth and influence but also solidified its political power in the region. The conquered territories became Egyptian provinces, and Thutmose III\u2019s administration ensured the smooth governance of these regions, contributing to the stability and prosperity of the empire.\n\n4. Thutmose III implemented administrative reforms that streamlined governance and centralized power\n\nThutmose III implemented significant administrative reforms that enhanced governance and centralized power in Egypt. He established a bureaucracy that efficiently managed the vast territories he had conquered. The bureaucracy comprised officials who oversaw various aspects of governance, including tax collection, law enforcement, and resource management.\n\nThutmose III also strengthened the role of the vizier, the chief administrative officer, who played a crucial role in coordinating the activities of the bureaucracy. By streamlining administrative procedures and ensuring effective governance, Thutmose III was able to consolidate his control over the empire and maintain stability throughout his reign.\n\n5. Thutmose III was a great patron of temple construction and restoration\n\nThutmose III was a notable patron of temple construction and restoration. He embarked on ambitious building projects throughout Egypt, erecting temples dedicated to various deities. One of his most significant projects was the expansion and enhancement of the Temple of Amun at Karnak.\n\nThutmose III expanded the temple complex, adding new structures, courtyards, and pylons adorned with intricate reliefs and inscriptions. He also commissioned the construction of other temples, such as the Temple of Mut at Karnak and the Temple of Montu at Armant.\n\nThese temples served as religious centers, where elaborate rituals and ceremonies were performed to honor the gods and affirm the divine authority of the pharaoh.\n\n6. He fostered trade relationships and engaged in diplomatic exchanges with neighboring regions\n\nThutmose III actively fostered trade relationships and engaged in diplomatic exchanges with neighboring regions. He recognized the importance of international trade and sought to expand Egypt\u2019s commercial networks. Thutmose III established diplomatic ties with kingdoms such as Mitanni, Babylonia, and the Hittites.\n\nThrough these diplomatic relationships, Thutmose III secured alliances and trade agreements that benefited Egypt\u2019s economy. Egyptian goods, such as textiles, precious metals, and luxury items, were exported to these regions, while Egypt imported valuable resources, including timber, metals, and exotic goods.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s emphasis on trade and diplomacy contributed to the prosperity of Egypt and strengthened its standing in the ancient Near East. It also promoted cultural exchange, as Egyptian influences spread to other regions, and foreign influences enriched Egyptian art, architecture, and material culture.\n\n7. Thutmose III undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve communication and transportation\n\nThutmose III was keen on improving infrastructure to facilitate trade, communication, and the movement of troops throughout the empire. He undertook significant construction projects, including the building of roads, bridges, and canals.\n\nThe construction of well-maintained roads and bridges allowed for faster and more efficient transportation of goods, armies, and messengers across Egypt and its conquered territories. Canals were also constructed to improve irrigation and enhance agricultural productivity in certain regions.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s infrastructure development initiatives played a vital role in connecting different parts of the empire, promoting economic growth, and ensuring effective governance.\n\n8. Thutmose III encouraged artistic and cultural activities during his reign\n\nThutmose III actively encouraged artistic and cultural activities during his reign. His patronage of the arts contributed to a flourishing of creativity in Egypt.\n\nUnder Thutmose III, Egyptian artists produced exquisite statues, reliefs, and other artistic masterpieces. These artworks showcased the pharaoh\u2019s power, celebrated his military conquests, and conveyed religious and mythological themes.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s support of artistic endeavors helped create a distinct artistic style known as the \u201cThutmoside style,\u201d characterized by naturalistic representations, attention to detail, and a sense of movement. This artistic style would influence subsequent generations of Egyptian artists.\n\n9. Thutmose III organized a successful expedition to the land of Punt, an enigmatic region known for its wealth and exotic resources\n\nThutmose III organized and successfully led an expedition to the land of Punt, an enigmatic region located in present-day Somalia and Eritrea. Punt was renowned for its wealth, exotic goods, and valuable resources.\n\nThe expedition aimed to establish trade relations with Punt and secure access to its riches. Thutmose III\u2019s fleet sailed down the Red Sea and reached Punt, where they traded with the local inhabitants. The expedition brought back valuable commodities such as frankincense, myrrh, ebony, gold, and exotic animals.\n\nThe expedition to Punt not only enriched Egypt\u2019s economy but also expanded its knowledge of distant lands and strengthened its influence in the region.\n\n10. Thutmose III commissioned numerous monuments and stelae to commemorate his military triumphs and divine rule\n\nThutmose III commissioned numerous monuments and stelae to commemorate his military triumphs and divine rule. These monumental structures served as visible reminders of his achievements and were strategically placed throughout Egypt.\n\nOne notable example is the famous Victory Stele of Thutmose III, also known as the \u201cIsrael Stela.\u201d This inscribed stone monument, erected at the Temple of Amun in Karnak, details Thutmose III\u2019s successful campaign in Canaan and mentions his encounter with the \u201crulers of Canaan\u201d and the \u201cAsiatics of Retenu,\u201d which scholars believe may refer to early encounters with the Israelites.\n\nAdditionally, Thutmose III commissioned the construction and embellishment of temples, such as the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the Temple of Mut at Karnak, and the Temple of Montu at Armant. These grand structures served to glorify the gods and assert the pharaoh\u2019s divine right to rule.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s monumental commemorations played a crucial role in shaping the narrative of his reign and cementing his legacy as one of Egypt\u2019s greatest pharaohs."}, {"url": "https://dailyhistory.org/How_Did_the_Nubians_Impact_Ancient_Egypt", "page_content": "Relief Depicting Egyptian King Ramesses II \u201cSmiting\u201d a Nubian Prisoner\n\nAmong ancient Egypt\u2019s many neighbors were the Nubians, who inhabited the Nile Valley to the south of Egypt in what is today the nation-state of Sudan. Although the Egyptians and Nubians had many peaceful interactions over several centuries, the two peoples' political leaders had a more acrimonious and contentious relationship. When the Egyptian state was strong, Nubia was usually weak and vice versa. To the Nubians, Egypt was the source of high culture and civilization that they admired and eventually replicated in many ways. Simultaneously, the Egyptians viewed the lands to their south as a source of resources to be exploited. Gold, ivory, and ebony were commodities that the Egyptians took from Nubia and traded with other Near Eastern kingdoms as far away as Babylon and Assyria.\n\nBut the relationship between the Nubians and Egyptians extended far beyond exploitation of resources and ancient forms of colonialism; by the first millennium BC, the Nubians had impacted many aspects of pharaonic culture. In 728 BC, a Nubian king named Piankhy, or Piye, led an army from Nubia north into Egypt and conquered the land, establishing the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty. Although the Nubian Twenty-Fifth Dynasty lasted less than 100 years, its kings were very active in shaping Egypt\u2019s political situation.\n\nThe Nubians also influenced the Egyptian culture of the Late Period \u2013 the period from approximately 728 BC until the Christian Era \u2013 by promoting \u201carchaizing\u201d features in royal ideology and art. Their influence on Egyptian art is perhaps the most noticeable because it reintroduced older styles while putting their own unique stamp on the finished products, especially in reliefs and statuary. They usually depicted themselves with their distinct sub-Saharan racial features instead of as typical Egyptians.\n\nAncient Nubian Culture\n\nMap of Egypt and Nubia: The Numbers Represent the Cataracts of the Nile River\n\nThe term \u201cNubia\u201d is actually a modern word, which may be derived from the ancient Egyptian word for gold \u2013 nebu. To both the Egyptians and Nubians, the Nile River was the source of their lifeblood. It brought yearly floods that allowed their crops to grow, so both peoples were geographically orientated along a north-south axis. The Egyptians referred to anything south of the first cataract (cataracts are rocky portions of a river unnavigable by boat) as \u201cWawat,\u201d and anything south of the second cataract was called \u201cKush.\u201d Collectively, Wawat and Kush comprise the region that modern scholars generally refer to as Nubia. [1]\n\nThe Egyptians were a fairly xenophobic people who often used various names to refer to their neighbors and other non-Egyptians with whom they dealt. They often referred to the Nubians in texts by the fairly neutral term \u201cNehesy,\u201d but also liked to employ more colorful epithets such as the \u201cwretched Kushites.\u201d [2] The ancient Egyptians were quite cognizant of the differences between them and all of their neighbors, as evidenced by the many \u201csmiting\u201d scenes on New Kingdom temples where the Egyptian king is shown about to club bound foreign prisoners with a mace.\n\nThe tomb of the New Kingdom Nineteenth Dynasty Egyptian King Seti I (reigned ca. 1305-1290 BC) depicts Egypt\u2019s three major neighbors and enemies: Nubians, Libyans, and Asiatics/Canaanites. [3] Each of the non-Egyptians was depicted wearing his traditional clothing and with his specific skin color and facial features \u2013 the Nubian was shown as black, as opposed to the reddish-brown Egyptian, and with clearly sub-Saharan African facial features. Based on the art historical evidence in Egypt, especially from the New Kingdom, one may think there was a clear and distinct line between the Egyptians and Nubians, but this was not always the case.\n\nFrom a relatively early time, Egyptians and Nubians interacted peacefully with each other in trade, as neighbors in Egyptian held portions of Nubia, and some even intermarried. Egyptian kings were impressed with the Nubians\u2019 martial abilities and often used Nubian bowmen contingents in their armies as mercenaries. Nubian mercenaries would work and live in Egypt and sometimes married Egyptians. Several examples of funerary stelae (offering stones) from Egypt\u2019s First Intermediate Period (ca. 2150-2050 BC) depict Nubian mercenaries with their Egyptian wives. The Nubian mercenaries are dressed in traditional Egyptian clothing, but their skin color and physiognomy show them clearly as Nubian. [4]\n\nIn Nubia proper, Nubian cultural life was centered around the city of Napata, which functioned as the capital for most ancient Nubia\u2019s early existence. [5] Kerma grew steadily in size and influence through the late third millennium BC and into the early second millennium BC \u2013 which coincided with the first collapse of the Egyptian state, known by modern scholars as the \u201cFirst Intermediate Period\u201d \u2013 until Upper and Lower Egypt were united once more during the Middle Kingdom (ca. 1975-1640 BC).\n\nSenusret I (ruled ca. 1971-1926 BC), the second king of Egypt\u2019s Twelfth Dynasty, proved to be an especially warlike pharaoh, which was detrimental to the Kerma state. The Egyptian king led several military campaigns into Nubia. He created a series of thirteen forts from the first cataract just south of Aswan/Abu in the north to the second cataract, near the city of Buhen in the south. [6] Egypt was clearly the stronger state at that point in history and influenced Nubia much more culturally than the other way around. For instance, the early Nubian architecture of palaces and tombs was circular and more traditionally African but was gradually replaced by a rectangular, Egyptian shape. [7]\n\nThe Height of Nubian Power\n\nThe Edge of the First Cataract Near Modern Aswan/Ancient Abu\n\nThe height of Nubian political power in the region came during Egypt\u2019s Second Intermediate Period (ca. 1750-1650 BC), when a foreign dynasty known as the \u201cHyksos\u201d people were in control of northern Egypt. Though, the Nubians had extended their power from the Dongola Reach region around Kerma all the way north to the first cataract. [8] and were apparently not content with that as they were involved in an alliance with the Hyksos. [9] The Nubians probably had their eyes set on acquiring the region around Thebes, which also happened to be the home of the only native Egyptian dynasty at the time, but quickly had their plans destroyed when the Egyptian King Ahmose (reigned ca. 1552-1527 BC) came to power, initiating the Eighteenth Dynasty and the New Kingdom and putting Nubia once more into an inferior political position.\n\nNubia during Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom (ca. 1550-1075 BC)\n\nNubia\u2019s political ambitions took a dramatic turn for the worse when the Egyptian king Thutmose III (ruled ca. 1479-1425 BC) came to the throne. Thutmose III was a particularly active military pharaoh who is often compared to Julius Caesar. Most of Thutmose III\u2019s recorded military campaigns were of his several Levant expeditions. Still, he did leave many textual and pictorial depictions of his campaigns into Nubia. He had a victory stela erected in the Nubian city of Gebel Barkal near the fourth cataract, indicating Egyptian influence, if not outright control, extended that far south during the New Kingdom. [10]\n\nBy the Nineteenth Dynasty, the Egyptians had colonized Nubia so thoroughly that a new government office was created known as the \u201cking\u2019s son of Kush.\u201d The king\u2019s son of Kush essentially functioned as a viceroy of the region, overseeing the trade and colonization. [11] But as with hundreds of years of prior Egyptian-Nubian history, Egypt\u2019s primacy would falter once more, and Nubia would be there to take advantage.\n\nThe Twenty-Fifth Dynasty\n\nStatue of King Taharqa in the National Museum of Sudan, Khartoum\n\nEgypt\u2019s the New Kingdom collapsed over a long period marked by widespread migrations of Libyans into Egypt, especially in the Delta region. The result was a politically fragmented Egypt: a dynasty of native Egyptian priests temporarily ruled the region around Thebes. In contrast, the Twenty-First through the Twenty-Fourth dynasties were all Libyan in ethnic origins, often ruling different parts of the country simultaneously. [12] This period of political fragmentation and Libyan domination has become known as the Third Intermediate Period (1075-664 BC) by modern historians. Before Egypt politically and socially disintegrated, the Nubians moved their capital farther south to Napata, which was located near the fourth cataract.\n\nOver the course of hundreds of years, the Nubians adopted many of the Egyptians' important cultural attributes, including writing and aspects of their religion. In many ways, by the time of the Third Intermediate Period, the Nubians were more pious followers of the Egyptian pantheon than the Egyptians were. Because of their faith in the Egyptian religion, the Nubian elite developed close ties to the priesthood of the god Amun of Thebes. It was probably under their urging that Piankhy (reigned over Egypt 728-714 BC) decided to invade Egypt to dislodge a Libyan potentate named Tefnakht from power in the Delta. [13]\n\nPiankhy marched north along the Nile with his army, defeating one Libyan potentate after another until they all pledged their fealty to him. [14] After defeating the Nubians, Piankhy returned to the royal palace in Napata and never returned to Egypt, but he did establish a long-lasting political connection. Piankhy\u2019s successors would comprise Egypt\u2019s Twenty-Fifth Dynasty, ruling over both Nubia and Egypt from the Egyptian capitals of Memphis and Thebes.\n\nThere was once a consensus among Egyptologists that Shabaqa (reigned 714-702 BC) was Piankhy\u2019s successor and that Shebitqu (ruled 702-690 BC) next, but some scholars have inverted the rules of the two kings in recent years. One source that favors the first chronology is a transmission from the third century BC Hellenized Egyptian historian, Manetho. According to two of Manetho\u2019s fragments, Shabaqa had to invade Egypt to defeat a usurper in the Delta.\n\nThe man in question was Bakenranef (reigned ca. 724-712 BC), who was Tefnakht\u2019s successor and the sole king of the Libyan Twenty-Fourth Dynasty city of Sais. One of the fragments states: Sabac\u00f4n, who, taking Bochch\u00f4ris captive, burned him alive and reigned for 8 years.\u201d [15] Shabaqa\u2019s actions put the Nubians in firm control of Egypt once more, which would last until the Assyrians arrived in 671 BC.\n\nShebitqu\u2019s successor, Taharqa (ruled 690-664 BC), was probably the ablest of all the Nubian kings. Taharqa was active in foreign affairs, siding with the Kingdom of Israel against Assyria, which unfortunately for Egypt eventually brought the Assyrians\u2019 wrath to the Nile Valley. Taharqa\u2019s wars with Assyria began around 674 BC, but before that time, the Nubian pharaoh embarked on ambitious building programs throughout Egypt. [16]\n\nTaharqa was an active builder in the region around Thebes, adding to existing temples through repairs and additions. One of the more interesting additions Taharqa made was a scene he added to the second pylon of the Medinet Habu temple. New Kingdom temples were traditionally built with large gateways, known as pylons, which were decorated with colorful pictorial reliefs of the pharaoh smiting Egypt's traditional enemies. The Medinet Habu temple's second pylon has a somewhat ironic relief depicting King Taharqa smiting Nubian prisoners. [17] Taharqa certainly influenced Egypt\u2019s foreign affairs and architecture to a certain extent, but the greatest impact the Nubians had was in the realm of art.\n\nPerhaps the Nubians' greatest impact on ancient Egypt was to bring back older, more established artistic styles in what modern scholars term archaism. In pictorial reliefs and especially in statuary, the Nubians were influenced by styles from Egypt\u2019s Old and Middle Kingdoms, but they added a couple of their own unique elements. Statues from the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty, especially those of the rulers such as Taharqa, often depict the subject in a much more realistic or individual manner than the normally stylized and somewhat generic fashion that was typical of Egyptian statuary.\n\nFor instance, although Taharqa is shown wearing an Egyptian king's typical accouterments and clothed in traditional Egyptian garb, he is depicted as taller, more muscular, and with definite sub-Saharan African facial features. [18] dynasties after the Nubians continued the realistic style, eventually evolving to become true portraiture statuary.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Nubians have been the Egyptians\u2019 southern neighbors since the dawn of civilization over 5,000 years ago. During that time, the Egyptians were usually the dominant people, but the Nubians could impact pharaonic civilization in some ways. When the Egyptians were strong, especially during the New Kingdom, Nubia was a great wealth source for the Egyptians. The Egyptians established forts and colonies that exploited Nubia's rich mineral resources, which they then traded on the international market with other Near Eastern kingdoms.\n\nLater, when the central government in Egypt collapsed, the Nubians conquered Egypt and brought back certain stability. The Nubians then involved themselves in the Near East's affairs, but that ultimately proved detrimental to Egypt. Finally, the Nubians brought back older artistic styles and conventions that gave new impetus to a culture that seemed exhausted of ideas.\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Morkot, Robert.

We will also explore how he helped to shape Ancient Egyptian culture and society.\n\nThere are many great Pharaohs in Ancient Egyptian history, but Thutmose III stands out as one of the most impressive. He was a successful warrior and leader who accomplished a great deal during his reign.\n\nEarly life\n\nThutmose III was born around 1481 BC to Pharaoh Thutmose II and Queen Isis. His father died when Thutmose III was about two-years old. While he was technically now pharaoh, Thutmose III was too young to actually rule. Therefore, his stepmother, Hatshepsut, was a assigned as his regent. This meant that she could exercise all of the powers of the pharaoh until he was old enough to take over (usually around the age of 15 or 16).\n\nHowever, Hatshepsut was not simply content being a regent. In the early years of her regency, she actually took the position of pharaoh for herself. This included holding her own coronation ceremony and having statues built with her royal name inscribed on them.\n\nThe seizure of power by his stepmother meant that as he grew up, Thutmose III did not rule as pharaoh. Regardless, Hatshepsut allowed Thutmose III to live on in the royal household and was given a good education. Young Thutmose was taught how to read and write, learned about military tactics and strategy, and enjoyed all of the benefits of a royal prince.\n\nWhen Thutmose turned 15, which was an age where he could take back power, Hatshepsut continued to rule as pharaoh in his place. It wasn't until Hatshepsut finally died in 1458 BC that Thutmose III became Pharaoh again, at around the age of 22.\n\nOnce in power, Thutmose made it clear that his reign had begun in 1479 BC, when he was 2 years old. This effectively removed the 20 years during which Hatshepsut claimed the throne. Many historians even claim that upon taking the throne, Thutmose III sought to erase the memory of Hatshepsut from history. This is because, at some time during his reign, her names were deliberately removed from many of her monuments.\n\nHowever, there is no clear evidence that Thutmose III was directly responsible for this erasure, which had led some scholars believe that Thutmose III actually respected his stepmother."}, {"url": "https://factsanddetails.com/world/cat56/sub364/entry-6097.html", "page_content": "THUTMOSE III (1480-1426 B.C.)\n\n\n\nThutmose III's mummified head Thutmose III is regarded was as the Napoleon of Egypt. Only 5 foot 3, he mounted at least 14 military campaigns, some of which he personally led, and won them all if historical records are to be believed . He helped the Egyptian empire reach the height of its power and size. His military campaigns expanded the borders of Egypt into Syria, Palestine and Nubia. During the last ten years of his reign Egypt was peaceful and prosperous.\n\nThutmose III assumed power after his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut died in 1458. He ruthlessly defaced her images and raised many monuments of himself. Otherwise he was regarded as a compassionate warrior who did not enslave enemy soldiers nor massacre civilians. He kept foreign princes obedient by holding their sons hostage in gilded cages and introduced chicken to ancient Egypt.\n\nMark Millmore wrote in discoveringegypt.com: \u201cSome believe Ramses II was the greatest Egyptian ruler but this not true; he spent Egypt\u2019s wealth on massive building projects where as Thutmose III actually created Egypt\u2019s wealth. Thutmose III possessed the archetypal qualities of a great ruler. A brilliant general who never lost a battle, he also excelled as an administrator and statesman. He was an accomplished horseman, archer, athlete, and discriminating patron of the arts. Thutmose had no time for pompous, self-indulgent bombast and his reign, with the exception of his uncharacteristic spite against the memory of Hatshepsut, shows him to have been a sincere and fair-minded man. [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com]\n\nAccording to Minnesota State University, Mankato: \u201cThutmose III was admired and revered for generations to come for having a great impact on Egypt both as a nation and as a culture. He constructed many great buildings and obelisks throughout his empire. Buildings were constructed at Heliopolis, Memphis, Abydos, and Aswan, as well as the additions made to the great temple at Karnak, where he had his annals inscribed in the walls. During the last year of his life he appointed his son Amenhotep II to succeed him. Amenhotep II was the son of Thutmose III\u2019s second wife Meryetre, who was Hatshepsut\u2019s daughter and Thutmose III\u2019s half sister. Thutmose III was laid to rest, in 1426 B.C. in the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. [Source: Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\n\u201cThutmose III was Pharaoh during the 18th Dynasty from 1504-1450 B.C. He was beloved and respected as a great warrior as well as being a sincere and fair-minded leader. Thutmose III is believed to be one of the greatest of Egyptian rulers because he was able to re-established Egyptian control over Syria and Nubia. He was also able to adorn his kingdom with revenues from these conquests. He built the temple of Amun at Karnak and erected many obelisks, including \"Cleopatra's Needle.\" His mother, Hatshepsut, first acted as regent for Thutmose III then took the throne from him. After the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III & IV began a bitter persecution of her memory, cutting out her name on monuments and placing both of their own over it wherever they could find it. +\\\n\nCategories with related articles in this website: Ancient Egyptian History (32 articles) factsanddetails.com; Ancient Egyptian Religion (24 articles) factsanddetails.com; Ancient Egyptian Life and Culture (36 articles) factsanddetails.com; Ancient Egyptian Government, Infrastructure and Economics (24 articles) factsanddetails.com\n\nWebsites on Ancient Egypt: UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, escholarship.org ; Internet Ancient History Sourcebook: Egypt sourcebooks.fordham.edu ; Discovering Egypt discoveringegypt.com; BBC History: Egyptians bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians ; Ancient History Encyclopedia on Egypt ancient.eu/egypt; Digital Egypt for Universities.

He was the son of Thutmose II and one of his concubines named Isis. Thutmose II was married to Hatshepsut who was his sister and daughter of Thutmose I. She grew up and was educated as a prince which molded her into an ambitious and strong-minded adult. Because of Thutmose II\u2019s poor heath and lack of leadership skills, Hatshepsut assumed much of the power during his reign. Hatshepsut considered Thutmose III to be a bastard son and believed him to be unworthy of being Pharaoh because he had no royal blood in him. Since Thutmose II and Hatshepsut hadn\u2019t had any sons, Thutmose III would be the heir to the throne, so in 1504 B.C. when Thutmose II dies, the young Thutmose III is crowned. At this time Thutmose III was only around twelve years old, and Hatshepsut believed it would be better if she retained the power of the Pharaoh. [Source: Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cDenied a prominent role in state affairs, Thutmose spent his childhood and adolescence preparing for the future. He was educated as a scribe and priest, developing a life-long love of literature and history, and then entered the army. By the time of Hatshepsut's death, he had risen to the rank of Commander in Chief and had enjoyed a short, victorious campaign in the Levant.\u201d [Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011]\n\n\u201cAs a child, Thutmose III spent most of his time in Thebes. This is where he was educated on how to rule Egypt once he took over. During this time the Amon clergy were in charge of educating all the young to be pharaohs, and this was done at the palace of Karnak. Here he learned about everything from culture and art to military and leadership techniques. Thutmose III soon began to excel as an administrator and statesman, as well as a general and warrior. He gained military skills such as archery and horsemanship, which he displayed to the public on many occasions, and boasted that none of his followers could equal him in marksmanship or physical prowess.\u201d +\\\n\nWhy Did Hatsheput Usurp the Throne from Thutmose III?\n\nWhy did Hatsheput usurp the throne from Thutmose III? Joyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: What could have caused her to take such unprecedented action? Legally, there was no prohibition on a woman ruling Egypt. Although the ideal pharaoh was male-a handsome, athletic, brave, pious and wise male-it was recognised that occasionally a woman might need to act to preserve the dynastic line. When Sobeknofru ruled as king at the end of the troubled 12th Dynasty she was applauded as a national heroine. Mothers who deputised for their infant sons, and queens who substituted for husbands absent on the battlefield, were totally acceptable. What was never anticipated was that a regent would promote herself to a permanent position of power. [Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011]\n\n\u201cMorally Hatshepsut must have known that Thutmose was the rightful king. She had, after all, accepted him as such for the first two years of his reign. We must therefore deduce that something happened in year three to upset the status quo and to encourage her to take power. Unfortunately, Hatshepsut never apologises and never explains. Instead she provides endless justification of her changed status, claiming on her temple walls (falsely) that both her earthly father Thutmose and her heavenly father, the great god Amen, intended her to rule Egypt. She goes to a great deal of trouble to appear as a typical pharaoh, even changing her official appearance so that her formal images now show her with the stereotyped king's male body, down to the false beard. Hatshepsut has realised that others will eventually question her actions, and is carving her defence in stone. |::|\n\n\u201cWhat are we to make of Hatshepsut's actions? It is too simplistic to condemn her as a ruthless power-seeker. She could not have succeeded without the backing of Egypt's elite, the men who effectively ruled Egypt on behalf of the king, so they at least must have recognised some merit in her case. Her treatment of Thutmose is instructive. While the boy-king lived he was a permanent threat to her reign yet, while an 'accidental' death would have been easy to arrange, she took no steps to remove him. Indeed, seemingly oblivious to the dangers of a coup, she had him trained as a soldier. |::|\n\n\u201cIt seems that Hatshepsut did not fear Thutmose winning the trust of the army and seizing power. Presumably, she felt that he had no reason to hate her. Indeed, seen from her own point of view, her actions were entirely acceptable. She had not deposed her stepson, merely created an old fashioned co-regency, possibly in response to some national emergency. The co-regency, or joint reign, had been a feature of Middle Kingdom royal life, when an older king would associate himself with the more junior partner who would share the state rituals and learn his trade. As her intended successor, Thutmose had only to wait for his throne; no one could have foreseen that she would reign for over two decades.\u201d|::|\n\nThutmose III as Leader of Egypt\n\nAround 1480 B.C., after the sudden death of Harshepsut, Thutmose III became the leader of Egypt. Soon after he became pharaoh, he began defacing of Hatshepsut\u2019s monuments and replaced her name with Thutmose I, II, or III, in an effort to erase his stepmother\u2019s name from history. Ironically, Thutmose III inherited an economically strong Egypt from Hatshepsut, that provided the foundation for his accomplishments and the greatness of the New Kingdom achieved. With his military training and a strong, stable Egypt to stand on, Thutmose III conquered foreign lands and brought such great wealth to Egypt that he, arguably, made making it the world\u2019s first super power.\n\nMark Millmore wrote in discoveringegypt.com: His impact upon Egyptian culture was profound. He was a national hero, revered long after his time. Indeed, his name was held in awe even to the last days of ancient Egyptian history. His military achievements brought fabulous wealth and his family resided over a golden age that was never surpassed. [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com ^^^]\n\nThutmose III established a military priesthood that controlled the empire. At the center of the system was the god Amun of Thebes and the powerful priests at his temple. \u201cHe was also a cultured man who demonstrated a curiosity about the lands he conquered; many of his building works at Karnak are covered with carvings of the plants and flowers he saw on his campaigns. He also set up a number of obelisks in Egypt.\u201d Among them are ones that now stand in London, New York, Rome and Istanbul. ^^^\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cThutmose took his throne in unsettled times. His eastern vassals, for so long quiet, were starting to challenge Egypt's dominance. A series of glorious campaigns, including the dramatic capture of Megiddo (Biblical Armageddon), saw Egypt restored to her position of power. Egypt now controlled an empire which stretched from beyond the third cataract in Nubian to the banks of the River Euphrates in Syria. The rewards of empire-plunder, tribute, taxes and gifts from those eager to be friends-made Thutmose the richest man in the world. [Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011 |::|]\n\n\u201cUsing his hard-won wealth, Thutmose attempted to out-build Hatshepsut. Once again the Nile Valley echoed to the sound of hammer and chisel. But now there was destruction alongside the construction. The royal masons had been charged with the task of removing all traces of the female pharaoh. By the time of his death, some thirty-three years after his solo accession, Thutmose was confident that Hatshepsut's unorthodox reign would soon be forgotten. |::|\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Military Campaigns\n\nIn his 19-year rule Thutmose III led military campaigns at a rate of almost one a year, including a victory over the Canaanites at Megiddo in present-day Israel. There are lengthy descriptions of his battles on the rock walls of Karnak. They include tales of soldiers hiding in baskets delivered to enemy cities and boats hauled 250 miles overland for a surprise attack. In the reliefs Thutmose himself is depicted as a sphinx trampling Nubians and a warrior smiting an Asiatic lion.\n\nOne of Thutmose\u2019s greatest military victory occurred in Joppa (present-day Jaffa, Israel) in 1450 B.C. According to a rare papyrus text, the Egyptians secured victory after employing Trojan-horse-like deception. After the city failed to fall during a siege, the commanding general Djehuty sent baskets to the city that were said to contain plundered goods. At night Egyptian soldiers emerged from the baskets and opened the city gates.\n\nThutmose III drive towards the Euphrates claimed new lands for Egypt and brought in tributes. Wall paintings from the period show Babylonians, Syrians, Nubians and Canaanites offering presents to the pharaoh and bowing in subservient positions. The military campaign is also blamed for triggering a series of conflicts that would ultimately would deal the Egyptians a costly defeat at the hands of the Assyrians.\n\nAccording to Minnesota State University, Mankato: \u201cTuthmosis II\u2019s and Hatshepsut\u2019s reigns were peaceful and saw very little warfare. But when Tuthmosis III took over power things were already starting to change. Unrest started to occur in many areas of Africa, Syria, and elsewhere. The first of seventeen successful campaigns happened only a few months into his reign, at the city of Megiddo. This attack from the rear gave the Egyptians an upper hand and played a big part in their victory. The battle lasted more than seven months and when it was over Tuthmosis III let the enemy leaders go so that they could tell everyone who the new leader of Egypt was. This victory not only gained Tuthmosis III the respect of the people of Egypt but also the respect of leaders and kings of other nations as the rightful pharaoh and a very skilled and intelligent general. Through the rest of his reign, Tuthmosis III engaged in sixteen more campaigns and won every one of them. Because of his undefeated record, Tuthmosis III is often referred to as \u201cThe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d. Some of his biggest victories came against the Mitannian empire. He captured and gained control of many Mitannian territories, which expanded his power over northern Palestine and Phoenicia. He erected a stele at he Euphrates River to mark the boundary of the Egyptian Empire. [Source: Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\nMark Millmore wrote in discoveringegypt.com: \u201cThutmose III had spent the long years of his aunt Hatshepsut\u2019s reign training in the army. This kept him away from court politics but nevertheless prepared him well for his own role as pharaoh because great ability in war was considered a desirable quality in the ancient world. Egyptian pharaohs were expected to lead their armies into foreign lands and demonstrate their bravery on the field in person. After a few victorious battles, a king might return home in triumph, loaded with plunder and a promise of annual tribute from the defeated cities. But during Hatshepsut\u2019s reign, there were no wars and Egypt\u2019s soldiers had little practice in warfare. The result was that Egypt\u2019s neighbors were gradually becoming independent and when this new, unknown pharaoh came to the throne; these other kings were inclined to test his resolve.\u201d [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com ^^^]\n\n\u201cThutmose III is often compared to Napoleon, but unlike Napoleon he never lost a battle. He conducted sixteen campaigns in Palestine, Syria and Nubia and his treatment of the conquered was always humane. He established a sort of \u201cPax Egyptica\u201d over his empire. Syria and Palestine were obliged to keep the peace and the region as a whole experienced an unprecedented degree of prosperity.\u201d ^^^\n\nTuthmosis III and the Battle of Mediggo\n\nTuthmosis III\u2019s first great military victory was at the Battle of Mediggo. According to Minnesota State University, Mankato: \u201cThis campaign, which is recorded in great detail on the walls of the temple he built in Karnak, revealed Tuthmosis III as a military genius. Tuthmosis III used the element of surprise attack when he invaded Mediggo, using the least expecting route. This route was narrow, hilly, and difficult to pass, and it took over twelve hours to reach the valley on the other side. Tuthmosis III lead his men through the hills and when he made it to the valley he waited until the last man made it through safely. [Source: Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\nMark Millmore wrote in discoveringegypt.com: In the second year of his reign, Thutmose found himself faced with a coalition of the princes from Kadesh and Megiddo, who had mobilized a large army. What\u2019s more, the Mesopotamians and their kinsmen living in Syria refused to pay tribute and declared themselves free of Egypt. Undaunted, Thutmose immediately set out with his army. He crossed the Sinai desert and marched to the city of Gaza which had remained loyal to Egypt. The events of the campaign are well documented because Thutmose\u2019s private secretary, Tjaneni, kept a record which was later copied and engraved onto the walls of the temple of Karnak. [Source: Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com ^^^]\n\n\u201cThis first campaign revealed Thutmose to be the military genius of his time. He understood the value of logistics and lines of supply, the necessity of rapid movement, and the sudden surprise attack. He led by example and was probably the first person in history to take full advantage of sea power to support his campaigns. Megiddo was Thutmose\u2019s first objective because it was a key point strategically. It had to be taken at all costs. When he reached Aruna, Thutmose held a council with all his generals. There were three routes to Megiddo: two long, easy, and level roads around the hills, which the enemy expected Thutmose to take, and a narrow, difficult route that cut through the hills. ^^^\n\n\u201cHis generals advised him to go the easy way, saying of the alternative, \u201cHorse must follow behind horse and man behind man also, and our vanguard will be engaged while our rearguard is at Aruna without fighting.\u201d But Thutmose\u2019s reply to this was, \u201cAs I live, as I am the beloved of Ra and praised by my father Amun, I will go on the narrow road. Let those who will, go on the roads you have mentioned; and let anyone who will, follow my Majesty.\u201d When the soldiers heard this bold speech they shouted in one voice, \u201cWe follow thy Majesty whithersoever thy Majesty goes.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cThutmose led his men on foot through the hills \u201chorse behind Horse and man behind man, his Majesty showing the way by his own footsteps.\u201d It took about twelve hours for the vanguard to reach the valley on the other side, and another seven hours before the last troops emerged. Thutmose, himself, waited at the head of the pass till the last man was safely through. The sudden and unexpected appearance of Egyptians at their rear forced the allies to make a hasty redeployment of their troops. There were over three hundred allied kings, each with his own army; an immense force. However, Thutmose was determined and when the allies saw him at the head of his men leading them forward, they lost heart for the fight and fled for the city of Megiddo, \u201cas if terrified by spirits: they left their horse and chariots of silver and gold.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian army, being young and inexperienced, simply lacked the control to take the city immediately. Thutmose was angry. He said to them, \u201cIf only the troops of his Majesty had not given their hearts to spoiling the things of the enemy, they would have taken Megiddo at that moment. For the ruler of every northern country is in Megiddo and its capture is as the capture of a thousand cities.\u201d ^^^\n\n\u201cMegiddo was besieged. A moat was dug around the city walls and a strong wooden palisade erected. The king gave orders to let nobody through except those who signaled at the gate that they wished to give themselves up. Eventually the vanquished kings sent out their sons and daughters to negotiate peace. According to Thutmose, \u201cAll those things with which they had come to fight against my Majesty, now they brought them as tribute to my Majesty, while they themselves stood upon their walls giving praise to my Majesty, and begging that the Breath of Life be given to their nostrils.\u201d They received good terms for surrender. An oath of allegiance was imposed upon them: \u201cWe will not again do evil against Menkheper Ra, our good Lord, in our lifetime, for we have seen his might, and he has deigned to give us breath.\u201d ^^^\n\nArmant Stela: Asiatic Campaigns of Thutmose III\n\nThe Armant Stela from the 15th century B.C. describes the Asiatic Campaigns of Thutmose III: It reads: \u201cLive the Horus: Mighty Bull, Appearing in Thebes; the Two Goddesses: Enduring of Kingship, like Re in Heaven; the Horus of Gold: Majestic of Appearances, Mighty of Strength; the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Lord of Making Offerings: Men-kheper-Re; the Son of Re, of his Body: Thut-mose Heqa-Maat, beloved of Montu, Lord of Thebes, Residing in Hermonthis, living forever.

But Thutmose\u2019s mummy is well preserved and allows comparison between the actual face of the king and his sculpted portraits. [Source: Dimitri, Laboury, University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology 2010, escholarship.org ]\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, despite a rather important evolution through different chronological types, the iconography of Thutmose III is characterized by a few absolutely constant physiognomic features, i.e., an S- shaped chin when seen in profile, a significant squared maxillary, and low, protruding cheekbones that create a horizontal depression under the eyes. These are the same features that distinguish his mummy\u2019s face, denoting an undeniable inspiration from the actual appearance of the king. However, on the other hand, other physiognomic details varied a lot, sometimes being in obvious contradiction to the mummy: for instance, at the end of his reign, during the proscription of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III decided to straighten his nose\u2014ostensibly hooked on his mummy\u2014in order to look like his father and grandfather, his true and then unique legitimating ancestors. This variability and the revival of his predecessors\u2019 iconography show that the evolution of the king\u2019s statuary cannot be explained solely by aesthetic orientations toward portrait or ideal image, or toward realism or idealization. There is a clear and conscious departure from the model\u2019s outer appearance that allows the introduction of meaning and physiognomically signifies the ideological identity of the depicted person. The same is true for private portraiture.\n\n\u201cJust like his aunt Hatshepsut, Thutmose III instigated modifications and thus evolution in his portraits because his identity, his political self-definition as the legitimate king of Egypt, changed throughout his reign. Obviously, in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians, portraiture was more than a simple artistic transposition of the physical appearances; it was a pictorial definition of an individual and recognizable identity, beyond appearances and even despite them, if needed.\n\n\u201cAmarna royal portraits at Thutmose\u2019s workshop. The excavation of the sculpture workshop in the estate of \u201cthe favorite of the perfect god, the chief artist and sculptor Thutmose\u201d at Akhetaten/Amarna provides an exceptional opportunity to understand the practical modalities of conceiving a royal portrait.\u201d\n\nKarnak Temple Under Thutmose III\n\nElaine Sullivan of UCLA wrote: \u201cKarnak experienced another period of vast change during the reign of Thutmose III. The greatest addition was a huge temple, the Akhmenu Festival Hall, placed behind Karnak\u2019s east wall, built after the king\u2019s 23rd year. The structure consisted of a large pillared hall leading to a set of three shrines, a series of rooms dedicated to the god Sokar, a hall decorated with relief scenes of flora and fauna observed during the king\u2019s foreign military campaigns, a chamber with niched walls that served as the main shrine of the divine image, and an upper sun-court. The exact cultic nature of the temple remains elusive, but it may have held ceremonies for the regeneration of the king on earth. [Source: Elaine Sullivan, UCLA, UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology 2010, escholarship.org ]\n\n\u201cA new stone enclosure wall was constructed, enclosing the Akhmenu in the greater temple complex. The obelisks of Hatshepsut were incorporated into a small contra-temple along the enclosure\u2019s eastern wall. Contra-temples, usually appended to the rear wall of a temple and opening outward, provided a location for those not allowed within the temple proper (such as the public) to interact with the divinities. Often statues of the king were located at these shrines, and people would petition the images to act as intermediaries with the gods on their behalf. At the center of Karnak\u2019s contra-temple stood a large calcite naos with a dyad of Thutmose III and the god Amun-Ra (although it originally may have depicted Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, with the queen\u2019s figure later recarved).\n\n\u201cThutmose III also added a stone pylon (the seventh) and connecting walls between the queen\u2019s pylon and the temple wall along the southern processional route. In front of the pylon, he raised red granite obelisks. Along the east wall of the eighth pylon\u2019s forecourt, he placed a calcite bark-shrine surrounded by peripteral pillars. This may have replaced the earlier calcite shrine of Amenhotep I at the same location, as Thutmose III gave his shrine an identical name.\n\n\u201cA huge sacred lake was cut into the space southeast of the temple. This may have been an expansion of a pre-existing lake at the same location. To the east of the lake a large mud- brick enclosure wall with exterior bastions was constructed, traditionally assigned to Thutmose III (although it may actually be older). The wall was enlarged and renovated in at least three phases, the last of which may date to as late as the 25th Dynasty...To the north of the main precinct, the king erected a small sandstone temple to the god Ptah (possibly replacing an earlier one of mud-brick). A hall with two columns fronted the temple\u2019s triple sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWithin the central core of Karnak, Thutmose III ordered significant remodeling. Behind the fifth pylon, he had a smaller pylon erected, the sixth, creating a small pillared court in front of the Palace of Maat. He replaced the limestone chapels of Amenhotep I along the sides of this court with sandstone replicas whose decoration commemorated the earlier king. Walls were appended to the east faces of the fifth and sixth pylons and a granite gate was erected between the pylons, creating a corridor along the temple\u2019s central axis to the Palace of Maat. Although he appears to have continued the decoration of Hatshepsut\u2019s unfinished Red Chapel, the king eventually removed and dismantled the chapel, with the front and rear doors reused in an interior wall of the palace\u2019s northern suite of rooms and the new corridor behind the sixth pylon. Some of the palace\u2019s interior walls were removed, either by the king, or earlier, by Hatshepsut, to allow the emplacement of the central bark-shrine. The Red Chapel was replaced with a new granite shrine, of similar size and shape, and a new entrance portico was designed for the Palace of Maat.\n\n\u201cPossibly due to damage incurred in the wadjet hall from heavy rainstorms, Thutmose III began a total reworking of the space. A stone gateway was erected around the obelisks of Hatshepsut, completely encapsulating their lower portions. He ordered the removal of the wooden wadj- columns, intending to replace them with six sandstone columns in the north half of the hall and eight in the south. The interior walls of the court were covered with a skin of stone, obscuring the original statue recesses of Thutmose I. Before his death, it appears that the king only had time to roof the northern part of the hall with sandstone slabs, supported by his network of pillars, gateway, and court walls. Amenhotep II finished the work, raising the eight southern columns and their roof. Thutmose III raised his own pair of granite obelisks between those of Thutmose I and II in the festival court before the fourth pylon. The bases of these obelisks have been discovered bordering the east side of the third pylon.\u201d\n\nRekhmire\n\nGreg Dawson of Minnesota State University, Mankato wrote: \u201cRekhmire the Vizier, under Thutmose III and Amenhotep II, was the son of a priest of Amon, Nefer Weben, and nephew of the Vizier Woser. He became the most powerful commoner in the country during Thutmose reign. His Theban tomb contains some information about his life and shows him and his wife, Meryt, festively enjoying the afterlife. He oversaw the building of the great entrance portal at the temple in Thebes watching to make sure that the blocks used were of the right quality. Also, under his supervision was the creation of giant statues, sphinxes, furniture and implements, and vessels and precious objects. [Source: Greg Dawson, Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com +]\n\n\u201cRekhmire was responsible for operation of foreign embassies, operation of law courts, collection of taxes, activities of the craftsmen of the Temple of Amun at Thebes and finally funerary banquet and musical accompaniment. Above all, it was his job to collect all tribute which came to the kingdom from the outside or surrounding areas such as tribute from the King\u2019s of Babylon, Assyria and the Hittites.The tomb also holds decrees given by the king concerning Rekhmire's role as Vizier, these decrees make the tomb of this high ranking commoner give people today a reference concerning the political, legal and social aspects of the New Kingdom of Egypt and also the empire.\u201d +\\\n\nDid Thutmose III Order the Attacks on Hatsheput\u2019s Monuments\n\nJoyce Tyldesley of the University of Manchester wrote for the BBC: \u201cSoon after her death in 1457 B.C., Hatshepsut's monuments were attacked, her statues dragged down and smashed and her image and titles defaced. The female king vanished from Egyptian history. She would remain lost until, almost three thousand years later, modern Egyptologists reconstructed her damaged inscriptions and restored her to her rightful dynastic place. |[Source: Dr Joyce Tyldesley, University of Manchester, BBC, February 17, 2011]\n\n\u201cThe Egyptians believed that the spirit could live beyond the grave, but only if some remembrance-a body, a statue, or even a name-of the deceased remained in the land of the living. Hatshepsut had effectively been cursed with endless death. Who could have done such a terrible thing, and why? Thutmose III, stepson and successor to Hatshepsut, seems the obvious culprit, but we should not condemn him unheard. There are two major crimes to be considered before we draw any conclusion. |::|\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that someone attacked Hatshepsut's monuments after her death. Archaeology indicates that the bulk of the vandalism occurred during Thutmose' reign. Why would he do this? At first it was imagined that this was the new king's immediate revenge against his stepmother; he was indeed cursing her with permanent death. The image of the young Thutmose seething with impotent rage as Hatshepsut ruled in his place is one which has attracted amateur psychologists for many years. However, it does not entirely fit with the known facts. |::|\n\n\u201cThutmose was to prove himself a calm and prudent general, a brave man not given to hasty or irrational actions. He did not start his solo reign with an assault on Hatshepsut's memory; indeed, he allowed her a traditional funeral, and waited until it was convenient to fit the desecration into his schedule. Some of the destruction was even carried out by his son, after his death, when most of those who remembered Hatshepsut had also died. It is a remote, rather than an immediate, attack. Furthermore the attack is not a thorough one. Enough remained of Hatshepsut to allow us to recreate her reign in some detail. Her tomb, the most obvious place to start the attack, still housed her name. Hatshepsut may have been erased from Egypt's official record, but she was never hated as Akhenaten 'The Great Criminal' would later be. |::|\n\n\u201cWhat can we conclude from this tangled tale? We should perhaps rethink our assumptions. Hatshepsut did not fear Thutmose; instead of killing him, she raised him as her successor. Thutmose may not have hated Hatshepsut. Initially he may even have been grateful to her, as she had protected his land while training him for greatness. But, as he grew older and looked back over his life, his perspective would shift. Would Egypt's most successful general, a stickler for tradition, have wished to be associated with a woman co-regent, even a woman as strong as Hatshepsut? |::|\n\n\u201cBy removing all obvious references to his co-ruler Thutmose could incorporate her reign into his own. He would then become Egypt's greatest pharaoh; the only successor to Thutmose II. Hatshepsut would become the unfortunate victim, not of a personal attack, but of an impersonal attempt at retrospective political correctness. |Thutmose set his masons to re-write history. Their labours would last well into the reign of his successor, Amenhotep II, a king who could not remember Hatshepsut, and who had no reason to respect her memory. Meanwhile, hidden in the Valley of the Kings, Hatshepsut still rested in her coffin. Thutmose I had been taken from their joint tomb and re-buried, but she had been left alone. Thutmose knew that as long as her body survived, Hatshepsut was ensured eternal life.\u201d |::|\n\nImage Sources: Wikimedia Commons\n\nText Sources: UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, escholarship.org ; Internet Ancient History Sourcebook: Egypt sourcebooks.fordham.edu ; Tour Egypt, Minnesota State University, Mankato, ethanholman.com; Mark Millmore, discoveringegypt.com discoveringegypt.com; Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Geographic, Smithsonian magazine, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Discover magazine, Times of London, Natural History magazine, Archaeology magazine, The New Yorker, BBC, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Time, Newsweek, Wikipedia, Reuters, Associated Press, The Guardian, AFP, Lonely Planet Guides, \u201cWorld Religions\u201d edited by Geoffrey Parrinder (Facts on File Publications, New York); \u201cHistory of Warfare\u201d by John Keegan (Vintage Books); \u201cHistory of Art\u201d by H.W.

Such a vast realm could never thrive if it weren\u2019t for leaders that were bold, confident, and eager to expand their territories. One such pharaoh was Thutmose III, widely regarded as one of Ancient Egypt's greatest rulers ever. With a lengthy reign and a relentless drive towards Egyptian expansion, Thutmose ushered his realm into a new golden age. What were some defining moments in his reign?\n\nOn the Threshold of a New Golden Age with Pharaoh Thutmose III\n\nThe official regnal dates for Thutmose III are 28th April 1479 BC to 11th March 1425 BC. This means that the pharaoh ruled Egypt for roughly 54 years. That is an incredibly lengthy reign for any monarch, especially at a time when many wanted to usurp the throne. However, we must consider that Thutmose officially became a pharaoh when he was only two years old. Historians can provide such a precise number thanks to funerary inscriptions discovered within the tomb of a military commander from the time of Thutmose. This commander was Amenemheb-Mahu, and on the walls of his tomb it is recorded that Thutmose III died in his 54th regnal year.\n\nOf course, it was impossible for Thutmose III to rule so young. His father, Thutmose II, died after a relatively short reign, and was survived by his Great Royal Wife, Hatshepsut, as well as his children. Thus, the effective power was left in the hands of Hatshepsut, who declared herself to be the regent to the boy king. Soon she declared herself Pharaoh, but never attempted to oust Thutmose III or deny his right to the throne. Still, growing up, the boy had little effective power in the realm, and Egypt was ruled by Hatshepsut for roughly 21 years. During this time, the queen began numerous new building projects, and the realm prospered steadily.\n\nBecoming an able and promising young man, Thutmose III was made the foremost leader of Ancient Egypt\u2019s armies, during Hatshepsut\u2019s effective reign. This was the start of a promising military career, and the development of Thutmose\u2019s fantastic ability as a strategist and tactician. In fact, he demonstrated such great capabilities in this role, and would later prove to be an unparalleled commander. Historians today regard Thutmose III as a pure military genius, and this has earned him the nickname of \u201cthe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d.\n\nLarge Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/ CC0)\n\nA Time for Conquest and a Time for Expansion\n\nUpon the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III effectively assumed his rightful role as the Pharaoh. He was now roughly 25 years old, and already proven as a commander. Soon enough, he began a decisive expansion of Egypt\u2019s borders. He is today considered as one of the greatest conquerors in the timeline of Ancient Egypt, and was certainly an aggressive expansionist ruler.\n\nHis first successes began almost immediately after he assumed the throne: he led a campaign deep into modern-day Israel, where he won a masterful battle at Megiddo, defeating the King of Kadesh. With a daring move, he marched his armies to the rear of the Megiddo forces, crushing them decisively.\n\nSoon after this victory, Egyptian dominance was reasserted in the region called Canaan. And that was just the beginning of Thutmose\u2019s achievements. He methodically assaulted city after city, slowly beating his enemies into submission. Over the course of his lengthy reign, it is said that he captured no less than 350 cities. He conquered most of the Near East, from the River Euphrates all the way down to Nubia in the south. And we know precisely that he conducted 17 military campaigns in his reign - an impressive number.\n\nAncient Egypt quickly marched into a new Golden Age. With reasserted dominance, with expanded borders and new victories, the realm prospered in every regard. And all this thanks to the warrior Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Barely in his 30s, he was already crowned with the laurel wreath of victory, and loved by the people. Meticulously and decisively, he transformed Ancient Egypt into a true \u201cinternational\u201d superpower, reshaping it into an empire that incorporated regions of Syria, Canaan, Nubia, and others.\n\nThutmose III Sphinx sculpture, 18th Dynasty of Egypt, 1550-1295 BC. Held at the Louvre Museum. (Louvre Museum/ CC BY-SA 2.0 FR )\n\nThe Napoleon of Ancient Egypt\n\nLuckily, we know a lot about Thutmose\u2019s military achievements because of fairly detailed records that survive. Many of his triumphs were inscribed onto the walls of the Temple of Amun in Karnak, accompanied by stunning reliefs of the king subduing his enemies. Furthermore, Thutmose had a royal scribe and a loyal commander, Thanuny, who kept meticulous records of his king\u2019s campaigns. Fragments of these scripts allowed us a greater insight into methods of ancient warfare and strategy.\n\nAnother contributing factor to Thutmose\u2019s military success is a number of innovations and new technologies that placed him one step ahead of his enemies. Roughly two centuries before his time, Ancient Egypt came under the brief rule of the Hyksos, foreign invaders who brought with them new and never before seen tools and weapons. New unique swords were quickly absorbed by the Egyptians, as well as new forging techniques, as well as powerful two-wheeled war chariots. With all these innovations, the Egyptian army was well suited for conquest.\n\nSoon after winning the key battle at Megiddo, Thutmose solidified Egypt\u2019s domination in Canaan, and began a series of conquests that would lead Egypt to its greatest ever expansion. All the greatest kings of the region - of the Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians - gave him tribute. He then led campaigns against the powerful Phoenician ports, and the quarrelsome Mitanni to the north. Through his victories, he expanded his realm\u2019s wealth: slaves were acquired, sheep and horses, thousands of cattle, powerful stallions, money and riches, many tons of grain, quality wood from Lebanon, and noble hostages that made obedience guaranteed.\n\nRelief in the Karnak Temple showing Thutmose III slaying Canaanite captives from the Battle of Megiddo, 15th Century BC . (Olaf Tausch/ CC BY 3.0 )\n\nA Golden King in a Golden Era\n\nOver the course of 17 campaigns, most - if not all - of his enemies were subdued, the foremost being the Mitanni. But it was not all about warfare: Thutmose III was also inclined to spur other developments within Egypt as well. New construction projects were begun, and new technologies mastered. Glass-making was refined, and a number of new lavish buildings were raised in Karnak. Several monumental obelisks from this time also survive.\n\nThutmose III died in his 56th year (54th regnal year). His remains were entombed in a unique and lavish tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy survives to this day. Succeeding him was his younger son, Amenhotep II. The latter\u2019s reign was successful, but not nearly as good as his father\u2019s. Likewise, Amenhotep conducted only a few campaigns to maintain his domination.\n\nTogether with Rameses the Great , Thutmose is widely regarded as Ancient Egypt\u2019s finest pharaoh. And considering that the history of this civilization spans several thousands of years, that achievement can be considered monumental.\n\nTop image: The statue of Pharaoh Thutmose III at the Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor, Egypt.

During the first twenty-two years of Thutmose's reign he was co-regent with his stepmother, Hatshepsut, who was named the pharaoh. While he is shown first on surviving monuments, both were assigned the usual royal names and insignia and neither is given any obvious seniority over the other. He served as the head of her armies.\n\nAfter her death and his later rise to being the pharaoh of the kingdom, he created the largest empire Egypt had ever seen; no fewer than seventeen campaigns were conducted, and he conquered from Niya in North Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia.\n\nOfficially, Thutmose III ruled Egypt for almost fifty-four years, and his reign is usually dated from April 24, 1479 BC to March 11, 1425 BC; however, this includes the twenty-two years he was co-regent to Hatshepsut - his stepmother and aunt. During the final two years of his reign, he appointed his son-and successor-Amenhotep II, as his junior co-regent. When Thutmose III died, he was buried in the Valley of the Kings as were the rest of the kings from this period in Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II by a secondary wife, Iset. His father's great royal wife was Queen Hatshepsut. Her daughter Neferure was Thutmose's half-sister.\n\nWhen Thutmose II died Thutmose III was too young to rule, so Hatshepsut became his regent, soon his coregent, and shortly thereafter, she declared herself to be the pharaoh while never denying kinship to young Thutmose III. Thutmosis III had little power over the empire while Hatshepsut exercised the formal titulary of kingship. Her rule was quite prosperous and marked by great advancements. When he reached a suitable age and demonstrated the capability, she appointed him to head her armies.\n\nThutmosis III had several wives:\n\nSatiah: She may have been the mother of his firstborn son, Amenemhat. An alternative theory is that the boy was the son of Neferure. Amenemhat predeceased his father. Merytre-Hatshepsut - Thutmose's successor, the crown prince and future king Amenhotep II, was the son of Merytre-Hatshepsut. Additional children include Menkheperre and daughters named Nebetiunet, Meryetamun (C), Meryetamun (D) and Iset. Merytre-Hatshepsut was the daughter of the divine adoratrice Huy. Nebtu: she is depicted on a pillar in Thutmose III's tomb Menwi, Merti, Menhet three foreign wives Neferure: Thutmose III may have married his half-sister, but there is no conclusive evidence for this marriage. It has been suggested that Neferure may have been the mother of Amenemhat instead of Satiah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates and Length of Reign\n\nThutmose III reigned from 1479 BC to 1425 BC according to the Low Chronology of Ancient Egypt. This has been the conventional Egyptian chronology in academic circles since the 1960s, though in some circles the older dates 1504 BC to 1450 BC are preferred from the High Chronology of Egypt.\n\nThese dates, just as all the dates of the Eighteenth Dynasty, are open to dispute because of uncertainty about the circumstances surrounding the recording of a Heliacal Rise of Sothis in the reign of Amenhotep I.\n\nA papyrus from Amenhotep I's reign records this astronomical observation which, theoretically, could be used to perfectly correlate the Egyptian chronology with the modern calendar; however, to do this the latitude where the observation was taken must also be known. This document has no note of the place of observation, but it can safely be assumed that it was taken in either a Delta city such as Memphis or Heliopolis, or in Thebes. These two latitudes give dates twenty years apart, the High and Low chronologies, respectively.\n\nThe length of Thutmose III's reign is known to the day thanks to information found in the tomb of the court official Amenemheb. Amenemheb records Thutmose III's death to his master's fifty-fourth regnal year, on the thirtieth day of the third month of Peret.\n\nThe day of Thutmose III's accession is known to be I Shemu day 4, and astronomical observations can be used to establish the exact dates of the beginning and end of the king's reign (assuming the low chronology) from April 24, 1479 BC to March 11, 1425 BC respectively.\n\nAccording to 1 Kings 6:1 the Exodus took place in 1448 b.C. That is, 477 years before Solomon became king in 971 BC. This would make Thutmoses III pharaoh during the Exodus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nThutmose III smiting his enemies. Relief on the seventh pylon in Karnak.\n\nThutmose III, riding in a \"chariot of fine gold,\" led his armies out of Egypt into Phoenicia, Palestine, and Syria. In later campaigns he extended the empire to the Euphrates Valley in Mesopotamia. Earlier rulers had already pushed the frontiers south into Nubia, beyond the First Cataract of the Nile.\n\nWidely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III made 16 raids in 20 years. He was an active expansionist ruler, sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or \"the Napoleon of Egypt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first Pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak, and are now transcribed into Urkunden IV.\n\nHe is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs, who transformed Egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from southern Syria through to Canaan and Nubia. In most of his campaigns his enemies were defeated town by town, until being beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a much weaker city or state one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved.\n\nMuch is known about Thutmosis \"the warrior\", not only because of his military achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large number of lands, is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. He encountered only little resistance from neighboring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily. His army also had carried boats on dry land. These campaigns (17 in 20 years), are inscribed on the inner wall of the great chamber housing the \"holy of holies\" at the Karnak Temple of Amun. These inscriptions give the most detailed and accurate account of any Egyptian king.\n\n\n\nWhen Hatshepsut died on the tenth day of the sixth month of Thutmose III's twenty first year - according to information from a single stela from Armant - the king of Kadesh advanced his army to Megiddo.[ Thutmose III mustered his own army and departed Egypt, passing through the border fortress of Tjaru (Sile) on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month.\n\nThutmose marched his troops through the coastal plain as far as Jamnia, then inland to Yehem, a small city near Megiddo, which he reached in the middle of the ninth month of the same year. The ensuing Battle of Megiddo probably was the largest battle in any of Thutmose's seventeen campaigns. A ridge of mountains jutting inland from Mount Carmel stood between Thutmose and Megiddo, and he had three potential routes to take.\n\nThe northern route and the southern route, both of which went around the mountain, were judged by his council of war to be the safest, but Thutmose, in an act of great bravery (or so he boasts, but such self-praise is normal in Egyptian texts), accused the council of cowardice and took a dangerous route through the Aruna mountain pass which he alleged was only wide enough for the army to pass \"horse after horse and man after man.\"\n\nDespite the laudatory nature of Thutmose's annals, such a pass does indeed exist (although it is not quite so narrow as Thutmose indicates) and taking it was a brilliant strategic move, since when his army emerged from the pass they were situated on the plain of Esdraelon, directly between the rear of the Canaanite forces and Megiddo itself.\n\nFor some reason, the Canaanite forces did not attack him as his army emerged, and his army routed them decisively. The size of the two forces is difficult to determine, but if, as Redford suggests, the amount of time it took to move the army through the pass may be used to determine the size of the Egyptian force, and if the number of sheep and goats captured may be used to determine the size of the Canaanite force, then both armies were around 10,000 men.\n\nHowever most scholars do believe that the Egyptian army was more numerous. According to Thutmose III's Hall of Annals in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, the battle occurred on \"Year 23, I Shemu day 21, the exact day of the feast of the new moon\" - a lunar date. This date corresponds to May 9, 1457 BC based on Thutmose III's accession in 1479 BC. After victory in battle, however, his troops stopped to plunder the enemy and the enemy was able to escape into Megiddo. Thutmose was forced to besiege the city instead, but he finally succeeded in conquering it after a siege of seven or eight months.\n\nThis campaign drastically changed the political situation in the ancient Near East. By taking Megiddo, Thutmose gained control of all of northern Canaan, and the Syrian princes were obligated to send tribute and their own sons as hostages to Egypt. Beyond the Euphrates, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite kings all gave Thutmose gifts, which he alleged to be \"tribute\" when he recorded it on the walls of Karnak.The only noticeable absence is Mitanni, which would bear the brunt of the following Egyptian campaigns into Asia.\n\n\n\nThutmose's second, third, and fourth campaigns appear to have been nothing more than tours of Syria and Canaan to collect tribute. Traditionally, the material directly after the text of the first campaign has been considered to be the second campaign. This text records tribute from the area which the Egyptians called Retenu, (roughly equivalent to Canaan), and it was also at this time that Assyria paid a second \"tribute\" to Thutmose III.\n\nHowever, it is probable that these texts come from Thutmose's fortieth year or later, and thus have nothing to do with the second campaign at all. If so, then so far, no records of this campaign have been found at all. This survey is dated to Thutmose's twenty-fifth year. No record remains of Thutmose's fourth campaign whatsoever, but at some point in time a fort was built in lower Lebanon and timber was cut for construction of a processional barque, and this probably fits best during this time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnals of Tuthmoses III at Karnak depicting him standing before\n\nthe offerings made to him after his foreign campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe fifth, sixth, and seventh campaigns of Thutmose III were directed against the Phoenician cities in Syria and against Kadesh on the Orontes. In Thutmose's twenty-ninth year, he began his fifth campaign where he first took an unknown city (the name falls in a lacuna) which had been garrisoned by Tunip.\n\nHe then moved inland and took the city and territory around Ardata, the town was pillaged and the wheat fields burnt. Unlike previous plundering raids, however, Thutmose III subsequently garrisoned the area known as Djahy, which is probably a reference to southern Syria.\n\nThis subsequently permitted him to ship supplies and troops between Syria and Egypt. Although there is no direct evidence for it, it is for this reason that some have supposed that Thutmose's sixth campaign, in his thirtieth year, commenced with a naval transportation of troops directly into to Byblos, bypassing Canaan entirely.\n\nAfter the troops arrived in Syria by whatever means, they proceeded into the Jordan river valley and moved north from there, pillaging Kadesh's lands.\n\nTurning west again, Thutmose took Simyra and quelled a rebellion in Ardata, which apparently had rebelled once again. To stop such rebellions, Thutmose began taking hostages from the cities in Syria. The cities in Syria were not guided by the popular sentiment of the people so much as they were by the small number of nobles who were aligned to Mitanni: a king and a small number of foreign Maryannu.\n\nThutmose III found that by taking family members of these key people to Egypt as hostages, he could drastically increase their loyalty to him. However, Syria did rebel yet again in Thutmose's thirty-first year, and he returned to Syria for his seventh campaign, took the port city of Ullaza and the smaller Phoenician ports, and took even more measures to prevent further rebellions.\n\nAll the excess grain which was produced in Syria was stored in the harbors he had recently conquered, and was used for the support of the military and civilian Egyptian presence ruling Syria. This furthermore left the cities in Syria desperately impoverished, and with their economies in ruins, they had no means of funding a rebellion.\n\n\n\nAfter Thutmose III had taken control of the Syrian cities, the obvious target for his eighth campaign was the state of Mitanni, a Hurrian country with an Indo-Aryan ruling class. However, to reach Mitanni, he had to cross the Euphrates river. Therefore, Thutmose III enacted the following strategy.\n\nHe sailed directly to Byblos and then made boats which he took with him over land on what appeared to otherwise be just another tour of Syria, and he proceeded with the usual raiding and pillaging as he moved north through the lands he had already taken.\n\nHowever, here he continued north through the territory belonging to the still unconquered cities of Aleppo and Carchemish, and then quickly crossed the Euphrates in his boats, taking the Mitannian king entirely by surprise. It appears that Mitanni was not expecting an invasion, so they had no army of any kind ready to defend against Thutmose, although their ships on the Euphrates did try to defend against the Egyptian crossing.\n\nThutmose III then went freely from city to city and pillaged them while the nobles hid in caves (or at least this is the typically ignoble way Egyptian records chose to record it). During this period of no opposition, Thutmose put up a second stele commemorating his crossing of the Euphrates, next to the one his grandfather Thutmose I had put up several decades earlier. Eventually a militia was raised to fight the invaders, but it fared very poorly. Thutmose III then returned to Syria by way of Niy, where he records that he engaged in an elephant hunt. He then collected tribute from foreign powers and returned to Egypt in victory.\n\n\n\nThutmose III returned to Syria for his ninth campaign in his thirty-fourth year, but this appears to have been just a raid of the area called Nukhashshe, a region populated by semi-nomadic people. The plunder recorded is minimal, so it was probably just a minor raid.\n\nRecords from his tenth campaign indicate much more fighting, however. By Thutmose's thirty-fifth year, the king of Mitanni had raised a large army and engaged the Egyptians around Aleppo. As usual for any Egyptian king, Thutmose boasted a total crushing victory, but this statement is suspect.\n\nSpecifically, it is doubted that Thutmose accomplished any great victory here due to the very small amount of plunder taken. Specifically, Thutmose's annals at Karnak indicate he only took a total of ten prisoners of war. He may simply have fought the Mitannians to a stalemate, yet he did receive tribute from the Hittites after that campaign, which seems to indicate the outcome of the battle was in Thutmose's favor.\n\nThe details about his next two campaigns are unknown. His eleventh is presumed to have happened in his thirty-sixth regnal year, and his twelfth is presumed to have happened in his thirty-seventh, since his thirteenth is mentioned at Karnak as happening in his thirty-eighth regnal year. Part of the tribute list for his twelfth campaign remains immediately before his thirteenth begins, and the contents recorded (specifically wild game and certain minerals of uncertain identification) might indicate that it took place on the steppe around Nukhashashe, but this remains mere speculation.\n\nIn his thirteenth campaign Thutmose returned to Nukhashashe for a very minor campaign. The next year, his thirty-ninth year, he mounted his fourteenth campaign against the Shasu. The location of this campaign is impossible to determine definitely, since the Shasu were nomads who could have lived anywhere from Lebanon to the Transjordan, to Edom.\n\nAfter this point, the numbers given by Thutmose's scribes to his campaigns all fall in lacunae, so campaigns can only be counted by date. In his fortieth year, tribute was collected from foreign powers, but it is unknown if this was considered a campaign (i.e. if the king went with it or if it was led by an official).\n\nOnly the tribute list remains from Thutmose's next campaign in the annals, and nothing may be deduced about it, except that it probably was another raid to the frontiers around Niy. His final Asian campaign is better documented, however. Sometime before Thutmose's forty-second year, Mitanni apparently began spreading revolt among all the major cities in Syria. Thutmose moved his troops by land up the coastal road and put down rebellions in the Arka plain and moved on Tunip.\n\nAfter taking Tunip, his attention turned to Kadesh again. He engaged and destroyed three surrounding Mitannian garrisons and returned to Egypt in victory. However, his victory in this final campaign was neither complete, nor permanent, since he did not take Kadesh, and Tunip could not have remained aligned to him for very long, certainly not beyond his own death.\n\n\n\nThutmose took one last campaign in his fiftieth regnal year, very late in his life. He attacked Nubia, but only went so far as the fourth cataract of the Nile. Although no king of Egypt had ever penetrated so far as he did with an army, previous kings' campaigns had spread Egyptian culture that far already, and the earliest Egyptian document found at Gebel Barkal, in fact, comes from three years before Thutmose's campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonuments In her honor ...\n\nThutmose III was a great builder pharaoh and constructed over fifty temples, although some of these are now lost and only mentioned in written records. He also commissioned the building of many tombs for nobles, which were made with greater craftsmanship than ever before. His reign was also a period of great stylistic changes in the sculpture, paintings, and reliefs associated with construction, much of it beginning during the reign of Hatshepsut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistic Projects\n\nThutmose's architects and artisans showed great continuity with the formal style of previous kings, but several developments set him apart from his predecessors. Although he followed the traditional relief styles for most of his reign, after his forty-second year, he began having himself depicted wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and a sndyt-kilt, an unprecedented style.\n\nArchitecturally, his use of pillars also was unprecedented. He built Egypt's only known set of heraldic pillars, two large columns standing alone instead of being part of a set supporting the roof. His jubilee hall was also revolutionary, and is arguably the earliest known building created in the basilica style. Thutmose's artisans achieved new heights of skill in painting, and tombs from his reign were the earliest to be entirely painted, instead of painted reliefs.\n\nFinally, although not directly pertaining to his monuments, it appears that Thutmose's artisans had learned glass making skills - developed in the early eighteenth dynasty - to create drinking vessels by the core-formed method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnak\n\nDepiction of Tuthmoses III at Karnak holding a\n\nHedj Cluband a Sekhem Scepter standing before\n\ntwo obelisks he had erected there.\n\nThutmose dedicated far more attention to Karnak than any other site. In the Iput-isut, the temple proper in the center, he rebuilt the hypostyle hall of his grandfather Thutmose I, dismantled the red chapel of Hatshepsut, built Pylon VI, a shrine for the bark of Amun in its place, and built an antechamber in front of it, the ceiling of which was supported by his heraldic pillars.\n\nHe built a temenos wall around the central chapel containing smaller chapels, along with workshops and storerooms. East of the main sanctuary, he built a jubilee hall in which to celebrate his Sed festival. The main hall was built in basilica style, with rows of pillars supporting the ceiling on each side of the aisle. The central two rows were higher than the others to create windows where the ceiling was split. Two of the smaller rooms in this temple contained the reliefs of the survey of the plants and animals of Canaan which he took in his third campaign.\n\nEast of the Iput-Isut, he erected another temple to Aten where he was depicted as being supported by Amun. It was inside this temple that Thutmose planned on erecting his tekhen waty, or \"unique obelisk.\" The tekhen waty was designed to stand alone, instead as part of a pair, and is the tallest obelisk ever successfully cut. It was not, however, erected until Thutmose IV raised it, thirty five years later. It was later moved to Rome by Emperor Constantius II and is now known as the Lateran Obelisk.\n\nAnother Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius I re-erected another obelisk from the Temple of Karnak in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, in AD 390. Thus, two obelisks of Tuthmosis III's Karnak temple stand in Papal Rome and in Caesaropapist Constantinople, the two main historical capitals of the Roman Empire.\n\nThutmose also undertook building projects to the south of the main temple, between the sanctuary of Amun and the temple of Mut. Immediately to the south of the main temple, he built the seventh pylon on the north-south road which entered the temple between the fourth and fifth pylons.\n\nIt was built for use during his jubilee, and was covered with scenes of defeated enemies. He set royal colossi on both sides of the pylon, and put two more obelisks on the south face in front of the gateway. The eastern one's base remains in place, but the western one was transported to hippodrome in Constantinople. farther south, alone the road, he put up pylon VIII which Hatshepsut had begun. East of the road, he dug a sacred lake of 250 by 400 feet, and then placed another alabaster bark shrine near it. He commissioned royal artists to depict his extensive collections of fauna and flora in the Botanical garden of Thutmosis III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefacing of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nUntil recently, a general theory has been that after the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut 'usurped' the throne from Thutmose III. Although Thutmose III was a co-regent during this time, early historians have speculated that Thutmose III never forgave his stepmother for denying him access to the throne for the first two decades of his reign.\n\nHowever, in recent times this theory has been revised after questions arose as to why Hatshepsut would have allowed a resentful heir to control armies, which it is known she did. This view is supported further by the fact that no strong evidence has been found to show Thutmose III sought to claim the throne.\n\nHe kept Hatshepsut's religious and administrative leaders. Added to this is the fact that the monuments of Hatshepsut were not damaged until at least twenty years after her death in the late reign of Thutmose III when he was quite elderly and in another coregency - with his son who would become Amenhotep II - who is known to have attempted to identify her works as his own. Additionally, Thutmose III's mortuary temple was built directly next to Hatshepsut's, an act that would have been unlikely to occur if Thutmose III bore a grudge against Hatshepsut.\n\nAfter her death, many of Hatshepsut's monuments and depictions were subsequently defaced or destroyed, including those in her famous mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. Traditionally, these have been interpreted by early modern scholars to be evidence of acts of damnatio memoriae (condemning a person by erasure from recorded existence) by Thutmose III.\n\nHowever, recent research by scholars such as Charles Nims and Peter Dorman, has re-examined these erasures and found that the acts of erasure which could be dated, only began sometime during year forty-six or forty-seven of Thutmose's reign (c. 1433/2 BC). Another often overlooked fact is that Hatshepsut was not the only one who received this treatment. The monuments of her chief steward Senenmut, who was closely associated with her rule, were similarly defaced where they were found. All of this evidence casts serious doubt upon the popular theory that Thutmose III ordered the destruction in a fit of vengeful rage shortly after his accession.\n\nCurrently, the purposeful destruction of the memory of Hatshepsut is seen as a measure designed to ensure a smooth succession for the son of Thutmose III, the future Amenhotep II, as opposed to any of the surviving relatives of Hatshepsut who had an equal, or better, claim to the throne. It also may be likely that this measure could not have been taken earlier - until the passing of powerful religious and administrative officials who had served under both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III had occurred.\n\nLater, Amenhotep II even claimed that he had built the items he defaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomb\n\nThutmose's tomb, discovered by Victor Loret in 1898, is in the Valley of the Kings. It uses a plan which is typical of eighteenth dynasty tombs, with a sharp turn at the vestibule preceding the burial chamber. Two stairways and two corridors provide access to the vestibule which is preceded by a quadrangular shaft, or \"well\".\n\nThe vestibule is decorated with the full story of the Book of Amduat, the first tomb to do so in its entirety. The burial chamber, which is supported by two pillars, is oval-shaped and its ceiling decorated with stars, symbolizing the cave of the deity Sokar. In the middle lies a large red quartzite sarcophagus in the shape of a cartouche.\n\nOn the two pillars in the middle of the chamber there are passages from the Litanies of Re, a text that celebrates the later sun deity, who is identified with the pharaoh at this time. On the other pillar is a unique image depicting Thutmosis III being suckled by the goddess Isis in the guise of the tree.\n\nThutmose III's tomb in the Valley of the Kings, (KV34), is the first one in which Egyptologists found the complete Amduat, an important New Kingdom funerary text. The wall decorations are executed in a simple, \"diagrammatic\" way, imitating the manner of the cursive script one might expect to see on a funerary papyrus rather than the more typically lavish wall decorations seen on most other royal tomb walls.\n\nThe coloring is similarly muted, executed in simple black figures accompanied by text on a cream background with highlights in red and pink. The decorations depict the pharaoh aiding the deities in defeating Apep, the serpent of chaos, thereby helping to ensure the daily rebirth of the sun as well as the pharaoh's own resurrection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scene from the Amduat on the walls of the tomb\n\nof Thutmose III, KV34, in the Valley of the Kings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath and Burial\n\nAccording to the American Egyptologist, Peter Der Manuelian, a statement in the tomb biography of an official named Amenemheb establishes that Thutmose III died on Year 54, III Peret day 30 of his reign after ruling Egypt for 53 years, 10 months, and 26 days. (Urk. 180.15) Thutmose III, hence, died just one month and four days shy of the start of his fifty-fourth regnal year. When the co-regencies with Hatshepsut and Amenhotep II are deducted, he ruled alone as pharaoh for just over thirty of those years.\n\nThutmose III's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in 1881. He was interred along with those of other eighteenth and nineteenth dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the twenty-first dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun.\n\nWhile it is popularly thought that his mummy originally was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero in 1886, it was in fact first unwrapped by Emile Brugsch, the Egyptologist who supervised the evacuation of the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache five years previously in 1881, soon after its arrival in the Boulak Museum. This was while Maspero was away in France, and the Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service ordered the mummy re-wrapped. So when it was \"officially\" unwrapped by Maspero in 1886, he almost certainly knew it was in relatively poor condition.\n\nThe mummy had been damaged extensively in antiquity by tomb robbers, and its wrappings subsequently cut into and torn by the Rassul family who had rediscovered the tomb and its contents only a few years before. Maspero's description of the body provides an idea as to the magnitude of the damage done to the body:\n\nHis mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the 20th dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.\n\nThe face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror.\n\nHis statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealized their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Thutmosis II, though with a greater show of energy.\n\nUnlike many other examples from the Deir el-Bahri Cache, the wooden mummiform coffin that contained the body was original to the pharaoh, though any gilding or decoration it might have had had been hacked off in antiquity.\n\nIn his examination of the mummy, the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith stated the height of Thutmose III's mummy to be 1.615m (5 ft. 3.58in.). This has led people to believe that Thutmose was a short man, but Smith measured the height of a body whose feet were absent, so he was undoubtedly taller than the figure given by Smith.The mummy of Thutmose III now resides in the Royal Mummies Hall of the Cairo Museum, catalog number 61068.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III (unknown-ca 1426 B.C.) wasted no time making a name for himself, once he was out from under the shadow of the over-reaching regent-turned-pharaoh Hatshepsut.

Thutmose III was a skilled warrior who brought the Egyptian empire to the zenith of its power by conquering all of Syria, crossing the Euphrates (see Tigris-Euphrates river system ) to defeat the Mitannians , and penetrating south along the Nile River to Napata in the Sudan. He also built a great number of temples and monuments to commemorate his deeds.\n\nIn the 22nd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, a formidable coalition was formed against Egypt , led by the king of Kadesh in northern Syria and no doubt supported by the Mitanni. At this moment of crisis, Hatshepsut died, and Thutmose as sole ruler began a series of annual military campaigns aimed at Nubia and the Levantine powers.\n\nAs he grew up, Thutmose may even have been entrusted with command of the army on campaign in Nubia ; he may have also fought in Gezer in Palestine . His grandfather Thutmose I had penetrated into northern Syria; Thutmose II, though far from a weakling, had not followed this success, and Hatshepsut may have been unwilling to send an army into the field. Thus, through inaction, Egyptian influence in Syria and Palestine declined. The sons and grandsons of the Syrian princes who had surrendered to Thutmose I no longer sent tribute, and the king of Mitanni , a powerful Mesopotamian kingdom with its capital beyond the Euphrates, was able to extend his control westward to the Mediterranean .\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II ; his mother was one of the king\u2019s secondary wives or a lesser harem queen, named Isis . Since there was no prince with a better claim to the throne, the boy was crowned king on the early death of his father; he was very young at the time. Hatshepsut \u2014the daughter of Thutmose I , the wife and sister of Thutmose II, and the mother of Thutmose III\u2019s half-sister Neferure\u2014acted as regent. By the seventh year of his reign this strong-minded and ambitious woman herself assumed the attributes, dress, and insignia of a king and to all intents and purposes reigned in his stead. As one of her courtiers says, \u201cshe directed the affairs of the whole land according to her wishes.\u201d Still, Thutmose was given an education befitting his royal station. He was taught all military skills, especially archery, which he demonstrated in public display, and horsemanship, in which he showed considerable prowess . He was later to boast that none among his followers could equal him in physical strength and in marksmanship.\n\nMilitary campaigns\n\nAfter a few months\u2019 preparation the king was ready to march at the head of his army. The first campaign is recorded in some detail on the walls of the temple he built at Karnak in Thebes, which describe the march to Gaza and thence to Yahmai south of the Carmel Range, the council of war, and the king\u2019s bold decision to surprise the enemy encamped at Megiddo, northeast of Carmel and about 18 miles (29 km) southeast of the modern city of Haifa. Thutmose\u2019s approach was by the route least expected\u2014a narrow defile over the mountain. It was successful: the enemy was defeated, and Megiddo was taken after a siege of eight months. In subsequent campaigns, which are less fully described in the annals, ports on the Phoenician coast were converted into Egyptian supply bases, and Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biq\u0101\u02bf (Bekaa) valley were taken.\n\nIn the 33rd year of Thutmose\u2019s reign, the time was at last ripe for his most audacious move, an attack on the kingdom of Mitanni itself, which had grown stronger since the day when Thutmose I had taken its army by surprise. Thutmose planned the campaign well; pontoon boats were transported across Syria on oxcarts for the crossing of the Euphrates River. The ensuing encounter, which must have taken place on the eastern bank, is not described by the annalist; it resulted in the precipitate flight of the Mitannian king and the capture of 30 members of his harem and some hundreds of his soldiers. Triumphantly, Thutmose set up his commemorative inscription by the river\u2019s edge, next to that of his grandfather Thutmose I. It was his farthest point of advance. On the homeward journey he hunted elephant in the land of Niy, in the Orontes valley, and on his return he celebrated a great triumph at Thebes and dedicated prisoners and booty to the temple of the state god, Amon.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Native rulers, members of local ruling dynasties, were henceforward set to govern their own territories as vassals of Egypt and were bound by solemn oath to keep the peace, render annual tribute, and obey the Egyptian representative in the region, the \u201coverseer of foreign lands.\u201d Their sons were sent as hostages to Egypt and educated at court, so that in due course they might return to rule their inheritance, Egyptianized in outlook and sympathies. Fortresses were built, and Egyptian garrisons were stationed at key points along the coast and in the highlands.\n\nTo the south, Thutmose reaffirmed the southern boundary of Egyptian domination over Nubia as far as Kurgus, and at Napata, near Mount Barkal, he built a temple to Amon. He thoroughly subdued the turbulent Nubian tribes and employed many of them in the gold mines, which from his reign on became the basis of Egyptian wealth in foreign exchange with the princes of western Asia. For the last 12 years of his reign, he was content to enjoy the fruits of his victories. The tribute of Syria and Palestine and of the Sudan poured into his treasury; the annals list huge quantities of timber and metal ores, cattle, and grain delivered by the conquered. Minoan Crete and Cyprus, Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites sent gifts. The tombs of high officials of the reign are decorated with scenes depicting the reception of foreign envoys coming from places as far away as the Aegean and the Greek mainland to lay their rich and exotic gifts at the feet of the pharaoh.

Over the course of 17 campaigns, he secured more territory than any other pharaoh. By the end, he controlled Egypt\u2019s largest ever empire.

The battle itself was a decisive victory for Egypt and the seven- or eight-month siege which followed reduced the power of the subject kings, gave Thutmose III control of northern Canaan (from which he launched his campaigns into Mesopotamia), and elevated the Egyptian king's status to legend.\n\nBattle of Megiddo Relief Olaf Tausch (GNU FDL)\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE) by a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II's great royal wife was Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), who was appointed regent to the young Thutmose III upon the death of his father. Hatshepsut, however, broke with the tradition which insisted on a male pharaoh and assumed the position herself.\n\nThutmose III grew up at court and received extensive military training as was expected for a prince in the period of the New Kingdom of Egypt (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE), the age of empire. When Hatshepsut died, Thutmose III came to power, and believing him to be weak and inexperienced, the king of the Syrian city of Kadesh incited a rebellion in the Egyptian province of Canaan which quickly gained support from other regions hoping to cast off Egyptian rule. This coalition assembled at the city of Megiddo.\n\nIn c. April of 1457 BCE, Thutmose III marched his army from Thebes to Megiddo in northern Canaan (northern Israel in the present day), prudently chose to approach the city by a narrow pass from the town of Aruna \u2013 instead of the wider and easier routes to the city \u2013 and surprised his enemies by entering the Qina Valley behind their defensive positions and driving them from the field. The entire campaign could have been ended that day, had the Egyptian army not halted their pursuit of survivors to collect treasures and trophies from the field; Thutmose III had to lay siege to the city to take it.\n\nThutmose III's commander and military scribe Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) naturally accompanied his king on the campaign to put down the revolt and kept a journal detailing the engagement. Tjaneni's account so pleased Thutmose III that he had portions of it inscribed on the walls of the great Temple of Amun at Karnak and, to lesser extents, elsewhere. Tjaneni's report is among the most detailed of any campaign in Egypt's history including that of Ramesses II's famous account of The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BCE.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nTjaneni begins by explaining why the inscription is to be found engraved on the temple's walls. He then proceeds to detail the campaign and the reasons for it. The 'wretched enemy' mentioned periodically is the king of Kadesh who initiated the rebellion and organized the forces against Egypt but at some points is used to designate all who had joined the rebellion. Following the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose III would subjugate and punish all who participated, conquering not only Kadesh but all of Syria and the lands of the Mitanni in Mesopotamia, among others.\n\nThe following translation is by James B.

His majesty passed the fortress of Sile [on the Egyptian frontier] on the first campaign of victory which his majesty made to extend the frontiers of Egypt, in valor, in victory, in power, and in justification. Now this was a long time in years\u2026while every man was tributary before Egypt. But it happened in later times that the garrison which was there was in the town of Sharuhen while from Iursa to the outer ends of the earth [from southern Canaan to northern Syria] had become rebellious against his majesty.\n\n(The army marched at a rate of 150 miles in 10 days to reach Gaza where they rested. They then moved on to the town of Yehem near Aruna where Thutmose III called a council of his commanders. There were three ways the army could travel to Megiddo: a narrow path where the troops would have to march single-file, a road to the south, and another to the north both of which were wider and would allow for an easier movement of the army. Thutmose III had decided on the narrow road from Aruna; his generals wanted to go by either of the two other easier routes).\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHis majesty ordered a conference with his victorious army, speaking as follows:\n\n\"That wretched enemy of Kadesh has come and has entered into Megiddo. He there at this very moment. He has gathered to him the princes of every foreign country which had been loyal to Egypt, as well as those as far as Naharin and Mitanni, them of Hurru, them of Kode, their horses, their armies, and their people, for he says \u2013 so it is reported - 'I shall wait here in Megiddo to fight against his majesty'. Will you tell me what is in your hearts?\"\n\nThey said in the presence of his majesty: \"What is it like to go on this road which becomes so narrow? It is reported that the foe is there, waiting on the outside, while they are becoming more numerous. Will not horse have to go after horse and the army and the people similarly? Will the vanguard of us be fighting while the rear guard is waiting here in Aruna unable to fight? Now, two other roads are here. One of the roads \u2013 behold, it is to the east of us, so that it comes out at Taanach. The other \u2013 behold, it is to the north side of Djefti, and we will come out to the north of Megiddo. Let our victorious lord proceed on the one of them which is satisfactory to his heart but do not make us go on that difficult road!\"\n\nThen messages were brought in about that wretched enemy and discussion was continued of that problem on which they had previously spoken. That which was said in the majesty of the Court \u2013 life, prosperity, health [a common blessing regarding pharaoh. Thutmose III spoke to the assembly:]\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\n\"I swear, as Ra loves me, as my father Amun favors me, as my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction, my majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road! Let him of you who wishes go upon these roads of which you speak and let him of you who wishes come in the following of my majesty! 'Behold', they will say, these enemies whom Ra abominates, 'has his majesty set out on another road because he has become afraid of us?' \u2013 So they will speak.\"\n\nThey said in the presence of his majesty:\n\n\"May thy father Amun, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding over Karnak, act according to thy desire! Behold, we are following they majesty everywhere that thy majesty goes, for a servant will be after his lord.\"\n\nThen his majesty laid a charge upon the entire army:\n\n\"Ye shall hold fast to the stride of your victorious lord on that road which becomes so narrow. Behold, his majesty has taken an oath, saying: 'I will not let my victorious army go forth ahead of my majesty in this place!'\"\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nNow, his majesty had laid it in his heart that he himself should go forth at the head of his army. Every man was made aware of his order of march, horse following horse, while his majesty was at the head of his army.\n\n(The army traveled by the narrow road from Aruna to Megiddo. The men marched in single-file, leading the horses. The chariots were dismantled and carried by the soldiers. Although reports had been received that the enemy would be waiting for them at the end of the narrow road, they found no one there. The coalition expected Thutmose III to take either of the easier paths and were actually waiting for him at the end of those roads.)\n\nThen his majesty issued forth [from the narrow road] at the head of his army which was prepared in many ranks. He had not met a single enemy. Their southern wing was in Taanach while their northern wing was on the south side of the Qina valley. Then his majesty rallied [his troops] saying: \"They are fallen! While that wretched enemy [watched for us in the wrong place, we have arrived to surprise them.] May ye give praise to Amun; may he extol the might of his majesty, because his arm is greater than that of any king. It has indeed protected the rear of his majesty's army in Aruna!\"\n\nNow while the rear of his majesty's victorious army was still at the town of Aruna, the vanguard had come out into Qina Valley and they filled the mouth of this valley.\n\nThen they [his generals] said to his majesty \u2013 life, prosperity, health! \u2013 \"Behold, his majesty has come forth with his victorious army and they have filled the valley. Let our victorious lord listen to us this time and let our lord guard for us the rear of his army and his people. When the rear of the army comes forth for us into the open, then we shall fight against these foreigners, then we shall not trouble our hearts about the rear of our army.\"\n\nA halt was made by his majesty outside [of the valley] and he [sat] there guarding the rear of his victorious army. Now the leaders had just finished coming forth on this road when the shadow turned [meaning it was noon, when the sundial had to be repositioned. It took seven hours before the rearguard caught up to the vanguard of the army in the valley]. His majesty reached the south of Megiddo on the bank of the Qina brook when the seventh hour was in its course in the day.\n\nThen a camp was pitched there for his majesty and a charge was laid upon the entire army, saying: \"Prepare ye! Make your weapons ready, since one will engage in combat with that wretched enemy in the morning.\"\n\nResting in the enclosure of life, prosperity, and health [in the royal pavilion] the pharaoh provided for the officials, issuing rations to the retinue, posting the sentries of the army, saying to them: \"Be steadfast, be steadfast! Be vigilant, be vigilant!\" Awakening in life in the tent of life, prosperity, and health [he met with his messengers]. They came to tell his majesty: \"The desert is well and the garrisons of the south and north also!\"\n\nHis majesty set forth in a chariot of fine gold, adorned with his accoutrements of combat, like Horus, the Mighty of Arm, a lord of action like Montu, the Theban, while his father Amun made strong his arms. The southern wing of his majesty's army was at a hill south of the Qina brook and the northern wing was to the northwest of Megiddo, while his majesty was in their center. Amun being the protection of his person in the melee and the strength of Set pervading his members.\n\nThereupon his majesty prevailed over them at the head of his army. Then they [the enemy] saw his majesty prevailing over them, and they fled headlong to Megiddo with faces of fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of gold and silver so that someone might draw them up into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now, the people had shut this town against them but they let down garments to hoist them up into this town. Now, if only his majesty's army had not given up their hearts to capturing the possessions of the enemy, they would have captured Megiddo at this time, while the wretched enemy of Kadesh and the wretched enemy of this town were being dragged up hastily to get them into their town, for fear of his majesty entered their bodies and their arms were weak for his serpent-diadem had overpowered them.\n\nThen their horses and their chariots of gold and silver were captured as easy as prey. Ranks of them were lying stretched out on their backs like fish in the bight of a net while his majesty's victorious army counted up their possessions. Now there was captured that wretched enemy's tent which was worked with silver.\n\nThen the entire army rejoiced and gave praise to Amun because of the victory which he had given to his son on this day. They lauded his majesty and extolled his victories. Then they presented the plunder which they had taken: hands [hands cut off as spoils of war], living prisoners, horses, and chariots of fold and silver and of painted work.\n\nThen his majesty commanded his army with these words:\n\n\"Capture ye effectively, my victorious army! Behold, all foreign countries have been put in this town by the command of Ra on this day, inasmuch as every prince of every northern country is shut up within it for the capturing of Megiddo is the capturing of a thousand towns! Capture ye firmly, Firmly!\"\n\nOrders were issued to the commanders of the troops to provide for their divisions and to inform each man of his place. They measured this city, which was corralled with a moat and enclosed with fresh timbers of all their pleasant trees, while his majesty himself was in a fortress east of this town, being watchful. He ordered the town enclosed with a girdled wall. Its name was called \"Men-kheper-Ra-is-the Corraller-of-the-Asiatics.\" People were appointed as sentries at the enclosure of his majesty and they were told: \"Be steadfast, be steadfast! Be vigilant, be vigilant!\" Not one of them was permitted to go outside from behind this wall except to come out at a knock on the door of their fortress [by an Egyptian].\n\nNow everything which his majesty did to this town and to that wretched enemy and his wretched army is set down by the individual day by the individual expedition and by the individual troop commanders. They are set down on a roll of leather in the Temple of Amun today.\n\nNow the princes of this foreign country came on their bellies to kiss the ground to the glory of his majesty and to beg breath for their nostrils because his arm was so great, because the prowess of Amun was so great over every foreign country, all the princes whom the prowess of his majesty carried off, bearing their tribute of silver, gold, lapis lazuli, and turquoise, and carrying grain, wine, and large and small cattle for the army of his majesty, with one gang of them bearing tribute southward. Then his majesty appointed princes anew for every town.\n\nList of the booty which his majesty's army carried off from the town of Megiddo:\n\n340 living prisoners and 83 hands, 2,041 horses, 191 foals, 6 stallions; 1 chariot worked with gold with a body of gold belonging to that enemy, 1 fine chariot worked with gold belonging to the prince of Megiddo, and 892 chariots of his wretched army \u2013 total: 924. 1 fine bronze coat of mail belonging to that enemy, 1 fine bronze coat of mail belonging to the prince of Megiddo, and 200 leather coats of mail belonging to his wretched army; 502 bows, and 7 poles of meru-wood worked with silver of the tent of that enemy.\n\nNow the army of his majesty carried off cattle of 387, 1,929 cows, 2,000 goats, and 20,500 sheep. List of what was carried off afterward by the king from the household goods of that enemy who was in Uanoam, Nuges, and Herenkeru [of northern Syria] together with the property of those towns which had made themselves subject to him: 38 [officers] belonging to the enemy, 84 children of that enemy and of the princes who were with him, 5 [officers] belonging to them and 1,796 male and female slaves as well as their children and 103 pardoned persons who had come out from that enemy because of hunger \u2013 total: 2,503 \u2013 apart from bowls of costly stone and gold, various vessels (100), a large jar in Syrian work, jars, bowls, plates, various drinking vessels, large kettles, 17 knives \u2013 making 1,784 deben [the Egyptian monetary unit], gold in discs found in the process of being worked, as well as abundant silver in discs \u2013 966 deben and 1 kidet, a silver statue with a head of gold, 3 walking sticks with human heads, 6 carrying chairs of that enemy of ivory, ebony, and carob-wood, 1 bed belonging to that enemy of carob-wood worked with gold and with every kind of costly stone, completely worked in gold, a statue of that enemy which was there of ebony worked with gold, its head of lapis lazuli, bronze vessels and much clothing of that enemy.\n\nNow the fields were made into arable plots and assigned to inspectors of the palace in order to reap their harvest. List of the harvest which his majesty carried off from the Megiddo acres: 207,300 plus sacks of what apart from what was cut as forage by his majesty's army."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/thutmose-iii-history-military-campaigns-greatest-achievements/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, one of ancient Egypt\u2019s greatest rulers, was the 6th pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reign, which spanned from around 1479 to 1425 BC, was one marked by his unrelenting thirst for dominance and power. Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns? And how did Thutmose III bring the mighty Mitannians to submission?\n\nBelow, World History Edu explores the life, family tree, military campaigns, and major achievements of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nQuick facts about Thutmose III\n\nBirth: c. 1481 BC\n\nDied: c. 1425 BC\n\nAged: 56\n\nBurial place: Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt\n\nReligion: Ancient Egyptian religion\n\nFather: Thutmose II\n\nMother: Iset\n\nSiblings: Neferure\n\nSpouses: Satiah, Nebtu, Menwi, Menhet, Merti, Nebsemi\n\nChief consort: Merytre-Hatshepsut\n\nChildren: Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, Siamun, Nefertiri, Amenemhat, Amenhotep II\n\nReign: 1479-1425 BC\n\nDynasty: 18th\n\nPredecessor: Queen Hatshepsut\n\nSuccessor: Amenhotep II\n\nEpithets: \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d, \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d\n\nOther names: Thutmosis (\u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d or \u201cThoth is born\u201d)\n\nMost known for: Steering ancient Egypt to its zenith ever\n\nConquests: northern Syria, parts of Nubia, Palestine, Niya Kingdom\n\nBirth and early life\n\nSon of Egyptian ruler Thutmose II and Queen Iset, Thutmose III was born around 1481 BC. Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://www.givemehistory.com/king-thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III (1458-1425 BCE) also known as Tuthmosis III was Egypt\u2019s 6th king of the 18th Dynasty. He forged an enduring reputation as one of antiquity\u2019s greatest military leaders. This military prowess set the platform for his position as one of Egypt\u2019s most effective monarchs. His throne name, Thutmose, translates as \u2018Thoth is Born,\u2019 while \u2018Menkhperre\u2019 his birth name means \u2018Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra.\u2019 Both Thutmose III\u2019s names acknowledged two of ancient Egypt\u2019s most powerful deities.\n\nFacts About Thutmose III\n\n6th king of Egypt\u2019s 18th Dynasty and national hero, Thutmose III was revered by his people\n\nOne of antiquity\u2019s greatest military leaders, successfully leading 17 military campaigns in 20 years, amassing enormous wealth for Egypt\n\nA military genius, he mastered the art of surprise attacks, rapid movement, logistics and lines of supply\n\nThutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s history, from elaborate tombs enlivened with ornate paintings to the massive pylons in Karnak, painting, sculpting and glass making flowered\n\nHe erected many of Egypt\u2019s majestic obelisks including those now set in New York, Istanbul, Rome and London today\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Family Lineage\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE) and Iset one of Thutmose II\u2019s lesser wives. Thutmose II was also married to Queen Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), a royal daughter of Thutmose I (1520-1492 BCE) who also carried out the role of God\u2019s Wife of Amun..\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Thutmose III was only three years old, too young to rule so Hatshepsut became regent. Hatshepsut later declared herself pharaoh and assumed the throne herself, emerging as one of the most powerful women in Egyptian history.\n\nWhen Thutmose III came of age his stepmother gave him command of Egypt\u2019s armed forces. It was an inspired decision, even if politically motivated. Thutmose III proved himself to be a charismatic leader and an exceptional military strategist.\n\nThutmose III During Hatshepsut\u2019s Regency And His Rise To Power\n\nThutmose III grew up at the royal court in Egypt\u2019s capital Thebes. Little documented evidence of his early life survived. However as was the custom in Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom, the physical and intellectual development of a prince was a major focus of their education.\n\nThutmose III is believed to have studied military tactics and strategies together with athletics while in school. It is also thought he participated in Hatshepsut\u2019s early campaigns abroad. It was common practice amongst New Kingdom pharaohs to immerse their successors in the military at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III is said to have honed his skills in hand-to-hand combat, archery and horsemanship.\n\nDuring Thutmose III\u2019s formative years, his stepmother reigned over one of Egypt\u2019s most prosperous times. Once Hatshepsut\u2019s initial campaigns had secured her reign, there were few major overseas deployments and the army primarily focused on protecting trade and maintaining orders along Egypt\u2019s long borders.\n\nUpon Hatshepsut\u2019s death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III\u2019s ascension to the throne, the kings of Egyptian-vassal states in Syria and Canaan rebelled. Thutmose III preferred direct action rather than negotiation so he left Egypt on his first military campaign.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Military Campaigns\n\nDuring his time on the throne, Thutmose III successfully led 17 military campaigns in 20 years. At the pharaoh\u2019s direction, details of his victories were inscribed at Karnak\u2019s Temple of Amun. Today, there are acknowledged to be the most exhaustive records of ancient Egypt\u2019s military campaigns in existence.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s first campaign climaxed at The Battle of Megiddo, his most famous battle. The account of the campaign comes to us from Thutmose III\u2019s private secretary (c. 1455 BCE).\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief supremely confident in his own ability and of victory. By taking a little-used cattle track, Thutmose III achieved tactical surprise and routed his enemy. Thutmose III then marched on the city and besieged it for eight months until they surrendered. Thutmose III returned home laden with an enormous campaign loot, having lingered only to harvest the defeated army\u2019s crops.\n\nMegiddo saw Thutmose III initiate a policy that continued throughout all his subsequent campaigns. He brought the noble children of defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where many continued supporting Egyptian interests.\n\nVictory at Megiddo gave Thutmose III control of northern Canaan. His Nubian campaigns proved equally successful. By Thutmose III\u2019s 50th year, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s borders beyond those of any of his predecessors, making Egypt wealthier than it had been at any time since the start of the Old Kingdom\u2019s 4th Dynasty (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nThutmose III And The Arts\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign was not only absorbed by military campaigns. His patronage of the arts extended to his commissioning of 50 temples along with countless monuments and tombs. Thutmose III also contributed more to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than other pharaohs. Ironically, his refurbishment of the Karnak temple preserved the names of past kings and provided descriptions outlining of his own military campaigns.\n\nUnder Thutmose III, artistic skills flowered. Glass making was refined and mastered. Statuary adopted less idealized and more realistic styles. Thutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s long history. From elaborate tombs embellished with complex paintings and freestanding columns to the massive pylons in Karnak. Thutmose III also created public parks and gardens, complete with ponds and lakes for his subject\u2019s recreation, while a private garden surrounded both his palace and his Karnak temple.\n\nDefacing Hatshepsut\u2019s Monuments\n\nOne of the most controversial acts attributed to Thutmose III is his desecration of Hatshepsut\u2019s monuments and his attempt to erase her name from historical records.\n\nAccording to Egyptian religious belief, to expunge a person\u2019s name was to doom them to non-existence. For an ancient Egyptian to continue their eternal journey in the afterlife they needed to be remembered.\n\nThe current view amongst most scholars is that Thutmose III ordered this campaign to prevent Hatshepsut from becoming a role model for future Queens who may aspire to rule. In the Egyptian afterlife, there was no place in the narrative for a woman to ascend the throne and wield power.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of a pharaoh was to maintain ma\u2019at, the principle of harmony and balance at the heart of ancient Egyptian culture. This is thought to be the motivation behind Thutmose III\u2019s expunction of Hatshepsut\u2019s name.\n\nLegacy\n\nThutmose III left a substantial legacy of military greatness. Thutmose III took an isolated and weakened nation and transformed Egypt into an imperial power. By carving an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia across to Syria and the Levant and down to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, Thutmose III cemented Egypt\u2019s influence as a powerful and prosperous nation. Thutmose III epitomized the ideal of the Egyptian warrior-king who led his military to successive glorious victories, cementing his status as an Egyptian national hero and one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt.\n\nReflecting On The Past\n\nWas Thutmose III really an ancient Napoleon, a brilliant general who never lost a battle or merely a skilled propagandist who stole Hatshepsut\u2019s legacy?\n\nHeader image courtesy: Louvre Museum [CC BY-SA 2.0 fr], via Wikimedia Commons"}, {"url": "https://www.primidi.com/thutmose_iii/thutmoses_military_campaigns", "page_content": "Thutmose's Military Campaigns\n\nFurther information: Djehuty (general) and The Taking of Joppa\n\nWidely considered a military genius by historians, Thutmose III made 16 raids in 20 years. He was an active expansionist ruler, sometimes called Egypt's greatest conqueror or \"the Napoleon of Egypt.\" He is recorded to have captured 350 cities during his rule and conquered much of the Near East from the Euphrates to Nubia during seventeen known military campaigns. He was the first Pharaoh after Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates, doing so during his campaign against Mitanni. His campaign records were transcribed onto the walls of the temple of Amun at Karnak, and are now transcribed into Urkunden IV. He is consistently regarded as one of the greatest of Egypt's warrior pharaohs, who transformed Egypt into an international superpower by creating an empire that stretched from southern Syria through to Canaan and Nubia. In most of his campaigns his enemies were defeated town by town, until being beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a much weaker city or state one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved.\n\nMuch is known about Thutmosis \"the warrior\", not only because of his military achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large number of lands, is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. He encountered only little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily. His army also had carried boats on dry land. These campaigns (17 in 20 years), are inscribed on the inner wall of the great chamber housing the \"holy of holies\" at the Karnak Temple of Amun. These inscriptions give the most detailed and accurate account of any Egyptian king."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thutmose-III/Adornment-of-Egypt", "page_content": "Adornment of Egypt\n\nThe new prosperity was reflected in the remarkable program of building undertaken by the king\u2019s architects. The Temple of Amon at Karnak in particular was enlarged and enriched by many new buildings and a number of obelisks. Two of the splendid granite obelisks that he erected there are now in Istanbul and Rome; of the two, now known as Cleopatra\u2019s Needles, with which he adorned the temple of the sun god at Heliopolis, one is in New York City\u2019s Central Park and the other on the Thames embankment in London. During Thutmose III\u2019s reign, art and craftsmanship received new impetus from his patronage. The exotic birds, beasts, and plants that he brought back from his campaigns in Asia are depicted on the walls of his Festival Hall at Karnak; among the gifts sent him from abroad were a live bear, an elephant, a giraffe, and \u201cbirds that give birth every day\u201d\u2014probably domestic hens, which were rare in the Middle East at that time.\n\nThe last decade of his reign is marked by the building of a new temple at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b, next to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple. At the same time, a systematic program was instituted by Thutmose III to erase the record of her kingship and to ascribe her monuments to her immediate predecessors, Thutmose I and Thutmose II. The motive for Hatshepsut\u2019s proscription at such a late date is not fully understood, but most of her cartouches and images vanished from public view.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Thutmose appointed his son Amenhotep II, the son of his second wife, Meryetre, as coregent. When he died, in 1426 bce, he was laid to rest in a remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. The mummy of the pharaoh was one of those discovered in 1889, in a hiding place where the priest-kings of the 21st dynasty (1075\u2013c. 950 bce) had put them for safety. Of the rich furniture that must originally have been placed in the tomb, only a few fragments were found. A memorial temple, which he built on a terrace at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b beside that of Hatshepsut, was discovered in 1962.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the western Theban mountain, the burial place of three members of his harem was found; judging by their names, they were Asiatic princesses, and though of minor rank their jewelry and equipment were extremely lavish.\n\nOf all the kings of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III is perhaps the one who, for the modern historian, most nearly comes to life. His records, though couched in the boastful and extravagant terms thought befitting a pharaoh\u2019s exploits, leave little doubt not only of his ability as a soldier and a statesman but also of his abilities as an athlete and a hunter of lion, wild cattle, and elephant. From his mummy it is known that he was a small man, not above five feet three inches (1.6 metres) in height. His statues show a youthful, smooth face with a large, high-bridged nose and pleasantly smiling mouth.\n\nHis fame lived after him. His name inscribed on countless amulets was thought to bring power and protection to the wearers. A popular hymn celebrating his triumphs became a model for later paeans of victory.

His throne name, Thutmose, means 'Thoth is Born', while his birth name, Menkhperre, means 'Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra'.\n\nBoth of these throne names reference important deities of ancient Egypt Thoth, the god of writing and wisdom, and Ra, the supreme god of the sun. Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II and a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II (r. 1492-1479 BCE) was married to Queen Hatshepsut (r. 1479-1458 BCE), royal daughter of Thutmose I (r. 1520-1492 BCE) and a powerful woman who held the position of God's Wife of Amun.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Hatshepsut became regent of Egypt since Thutmose III was too young to rule. She was supposed to maintain this position but, instead, declared herself pharaoh and ruled independently. Thutmose III, when he came of age and proved himself able, was given command of the armed forces by his step-mother; a choice she would not regret as he proved himself an exceptional military strategist and charismatic leader. He is often referred to in the present day as 'the Napoleon of Egypt', but unlike Napoleon, Thutmose III never lost a single engagement, expanded and maintained his empire, and was worshiped by his people for centuries after his death.\n\nYouth Under Hatshepsut & Rise to Power\n\nThutmose III was born c. 1481 BCE and was only three years old when his father died and Hatshepsut was made regent and then reigning monarch. He grew up at the royal court of Thebes, capital of Egypt throughout most of the period of the New Kingdom (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE). Although there is little documentation of his life during this time, a great emphasis was placed on the physical and intellectual development of princes during the New Kingdom of Egypt as they were expected to one day rule over an expanding empire.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThutmose III, therefore, would have spent a great deal of time in school, at athletics, and learning about military tactics and strategies. He probably went along on the early campaigns Hatshepsut commissioned as this was a common practice among New Kingdom pharaohs to acquaint their successors with warfare at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III developed skills in archery, horsemanship, hand-to-hand combat, and athletic ability. There is no doubt that military training was his priority but his education went far beyond battle tactics and the use of weapons; his later reign makes clear he was a highly cultured and sophisticated man who was aware of the value of cultures beyond Egypt's borders, recognized the importance of art and music, and had a great respect for human life.\n\nStatue of King Thutmose III Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (Copyright)\n\nWhile he was growing up, his step-mother was reigning over one of the most prosperous periods in Egypt's history. After the initial campaigns to secure her position, there were no others throughout Hatshepsut's reign and the army was only deployed in small troops to protect trade expeditions and to maintain the borders. Hatshepsut did not allow her military to stand idle, however, or weaken as evidenced by how quickly Thutmose III was able to mobilize and lead the armies once he came to power.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nHatshepsut may have married her daughter Neferu-Ra to Thutmose III in order to secure succession but it does not seem, after his youth, that he spent much time at court. Orientalist James Henry Breasted has suggested he would have probably lived among the soldiers from a fairly early age in order to stay out of Hatshepsut's way and prove himself useful to her reign. It was common enough for noble princes to be removed at the discretion of a reigning monarch who perceived them as a threat and Thutmose III shows too great an ambition to have made himself so vulnerable.\n\nThat he succeeded in his plans is evidenced by the fact that, before the end of her reign, Hatshepsut had placed him in command of her armies. Her reign ended with her death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III came to the throne. Hatshepsut had maintained a tight control of Egypt's borders and provinces, but with her death, the kings of Egyptian-controlled states in Canaan and Syria rebelled. Thutmose III was not interested in negotiation and certainly was not going to let these provinces simply leave the empire, and so he set out on his first military campaign.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years. He ordered the details of his victories to be inscribed at the Temple of Amun at Karnak and they are considered the most extensive records of ancient Egyptian military campaigns extant. His first is his most famous \u2013 The Battle of Megiddo \u2013 and is the one described in the most exacting narrative. His later campaigns lose this form and are given with less detail, appearing more as lists of spoils than narratives of the king's victories.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years.\n\nThe reason for the decline in narrative form is not clear, but the claim of some scholars that it indicates a stronger cohesion of the state in which pragmatic lists of goods superseded narratives of a pharaoh's victory is untenable; there are a number of such narratives in the centuries following Thutmose III's reign, most notably that of Ramesses II (r. 1279-1213 BCE) concerning Kadesh and Ramesses III (r. 1186-1155 BCE) regarding his victory over the Sea Peoples. The most reasonable explanation for the brevity of the later inscriptions is simply that the writer of the Megiddo narrative died.\n\nThe story of the Battle of Megiddo was written by Thutmose III's private secretary, military scribe, and general Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) who was with him throughout the event. Tjaneni kept a journal on a leather scroll (later deposited for posterity at the Temple of Amun in Thebes) which Thutmose III so admired he ordered the narrative inscribed on the walls of the temple as well as those of others throughout Egypt.\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief fully aware of his abilities and those of his troops and completely confident of victory. In the most famous passage of the account, the pharaoh calls a conference with his senior staff to discuss marching orders to Megiddo and tells them they will be taking the narrow road from Aruna, on which the army will have to march single-file, rather than either of the wider and more easily travelled roads which were available.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe generals object to this, arguing that they have intelligence the enemy is waiting for them at the pass to the plains of Megiddo from the Aruna road and their rearguard will still be marching while the vanguard is engaged with the enemy. Thutmose III hears their counsel but disagrees, telling them that they may take whatever road they choose but he will be leading his army along the Aruna road and will be leading from the front. The generals then agree to follow wherever he chooses to take them.\n\nHis decision on the Aruna road was characteristic of Thutmose III's resolve to pursue a course he considered best regardless of the difficulties. The armies would have had an easier time on the other roads \u2013 especially considering that, on the Aruna path, they had to dismantle and carry the chariots and supply wagons \u2013 but it would have cost the army the element of surprise which Thutmose III recognized as imperative.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nAs it turned out, the enemy was not waiting at the end of the Aruna road but on the two easier paths which they expected Thutmose III to take at the head of so large an army. No one expected him to lead his forces along what was essentially a cattle path. After giving his army a night to rest and refresh themselves, he ordered the attack the next morning, leading from the front, and drove his opponents from the field. The report then details how his army, delighted at the victory, gathered treasures from the fallen instead of pursuing survivors and taking the city. This cost Thutmose III complete victory on the field that day because it gave the people of Megiddo time to prepare their defenses.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEven so, Thutmose III marched on the city, surrounded it with a moat and a stockade, and lay siege to it for seven or eight months until it surrendered. He offered very generous terms to the people \u2013 none of the surviving ringleaders of the revolt were executed \u2013 which essentially came down to a promise not to incite rebellion in the future. He then turned his army around and marched back home with his enormous loot from the campaign, pausing only to harvest the crops of the defeated and bring them back to Egypt.\n\nAt Megiddo, he also initiated a policy he would adhere to throughout all his campaigns of bringing the noble children of the defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. These children were held as hostages to guarantee the good behavior of their parents but were treated with all the respect due to royalty, housed in the palace, and given many freedoms. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where, since they had now spent their youth in Egypt, they supported and encouraged Egyptian culture and the state's interests when they were elevated to positions of power.\n\nThutmose III's victory at Megiddo gave him control of northern Canaan from which he would launch his campaign into Syria to take Kadesh. He campaigned against the Mitanni and erected a stele at the Euphrates River, commemorated in his inscription at Karnak, known as Thutmose III's Hymn of Victory. His Nubian campaigns were equally successful, and by his 50th year, he had expanded Egypt's holdings beyond any of his predecessors and made the country wealthier than it had been since the beginning of the 4th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nPatron of the Arts\n\nHis reign was not only focused on military conquest, however, as his patronage of the arts shows. Thutmose III commissioned upwards of 50 temples, numerous tombs, monuments, and contributed more significantly to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than any other pharaoh. His renovations and additions to the Karnak temple, in fact, are among the most significant in that they preserve the names of past kings (whose monuments he would sometimes remove in his renovations) and provide narratives of his own campaigns and initiatives which have proven to be extremely important to scholars in the study of the culture.\n\nTemple of Amun, Karnak Dennis Jarvis (CC BY-SA)\n\nArtistic techniques and experimentation reached new heights under Thutmose III. Glass-making had been known for centuries but was now perfected to the point where drinking vessels could be made of glass. Statuary was less idealized and more realistic \u2013 a trend begun in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040-1782 BCE) \u2013 but abandoned in favor of the traditional idealism in art established during the Old Kingdom. Thutmose III is depicted in his statuary as a tall, handsome man in excellent physical condition and this is considered a realistic portrayal in that, first, all depictions are uniform and, second, depictions of others \u2013 also consistent \u2013 are far from flattering.\n\nHis artisans produced some of the finest work in Egypt's history including elaborate tombs decorated with intricate paintings and freestanding columns as well as contributing enormous pylons to Karnak. In keeping with Egypt's respect for and love of nature, he encouraged public parks and gardens, created lakes and ponds for the people's recreation and enjoyment, and had a private garden cultivated both around his palace and at Karnak temple.\n\nDefacement of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nHis artistic sensibilities and respect for others are at odds with a policy almost universally ascribed to him: the desecration of Hatshepsut's monuments and the attempt to erase her name from history. Scholars are divided on when this happened in his reign but it was certainly not in the early years. Whenever it transpired, the name and images of Hatshepsut were removed from all public monuments as well as the exterior and some of the interior work at her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri.\n\nTo remove a person's name was to condemn them to non-existence; one needed to be remembered in order to continue one's eternal journey in the afterlife. Further, it was thought that the deceased needed daily sustenance in the form of food and drink offerings delivered to their tombs, where their body was preserved through mummification and statues representing them enabled their soul to visit and partake of these offerings. The so-called Execration Texts of ancient Egypt make clear that the removal of one's name was only justified if that person had committed some serious offense, but there is no evidence of Hatshepsut being involved with any such crimes.\n\nTemple of Hatshepsut, Aerial View N/A (CC BY)\n\nMost likely, Thutmose III ordered this action to prevent Hatshepsut from standing as a role model for future women who might aspire to rule. The position of the monarch of Egypt was traditionally occupied by males and, by assuming power for herself, Hatshepsut had departed from this practice. The first king of Egypt was thought to have been the god Osiris who was murdered by his brother Set and brought back to life by his sister-wife Isis. He was finally succeeded by his son Horus who defeated Set, took back the throne, and re-established order in the land. Kings associated themselves with Horus during their reign and with Osiris, who became Lord of the Dead, in the afterlife; there was no place in this narrative for a woman to hold supreme power.\n\nThe central cultural value of ancient Egypt was ma'at (harmony and balance) and this relied largely on an adherence to tradition. Ancient Egyptians are often characterized as conservative for this reason: departure from tradition could result in a loss of stability \u2013 balance \u2013 and the return of primordial chaos. It was the duty of the pharaoh to maintain ma'at and this is probably the motivation behind Thutmose III's eradication of Hatshepsut's name.\n\nHe backdated his reign to remove all evidence of her ever having ruled Egypt and replaced some of her images in her mortuary temple with his own. All of her public monuments were torn down \u2013 especially those at Karnak \u2013 and replaced by his, though, at other sites, only her name was removed. So thorough was this erasure of his predecessor that Hatshepsut's name was unknown in Egypt's history until the 19th century CE. Later kings of Egypt thought the beautiful Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri was built by Thutmose III, and many of them would claim her impressive monuments as their own.\n\nThutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly.\n\nIt has been suggested that Thutmose III had nothing to do with these actions and that they were perpetrated by his son and successor Amenhotep II (r. 1425-1400 BCE) either in the latter part of Thutmose III's reign or the beginning of his own. Although this is possible, it does not seem probable in that, by the time of Amenhotep II, Thutmose III had already ordered Hatshepsut's works at Karnak removed and replaced by his own. Further, the image and name of Hatshepsut was left intact within the interior of her mortuary temple.\n\nIf Amenhotep II, who never knew Hatshepsut, was trying to erase her from history, it is unlikely he would have spared her memory anywhere. Leaving her name and image intact, but out of the public eye, suggests that Thutmose III was only interested in maintaining the tradition of a male pharaoh in Egypt's history but did not wish his step-mother any ill will.\n\nWhen he died, of natural causes, in c. 1425 BCE, he was buried in his own mortuary temple beside that of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri. Even though he had basically claimed her temple as his own, he still would not have had his eternal resting place located so close to hers if he had sincerely believed she deserved to be sentenced to non-existence.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unfortunate result of this action is that, ever since the rediscovery of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III is as often referenced for her eradication as he is for his many accomplishments and magnificent reign. Thutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly. He elevated Egypt's status as a powerful and prosperous nation, employed the people in monumental building projects, and epitomized the ideal of the valiant Egyptian warrior-king who led his forces to successive victories.\n\nThutmose III's consideration for his enemies in defeat and gentle treatment of them made him respected far beyond the boundaries of his country. He established an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, through Syria and the Levant, down through Nubia to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile.\n\nAlthough there is little doubt that the people of these lands would have preferred their independence, they prospered under his reign through the peace he established and maintained through his military and diplomatic skills. In every respect, Thutmose III represented the ideal pharaoh to his people and his memory has endured to the present day as one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt."}, {"url": "https://www.havefunwithhistory.com/thutmose-iii-accomplishments/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, often referred to as the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt,\u201d was a powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom who ruled from approximately 1479 BCE to 1425 BCE.
