{"Merle Oberon died in (1958).": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s. One writer described her as \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different\u201d, while others marveled at her \u201cdelicate\u201d oval face, \u201celoquent\u201d emerald eyes, \u201cbright red lips\u201d and \u201calabaster\u201d skin.\n\nThough her 1936 best actress Oscar nomination for the coming-of-age drama The Dark Angel affirmed her place in a league with Katharine Hepburn and the eventual winner, Bette Davis, the glamor paragons of the day, it was only later that the world discovered Oberon was a south Asian woman passing for white.\n\nGiven the way Everything Everywhere All at Once has dominated this awards season, it seems increasingly likely that Michelle Yeoh will take home this year\u2019s best actress prize. But when Yeoh\u2019s name was announced among the best actress nominees for this year\u2019s Academy Awards in late January, the Hollywood Reporter was at pains to call the veteran actor \u201cthe first person who identifies as Asian to ever be nominated for the award\u201d.\n\nLaurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in Wuthering Heights. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar\n\nCritics condemned the declaration as too politically correct, even as it captured the complex tie that binds these women, each a product of her time. Where the 60-year-old Yeoh is a butt-kicking film pioneer on the brink of smashing a cultural ceiling for playing a role originally written for Jackie Chan, Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. It wasn\u2019t until decades after her death in 1979 at age 68 that the world learned her truth. That, not Oberon\u2019s eye-opening work in The Dark Angel, is what should rightly be hailed as her signature performance.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the story of racial representation,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, \u201cMerle Oberon is a really important part. She brings a global aspect to it, the shades of brown.\u201d\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in what was then the British Indian city of Bombay, Oberon was determined to make the most of her innately fairer complexion. It became her ticket to a bigger world, the shroud that helped disguise the fact that she was the product of rape. Her birth father was the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Her mother, believed to have been of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry, was just 14 when she gave birth in 1911. After centuries of intermixing, babies born from biracial relationships had evolved into a quiet shame \u2013 shunned by Britons and Indians alike.\n\nThe family nicknamed Oberon \u201cQueenie\u201d, as her birth coincided with Queen Mary and King George\u2019s visit to India. In an attempt to soften Oberon\u2019s lot in life, her grandmother raised her as her own and convinced her that her teenage mother was actually her half sister. But that wasn\u2019t enough to shield Oberon from the relentless taunts over her mixed heritage. At the age of three, after a cross-country move to Calcutta, she won a scholarship to one of the city\u2019s best all-girls private schools, only for classmates to drive her out with their overt racism. Films and the nightlife scene became her escape, and playing pretend key to her survival.\n\nMerle Oberon and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Alamy\n\nIn adolescence, Oberon began honing a posh accent and lightening her skin with bleach creams loaded with ammoniated mercury \u2013 a dangerous poison that had more of a weakening effect on Oberon\u2019s many male suitors. Those who didn\u2019t dump her outright after discovering her race helped sponsor her moves from India to France and England, where she worked for a time as a club hostess under the name Queenie O\u2019Brien. When she became romantically involved with the Hungarian-born British director Alexander Korda, Oberon\u2019s acting career clicked into high gear.\n\nA bit part as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 blockbuster The Private Life of Henry VIII announced her breakout. A mad scramble to come up with a cover story for the actor credited as \u201cMerle Oberon\u201d ensued. She told people she had been born in Tasmania \u201cbecause it was so far from the US and Europe and generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core\u201d, wrote Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of the 2002 documentary The Trouble with Merle. (In her lifetime, Oberon visited Australia twice.) Oberon claimed her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. (Her half-brother, Harry, would discover them in Bombay, now Mumbai, after her death.) As for her much darker-skinned mother \u2013 her biological grandmother \u2013 Oberon presented her as a maid.\n\nSuch was the cost of making it in show business at a time when the US government was keen to crack down on indecency. Rather than leave it up to lawmakers, Hollywood seized on the opportunity to police itself, adopting a set of rules known as the Hays Code \u2013 which, among many other things, frowned upon interracial romance. With representational casting essentially made illegal, studios embraced yellow and blackface. And when Oberon\u2019s early work with Korda, whom she eventually married, led to a successful career under Samuel Goldwyn, it became in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep her identity a mystery. \u201cThink about it,\u201d says Dav\u00e9. \u201cShe was part of this cadre of actors and actresses that were loaned out to make all these movies. She was dependent on Goldwyn and Korda for her livelihood. I can see why she had to hide in that way. She had no power.\u201d\n\nNot even the 1936 best actress nomination brought Oberon any extra clout. For a start, the Oscars were barely a decade old and not yet the gold standard award. For another, the media was even tougher on female actors than they are now and held Oberon up for extra scrutiny.\n\nOberon gets a tip as she leaves for Royal Ascot, in a 1950 photo in London. Photograph: Norman Vigars/Getty Images\n\nOne critic derided Oberon\u2019s performance in the 1934 action film The Scarlet Pimpernel, citing a \u201ctendency to strongly orientalize her appearance by means of facial makeup and the slant of black brows\u201d. When a 1934 Los Angeles Times story used the term \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d to describe her, Oberon dismissed it as a coincidence. In an ad campaign for Max Factor, the cosmetics brand bragged about how its makeup turned her from \u201cslightly unreal and exotic\u201d to a \u201cbeautiful, charming girl\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she would be Oscar nominated for The Dark Angel, a film about a first world war love affair that is complicated when the male protagonist suffers a battle injury that costs him his eyesight. Strangely, it was Oberon\u2019s only nomination, even as Hepburn and Davis became Oscar perennials and Oberon kept working into the early 70s. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights and as herself in 1966\u2019s The Oscar, which is about the awards.\n\nStill, she soldiered on in spite of the damage she\u2019d caused to her skin from so much bleach cream and a car accident that left her disfigured and forced Korda to abandon production of the epic I, Claudius. To keep the cracks in Oberon\u2019s white facade from surfacing on screen, the cinematographer Lucien Ballard developed a special camera light for her to obscure her facial scars. This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Oberon", "page_content": "Merle Oberon, (born February 19, 1911, Bombay [now Mumbai], India\u2014died November 23, 1979, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), British and American film actress who appeared in more than 30 motion pictures.

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel\u2014will look familiar. Matt Bomer plays a wunderkind producer based on MGM production head Irving Thalberg. Kelsey Grammer plays his boss, a figure inspired by Louis B. Mayer. But the most fascinating character may be Margo Taft, an actress played by Jennifer Beals who\u2019s concealing an explosive secret. The character is based on Merle Oberon, a golden-age movie star who was known for her great beauty\u2014and the similar secret she took with her to the grave.\n\nThe raven-haired, brown-eyed stunner, probably best known for playing Cathy opposite Laurence Olivier\u2019s Heathcliff in the 1939 classic Wuthering Heights, spent her life hiding her biracial identity, \u201cpassing\u201d for white. Like Oberon, Margo likely fears that the truth about her heritage will torpedo her career during a time when racial prejudice was rampant, and silver-screen faces were lily-white, save for a black servant or two.\n\nOberon\u2019s career took off after a move to London at age 17, when English director Alexander Korda cast her in a small but pivotal role as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII in 1933. The film\u2019s success led to leading-lady status, and films including The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Dark Angel\u2014for which she was Oscar-nominated\u2014That Uncertain Feeling, and A Song to Remember.\n\nBut it was Oberon\u2019s personal story that was worthy of a Hollywood script. The actress, known more for her striking looks\u2014often described as \u201cexotic\u201d\u2014than her acting abilities, claimed she was born in Tasmania (like her contemporary Errol Flynn). She said that after her British Army officer father died, she was raised by her aristocratic Indian godparents. It\u2019s believed Korda, who became the first of Oberon\u2019s four husbands, concocted the fake origin story.\n\nNicknamed \u201cQueenie\u201d in honor of King George V and Queen Mary\u2019s 1911 visit to India the year she was born in the city now known as Mumbai, Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson\u2019s true provenance wasn\u2019t revealed until four years after her death in 1979. The biography Merle: A Biography of Merle Oberon exposed what seems to have been known by those in her inner circle: Oberon was Anglo-Indian. Her mother\u2014or the woman believed to be her mother (more about that later)\u2014came from what\u2019s now Sri Lanka, and was part M\u0101ori; her father, Arthur Thompson, was a British mechanical engineer. Ironically, the regal actress\u2014she became \u201cLady Korda\u201d when her first husband was knighted in 1942\u2014had an impoverished childhood in India.\n\nIn 1985, her nephew Michael Korda, then editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, penned the roman \u00e0 clef Queenie about his aunt, and told The Los Angeles Times that her Eurasian ancestry \u201cwas an open secret\u201d within his family.

Yet her interpretation of the fiercely independent actress may also offer insight into Oberon\u2019s own mindset. \u201cMargo is willing to suppress so much in order to get as far as she can,\u201d says Beals. Oberon was just as tenacious: after a 1937 car accident damaged one side of her face, she hid her scars with makeup and good lighting. Then, on the set of the 1944 filmThe Lodger, cinematographer Lucien Ballard mounted a light on the side of a camera, which diffused her flaws.

A unique beauty and Academy award nominee, she was one of the most celebrated actresses of her time. The biggest role of her life was, however, little seen. And that\u2019s just how she wanted it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFearing discrimination, she was forced to conceal her ethnicity from the world and it wasn\u2019t until after her death that the truth was revealed.\n\nBorn in 1911 as Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in Bombay, British India, she was raised the daughter of Arthur O'Brien Thompson, a British engineer, and his wife Charlotte Selby, who was of Sri Lankan and Maori heritage. In reality, they were her grandparents. Estelle\u2019s biological mother was Constance Thompson, whom she grew up believing was her older sister. This peculiar domestic set-up was an attempt by the family to save Estelle from disgrace owing to the fact Constance was only 12 when she fell pregnant. The identity of the child\u2019s father is unknown to this day. It is unclear if Oberon ever found out the truth about her parents; it would have added a layer of complexity to the racial arrangements she would have to make in her life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1914 Arthur Thompson left his family to join the British Army. He would die of pneumonia two years and half a world away later on the Western Front. Those were years of hardship for the Thompson family, who were living in shabby apartments. Bombay then was pretty much as it is now. Hectic with heat and crowds, the city has an oppressive air, and it was perhaps harsher still for the Thompsons, whose future of possibilities in having an Englishman as head of the household had been extinguished. Things looked to have changed for the better when in 1917 Estelle won a scholarship to attend a prestigious private school in Calcutta. The family moved the length of India and set up in more comfortable lodgings. Comfortable was not, however, Estelle\u2019s time at school. Though light-skinned compared to Charlotte, her mixed-race heritage was known and she became the subject of terrible abuse. The bullying was so intolerable that she was forced to stop attending lessons, eventually finishing her studies by being tutored at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was as a direct result of this episode that Estelle first considered concealing her identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nWith her schooling over, she began to feel restless, sensing that her ethnicity would forever constrain her life chances. The glint of something different, the light leading to a new path, was movies; perhaps initially not in a starring role, but the prospect she saw in them of transformation. If nothing else, her education had given her perfect diction, which, when combined with an upper-class English accent and the beauty that by now was quite evident, gave her a way into the Calcutta Amateur Dramatics Society. She later said that she\u2019d joined in the hope it would help \u2018pave her way to the movies.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was there she met Ben Finney, a former actor and Colonel in the British Army, and whom she began seeing. The relationship lasted until Finney one day caught a glimpse of Charlotte Thompson. He abruptly dumped Estelle, having realised she was not white, only passing for. To ease his guilt, Finney promised that if she ever visited France, he would make the necessary introductions to Rex Ingram, the head of a French film studio in Nice. What seemed like conscience-greasing hyperbole in fact had merit, as Finney had become acquainted with Ingram via his old flame Barbara Lamarr, the American film star. Feeling that this promise may be as short-lived as his romantic interest in her, Estelle and Charlotte packed their belongings and set off for Nice. On their arrival, they found the ever-chivalrous Finney was not there to meet them, although he did keep his bargain and put in a good word for her at the studio. Rex Ingham liked Estelle\u2019s looks, which set her apart from the blonde and blue-eyed types he was more used to working with. He immediately hired her as an extra.\n\n\u2018I couldn't dance or sing or write or paint. The only possible opening seemed to be in some line in which I could use my face. This was, in fact, no better than a hundred other faces, but it did possess a fortunately photogenic quality\u2019\n\n\u2013 Merle Oberon\n\n\n\n\n\nShe played minor roles for a while and at the age of 17 decided the best way to forward her career was to move to London. Once there, and to make ends meet, she found work as a hostess at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, on Piccadilly, but continued to take what scraps the film industry threw at her. One day, while queuing for tea at the Paramount studio canteen, Estelle caught the attention of the famous producer Alexander Korda. He cast her in the small but very focal role of Anne Boleyn in his 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u2018They\u2019re trying to make me the first Glamour Girl of England. I suppose it is because my face is odd, and my eyes slant. I don\u2019t look like any of the other movie stars over there, and they feel that if they worked on me hard enough, perhaps I would be the type\u2019\n\n\u2013 Merle Oberon\n\n\n\n\n\nFearing Estelle\u2019s mixed heritage might become an obstacle to her movie career, Korda decided to re-form her. He dropped the O\u2019Brien for the more aristocratic Oberon. Next was the creation of a fictional biography that said she was born in Tasmania to upper class British parents. No new identity could be complete without the material destruction of the old. Her records were made to disappear, with the official line being that they had gone up in flames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018It's easier for me to be something which I am not than it is to act myself\u2019\n\n\u2013 Merle Oberon\n\nBy now, Oberon herself was anxious to keep her race a secret, so desperate that at one point she had Charlotte pose as her maid. Even after death in 1937, Charlotte Selby Thompson was destined, in a sense, to carry on playing the maid: in the portraits Estelle commissioned of her, the artist was instructed to lighten her skin colour.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe role of Anne Boleyn would be Oberon\u2019s breakout and the film\u2019s success paved the way to leading-lady status. Her career benefited from her growing professional and personal relationship with Korda, and she was so much in demand that he sold shares of her contract to the American producer Samuel Goldwyn, of Goldwyn Mayer. Hollywood hits such as the Scarlet Pimpernel and Wuthering Heights followed, with Oberon commuting between London and California. Her performance in the 1935 film The Dark Angel earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.\n\nIt was the first time a biracial actress had been recognised in segregated Hollywood, though of course it did little for people of colour as no one other than Oberon and those close to her knew the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMerle Oberon Max Factor Make-up Advertisement\n\nOberon had always refused to appear on camera without make-up, which was used to mask her natural complexion. She was set to star in another Korda film, 1937\u2019s I, Claudius, where she was due to play the role of Messalina, but she was injured in a car crash and filming abandoned. The accident left her with facial injuries severe enough that they might have ended her career, but these too were masked away with make-up.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorda and Oberon were married in 1939 and as an engagement present he gave her a spectacular Cartier necklace. It was an incredible and very distinctive piece, with 29 teardrop-shaped emeralds linked by platinum and covered in single-cut diamonds. The Indian emeralds must have held a special, if tortuously conflicted, significance. They were a connection to a distant past that was less racially piercing, but she was all too aware it was a place from which she could never have flourished. It was as though Estelle O\u2019Brien and Merle Oberon had been born conjoined twins and in order for one to survive, truly survive, the other had to die. It must have seemed at the time that it was an obvious choice. Estelle had to be killed. But was a touch of humanity lost along with that soul? Oberon would continue to wear the necklace throughout her life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMerle Oberon's Cartier Emerald Necklace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1940 Oberon suffered further damage to her face, now thought to have been as a result of using chemicals to further lighten her complexion. It was reported at the time as being \u2018cosmetic poisoning\u2019. Korda arranged for her to see the best skin specialist in New York, where she underwent several dermabrasion procedures. The results were only partially successful and she was left with noticeable pitting and indentations in her skin. The cinematographer Lucien Ballard devised a special light to eliminate all her flaws, at least on film, by the use of a compact spotlight he called the Obie. Mounted on the side of the camera, it lit the subject head-on, reducing unflattering lines and shadows, and removed signs of scarring. Obie went into general use and is still around today. Oberon left Korda to marry Ballard in 1945. She was to marry twice more.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of her life Oberon had amassed a major jewellery collection, with a number of impressive pieces. Today her favourite emerald necklace is one of Cartier\u2019s most photographed pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\nMerle Oberon died in 1979 after suffering a stroke. She did her best to maintain her fictional background until the very end, though an increasingly sceptical press were asking difficult questions of her early life. Her Tasmanian origins were comprehensively debunked after her death.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe once said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Without security it is difficult for a woman to look or feel beautiful\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price she paid for that security was a life complex in identity issues, of scars, real and emotional, of masks, painted and psychological; a story worthy of a Hollywood script.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Art of Glamour , the style and beauty secrets of Hollywood's golden age"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1574/merle-oberon", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!
