His tenure in the country was cut short in 2010 when he was charged with fraternization for having a sexual liaison with a female subordinate.\n\nHe was charged and later pleaded guilty to two counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, in violation of the National Defence Act.\n\nBy the time he was convicted, M\u00e9nard had already left the military, but was symbolically reduced in rank. He was also fined $7,000.\n\nTough rules\n\nAfghanistan has tough rules for private military contractors regarding the possession and use of weapons and other military gear.\n\nIt's those rules \u2013 and the way the Afghan government enforces them \u2013 that Canadian security consultant Alan Bell says could be to blame for M\u00e9nard's detention.\n\nBell's Globe Risk International has done security work in Afghanistan on behalf of clients like the Canadian Foreign Affairs department. In fact, Bell says he once even reported to M\u00e9nard during a stint in Kandahar province.\n\nAfghanistan's rules for private security contractors were toughened significantly several years ago.\n\n\"This was for licensing purposes and for generating revenue for the Afghanistan government,\" Bell said. \"It was also a way of tying a weapon to an individual if that weapon was ever used illegally.\"\n\nIt's happened to a lot of companies. - Alan Bell, security consultant\n\nThat Afghan system's rules require security companies to keep accurate, detailed records of all military equipment uses in Afghanistan including rifles, radios, ballistic helmets and other gear. Bell says those records are sent to Afghanistan's Interior Ministry along with licence fees.\n\nAfghan officials frequently audit security companies to ensure they only have the weapons they have licences to support.\n\nBell says these audits can frequently cause trouble for security companies in Afghanistan, in part because the requirements are onerous, but also because the Afghan system frequently doesn't operate with the same business ethics that Western companies are used to.\n\n\"It's happened to a lot of companies. These people turn up out of the blue and try to audit their weapons and what they have what they don't have,\" Bell said. \"When there is an audit and they find you've got X amount of weapons that haven't been listed or licensed, they take that very seriously.\n\n\"If you get caught, then you have a problem. They will arrest usually the country manager because is the one that is on the ground all the time,\" Bell said.\n\n\"They've arrested a lot of [expatriates] over the years and they fine then, they fine the company. They usually confiscate the equipment that wasn't registered with them, and then you carry on business as normal.\n\n\"Then [Interior Ministry officials] go on to another company and do the same things.\"\n\nIt appears it's a situation similar to this that has M\u00e9nard spending time in jail. GardaWorld does lots of work in Afghanistan, including, at times, for the Canadian government.\n\nIt's also had more than one rules run-in with Afghan authorities.\n\nGardaWorld faced similar problem in 2012\n\nIn 2012, two British employees of GardaWorld were arrested by Afghan authorities and faced similar accusations after being found with 30 allegedly unlicensed AK-47s. At the time, GardaWorld maintained its employees were planning to buy the weapons but wanted to test their functionality on a range first.\n\nGardaWorld also faced a forced shutdown of its operations as a result of those arrests.\n\nThat dispute occurred in the early days of an Afghan government plan to take over and \"Afghanize\" most of the work undertaken by private security contractors in the war-torn country.\n\nBell says these latest accusations levelled against GardaWorld and M\u00e9nard remind him of that 2012 dispute.\n\n\"This is down to hard cash at the end of the day and whether Garda did have equipment that wasn't registered or not,\" Bell said. \"[Garda] obviously had their reason for doing that, now they've been found out so consequently they will have to pay the fines and then it will be business as usual and next week it will be another company.\n\n\"This has happened so many times with so many companies. It isn't rare.\"\n\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Department said it is aware of the arrest, and that \"consular services are being provided to a Canadian citizen who has been detained in Afghanistan.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/daniel-m%C3%A9nard-ex-canadian-general-released-from-afghan-prison-1.2543215", "page_content": "Daniel M\u00e9nard, the former Canadian brigadier-general held in an Afghan jail on gun-running charges, has been released from prison.\n\nM\u00e9nard had been imprisoned since January in his current role as an executive for private security company GardaWorld.\n\nA newspaper carrying a report from Kabul on Jan. 30 alleged M\u00e9nard's run-in with the law centred on accusations of possessing military equipment without permission, including 129 rifles and 148 radios.\n\nGardaWorld later told CBC News the issue had been resolved and that M\u00e9nard's release \"should happen imminently,\" but word of his actual release did not come until this week.\n\nGardaWorld confirmed M\u00e9nard's release in a statement to CBC News on Wednesday.\n\n\"This situation was about the administration of a license, as we disclosed previously, and not about gun-running,\" spokesman Joe Gavaghan said in an email to CBC News.\n\nM\u00e9nard was formerly a military commander for Canada's mission in Afghanistan.

This is a story that Canada\u2019s mainstream media refuses to give the light of day.\n\nPrivate Security, Public Money Throughout the disastrous twenty-year-long war in Afghanistan, Canada has been heavily reliant on private security companies (PSCs) to aid the war effort. Despite the prevalence of PSCs in the North American nation\u2019s operations in Afghanistan, their presence has garnered barely any media attention. Canadians are largely ignorant of this controversial element of the foreign occupation. Media narratives about Lavery have mentioned that he operated the PSC Raven Rae Consultancy Services, which employed some fifty Afghan nationals. News outlets have, however, refrained from focusing on Lavery\u2019s company with the same level of attention they have applied to his heroics. According to its site, Raven Rae began its operations in Afghanistan in 2010. It was one of the thousands of PSCs that entered Afghanistan during the US and NATO occupation. Private security industry researcher Anna Powles has gone so far as to say that Afghanistan \u201chas been a gravy train for the global private security industry for the past two decades.\u201d So integral were PSCs to the day-to-day running of military operations in Afghanistan that a former senior US commander remarked that their departure \u201cled to the erosion of the capability of the Afghan Air Force.\u201d In the same interview, the anonymous ex-military official added that without the \u201cultimate security\u201d of the military, these private armies had no choice but to withdraw. At the height of Canada\u2019s thirteen-year military mission in Afghanistan, Saladin, DynCorp, and other PSCs had larger numbers of armed men at their disposal than most of the NATO countries occupying the country. In 2008, Canadian brigadier-general Denis Thompson explained: Without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what we are achieving here. There are many aspects of the mission here in Afghanistan, many security aspects that are performed by private security firms that which, if they were turned over to the military, would make our task impossible. We just don\u2019t have the numbers to do everything. The federal government spent tens of millions of dollars on PSCs. They paid $10 million for private security to guard Canada\u2019s signature $50 million aid project \u2014 the repair of the Dahla Dam in Kandahar province. The federal government also contracted Saladin to protect its embassy in Kabul. Saladin was the same company that helped secure Prime Minister Stephen Harper during a visit in 2007 and was charged with the protection of forward operating bases in Kandahar province. Saladin has a history that should worry anyone concerned with the dangers of privately owned militaries. Its predecessor, Keenie Meenie Services, trained and possibly equipped Islamic insurgents battling Russian forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was also implicated in covert operations in Nicaragua as part of the Iran-Contra Affair."}, {"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/5-canadians-killed-in-afghanistan-1.782043", "page_content": "Reporter Michelle Lang of the Calgary Herald was among five Canadians killed by a bomb in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
