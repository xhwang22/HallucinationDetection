Sydney FC was the inaugural Grand Final winner, with Adelaide United securing the first Premiership as table-toppers at the end of the season.\n\nThe initial season was made up of:\n\n- Adelaide United (SA)\n\n- Central Coast Mariners (NSW)\n\n- Melbourne Victory (VIC)\n\n- Newcastle Jets (NSW)\n\n- New Zealand Knights (NZ)\n\n- Queensland Roar (QLD - now Brisbane Roar)\n\n- Perth Glory (WA)\n\n- Sydney FC (NSW)\n\nThe launch of the A-League in 2005\n\n\n\nThe Knights took part in the first two seasons of the competition, before Wellington Phoenix took over their licence ahead of the 2007/08 season.\n\nThe league expanded in 2009 with two new teams - Gold Coast United (QLD) and North Queensland Fury (QLD) - with Melbourne Heart (now Melbourne City) joining in 2010. However, Gold Coast and North Queensland lasted three and two seasons respectively.\n\nA second team in Sydney was announced in 2012, with Western Sydney Wanderers joining the competition for the 2012-13 season, winning the Premiership in their first season and the AFC Champions League in 2014.\n\nIn December 2018 the A-League - which had 10 clubs at the time - announced that two new clubs would be added to the competition across the next two seasons, with Western United (VIC) and Macarthur FC (NSW) joining in 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the A-League officially became independent of Football Australia, coming under the new entity called the 'Australian Professional Leagues' (APL).\n\nSydney FC is the most successful team in the history of the A-League Men competition, winning four Premierships and five Championships.\n\nIn September 2021, the A-League became the A-League Men, with the APL revealing its new identity, with the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth leagues brought together under a unified \u201cA-Leagues\u201d banner.\n\nSydney FC lift the A-League Men Championship trophy, nicknamed the 'Toilet Seat'."}, {"url": "https://ccmariners.com.au/history", "page_content": "About Us\n\nInaugurated in 2004, Central Coast Mariners FC is proud to be the first ever professional sporting entity to represent the Central Coast region on a national and international sporting stage.

Media speculation prior to the announcement of the franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan\u2014who would act as inaugural club chairman\u2014also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.\n\nAt the time of the formation of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league's allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was \"over the moon\", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a \"foundation player\" and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda was one of the most prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win. The club's management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5 million salary cap, stipulating that they \"would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground.\"\n\nLawrie McKinna era (2004\u20132010)\n\nThe Mariners' inaugural season was considered a resounding success by most; the team reached the 2006 A-League Grand Final after finishing third during the regular season. Central Coast was defeated by Sydney FC 1\u20130 in front of a crowd of 41,689\u2014a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth Glory in the final 1\u20130. Before the 2006\u201307 A-League season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years. This was the club's first marquee signing, following the lead of Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the 2006 Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5\u20134 on penalties after the score was tied 1\u20131 after extra time. The Mariners then participated in the 2006\u201307 A-League season, but was unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.\n\nClub captain Noel Spencer was released by the Mariners, then signed to participate in the Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006\u201307 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencv\u00e1ros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and S\u00e3o Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side to draw from the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season saw Central Coast win its first premiership on goal difference ahead of Newcastle, following a final round that began with Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2\u20130 loss to Newcastle in the first leg of its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2\u20130 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3\u20132 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1\u20130 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield's decision, goalkeeper Danny Vukovi\u0107 struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vukovi\u0107 was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international keeper Mark Bosnich on a seven-week contract.\n\nBefore the 2008\u201309 season, Central Coast was predicted to be among the A-League leaders, but had a run of three losses in a row to end the regular season. Even with the losing streak, the club narrowly qualified for the finals, finishing in fourth, two points ahead of Sydney F.C. and Wellington Phoenix. Central Coast lost 4\u20131 on aggregate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending the team's season.\n\nGraham Arnold and Phil Moss era (2010\u20132015)\n\nIn February 2010, following the club's 2009\u201310 season, McKinna chose to move into a new role, becoming Central Coast's Football and Commercial Operations Manager. Socceroos assistant manager Graham Arnold was appointed as the club's new manager, becoming its second manager. In the lead-up to the 2010\u201311 season, numerous transfers resulted in changes to the club's squad. The Mariners announced the signing of 2005 Under 20s World Cup winner Patricio P\u00e9rez of Argentina in June 2010, followed by Dutch defender Patrick Zwaanswijk. In July 2010, it was announced that the Mariners' women's team would not compete in the 2010\u201311 W-League competition. The club stated that financial reasons were behind the decision, after Football NSW withdrew its funding.\n\nIn spite of relatively low expectations in the lead up to the season, the 2010\u201311 season was more successful for the club than 2009\u201310; the A-League and youth league teams both finished second in their respective leagues in the regular season. The senior team was then defeated by the premiers, Brisbane Roar, 4\u20132 on aggregate over two legs in the major semi-final, before defeating Gold Coast United 1\u20130 in the Preliminary Final to qualify for the 2011 A-League Grand Final against Brisbane. By reaching the Grand Final, the club also qualified for the 2012 AFC Champions League. In a championship match that the A-League's website called \"classic\", Central Coast was defeated 4\u20132 in a penalty shootout after leading 2\u20130 with three minutes remaining in extra time to finish runners-up for the third time.\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season was similarly successful, as the club won the premiership for the second time in its history with 51 points, two more than second-place Brisbane. The club failed to qualify for a second successive Grand Final, though, losing 5\u20132 on aggregate to Brisbane in the major semi-final and 5\u20133 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw with Perth Glory in the Grand Final Qualifier.\n\nOn 21 April 2013, after three losses in Grand Finals, Central Coast won its first A-League title, defeating first-year side Western Sydney Wanderers 2\u20130 in the Grand Final at Allianz Stadium. Arnold re-signed with the club for a further two seasons on 30 August 2013, but on 14 November it was confirmed that he had signed a two-year contract to become manager of J. League Division 1 side Vegalta Sendai, starting in January 2014. Former assistant manager Phil Moss was named the new head coach. Mariners general manager Peter Turnbull left the club as well, and New Zealand international Michael McGlinchey moved to the J. League to play for Arnold's new side. Central Coast finished the 2013\u201314 A-League regular season in third place, behind runner-up Western Sydney on goal difference. In the semi-final, the Mariners' championship hopes ended with a 2\u20130 loss to Western Sydney; the game came three days after the team was eliminated from the 2014 AFC Champions League after losing to Japanese club Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1\u20130 to finish last in their group.\n\nIn what was Moss's first pre-season as coach, he did little to change what Arnold had built at the club. The only major changes in the side were with the addition of Senegalese international Malick Man\u00e9 and Hungarian Rich\u00e1rd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1\u20130 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win for the remainder of the year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R&F and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player F\u00e1bio Ferreira also joined the team at the tail end of the season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015\u201316 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.\n\nPost-Arnold Era (2015\u20132020)\n\nThe Mariners had their equal-worst A-League performance to date in the 2015\u201316 season. Their 13 points, the fewest in club history, resulted in a last-place finish, and they set a league record by losing 20 games while winning only 3, a record low for the Mariners. Central Coast allowed 70 goals, the most in league history, and had a goal difference of \u221237, the worst by an A-League team. The Mariners' totals of goals conceded at home and away (32 and 38 respectively) were also A-League records, and they went the entire season without a clean sheet.\n\nIn the 2016 FFA Cup, the Mariners suffered a 2\u20131 loss to Green Gully SC at Green Gully Reserve, becoming just the second A-League team to be eliminated by a state league team in the FFA Cup. Following this loss the club sacked Walmsley on 8 August 2016, with coaching duties in the leadup to the 2016\u201317 season taken up by assistant coach John Hutchinson in a caretaker role.\n\nOn 29 August 2016, Paul Okon was hired as Central Coast's full-time coach, succeeding the sacked Tony Walmsley. In Okon's debut as Central Coast manager, the Mariners drew 3\u20133 with Perth Glory at Nib Stadium, after coming back from 3\u20130 down at half time. Okon achieved his first win as Central Coast manager in his fifth game in charge: a 2\u20131 win over defending champions Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium on 6 November 2016. However, the Mariners ended the season in eighth.\n\nOn 2 August 2017, for the second consecutive year, the Mariners were knocked out of the FFA Cup by a state league team in the first round, after losing 3\u20132 to Blacktown City. During the 2017\u201318 A-League season, the Mariners were in the top four at one stage, but after a run of 11 games without a win the club dropped down the table. Okon resigned as manager with Central Coast in ninth entering the last four rounds of the regular season; Wayne O'Sullivan served as an interim manager following Okon's departure. With a six-game losing streak at the end of the season, the team finished last for the second time in three years. Former Brisbane manager Mike Mulvey was hired by Central Coast in 2018. In the first 21 matches of the 2018\u201319 A-League season, the Mariners won only once. Mulvey was replaced as manager by Alen Stajcic, the former head coach of the Australia women's national team. Despite two wins in his six games as a caretaker manager, the Mariners were unable to avoid finishing at the bottom of the table again. Stajcic was given a three-year contract after the season.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, after playing their last game of the 2019-20 season, the Mariners were put up for sale by owner Michael Charlesworth, putting the club at risk of leaving the Central Coast. If no buyer is found, the Mariners' A-League license will be handed back to the FFA.\n\nResurgence (2020\u2013present)\n\nIn his second full season at the club, Stajcic made some large signings, re-acquiring the services of former player Oliver Bozanic on October 21, 2020 after he had left Scottish club Hearts and signing Costa Rican international Marco Urena on December 22, 2020 after he had left South Korean club Gwangju FC.\n\nThe season had begun well with the Mariners beating local rivals Sydney FC in Sydney for the first time in 7 years. In somewhat of a fairy-tale story, the Mariners sat in first place after 16 rounds but would drop points during the later rounds to finish in third place. This qualified the club for their first finals appearance in 7 years. They would then lose to Macarthur FC 2\u20130 in the elimination finals on 12 June, 2021.\n\nOn 17 June 2021, Stajcic decided to resign from the club. His replacement, Nick Montgomery, was announced on July 7, 2021.\n\nMontgomery's first season continued on the success of last season. He brought the club to its first ever FFA Cup Final where they lost 2\u20131 to Melbourne Victory on 5 February, 2022. The Mariners also finished fifth in the A-League which qualified the club for a second consecutive finals series. They were again knocked out in the elimination finals, this time by Adelaide United, losing 3\u20131 on 15 May, 2022.\n\nOn 10 June, 2022, the club announced that it had retained the services of Montgomery and assistant coach Sergio Raimundo until at least 2025."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/09/central-coast-mariners-from-peak-farce-to-a-league-summit", "page_content": "How about them \u201cSouth Coast Mariners\u201d? The A-League club which made such an impression on new consultant Harry Redknapp he could not quite recall their name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the South Coast Mariners \u2026 they asked me if I would do a bit as an advisor,\u201d the English manager told talkSPORT radio in May 2016. The Mariners had just claimed the wooden spoon, finishing 12 points adrift and with a total three wins and 13 points from 27 games.\n\nExecutive vice chairman Peter Storrie, one of Redknapp\u2019s former West Ham colleagues, had done the wooing and chief executive Mike Charlesworth expected him to visit the Central Coast at least twice during the season and possibly also in the off-season. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cI won\u2019t be going. It\u2019s a long way \u2013 30-odd hours on a plane.\u201d\n\nHow about those Mariners? The team which used to do so much with so little but had slipped into comedic areas and reached the peak of peak A-League. How about the 70 goals conceded in 2015-16 under Tony Walmsley, an unenviable record that got him the sack?\n\nHow about the 4-1 loss to Perth Glory on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2018 remembered not for the unfortunate scoreline but the image of two portable training goals being wheeled onto the field after a goal post on one of the originals snapped mid-match?\n\nHow about Usain Bolt, the champion sprinter with the first touch of a trampoline who came but did not conquer? How about the home defeat to Wellington Phoenix that ended with an 8-2 scoreline and another sacked coach in Mike Mulvey?\n\nNow there is none of that. Gone is the drama and the farce and the toy rifles smuggled into stadiums by small children. In its place, finally, is some football. This season, under Alen Stajcic, is the first time the Mariners have back-to-back league wins since December 2017. It is their best start since their title-winning campaign of 2013-14 of the Graham Arnold era. Five wins and two losses from the opening seven games seems scarcely fathomable, their 15 points to date utterly incongruous with those 13 gleaned from entire season some five years ago.\n\nEach week, A-League observers with a keen sense of history wait for it all to come crashing down, for natural order to resume. Except that it does not, and the football keeps coming. There is still the small matter of the club\u2019s perennially imminent sale the still-empty promise of a budget big enough to climb up off the salary cap\u2019s floor.\n\nStill, how about 19-year-old Alou Kuol, whose mere presence on the field makes magic happen, and whose brace off the bench against Western United on Sunday \u2013 his fourth and fifth goals from seven outings this season \u2013 won the game 3-2 and restored the Mariners\u2019 spot at the top of the table, and whose name is now talked about as an Olyroos candidate for the Olympics?\n\nHow about Danny De Silva\u2019s return to form, and the energy of Josh Nisbet, Jordan Smylie and Daniel Bouman? That tired \u201cgive youth a chance\u201d refrain so often trotted out when money is tight, recruitment poor and injuries plentiful has suddenly taken on a prettier hue.\n\nAnd what about Matt Simon doing things the way he used to back when the club\u2019s winning culture made for premierships, championships and regular finals appearances. He has always been the serial pest opponents love to hate and hate to love, only the Wizard of Woy Woy of 2021 is producing his special kind of sorcery surrounded by some other magic. Last week the club talisman marked his 200th appearance with an assist and penalty goal to help Central Coast to a 3-2 comeback win over Melbourne City. He was chaired off the field by teammates, then cried as he embraced his young daughter, who was born prematurely and to whom he dedicated his display. Days later the 35-year-old opened the scoring against Western United to lay the foundations on which Kuol would build.\n\nAccording to United coach Mark Rudan, Stajcic is actually the resident practitioner of the paranormal. \u201cHe\u2019s a magician as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 he\u2019s turned the place around again,\u201d Rudan said before his side\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s funny [the media] mentioned [the Mariners are] walking on water because right now you\u2019d think Alen Stajcic is Jesus, because he\u2019s done a fantastic job with them. We all know the fantastic job that he did with the Matildas as well.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Stajcic himself was more pragmatic. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic, the magic is hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you put the hard work in sometimes you get rewarded, and we\u2019re in a moment now where the hard work we put in over the pre-season is paying off. The best part is it\u2019s instilled some belief and confidence.\u201d\n\nNothing to write home about, in other words.

Struggling to keep up? Don't worry, the ESPN Australia and New Zealand Football Wrap is here to keep you in the loop.\n\nThe Millions (AND MILLIONS)\n\nFour games into the A-League's 2020-21 campaign and perennial wooden-spooners the Central Coast Mariners are top of the league. Wait, what?\n\nClaiming their third win of the season already, just two off their total for 2019-20, the Mariners upset defending champions Sydney FC last Friday night, running out 2-0 winners thanks to some great goalkeeping, a Ben Warland own-goal in the 53rd minute and Alou Kuol's second golazo of the season in the 74th to go two points clear atop the league.\n\nLuck may have been ridden, but coach Alen Stajcic deserves significant praise for what he's been able to do with his group in the opening month of the season, especially considering all the external noise that has haunted the club. Players such as Ruon Tongyik (one of the best defenders in the league so far), keeper Mark Birighitti, and midfielders Gianni Stensness, Josh Nisbet, Daniel De Silva have all impressed for the Mariners so far.\n\n- A-League on ESPN+: Stream LIVE games and replays (U.S. Only)\n\n- A-League Tipping: Create a comp and test yourself against the best!\n\nOf course, a significant part of the charm that has made Stajcic's side the toast of the A-League isn't just derived from on-field pluck, but also the half-a-decade in the wilderness that preceded their strong start to this season.\n\nCall it human nature or years of Hollywood conditioning, but rare is the individual that goes out and roots for Goliath to beat David, the Killer Whale to get the seal or for the Hawks to beat the Ducks in the Division II Minnesota State Pee-Wee Hockey Championship.\n\nThe Mariners are not a shiny, bells and whistles, glamour club. Instead, it cultivates a community and family focused image instilled with a \"Coastie\" vibe. With a picturesque stadium serving as their backdrop, family photos between players and fans are staged after wins, sauce bottles stalk the touchline, and nobody blinks in the face of the club icon being \"The Wizard of Woy Woy\" Matt Simon.\n\nThis air gives them a certain amount of leeway when it comes to how they present themselves; leading to acerbic, creative, social media friendly and endearing online campaigns involving sauce bottle sponsors and cult-hero mascot Marvin. They're also one of the most forthcoming when it comes to sourcing players and coaches for media opportunities -- vitally important when you're trying to share stories that drive emotional engagement in a club against the backdrop of sustained failure.\n\nInevitably, no amount of viral videos are going to make up for loss after loss after loss after loss, but the work those behind the scenes have done to build the Mariners own, unique appeal during the years of futility is now, deservedly, seeing fruit as hope emerges on the pitch.\n\nWhy Don't You Fix Yourself a Nice Tall Glass of Shut Up Juice\n\nA sense of club over simply a team is vital as football, ultimately, is a form of entertainment; designed to elicit an emotional reaction from its audience by providing not just displays of skill but as a conduit for emotions (good and bad), community, introspection, stories and family. While a certain level of polish is required for the product to function as an aesthetic choice -- and this level of competency can vary depending on the viewer -- once that point has been met the other, more metaphysical factors can keep observers engaged and invested.\n\n- Lewis: Football's silence on January 26 is deafening\n\nIn 2020-21, the A-League and W-League's quality on a technical level is not its greatest ever but, for the first time in a long-time, there is seemingly sufficient narrative and emotion to be conjured to give the zeitgeist hope anyway.\n\nPerhaps thanks to the chaos that has uprooted the competition, games are more prone to dramatic finishes, swings in momentum and unpredictable results. Young players that are increasingly being given a shot by clubs provide new storylines and the magic of unknown potential to invest in. Local coaches are being given opportunities to forge their own path and there are promises of potential reforms under an independent league on the horizon. Even the fragile nature of the A- and W-Leagues -- battered pillar to post by COVID, border restrictions, its own broadcaster, a seemingly disdainful media and more -- has given it an underdog quality in the minds of many.\n\nWith no broadcast deal beyond this season and still without a naming rights sponsor, the pair's situation is still precarious in 2020-21, but there's potential.\n\nAs low as history guides us to set expectations (sorry, getting cynical again) it's incumbent on the league's newly independent controllers to take advantage of this and seek to both maintain and grow their tent: excite those here already, bring back those lost in the journey, welcome others in and, hardest of all, don't mess it up.\n\nThe Most Electrifying Man In Sports-Entertainment\n\nOne of the reasons for this sense of optimism is the aforementioned Kuol. The youngster's personality and performances, as part of the A-League's broader youth movement, has attracted significant attention in recent weeks and his journey from state leagues to the Mariners is worthy of exploration.\n\nDespite not being old enough to get a driver's licence, the teenager netted 28 goals across 41 appearances for Goulburn Valley Suns in senior NPL2 Victoria football in 2018 and 2019, winning a Golden Boot in the latter. A-League opportunities, however, weren't forthcoming and despite earning a call-up to a Young Socceroos camp, he was seemingly set to sign for Melbourne Knights before the Mariners came knocking ahead of 2019-20.\n\nArriving in Gosford with an impressive pedigree but still raw, he was moved carefully through the Mariners academy under Nick Montgomery as he adjusted to life in professional football. But with youth staff encouraging his strengths as he worked on his weaknesses, he duly demonstrated his worth with six goals in the Y-League and earned his senior debut against Western United in January.\n\nThat tempered but still progressive approach -- emphasising what the now-19-year-old could do rather than what he couldn't -- has continued into 2020-21, with the youngster averaging less than 45 minutes across his four starts but still, per FbRef, having more shots on target per 90 than any other player in the league.\n\nThe Mariners have a good thing going in Kuol and, thankfully, appear to know how to shepherd him onward.\n\nIt Doesn't Matter What You Think\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Western's Dylan Pierias and Adelaide United's Mohamed Toure proved matchwinners in their side's wins over Perth Glory and Melbourne Victory and duly found themselves under the limelight.\n\n\"I think he'll go as far as he wants to go, Mohamed,\" Adelaide boss Carl Veart said. \"I think he can go all the way to the top. I haven't seen a 16, 17-year-old in Australia like him, ever.\"\n\nWestern boss Mark Rudan, however, was much more tempered in his willingness to lavish praise: \"The most important thing though, is that sometimes we tend to jump off a little bit too early and we go and praise these young players [Pierias] and pump them up and talk them up.\"\n\nThough sharply contrasting in tone, neither Rudan or Vaert's approach is necessarily the wrong one, for while they were said in open media conferences, one has to bear in mind that they were likely uttered for an audience of one.\n\nDiffering environments, playing responsibilities, training methods, mentoring, or philosophical approaches will all have a massive effect on young player development and, while it is first and foremost on the youngster to put in the work, it is also incumbent on clubs to show adaptability in approach if they are to maximise their asset. Rudan's message of caution for Pierias and Veart's optimism for Toure, while also likely reflective of their own internal demeanors, are seemingly tailored for their players.\n\nFor Pierias, who was much hyped as a teen before struggling for senior football, grounding may serve as his greatest ally as he seeks to consolidate his place and not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Toure's meteoric rise, conversely, hardly needs a stop sign right now.\n\nDifferent strokes.\n\nThe Jabroni-beatin', pie-eatin', Hell-raisin', trailblazin', People's Champ!\n\nAs Ola Toivonen told ESPN's Ante Jukic in 2019-20 on building a connection with Robbie Kruse, \"... it's easy. Robbie's been around and he's a smart player. I like smart players.\"\n\nMaking his first A-League start in 367 days in Victory's 2-1 win over Perth Glory, injuries to Rudy Gestede and Ben Folami pressed Kruse into a central striking role for that contest and although he clearly tired as the game went on, his impact on Victory's moves forward were palpable.\n\nThe 32-year-old's ability to read the ebbs and flows of the game and understand the ramifications of his position, the ball's, his teammate's and his foes are a cut above the A-League's norm, which allows him to create chances that appear simple, but can be anything but even from a more advanced position.\n\n- Melbourne Victory looking to build around fit-again Kruse\n\nIn the 22nd minute of Victory's triumph, for example, he perfectly times a run between the line of Glory central defenders Riley Warland and Darryl Lachman. Recovering after just being unable to connect with Adama Traore's ball over the top in a manner that will allow him to shoot, he attacks retreating left-back Dane Ingham before laying off a backheel for an on-rushing Brandon Lauton that the youngster subsequently sends wide of the far-post.\n\nHow the Socceroo created the chance deserves closer scrutiny. Aware of the trajectory of the ball, himself and that of his teammates within moments of Traore's pass, Kruse, it appears, has already made the decision to lay off the back heel to Lauton before he takes a touch. This then guides his subsequent move to drive Ingham back and open up space and an angle to allow the 20-year-old to get a shot off -- all without looking back at him. Superbly done.\n\nGestede is unlikely to prove as creative a force as Toivonen did when he returns from injury in coming weeks, however he too should enjoy the freedom that comes with playing with Kruse allows. While dropping his Socceroo deeper is an option, Grant Brebner shouldn't discount opportunities to experiment with deploying the two as a pair atop the Victory attack.\n\nThere are two things you can do about it, and that's nothing and like it!\n\nLast year, ESPN charted the history of Ferenc Puskas' arrival to Australia in the late 1980s and subsequent journey as coach of NSL powers South Melbourne.\n\nPart of a long-line of underappreciated legends that fell out of focus in the wake of the 2005 rebooting of the sport, one of the disappointingly few tangible reminders of the Galloping Major's time in Australia stands in the shadow of Melbourne's AAMI Park -- a statue unveiled in 2017.\n\nA gift from the Hungarian Government, it is just one of four statues of the legendary attacker in the world but, as shared on social media in recent days, it has fallen into a state of deep disrepair as a result of what appears to be vandalism.\n\nKnow it's been well covered on twitter but I went to have a look for myself\n\n\n\nFebruary 2017 and January 2021 pic.twitter.com/mPiEueydfM \u2014 mikey (@mikeymifsud) January 28, 2021\n\nFor a city that calls itself the sporting capital of the world, and in which statues of figures from athletics, cricket, and AFL sit immaculately maintained just hundreds of meters away, it is an embarrassment.\n\nCalls from South fans for the statue to be moved to the club's home of Lakeside Stadium have been frequent in recent years, and ESPN understands that there have been discussions at the club and with council around getting the statue formally moved even before the latest state of disrepair was revealed.\n\nIn response to the social media backlash, Victorian state minister Martin Pakula has said that he is working with the Melbourne Olympic Parks Trust to immediately restore the statue. A step worthy of praise, but also the minimum that must be maintained.\n\n\"There is no secret that we would like to bring the Puskas statue home, where he will be respected and adored for the true legend he was,\" South Melbourne FC president Nicholas Maikousis told ESPN. \"We have been working behind the scenes for some time now to make this happen and we hope that it can happen sooner rather than later.\"\n\nIt's a matter of respect. Respect for a man that did so much, touched so many and for the game he held so dear."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/07/a-league-central-coast-mariners-preview", "page_content": "Last season's position: 2nd (Grand final winner)\n\nGuardian writers' prediction: 2nd\n\nGraham Arnold's self-proclaimed 'smallest club in the league' may have conquered Everest with their deserved championship win last season, but now the challenge is to maintain that momentum. In many ways, of course, it is easier to be the hunter rather than the hunted.\n\nArnold though has developed into an astute coach and man-manager who seems to know exactly how to get his side working in harmony both on and off the pitch and, arguably, be better than the sum of their parts. Though they will be written off in some quarters, the Mariners will likely sustain their impetus from last season's breakthrough achievements in the A-League and subsequent AFC Champions League campaign.\n\nArnold has turned the Mariners' weakness \u2013 small budget and limited supporter catchment area \u2013 into a positive of sorts, and there is a level of 'us against them' mentality within the squad. The Mariners work hard at community engagement which adds further to the esprit de corps, while the lack of daily local media scrutiny allows the team to go about their business without some of the strains \u2013 perceived or otherwise \u2013 suffered by the capital city clubs.\n\nFor better and for worse the atmosphere at Gosford's Bluetongue stadium is more Soccer Mum, than terrace tifosi. What other club would pass an oversized farewell card around the members section to acknowledge the retirement of Patrick Zwaanswijk, as if it were the departure of Barry from accounts receivable, rather than a professional footballer?\n\nArnold has inked a new three-year deal which will keep him at the Mariners until at least 2016. It means that the league's smallest club are also reaffirmed as the most steady, with Lawrie McKinna the only previous incumbent at the helm. Once again stability will be a cornerstone of any success the Mariners enjoy.\n\nLike most A-League clubs, Central Coast have lost their fair share of important cogs. Several starters from last year's grand final win are now gone with Pedj Bojic, Bernie Ibini and Mat Ryan all significant losses, as is improving midfielder Oliver Bozanic. Perhaps, though, the most notable absence will be Zwaanswijk whose experience, quality and presence will be sorely missed.\n\nLast season's surprise A-League top goalscorer Daniel McBreen will miss the first weeks of the campaign while he completes loan commitments with his Chinese Super League club. That a journeyman striker like McBreen somehow went from a modest career return in front of goal, to top of the A-League tree is testament to Arnold's rare ability to polish a rough diamond.\n\nRecent years has seen the Mariners cope with player departures better than most. Notably, Arnold has successfully groomed young players into stars almost overnight with Ibini, Mitchell Duke and Trent Sainsbury prime examples. Don't bet against youth squad graduates Michael Neill and Hayden Morton making an impact, nor New Zealander Storm Roux or former Sydney FC player Tom Slater.\n\nAt the other end of the scale experienced Eredivisie defender Marcel Seip has been brought in to fill the considerable void left by his compatriot Zwaanswijk. The success or otherwise of the 31-year-old will be an important component for the Mariners amid relatively inexperienced defensive options which also includes Joshua Rose, Sainsbury, Zac Anderson, Brent Griffiths, Morton, Neill and Roux. Arnold and the Mariners have rarely got it wrong with their imports in recent years and it would be a surprise if Seip is an exception to the rule.\n\nThere is at least surprise, however, on the incoming list with goalkeeper Liam Reddy signed as a replacement for the Club Brugge-bound Ryan. The Mariners have made a point of signing players that fit in with the family culture of the club, yet Reddy has a lengthy rap sheet dating all the back to a fierce punch landed on the chin of former Joeys captain Mark Byrnes a decade ago in the National Soccer League. More recently Reddy departed Sydney FC in unhappy circumstances after consuming alcohol on a trip to New Zealand, and in the interim had an unlikely spell in the Iranian top flight.\n\nThe Mariners have made two other significant recruits, who are more likely to be pivotal to the success of the upcoming campaign. Marcos Flores is one of the major moves of the A-League off-season with the Argentinian set to bring a new level of flair to the Mariners. It will be interesting to see if Arnold uses him as a striker or in a creative midfield role.\n\nThe second key signing is that of local-boy-made-good Matt Simon. The former East Gosford tradie is in many ways a player cast in the image of the average Mariners fan. The striker is more effective than his sometimes agricultural style suggests and a solid goal return saw him earn Socceroo caps in years gone by. Similar in style to McBreen, Simon returns to his hometown club after an indifferent 18-month stint with K-League side Chunnam Dragons.\n\nWith their settled and pragmatic approach, the Mariners are likely to start the season in more cohesive fashion than many of their rivals. Provided they avoid injuries to key personnel, expect Arnold's men to be there or thereabouts at the business end of the season."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/450234", "page_content": "Baba Diawara inspired a 3-2 comeback win for Adelaide United over Central Coast Mariners to lift them off the bottom of the A-League table for the first time since January.\n\nThe Senegalese striker bagged a brace and Dylan McGowan scored another in Gosford on Saturday, giving the defending champions a first away win this season and improving their odds of avoiding the wooden spoon.\n\nIt was a match in which the pendulum swung unpredictably, and Kwabena Appiah's first-half goal appeared to give the Mariners a solid platform on which to keep their slim finals chances alive.\n\nRoy O'Donovan converted a late penalty for the hosts to round off the night's scoring.\n\nFabio Ferreira was unlucky not to score soon after the half-hour mark when he fed Appiah, continued his run past two defenders and then unleashed a low effort that Eugene Galekovic managed to keep out.\n\nAdelaide then fashioned an opening, only for a lunging Diawara to somehow fail to get a boot on Sergio Cirio's cross as an open net beckoned.\n\nIn the very same minute, a defensive lapse allowed the Mariners to take the lead on the eve of half-time.\n\nStorm Roux pounced on a poor clearance and curled in a cross from the right, which Appiah met with a glancing header that went into the net, past the diving Galekovic, in the goalkeeper's 250th A-League appearance.\n\nBut Adelaide returned from the break with a vengeance and buried three goals within 10 minutes to take control.\n\nDiawara finished from close range on 56 minutes, after Liam Rose miscontrolled a clearance, and McGowan promptly put Adelaide in the lead with a thumping header from a corner.\n\nDiawara's fourth goal in three games put the result beyond doubt, a near-carbon copy of his teammate's headed goal from a corner, to cap a good night of set pieces.\n\nThe hosts refused to throw in the towel and Roux cut a swathe through Adelaide's defence and forced Galekovic into a diving save from the top of the penalty box.\n\nA Kim Jae-Sung handball gave Central Coast a 90th-minute lifeline and O'Donovan slotted the ensuing penalty.\n\nFerreira will have wished his late shot was not wide of the post as the defeat left the Mariners bottom with three rounds remaining in the regular season."}]}
