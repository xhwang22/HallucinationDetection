In 1601 he met the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci, who was one of the first Westerners allowed into the interior of China. To gain acceptance, Ricci had first learned the Chinese language and culture, which in turn enabled him to spread knowledge of Western science and religion. Li was greatly attracted by Ricci\u2019s teachings, although he only consented to be baptized by him in 1610, shortly before Ricci\u2019s death. Li was regarded as one of the most important Christian converts in the late Ming dynasty Roman Catholic mission.\n\nBritannica Quiz Faces of Science\n\nLi began his collaboration with the Jesuits by engraving and printing numerous copies of Ricci\u2019s world map, which altered many Chinese views of world geography.

This book systematically introduced European-style mathematical notation, while Li included complementary elements from traditional Chinese mathematics. Li also wrote a short treatise on geometry dictated by Ricci.

Based on Aristotle\u2019s On the Heavens (4th century bc), this book was originally used as a textbook at the College of Coimbra in Portugal. In addition, Li translated European logic treatises. He also brought together and published a series of books composed by the Jesuits with Chinese help, Tianxue chuhan (1629; \u201cFirst Collection of Writings on Heavenly Learning\u201d), that included 20 Western scientific and religious titles.

We also grill the highly informed senior tax officials who participate in our surveys on their favored indicators, like diesel-fuel consumption, and collect their thoughts on emerging economic trends for our subscribers.

That locks up resources by prolonging the lives of doomed ventures and making it difficult for VCs and employees to know where best to invest their money or labor. The Reason Founders aren\u2019t bad people. But when they lie, they fall back on flawed justifications, such as the need to protect investors and employees. They might tell themselves that because all entrepreneurs stretch the truth, they must do so to stay competitive. The Solution Moral philosophy can help founders remain truthful. They can dream big, but they must be honest about the evidence and assumptions underpinning their vision. And they should seek out partners, investors, and others who will help them be their best selves.\n\nIn the early days of Vice Media, cofounder Shane Smith sent a few copies of the Montreal-based start-up\u2019s fledgling publication to a record store in Miami and a skate shop in Los Angeles so that the company could tell advertisers its readership was distributed across North America\u2014an act befitting the monicker \u201cBullshitter Shane,\u201d reportedly bestowed on him by a friend and colleague.\n\nSuch chicanery is too common in the start-up world. The norms of entrepreneurship encourage founders to be hustlers and evangelists for their companies. Indeed, legendary founders are celebrated for their ability to inspire others, even if that means stretching the truth. Consider Steve Jobs, the quintessential start-up pitchman. Early Apple employees describe him as able to \u201cconvince anyone of practically anything.\u201d In the words of engineer Andy Hertzfeld, Jobs had a \u201creality distortion field, a confounding m\u00e9lange of a charismatic rhetorical style, an indomitable will, and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a vital skill for founders, who must persuade their audiences to temporarily suspend disbelief and see the opportunity the entrepreneur sees: a world that could be but is not now. However, reality distortion is a slippery slope. Enthusiasm can lead to exaggeration, exaggeration to falsity, and falsity to fraud. This descent is embodied in Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder and Jobs devotee who allegedly deceived investors and customers by marketing bogus blood tests.\n\nThe Holmes case is rare; few entrepreneurs face criminal fraud charges, as Holmes did when this article went to press. But lesser indiscretions are common, including obfuscation, lies of omission, exaggeration, embellishment, evasion, bluffs, and half-truths. And they come at a cost. Deception results in market inefficiencies; it locks up resources by prolonging the lives of doomed ventures and making it difficult for VCs and employees to know where best to invest their money or labor. We believe it also takes a personal toll on founders, given the debilitating stress that often accompanies lying.\n\nReality distortion is a slippery slope. Enthusiasm can lead to exaggeration, exaggeration to falsity, and falsity to fraud.\n\nHow can we drive deception out of the start-up culture while also encouraging entrepreneurs to take risks and dream big? We have spent decades researching this question, and we bring a multidisciplinary approach to answering it. One of us (Kyle) is a successful founder turned academic; one (Jon) teaches business and philosophy; and two (Tom and Laura) hold academic appointments focused on ethical entrepreneurship. In this article we first explore why deception is so prevalent among entrepreneurs and then explain why common justifications for it are invalid. Finally, we suggest guidelines for behavior that can help entrepreneurs be both successful and honest\u2014to the benefit of all.\n\nWhy Entrepreneurs Lie\n\nThe Chicago economist Frank Knight was one of the first scholars to study the role of entrepreneurs in the modern capitalist system. In his 1921 book Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, he distinguishes entrepreneurs from other businesspeople by their willingness to act in the face of uncertainty. Of course, established businesses face uncertainty too\u2014but start-ups must navigate through a particularly dense fog. Entrepreneurs often don\u2019t know whether their product will work, how it will be manufactured, who the customers will be, or how they can be reached. For Knight, an entrepreneur is someone who, facing all this uncertainty, acts while others dither.\n\nBut action alone is insufficient. An entrepreneur needs others\u2019 help and must therefore be a persuasive cheerleader\u2014when pitching VCs for funding, wooing prospective employees away from cushy jobs, persuading customers to take a chance on a new product, and instilling confidence in the team amid the start-up\u2019s vacillating fortunes.\n\nThat\u2019s the first reason some entrepreneurs are less than truthful: They transgress because they have many opportunities to do so. More than most other businesspeople, they are always \u201con.\u201d\n\nThe second reason is that entrepreneurs have a lot on the line. As a group they stand to gain great wealth, but it\u2019s unevenly distributed. Research shows that the median entrepreneur has poor risk-adjusted returns\u2014statistically, founders would be better off working at an established company or holding a diversified index fund than holding their own equity. But what the median lacks, the maximum makes up for. A small percentage of entrepreneurs become enormously wealthy. Indeed, entrepreneurs dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s richest people.\n\nA thousand things must go right to earn such outsize rewards, and in any one meeting, a founder\u2019s fortunes might balance on a knife\u2019s edge. Failure can mean not just missing an enormous windfall but also letting down friends, family, employees, and investors. With stakes that high, it can be tempting to bend the truth.\n\nMark Laita\n\nThe third reason entrepreneurs are prone to deception is that it\u2019s relatively easy for them to get away with it. Entrepreneurship has a great deal of what economists call \u201cinformation asymmetry.\u201d Typically, founders lead private, closely held companies and possess lots of information that others\u2014investors, customers, employees\u2014don\u2019t have. The leaders of public companies have extensive transparency requirements and are under intense scrutiny; if they tell a lie, many people are in a position to discover it. But even in a venture-backed start-up with board oversight, only a tiny circle of people are privy to the company\u2019s internal workings, so deceptions can easily evade detection or go unchallenged. And because start-ups are, on average, staying private longer than they used to, such opacity is increasingly common and persistent.\n\nNone of this is to say that entrepreneurs are less ethical than other businesspeople. What little research is available suggests that on average, they have higher moral standards than corporate managers do. But the pressures that might tempt them to be less than completely truthful are enormous\u2014and decades of psychological study have shown that even people with high moral standards are likely to transgress in contexts in which ethical lapses are common and tolerated.\n\nHow Entrepreneurs Rationalize Their Lies\n\nMost founders who shade the truth under such pressures probably don\u2019t see themselves in a poor light. They often justify their actions through some combination of three rationalizations that are closely related to common ethical theories about what makes actions right or wrong. But each falls apart under even casual philosophical scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d\n\nIn 2018 Entrepreneur interviewed Gary Hirshberg, who built Stonyfield Farm from a two-person (and seven-cow) side hustle into one of the world\u2019s leading purveyors of organic yogurt. Stonyfield\u2019s success didn\u2019t always seem destined. Hirshberg recounted a series of dire moments and the deceptions that saved the company, including lies to vendors and a loan officer at the Small Business Administration. He offered several rationales, all common among entrepreneurs and related to well-known theories of ethics.\n\n\u201cI think lying, if we want to call it that, which I guess is what it should be called, for the common good, because in the end it didn\u2019t help the vendors for me to go under either, is OK as long as you ultimately do deliver,\u201d Hirshberg explained. This \u201cends justify the means\u201d rationalization harks back to the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, according to which an action should be judged solely on the basis of its consequences. \u201c[I]t is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong,\u201d Bentham wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m protecting my people.\u201d\n\nA variant of the \u201cends justify the means\u201d rationalization, this was invoked by Hirshberg as well. \u201cYou do whatever the heck you have to do to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were fighting for employees\u2019 jobs and our mothers\u2019 and mothers-in-laws\u2019 and friends\u2019 investments. Fighting for our lives. And I think anything goes, as long as you\u2019re not injuring anybody.\u201d Friends, family, and early equity investors and employees are often prioritized over stakeholders appearing on the scene later and at a further remove\u2014in Hirshberg\u2019s case, the SBA and his vendors.\n\nOf course, entrepreneurs can\u2019t know whether their lying will lead to better outcomes for their stakeholders or result in the greatest happiness for the greatest number. They are subject to forces beyond their control, and many who lie \u201cfor the common good\u201d will see their ventures fail. When that happens, it comes at the expense of stakeholders who were tricked into supporting them or harmed by risks they weren\u2019t given full and honest knowledge of.\n\n\u201cEverybody does it.\u201d\n\nHirshberg said of his vendors, \u201cIt\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t seen it before.\u201d According to this view, reality distortion is merely part of the game, like \u201cpuffery\u201d in advertising and bluffing in poker; it\u2019s not prohibited by the rules, and each person playing is responsible for knowing those rules. Sometimes the obfuscation is vague: During tech bubbles, some start-ups with only a small IT component tried to classify themselves as tech companies, because that would boost their valuation. Other times the fudging is more explicit, as when founders exaggerate anticipated revenue because they expect that investors will discount their numbers. In that scenario, a founder might reason, I have to say we will generate $50 million a year, because investors are going to discount the figure and hear $5 million a year; everybody knows that. Founders might also massage their financial models to produce outcomes they think VCs expect: a 10x return, a multibillion-dollar market. Those who don\u2019t exaggerate may rightly fear putting themselves at a disadvantage.\n\nMark Laita\n\nHirshberg is a successful entrepreneur, a prolific philanthropist, and no doubt a well-meaning soul. His comments capture the pressures all entrepreneurs feel and the rationales that can lead them to shade the truth. But they ultimately fail to hold water; they are excuses rather than sound arguments. They shift the responsibility for decision-making onto the supposedly uncontrollable and sometimes immoral norms of abstract institutions. \u201cBusiness is business,\u201d founders might say, absolving themselves of murky choices. But in our view, the business and start-up domains are no different from the rest of life, and they should be governed by the same ethics.\n\nThe Honest Entrepreneur\n\nMost entrepreneurs want to engender trust in others and prove themselves worthy of that trust. Few aspire to be scoundrels. Evidence suggests that for the vast majority of people, lying and deception cause considerable stress. For example, studies have shown that stress related to ongoing ethical dilemmas decreases job satisfaction and is a leading cause of burnout.\n\nThere is a better way, and it involves fostering virtue in all aspects of life, including the professional realm. In this Aristotelian worldview, actions are right if they are what a good (virtuous) person would do. In what follows we offer two practices from exemplary entrepreneurs whom we\u2019ve had the pleasure of teaching, hosting, or collaborating with.\n\nShow your evidence and assumptions.\n\nWhen entrepreneurs paint a picture of what could be, that picture is not fabricated wholesale; it\u2019s an evidence-based guess. The evidence consists of the entrepreneurs\u2019 experiences, primary data collected through experiments, traction gained, and third-party data\u2014in short, things they know. The guesses are things they don\u2019t yet know but believe or hope to be true.\n\nNot everyone draws the same conclusions from such inputs. Entrepreneurs owe transparency and truthfulness to those being asked to commit themselves or their resources to the venture. Of course, they should present a compelling vision. But they should also present the evidence and assumptions that support that vision. The principle is similar to the instructions given by eighth-grade algebra teachers: Show your work. A good venture capitalist will question a founder\u2019s assumptions at pitch meetings\u2014but not all VCs do, especially if they\u2019re courting a start-up that\u2019s in high demand. And prospective employees, partners, and other stakeholders often aren\u2019t given an opportunity to closely examine the evidence and assumptions and form their own conclusions about the company, team, or product they\u2019re being asked to support.\n\nBeing compelling and being forthright can seem at odds with each other. In some contexts, caveats and discussions of risks are inappropriate. A founder who lucks into an elevator ride with an investor simply conveys the compelling story. And in casual conversation, what\u2019s relevant is the vision. Leaving out the risks and the downside potential is expected and not in any way deceptive.\n\nBut in a context where analysis and evaluation of the opportunity are the focus, such as a formal pitch or a conversation with a potential hire, entrepreneurs must articulate evidence and assumptions and yet still be persuasive. We propose a \u201cconclusion sandwich.\u201d The best entrepreneurs begin and end with their conclusion\u2014the extrapolation\u2014 and place their evidence and assumptions in the middle. A founder might say, \u201cWe\u2019ll make about $X million next year in gross revenue. Let me show you the evidence we have and the assumptions that support this.\u201d After running through the calculations, the founder might finish by asserting, \u201cTherefore, we believe $X million is a reasonable estimate.\u201d Listeners won\u2019t miss the takeaway but are free to reach their own conclusions.\n\nSurround yourself with people who will help you be your best.\n\nA mountain of psychology research shows that our social circles influence our morality. Acts that those around us commit or condone become acceptable to us over time, while acts they condemn become unacceptable. So wise entrepreneurs surround themselves with cofounders, mentors, board members, and investors who will help them become their best selves.\n\nInvestors are particularly important in this regard. An entrepreneur might launch a handful of ventures in a lifetime, but the most experienced investors participate in hundreds. They witness the ordeals of many founders in many markets over many years and accumulate wisdom that founders can\u2019t replicate. A good investor is able to \u201cpattern match,\u201d is sensitive to the moral dimensions of particular ordeals, and knows what courses of action are \u201cright\u201d and have the best outcomes. The best investors help entrepreneurs heed the better angels of their nature.\n\nWise entrepreneurs surround themselves with cofounders, mentors, board members, and investors who will help them become their best selves.\n\nThe wrong investors can be a disaster. This is especially apparent among those who prioritize growth above all else. Consider the pairing of WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann with SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. In their first meeting, Son is said to have expressed dissatisfaction with Neumann\u2019s level of intensity and urged him to be even crazier. Neumann obliged. The ensuing SoftBank-funded expansion of WeWork was outlandish, to say the least; it included self-dealing (Neumann trademarked the word \u201cWe\u201d and sold it to the company for nearly $6 million) and extravagant expenditures (a $60 million private jet). WeWork became the United States\u2019 most valuable unicorn, fueled in part by Neumann\u2019s messianic charisma and powerful reality distortion field. It reportedly took just moments for him to persuade investors to fund his vision. He was known, and is now lampooned, for over-the-top claims about the company (for example, framing it not as a real estate subletter but as a \u201cstate of consciousness\u201d) and what it could accomplish (solving the problem of orphaned children, for one). Still, Neumann\u2019s WeWork nearly reached its IPO before imploding. (As of this writing, a far more modest incarnation of the firm, under new leadership, was preparing to go public in a merger with a special-purpose acquisitions company.)\n\n. . .\n\nIt may be tempting to think that departures from the truth are just part of doing business\u2014that we operate in a no-holds-barred capitalist arena in which all contestants are responsible for their own welfare and know the rules of the game. Unfortunately, such cynicism feeds on itself; when we encounter dishonesty or scandal, we become disillusioned and are more likely to engage in such behavior ourselves.\n\nEntrepreneurs face particular pressures to lie. Vying for a fixed pool of VC money, often working to secure returns for friends and family, and chasing dreams of greatness, they may feel they will be disadvantaged if they pursue their ventures with a vigorous dedication to the truth. Understanding the forces that tempt them to lie and the tactics that may help them remain virtuous can reduce the deception that\u2019s all too common in this crucial part of the economy."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john.liscio/2231476", "page_content": "John Liscio\n\njournalist\n\n1949 (age 51)\n\nHe served in the Marine Corps before becoming a financial writer and analyst in the late 1970s.

DEVITO identified properties for sale, orchestrated the purchase of the properties, and performed construction work at the properties.\n\nIn addition, from January 2003 through February 2005, DEVITO engaged in a scheme to defraud insurance companies by submitting false and misleading insurance claims and supporting documents for water damage caused by broken pipes at several of the homes he and his co-conspirators had purchased as part of the mortgage fraud scheme.\n\nDEVITO obstructed justice in connection with his sentencing in 2003 in Manhattan federal court for racketeering and mortgage fraud in an earlier case. Specifically, DEVITO submitted false and misleading information regarding the value of his assets and his personal net worth following his sale of a property located in Purchase, New York.\n\nDEVITO, 45, pleaded guilty before Judge JONES on July 22, 2008. In addition to his 51-month prison term, Judge JONES ordered a supervised release of 3 years and ordered DEVITO to forfeit a total of $1.4 million.\n\nDEVITO's co-defendant JOHN LISCIO was sentenced on March 31, 2009, to 12 months in prison and three years of supervised release. LISCIO was also ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution. DEVITO's other co-defendant, ROBERT DIDONATO, was sentenced on April 13, 2009, to 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release. DIDONATO was also ordered to pay $18,000 in restitution and to forfeit $112,000.

Depending on the type of analyst job, the duties can vary quite a bit.\n\nSome financial analysts work in the securities industry analyzing stocks, bonds, and other securities for banks, brokerages, money management firms, and other organizations. These financial analysts typically develop expertise in a narrow category of stocks or bonds, such as Canadian corporate bonds or technology stocks, for example.\n\nOther financial analysts work for large corporations, analyzing internal financial data and producing financial plans, revenue expense projections, and recommendations to inform budget and investment decisions by company executives. Nonprofit organizations and government bodies also employ financial analysts in this type of work.\n\nKey Takeaways A financial analyst culls data to help companies make business decisions or investors take action, such as to buy or sell a stock or other security.\n\nThey weigh macroeconomic and microeconomic issues, and company fundamentals to make predictions about firms, sectors, and industries.\n\nA bachelor's degree in something math or finance-related is a given and moving up to the senior level means getting certifications and/or an MBA.\n\nA recent college graduate can expect to start at the junior level, under the supervision of a more senior analyst.\n\nSomeone with a few years of experience, several key certifications, and an MBA from a prestigious university can move up to a senior role.\n\n3:20 Rise of the Robo Advisors\n\nCareer Paths\n\nA recent bachelor's degree graduate seeking to become a financial analyst can expect to begin in a junior position under the guidance of a senior analyst. After several years of experience, many junior financial analysts consider returning to graduate school for advanced degrees.\n\nWhile junior analysts are not barred from advancement, continuing progression to positions with greater responsibility usually necessitates returning to school. A graduate with a master's degree can expect to begin work as a senior financial analyst or rise to the position very quickly.\n\nAn advanced financial analyst position generally requires an MBA degree with an appropriate subject focus or a master's degree in finance.\n\nWith greater experience and expertise, a senior financial analyst can continue into a supervisory position. A senior analyst in the securities industry often moves up to become a portfolio manager or a fund manager overseeing a team of senior analysts.\n\nThere may also be an opportunity to enter a senior management role. In the corporate world, senior analysts can become treasury managers supervising working groups within their departments. A standout performer may rise through the ranks to become a chief financial officer (CFO) or chief investment officer (CIO) responsible for all of the company's financial activities.\n\nEducation Requirements\n\nWhile a bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement for an entry-level financial analyst position, data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that a master's degree is generally preferred for permanent and advanced positions in the field.\n\n$95,570 The median annual income for financial analysts of all experience levels, according to May 2021 data (the latest available) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nA variety of undergraduate subjects are generally accepted by employers, including business fields such as finance, accounting, and economics. Due to the importance of advanced quantitative skills in this field, bachelor's degrees in statistics, mathematics, engineering, and physics are not uncommon among financial analysts; however, applicants with these degrees can benefit from business coursework, especially in accounting and finance.\n\nOther Qualifications and Skills\n\nSome financial analysts must obtain an appropriate license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is responsible for writing and enforcing rules for securities firms and brokers operating in the United States.\n\nLicensure generally requires sponsorship from the employing firm, so most financial analysts only obtain a license after starting a job; however, long-term employment may be contingent on successful licensure.\n\nMany employers expect financial analysts to pursue certification in the field. The preeminent certification in the field is the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation awarded by the CFA Institute.\n\nIt is available to financial analysts with at least three full years of qualifying work experience. Thus, it is generally considered a qualification for advancement to more senior financial analyst positions. Qualifying for the designation also requires a bachelor's degree and a passing score on a series of three exams administered by the CFA Institute.\n\nThe hiring of financial analysts is expected to grow by 9% between 2021 and 2031, slightly faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nFinancial analysts are often expected to present and explain their work to clients and superiors, so strong communication and presentation skills are crucial. Analytical and critical thinking skills are essential in evaluating alternatives and settling on a final recommendation.\n\nIn addition to knowledge of statistics, mathematics, and finance, experience using software tools associated with these disciplines is valuable. While it's not uncommon for employers to use highly specialized technology and proprietary tools that aren't available outside the firm, learning and relying on complicated quantitative software provides skills that translate well to other systems.\n\nWhat Are the Main Skills that a Financial Analyst Needs? The main skills that a financial analyst needs include critical thinking, analytical skills, presentation skills, an understanding of financial and economic terms, financial modeling skills, understanding of financial regulations, and being personable.\n\nHow Do You Pursue a Career As a Financial Analyst? To pursue a career as a financial analyst one needs to obtain a bachelor's degree. A degree in finance, economics, business management, statistics, or related fields is beneficial but not a requirement. An internship during college years will help secure a full-time financial analyst position. After some years of experience, further education may be required, such as an MBA or CFA qualification.\n\nAre Financial Analysts Rich? In general, financial analysts are well paid which can lead to them becoming rich. The average salary for a financial analyst in 2021 (the latest data available) was $95,570. Depending on the job, the firm, location, and the years of experience, the salary can be much higher and continues to grow over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA job as a financial analyst can be a demanding and also lucrative one. There are many career paths financial analysts can choose, from working in investment banks to working in nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe majority of financial analyst careers will require a bachelor's degree with on-the-job training to learn the complexities of the job and industry. Depending on the specific path an individual chooses, further requirements may be needed, such as securities licenses or other degrees."}, {"url": "https://www.wikizero.com/En/John_Liscio", "page_content": "John Liscio (1949 \u2013 November 29, 2000) was an American journalist covering finance and the economy as well as an independent financial analyst.
