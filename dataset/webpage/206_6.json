Thomas Biagi (IT) and BMW Team Italy \u2013 ROAL Motorsport secured another title for BMW: In Vallelunga (IT) third and fifth in the final two rounds of the national Italian Superstars series were sufficient for Biagi to defend his overall lead in his BMW M3 and win the championship at the season finale. Biagi was crowned champion with 178 points, followed by Max Pigoli (IT) and Luigi Ferrara (IT) with 147 and 134 points respectively.\n\nThe title rounded off a successful season for Biagi, which included two wins, a pole position and five fastest laps. The 34-year-old also goes into the finale of the International Superstars Series in Kyalami (ZA) on 28th November 2010 with an excellent chance of picking up another title: Biagi leads the competition on 147 points, and is followed once again by Pigoli and Ferrara.\n\n\u201cThis is a dream come true for me,\u201d said Biagi after the two successful races in Vallelunga. \u201cThis championship was new territory for me, and the car was obviously very different to drive compared to those I am familiar with from GT1 and LMP2. I found my feet quickly, however, and was competitive from the word go. BMW Team Italy has worked very hard since the winter tests. Everyone in the team contributed to this success. Roberto Ravaglia, who I always admired as a driver, also played a key role. He is also an outstanding team principal. Our focus now turns to the final in Kyalami, where there is another title up for grabs.\u201d\n\nRoberto Ravaglia, who won the DTM and World Touring Car Championship as a driver for BMW, said: \u201cThis victory is one of the two objectives we set at the beginning of the year. We are also in a very promising position in the international series. With just one round to go, we are close to ending the season with the best possible result.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can be extremely satisfied,\u201d added Umberto Grano, Sportive Activities Manager at BMW Italy. \u201cBMW Italy believed in the growth of the Superstars Series. The fact that there were well over 20,000 fans again in Vallelunga is a just reward for the work put in by the organisers.

Biagi, who drives a BMW M3 for BMW Team Italy (ROAL Motorsport), finished third and fifth in the two races to secure the Italian title.\n\nThe first of the two races at Vallelunga was won by multiple touring car champion Fabrizio Giovanardi in the impressive Porsche Panamera, run by N.Technology. The second race was won by Audi Sport Italia driver Alberto Cola. Having entered the weekend leading the standings, Biagi's results ensured he would beat Mercedes drivers Max Pigoli and Luigi Ferrara to the title.\n\n34-year-old Biagi won two of the sixteen races that made up the Italian Superstars Championship for 2010, also taking a pole position and five fastest laps. The Vallelunga races also counted towards the International Superstars Series, which concludes at Kyalami in South Africa on 28 November.

This will be the fourth time this course will host the vaunted major, placing it second in total PGAs only behind last year\u2019s host, Southern Hills.\n\nJust one year ago, Justin Thomas bested Will Zalatoris in a down-to-the-wire playoff in Oklahoma, which only occurred due to a 72nd-hole collapse by 54-hole leader Mito Pereira. A drive by the Chilean directly into a water hazard kept JT and Willy Z alive, with Thomas ultimately coming back from seven strokes down to start the final round.\n\nThis was the first major to require extra holes since the 2017 Masters. That was 19 consecutive majors that only needed 72 holes, the longest streak in PGA Tour history.\n\nIt should be an excellent second major of the season after a Jon Rahm Masters barnburner back in April. Below, we'll answer any and all frequently asked questions you may have about the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill.\n\nWhen and where is the PGA Championship being held in 2023?\n\nThis year\u2019s PGA will take place at Oak Hill, which has gone through quite the renovation over the last decade or so. The East Course has been essentially overhauled and will feature a drastically different look due to a large removal of trees, recontoured bunkers and major work to three holes, including the elimination of one altogether.\n\nArchitect Andrew Green revised the Donald Ross-designed course and added 200 yards of additional teeing space, bringing the total championship distance to just under 7,400 yards.\n\n\"The new dynamics give Oak Hill\u2019s membership more freedom to play, to hit a variety of shots and recover,\u201d wrote Derek Duncan, Golf Digest\u2019s Architecture Editor. \u201cIt should also prove an entertaining test for the professionals, who will be tempted to flex their muscles. If the remodel helps the East Course get back to crowning champions like Nicklaus, Trevino and Cary Middlecoff (winner of the 1956 Open) and their 27 combined major titles like it used to, the club won\u2019t have to do anything more to entice the USGA or PGA of America to come back.\u201d\n\nHas Oak Hill hosted any other majors other than the upcoming PGA Championship?\n\nEven with the historic redesign, it\u2019s not as if Oak Hill hasn\u2019t been critical in the golf landscape since its inception back in the early 20th century. The course has hosted many a major tournament from 1949\u2019s U.S. Amateur to the Senior PGA Championship in 2019. After the completion of 2008\u2019s Senior PGA Championship, Oak Hill Country Club became the first club in the United States to have hosted all six of the men's major championships that move around the country.\n\nIn terms of majors, the New York course has hosted three U.S. Opens (1956, 1968 and 1989) and three PGA Championships (1980, 2003 and 2013). The last PGA before the upcoming event featured Jason Dufner\u2019s only major. Dufner held off Jim Furyk by two shots with a two-under 68 on Sunday. Tiger Woods finished T-40, never breaking par his entire four-day run in Rochester.\n\nWho conducts the PGA Championship?\n\nThe Professional Golfers\u2019 Association (PGA) of America conducts the event.\n\nAre the PGA Tour and the PGA of America different?\n\nYes, the PGA Tour and the PGA of America have been independent of one another since 1968. The PGA Tour is an elite organization of tournament professionals, while the PGA of America is made up of club and teaching professionals who work at on- and off-course golf facilities around the country (and the world).\n\nWhen and where was the first PGA Championship played? And who won?\n\nThe first PGA Championship was played in 1916 at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, N.Y. England\u2019s Jim Barnes won, 1 up, over Jock Hutchinson.\n\nWait, 1 up \u2026 so was the PGA Championship a match-play event at one time?\n\nYes, from 1916 to 1957, the PGA Championship was contested as match play with a stroke-play qualifier. During the course of the championship, it was not uncommon for players to play more than 200 holes in seven days. Starting in 1958, the PGA Championship switched to the standard 72-hole, stroke-play format. Dow Finsterwald won the first stroke-play version of the event in 1958 at Llanerch Country Club in Havertown, Pa.\n\nHow many players are in the field?\n\nThere will be 156 players in the field at this year's PGA Championship. 18 of those are LIV golfers from reigning Open champion Cam Smith to two-time PGA champ Brooks Koepka to 2020 Masters winner Dustin Johnson to 2020 U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau to six-time major champ Phil Mickelson.\n\nThe PGA Championships uses a points formula that is finalized after the Wells Fargo Championship. It takes the top 70 who are not otherwise exempt, plus extra spots for the winners of past major championships plus the top 20 finishers in the PGA of America\u2019s annual club pro tournament. The PGA of America can randomly invite any player, and Joel Dahmen got such an invite this year.\n\nSergio Garcia will not contend for the Wanamaker Trophy at Oak Hill, as the 43-year-old Spaniard failed to qualify for the championship. This will be the second major Garcia will miss since his major contention began back at 1999's Open Championship. The only other that he missed was the 2020 Masters, which he had to skip due to testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nHow do club professionals earn one of the 20 spots?\n\nThe PGA of America fills the 20 spots held for club professionals for the top finishers at the PGA Professional Championship, which finished in early May at Twin Warriors & Santa Ana Golf Clubs in New Mexico.\n\nHas a club professional ever won the PGA Championship?\n\nNot in the modern era of the PGA Tour. According to the PGA, the best performance since 1970 by a club professional playing in the PGA Championship was a third-place finish in 1971 by Tommy Bolt, a former tour pro who had retired from the tour. The last top 10 also came from a former tour pro\u2014a very famous one\u2014turned club professional: Sam Snead in 1973. Only one club professional has finished inside the top 20 in the last 30 years, Jay Overton in 1988 at Oak Tree. Prior to 2021, only three had made the cut in the previous seven years: Ben Kern at Bellerive in 2018, Omar Uresti at Quail Hollow in 2017 and Brian Gaffney at Whistling Straits in 2015. But in 2021 at Kiawah Island, two clubs pros made the weekend: Ben Cook, who tied for 44th, and Brad Marek, who finished 78th.\n\nCan amateurs play in the PGA Championship?\n\nThe PGA Championship is limited to professionals only, meaning amateurs cannot qualify.\n\nWhat does the winner of PGA Championship receive?\n\nThe PGA champion receives the Wanamaker Trophy, the largest trophy of the four men\u2019s majors. In 2022, the winner also received a top prize of $2.7 million, 18 percent of the $15 million purse. (The PGA of America hasn't announced what the purse is for 2023.) Traditionally the winner also receives automatic invites into all three of the other majors and the Players Championship for the next five years, PGA Tour membership for the next five years and DP World Tour (formerly the European Tour) membership for the next seven years. They also become eligible to compete in the PGA Championship for life.\n\nWho won the 2022 PGA Championship?\n\nMaddie Meyer/PGA of America\n\nWhat looked like Mito Pereira\u2019s major quickly became anything but after a tough drive on the 18th hole found a water hazard and ultimately knocked the 54-hole leader out of contention.\n\nOut of his woes emerged Justin Thomas and Will Zalatoris who battled in a three-hole aggregate playoff to break the tie at the top. JT tied the largest comeback in the major\u2019s history, as he started Sunday behind seven strokes of the lead and he went on take home $2.7 million winner\u2019s share of the $15 million purse.\n\nCameron Young, Matt Fitzpatrick, Tommy Fleetwood, Chris Kirk and Rory McIlroy rounded out the top eight spots.\n\nWill Phil Mickelson be in this year's field to \u201cdefend\u201d his title?\n\nAfter a hell of a run at the Masters, finishing tied for second, Phil Mickelson will return at this year\u2019s PGA Championship. It\u2019ll be his first time at this tournament since winning it in 2021. A lot has happened since then, including a thing called LIV Golf. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it.\n\nLefty is one of 18 LIV Golfers in this event due to their placement in the top 100 in the Official World Golf Ranking. Justin Thomas and Mickelson will both be defending their PGA wins with Phil looking to win his third.\n\nWho has won the most PGA Championships?\n\nJack Nicklaus and Walter Hagen hold the record for most PGA Championship victories with five. Nicklaus also holds the record for most runner-up finishes in the PGA Championship with four.\n\nTiger Woods makes his putt for par and to win the PGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2007. Montana Pritchard/PGA of America\n\nHow many PGA Championships has Tiger Woods won?\n\nTiger Woods has won four PGA Championships, the last coming in 2007 at Southern Hills.\n\nWho are the most famous golfers not to have won the PGA Championship?\n\nThere are three players in golf history who have won the other three men\u2019s major championships (the Masters, the U.S. Open and the Open Championship) but have not completed the career Grand Slam by winning the PGA. They are Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson and Jordan Spieth. At the time of writing this, Spieth\u2019s play in the upcoming PGA Championship is in doubt due to a left wrist injury that forced him to WD from the AT&T Byron Nelson. It\u2019s supposed to be assessed week to week, according to Spieth and his doctors, and we\u2019ll see soon enough if he\u2019ll make the trip to Rochester to try to win that final major he needs to complete the Career Grand Slam.\n\nWho is the youngest winner of the PGA Championship?\n\nGene Sarazen is the youngest winner, claiming the title at Oakmont Country Club in 1922 at 20 years and 174 days old. He defended his title the following year at Pelham Country Club and went on to win his third and final PGA at Blue Mound Golf & Country Club in 1933.\n\nWhat is the PGA Championship scoring record?\n\nThe record for the lowest 72-hole score in a PGA Championship was held by David Toms for his 15-under 265 total at Atlanta Athletic Club in Duluth, Ga., in 2001, but Brooks Koepka broke that mark in 2018 with his 16-under 264 at Bellerive. Koepka also tied the record set by Henrik Stenson at the 2016 Open Championship for the lowest total in major championship history.\n\nWhat is the PGA Championship scoring record in relation to par?\n\nJason Day holds the record for scoring in relation to par not only in PGA Championship history but in major championship history. The Australian was 20-under-par (268) when he won at Whistling Straits in Haven, Wis., in 2015.\n\nWhat is the highest winning score of a PGA Championship? In relation to par?\n\nThe highest total score of a PGA champion is one-under 287, shot by Larry Nelson in 1987 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The highest winning score in relation to par was one-over 281, shot four times: Jay Hebert, 1960; Julius Boros, 1968; Gary Player, 1972; and Dave Stockton, 1976.\n\nWhat is the largest margin of victory in the PGA Championship?\n\nSam Greenwood\n\nThe largest margin of victory in the PGA Championship belongs to Rory McIlroy, who won by eight strokes in 2012 at the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island (S.C.). The Northern Irishman won the event again in 2014 at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky. That remains his last major championship victory.\n\nIf players are tied after 72 holes, how is a winner determined?\n\nIn the event of a tie, the PGA of America employs a three-hole aggregate format for the championship's playoff. This occurred just one year ago between Justin Thomas and Will Zalatoris. If players are tied after three holes it becomes a sudden-death playoff.\n\nHow many playoffs have there been in PGA Championship history?\n\nSince 1958 and the move to stroke play, there have been 14 playoffs in the PGA Championship, the most recent coming in 2022. The last one before that was back in 2011 at Atlanta Athletic Club, where Keegan Bradley defeated Jason Dufner in the three-hole aggregate playoff.\n\nWhat site has hosted the most PGA Championships?\n\nSouthern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., last week's host venue, is the all-time leader in PGA Championships hosted with five. Oak Hill is next with its fourth on the way.\n\nWhat state has hosted the most PGA Championships?\n\nNew York has hosted the most PGA Championships with 13, including three at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y., which hosted the 2013 PGA Championship. It\u2019ll be four at Oak Hill Country Club in just a few days time.\n\nWhat are the future venues for the PGA Championship?\n\nFuture venues for the PGA Championship have been announced officially through 2029. There is also a \u201cTBD\u201d year for 2030, as well as a venue locked in for 2031. They are as follows:\n\n2024 \u2014 Valhalla Golf Club, Louisville, Ky.\n\n2025 \u2014 Quail Hollow Club, Charlotte, N.C.\n\n2026 \u2014 Aronimink Golf Club, Newtown Square, Pa.\n\n2027 \u2014 The East Course at PGA Frisco, Frisco, Texas\n\n2028 \u2014 The Olympic Club, San Francisco\n\n2029 \u2014 Baltusrol Golf Club (Lower), Springfield, N.J.\n\n2030 \u2014 Congressional Country Club, Bethesda, Md.\n\n2034 \u2014 The East Course at PGA Frisco, Frisco, Texas\n\nWho is the favorite to win the 2023 PGA Championship?\n\nAt the moment of writing this, Masters champ Jon Rahm is the slight favorite to win the PGA, at least according to DraftKings. At +750 for outright winner, Rahm is barely in front of Scottie Scheffler, who is then followed by Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele and Justin Thomas. Phil Mickelson is +13000 if you\u2019re looking for a long-shot bet. Or if you\u2019re feeling really frisky, John Daly is +100000.\n\nWhat will the weather be like for the 2023 PGA Championship?\n\nUnlike the tumultuous Augusta weather at this year\u2019s first major, it looks like we\u2019ll be seeing some calm and uneventful weather\u2014knock on wood, of course\u2014at the upcoming PGA. The early forecast seems to be mostly sunny days with highs in the 60s, and lows in the mid-to-high 40s. There is a chance for some rain showers on Friday, so keep a lookout for that.\n\nWhat is Oak Hill known for?\n\nWell, that\u2019s a difficult question as this year\u2019s major at Oak Hill will be quite a bit different that its predecessors. The revamped club still features the giant oak trees it's known for but many trees have been cut down to lengthen the course and vary the scenery. The pesky pond on 15 is gone, and the fifth hole now plays as the sixth in the course set-up.\n\nGolf Digest\u2019s Architecture Editor Derek Duncan went into detail on what\u2019s new at the Rochester course, so let\u2019s let him take it away \u2026\n\n\u201cOak Hill\u2019s par-70 East Course will still be defined by its stellar par 4s, including the restored sixth and the long closing trio of 16, 17 and 18,\u201d Duncan wrote. \u201cThe course has some intriguing short par 4s, too, including the stylish uphill second with a blind, narrow green set above deep trench bunkers, the 12th that plays through a gauntlet of bunkers to a putting surface benched into a sharp hillside, and the dramatic 320-yard, uphill 14th that will entice players to attempt to drive the green, though misses short will leave them in bunkers well below the putting surface, and shots that go over the green are likely to roll off the property.\n\n\u201cAll the remodeling work makes Oak Hill a more diverse and interesting course than it was, one that allows players to be more aggressive off the tee than in the past but requires careful calculation hitting shots into the greens.\u201d\n\nWho broadcasts the PGA Championship?"}, {"url": "https://www.thomasbiagi.racing/en/deepening-thomas-biagi-biography/", "page_content": "He won all the categories he raced in: 6 international titles in 14 years\n\nThomas Biagi: a racer who, driven by his passions, lived a lifestyle within and around racing tracks all around the world: Other than being one the most popular drivers of the international racing world, thanks to the 6 titles won in the four wheels world, his experience in managing racing teams has made of him also a successful manager in the field of corporate incentives.\n\nThomas Biagi was born in Bologna in 1976, he started his career, like many F1 drivers, from karting (in which excelled), winning the title of Italian Champion. Thomas was a pioneer in the world of the Motorsports, being the first modern driver to race on single-seaters while still underage, at just 16. After a first year in Formula Alfa Boxer, and while still underage, he entered Formula 3, the real training ground of the auto sports. In this category scores various wins before starting a brilliant career in the international F3000, where he clinched the title of European vice-championship, second only to the still very young Felipe Massa. The experience gained in years of single-seaters made it possible for Thomas to test various F1 cars.\n\nIn 2003 Biagi decided to make a career change and to leave the single-seaters for the Ferrari covered wheels with a FIA GT Ferrari 550. After 6 wins, 5 of which were consecutive, in 2007 he clinched the title of World Champion in the competitive FIA GT1 series behind the wheel of a Maserati MC12. This triumph also helped him to win the coveted title of \u201cCasco d\u2019Oro di Autosprint\u201d.\n\nIn 2009 impossible challenges were a constant in Thomas\u2019 career: raced in three championships: Speedcar Series, FIA GT1 and Le Mans Series. In the Prototypes category he claimed the victory on his debut on the \u201c1000 Km of Barcelona\u201d and finished the season dominating the 6 hours of Vallelunga"}, {"url": "https://www.automobilsport.com/race-categories--24,165634,Thomas-Biagi-leader-of-the-Championship,news.htm", "page_content": "02.07.2017 / MaP\n\nAudi Sport Customer Racing Australia is ready to turn up the heat as the CAMS Australian GT Championship heads to Townsville next weekend (July 7-9) for the penultimate round of the 2017 season.With two cars in Championship contention, the h more >>\n\nPorsche Team EBI has become the latest Japanese outfit to confirm its entry for Blancpain GT Series Asia\u2019s upcoming round at Fuji Speedway this August.Naoya Yamano and Yuya Sakamoto will drive the squad\u2019s 991 GT3 R, which contested last seas more >>\n\n> Super Taikyu teams and drivers prove their worth on home soil> Championship organisers keen to attract further Japanese entries for Fuji Blancpain GT Series Asia\u2019s race-by-race Japanese entries - ARN Racing, CarGuy Racin more >>\n\nBlancpain ASIA GT Series, Japan RoundSuzuka Circuit 2017Result: Suzuka Race 2 more >>\n\n> GruppeM Racing duo benefit from OD Racing\u2019s puncture> Chou and Chang run out comfortable GT4 winnersGruppeM Racing\u2019s Hunter Abbott and Maxi Goetz starred in Blancpain GT Series Asia\u2019s second rac more >>\n\nBlancpain ASIA GT Series - Japan Round , Suzuka CircuitSaturday, June 24th 2017DRIVER QUOTESMarchy Lee, #5 Audi Hong Kong R8 LMS GT3: \u201cI made a good start and had the inside line on Aditya [Patel] into Turn 1, more >>\n\n... as Yu/Merlin triumph in GT4> Audi Hong Kong pair take championship lead with 16.5s victory> Craft-Bamboo duo chase down Taiwan Top Speed for GT4 spoilsMarchy Lee and Shaun Thong claimed the Blancpai more >>\n\nDuring the fourth weekend of June 1992, exactly 25 years ago, Stephane Ratel organised his first ever race, on the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans.

Biagi can also look forward to a drive in the BMW M3 DTM \u2013 which was the special reward for the winner of the 2012 BMW Sports Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiagi\u2019s success came courtesy of overall victory in the Italian GT Championship at the wheel of a BMW Z4 GT3 run by BMW Team Italia, as well as third place in the International Superstars Series in a BMW M3, again representing ROAL Motorsport. Biagi claimed four race wins and 14 podiums in the two series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Thomas Biagi,\u201d said Marquardt. \u201cTogether with his team-mates he really made his mark on the 2012 Italian GT Championship. Over the course of last season we once again witnessed countless magnificent performances from BMW drivers in high-class racing series.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that Biagi has come through to win the BMW Sports Trophy against such strong opposition underlines just how consistent he has been this year. He can now look forward to a drive in the BMW M3 DTM.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBiagi, who won the BMW Sports Trophy with a score of 434.23 points, said after the Award Ceremony: \u201cFirst place in the BMW Sports Trophy is a huge honour for me. I had been invited to the ceremony for the top 25 BMW privateers for the last two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nI would like to thank the fantastic team at ROAL Motorsport for enabling me to win it at the third attempt. We had an amazing year. I am proud to be a part of the BMW family. I will soon be even prouder when I get behind the wheel of the BMW M3 DTM. That is the stuff of dreams for any BMW driver.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 51st BMW Sports Trophy saw a total of 243 participants \u2013 more than ever before in the long history of this competition \u2013 do battle for a share of the 250,000 Euros prize money. Marquardt said: \u201cEven after over half a century, the BMW Sports Trophy still remains extremely attractive to drivers all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year we had 243 entrants from 24 countries on four continents. They represented BMW in 47 racing series around the world. Every driver who enters the BMW Sports Trophy is part of the BMW Motorsport family. Our privateers are fantastic ambassadors for the BMW brand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond place behind Biagi, and a cheque for 25,000 Euros, went to Maxime Martin (BE). Among the 26-year-old\u2019s achievements were second place overall in the Blancpain Endurance Series with the BMW Z4 GT3. He narrowly missed out on winning the DTM test by just 25 points in the BMW Sports Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Martin had already completed a test at the wheel of the BMW M3 DTM just a few weeks ago. Third place, and 21,000 Euros in prize money, went to Norbert Michelisz (HU) with his BMW 320 TC. He won the Independents' Trophy in the FIA World Touring Car Championship (WTCC). He also claimed one of three BMW race wins in the 2012 WTCC at his home event in Budapest (HU).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as the prospect of winning a healthy amount of prize money at the end of the year, participation in the BMW Sports Trophy also comes with many other advantages. Particularly attractive are the many cooperations that BMW Motorsport enjoys with selected companies within its Customer Racing programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto: BMW Sports Trophy Award Ceremony, BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt, Thomas Biagi (IT), Alessandro Zanardi (IT).\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW Sports Trophy 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Three consecutive years now.\n\nUtah gymnastics enters the NCAA gymnastics championship at Dickies Arena in Forth Worth, Texas, with title aspirations \u2014 legitimate ones at that \u2014 but leaves as one of the vanquished, specifically as the third place finisher.\n\nIt happened in 2021, when Utah finished third overall behind Michigan and Oklahoma.\n\nIt happened in 2022, when the Red Rocks finished third overall behind Oklahoma and Florida.\n\nAnd it happened again Saturday.\n\nUtah finished third overall at the national championships for the third straight year, again finishing behind a champion in Oklahoma and a runner up in Florida.\n\nNCAA final results NCAA women\u2019s gymnastics championship results\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Oklahoma; 198.3875; Florida, 198.2375; Utah, 197.9375; LSU, 197.5250\n\n\n\nEvent winners\n\n\n\nAll-around \u2014 Haleigh Bryant (LSU); 39.7250\n\n\n\nBalance beam \u2014 Maile O\u2019Keefe (Utah); 10.0\n\n\n\nFloor exercise \u2014 Jordan Bowers (Oklahoma), Danielle Sievers (Oklahoma); 9.9500\n\n\n\nUneven bars \u2014 Kayla Dicello (Florida), Leanne Wong (Florida); 9.9750\n\n\n\nVault \u2014 Trinity Thomas (Florida); 10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sooners, now repeat champions, won with a 198.3875, while the Gators ended with a 198.2375, the Utes with a 197.9375, and in fourth place, LSU with a 197.5250.\n\nAnother year, the same story.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve done this,\u201d Utah head coach Tom Farden said. \u201cMaybe three times now.\u201d\n\nOnce again it was the vault rotation that did the Red Rocks in.\n\nWhile Utah was excellent on uneven bars (49.5500) and floor exercise (49.5000) and unreal on balance beam (49.7375), the vault rotation was less than stellar.\n\nNo gymnast was able to stick their vault landing, and the highest individual score came in at 9.9000, courtesy of Abby Brenner, while Utah had to count a score in the 9.7-range (9.7625).\n\nThe rotation scored only a 49.1500, the lowest event score by any of the four teams that competed in the national championship.\n\nAnother year, the same failure. Right?\n\nStrictly speaking, yes.\n\nYes, Utah finished third overall, the program\u2019s national title drought \u2014 which is agonizing to fans \u2014 stretching to 28 long years in the process.\n\nThe last time the Red Rocks were national champions, Bill Clinton was the President of the United States, Batman Forever wound up the highest grossing movie at the box office and no current Utah gymnast had been born yet.\n\nAgonizing indeed.\n\n1 of 4 2 of 4 3 of 4 4 of 4\n\nAnd yes, the Red Rocks weren\u2019t nearly good enough on vault in a meet that demands elite rotations on all four events. Again.\n\nEven fourth place finishing LSU managed to avoid a rotation like Utah\u2019s vault on Saturday.\n\nBut this year was different. If for no other reason than Utah went down fighting. On vault specifically.\n\n\u201cWe were going for sticks and when you do that you risk the danger of stepping backwards,\u201d Farden said. \u201cAnd when you do that that is a bigger deduction than for a step forward.\u201d\n\nNearly every one of Utah\u2019s vaults saw a gymnast take a step back (or two) when competing in the most common 10.0 valued vault in the sport \u2014 the Yurchenko 1.5.\n\nUtah went for the win on Saturday and came up short.\n\n\u201cIt is another learning lesson,\u201d Farden said.\n\nWhile tears wound up streaming down the faces of multiple Red Rocks, there was little sorrow from them about the end result.\n\n\u201cOur goal for this weekend was to give it our all and leave nothing back,\u201d senior Abby Brenner said. \u201cWe did that. We went 24 for 24 (on routines). You can\u2019t really ask for more.\u201d\n\nAdded sophomore Grace McCallum: \u201cThis team fought hard until the end. We did a killer beam rotation. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of everybody. Hopefully next year is our year.\u201d\n\nThe weekend, which includes Thursday\u2019s semifinals, was \u2014 in the eyes of Farden \u2014 a success even, despite another third place finish.\n\n\u201cI actually feel like the program did make another progression this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI can look at things realistically.\u201d\n\nHe laid three specific reasons.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, most sports have a Final Four and it is really hard to get to the Final Four,\u201d Farden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it several times now. No. 2, we beat Oklahoma in postseason and that is extremely hard to do.\n\n1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5\n\n\u201cMy third point to this, I really felt like we are the precipice. We had really good scores on floor and bars and on balance beam they were unconscious. Those are amazing scores that put you in title contention.\u201d\n\nOf course, Farden knows that something needs to be different. Same behavior, same results, or something like that.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep tinkering and figure some things out,\u201d Farden said. \u201cI am really proud of the kids. They fought all the way to the end. We were on cloud nine after Thursday night. And it is sports. It is not a perfect science. If it was...\u201d\n\nThere were bright spots for Utah, though they may have faded away with the final result.\n\nSenior Maile O\u2019Keefe earned another perfect 10 on beam, her second in two days in Fort Worth and the tenth of her career.\n\nNothing left to say about Maile O'Keefe on beam \ud83d\udc10\n\n\n\n\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc13 \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfce!! pic.twitter.com/nlXEQQHJ0o \u2014 Utah Gymnastics (@UtahGymnastics) April 15, 2023\n\n\u201cShe is at the pinnacle,\u201d Farden said.\n\nThe Red Rocks\u2019 poor vault rotation happened in the middle of the competition, and rather than wither away, the team went on to their two best events of the day on bars and beam.\n\nUtah\u2019s beam rotation was nearly record-breaking \u2014 the team\u2019s low score that counted was a 9.9125 \u2014 and established once and for all that the Red Rocks are the best beam team in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe all said before the meet, win, lose or draw, there was no result that would disappoint,\u201d senior Cristal Isa said. \u201cWe had an amazing year and nothing we did today was going to change that. It is a little disappointing because of how things were leading up, but we did our best. We finished it out really strong and I am really proud of us.\u201d\n\nFor another year, Utah\u2019s best was not good enough to warrant the title best in the nation.\n\nWhich means sooner rather than later, the Red Rocks will get back to work.\n\n\u201cI am going to be out on the road and recruit,\u201d Farden said. \u201cWe will look at our training plan. I thought we had really good legs. We were right there in a lot of ways.\n\n\u201c... We have a nucleus of a lot of people who are exceptional and know how to handle big meets. And we are bringing in some really big talent (next year). So excited about the future. Always.\u201d"}]}
