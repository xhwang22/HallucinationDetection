Those dreams became reality in 2012 when she got as close as she could get to advancing to the 100m breaststroke final in London, losing a swim-off for the eighth spot in the final to Jamaica\u2019s Alia Atkinson. Van Beilen also competed in the 200m breaststroke after winning the event at the Canadian Trials, knocking world record holder Annamay Pierse off the Canadian Olympic team in the process. Van Beilen had competed at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, winning three medals including gold in the 100m breaststroke. Her multi-sport competition experience includes the 2011 and 2013 Universiades, where she won a pair of silver medals in her first appearance. Van Beilen made her FINA World Championship debut in 2013. She has been part of four straight CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW\u2026\n\nFamily: Parents Harry and Sharon Van Beilen\u2026 Older brother Nathan\u2026 Younger sister Marya\u2026 Uncle Wayne Van Dorp is a former NHL player\u2026 Cousin Joel Reinders is a CFL offensive lineman\u2026 Getting into the Sport: Learned to swim at age 5 in the backyard pool because she was a chubby child\u2026 Started swimming competitively at age 9\u2026 Was disqualified from her first meet for moving her toes\u2026 Outside Interests: Kinesiology major at the University of British Columbia\u2026 Enjoys baking and cooking\u2026 Played piano for 10 years\u2026 Odds and Ends: Nicknames: Teddy, TVB\u2026 Athlete ambassador for KidSport\u2026 Collects magnets during her travels\u2026 Favourite motto: Do my best, let God do the rest\u2026 Likes to eat yogurt-covered raisings before competing\u2026 Has a maple leaf tattoo on her toe, making it the last thing she sees before diving off the blocks\u2026\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESULTS\n\nFINA World Championships: 2013 \u2013 28th (100m breaststroke), 21st (200m breaststroke)\n\nYouth Olympic Games: 2010 \u2013 GOLD (100m breaststroke), SILVER (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m freestyle relay), 4th (4x100m medley relay)\n\nPan Pacific Championships: 2014 \u2013 12th (100m breaststroke), 12th (200m breaststroke)\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2014 \u2013 6th (100m breaststroke), 9th (200m breaststroke), BRONZE (4x100m medley relay)"}, {"url": "https://www.ubyssey.ca/sports/tera-van-beilen-swim-queen/", "page_content": "A young girl walks across the deck of a pool in Oakville, Ontario. She\u2019s eight years old, in that chubby phase every kid goes through, swimming her first novice swim practice ever without any goggles. When she finishes, the first thing she says to her mum, after asking to get some goggles, is when the next swim practice is. All it took was one swim practice to get her hooked, and she hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTera Van Beilen is an unbreakable force in the pool. In a solid 15-year career, she\u2019s made waves in the world of competitive swimming. She has been a part of four CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds, participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010 and won a pair of silvers at the 2011 and 2013 Universiades. Most notably, she qualified for her first Olympic Games in 2012 in the 100m and 200m breaststroke events.\n\nBut after 15 years of furious training and competing, Van Beilen has decided to hang up her suit and goggles, and retire from competitive swimming after missing the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic games. This can be a heavy hit for most athletes, but Tera was smiling and positive when she spoke to us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little shocked to be going through as much joy as I am now. I love the sport so much, and I will miss it \u2026 Swimming teaches you how to deal with these situations and making the best of what comes about and I think that's been really important in this transition phase,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThis was not an easy decision either. After devoting years of her life to this sport, she reflects on her career and has no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn't want to go into Olympic Trials thinking \u2018If I don't make the Olympics, life is over\u2019. I wanted to go in with confidence that I could potentially make it, and at the end of the day I actually swam the fastest that I ever had in four years and I have no regrets about the way I swam and the training and the last year. It's just the other girls were faster.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen isn\u2019t unfamiliar with this change in dynamics and \"passing the torch\". When she qualified for the Olympics back in 2012, she beat out reigning Canadian champion and record holder Annamay Pierse for the gold medal and the elusive spot on the Canadian team.\n\n\u201cMaking the Olympics was something that I actually didn't think I would realistically do in 2012, I thought it would be more of a 2016 goal and ended up doing it. In the moment after touching the wall, it was still something that was so surreal. Now, looking back on it, I will forever be an Olympian.\u201d\n\nYou could argue that she owes a bit of her success to the time that she\u2019s spent in Vancouver, especially at UBC. Despite receiving offers for full-ride scholarships from many American colleges, Van Beilen made the \u201chardest choice of her life.\u201d She decided to attend UBC to pursue her Olympic dreams.\n\n\u201cThe head coach of the Vancouver (High Performance) Centre flew to my house for dinner, and told me everything about UBC, and I was like it's a no-brainer. I need to come to this school. I would be training with Joseph Nagy, who's one of the best breaststroke coaches in the world, and putting myself in a tough environment where most of the members of the team had qualified for international competitions, all while earning a degree. Really, there\u2019s no other choice that seemed as perfect as UBC,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nAfter five years of gruelling high-performance training \u2014 including 10 two-hour swim practices a week alongside five hours of dryland training and balancing full-time schooling \u2014 Van Beilen feels blessed to have had this opportunity.\n\n\u201cI came [to UBC] because I wanted to make the Olympic team, that was my dream since I was a little kid. So I said whatever is going to get me there, I'm going to do. To get a degree at the same time too? It was tough, but I'm glad it did it,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nAs she heads into her final months at UBC, Van Beilen is finishing up her kinesiology degree and hopes to hit the pool again sometime soon. More importantly, she\u2019s looking towards the future with bright eyes, a positive attitude and some valuable life lessons under her wings.\n\n\u201cThere are flips and flops in swimming, and that's what is so exciting. You win and you lose. Here I am now, happy and excited,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s next for this Olympian, but we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be the last we see of Tera Van Beilen."}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/news/tera-van-beilen-steps-spotlight-canadas-olympic-swim-021314620--spt.html", "page_content": "MONTREAL - Tera Van Beilen stole the show in Saturday's marquee race and made Canada's Olympic swim team in a second event.\n\nThe women's 200-metre breaststroke final was billed as a showdown between world record holder Annamay Pierse and world championship bronze medallist Martha McCabe.\n\nBut it was Van Beilen, an 18-year-old from Oakville, Ont., who touched the wall first in a time of two minutes 24.03. McCabe was second in 2:24.81, which was also good enough to qualify for London.\n\nThose times are currently the second- and third-fastest in the world this year, according to Swimming Canada, behind the 2:22.73 of reigning Olympic champion Rebecca Soni of the U.S.\n\nWith one day of trials remaining Sunday, 30 athletes have earned the right to represent Canada in the pool in London.\n\nA maximum of two swimmers per event can qualify with the exception freestyle because four swimmers have to be chosen for the relay.\n\nJulia Wilkinson of Stratford, Ont., picked up her third victory by winning the 100-metre freestyle. Runner-up Victoria Poon of Hong Kong also qualified.\n\nToronto's Heather MacLean and Samantha Cheverton of Pointe-Claire, Que., round out the women's freestyle relay team.\n\nJoe Bartoch of London, Ont., will race the men's Olympic 100-metre butterfly for the second time in his career. Toronto's Tobias Oriwol qualified in the men's 200-metre backstroke.\n\nVancouver's Savannah King and Toronto's Alexa Komarnycky finished first and second respectively in the women's 800-metre freestyle to book their tickets to London. King also qualified in the 400-metres earlier this week.\n\nVan Beilen burst into tears when she finished second in the 100 breaststroke Tuesday and qualified for London for the first time.\n\nThe pressure to make the Olympic team off her shoulders, the first-year University of British Columbia student was more in control of her emotions Saturday.\n\n\"I said to myself this morning if I do end up making the team, the tears are going to stay inside of me this time,\" she said. \"A lot of people came up to me two days ago saying I got them to tears, so I didn't want to do that again.\n\n\"I wanted to race and have fun and be more happy when I came out.\"\n\nPierse, who still holds the long-course record of 2:20.12 set in 2009, was fifth in 2:27.14.\n\n\"It's actually really hard to see because I know how much Annamay has put into the sport and she's a really hard worker,\" McCabe said. \"We really wouldn't be where we are today in breaststroke if it wasn't for Annamay.\n\n\"She still has the world record, so she knows something we don't know still. You can't take away from her.\"\n\nPierce is the second swim star to fall short of the Olympic team at these trials. Mike Brown, fourth in the 100-metre breaststroke at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, also did not qualify.\n\nAfter setting the world record in 2009, Pierse had a difficult season. She suffered through a debilitating bout of dengue fever contracted at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.\n\n\"It really has been the hardest two or three years of my life,\" Pierse said through her tears. \"This is sport. It's what I love about it. It's what I hate about it, the ups and the downs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I've had more downs than ups in the last little while.\"\n\nWilkinson was also first in the 100-metre backstroke and the 200-metre individual medley at trials. She'll try for a fourth win in the 200-metre backstroke Sunday.\n\n\"My dad, when I was little, used to bribe me to do well at meets, so he said on the subway today 'you know, if you go four-for-four I'll buy you an iPad,'\" Wilkinson said. \"The 200-back is going to be hard, but iPad right?\"\n\nBartoch says Canada needs more depth in men's butterfly.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, I put it out (there) if somebody beats me, I'll retire,\" the 29-year-old said. \"No one's really come up to the challenge yet. When Mike Minentko retired, there was a big void there. I had to catch up where he was.\n\n\"I wish somebody was coming up. No one is coming to London and saying 'I want to train with Joe Bartoch and do what he's doing' so they're kind of paying for it It's always good to train with someone faster than you. I've been around for awhile so I have a lot of advice I could give.\"\n\nOriwol finished 15th in backstroke in the event in Beijing.\n\n\"My hopes are to be deep in the final,\" Oriwol said. \"As you can see already at the Olympic trials, if you're in the final anything can happen. Upsets happen and people don't swim like they're supposed to. Once I'm in the final, I just want to have a lane.\"\n\nMcCabe was cheered on a large contingent in green T-shirts that said \"Team Fleabag.\"\n\n\"My dad used to call me the flea growing up,\" she explained. \"I didn't know they were going to do that.\"\n\nMcCabe cautioned than even though she and Van Beilen posted eye-catching times, there are other countries who have yet to hold their Olympic trials and everyone will be quicker come London.\n\n\"Those times might get bumped down,\" McCabe said. \"Whether they do or not, by the time we get there, we're going to have to be faster.\"\n\nThe Paralympic trials are running in conjunction with trials. Montreal's Benoit Huot won his fourth race in as many nights with a victory in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nValeria Grand-Maison, a triple gold medallist at the 2008 Paralympics, was fastest in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nSummer Mortimer of Burlington, Ont., took the women's 100-metre freestyle. Kyle McMahon of Prince George, B.C., was the men's 50-metre butterfly victor."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/tera-van-beilen", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nTera van Beilen was born on 30 March, 1993 in Mississauga, Canada, is a Canadian swimmer.
