I will consult and work closely with Jim and get the approval of Mr. Irsay. He wants my football experience and success.\"\n\nSo will Tobin trade quarterback Jeff George to the Bears for Jim Harbaugh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What else are the Bears going to throw in?\" Tobin asked with a laugh.\n\nTobin was never an avid backer of George, first player selected in the 1990 draft, so George's future in Indianapolis is in question. George skipped most of training camp in a dispute he never publicly clarified. He was said to be fed up with what he perceived as unfair criticism in his hometown.\n\nTobin said he was going to review personnel with coach Ted Marchibroda before he talks about anyone, including George.\n\nSince the Colts finished 28th in the league in defense, Tobin's brother Vince could soon rekindle the family reunion they had with the Bears from 1986-92, when the Bears' defense finished 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 25th, 6th, 4th and 17th.\n\n\"We've got some changes to make,\" Bill Tobin admitted when asked about Vince.\n\nThe Colts' defensive coordinator is former Northwestern coach Rick Venturi.\n\nThe Tobin hiring was one of two shakeups in the NFL Friday. The New York Jets fired coach Bruce Coslet and promoted defensive coordinator Pete Carroll after Coslet refused to hire an offensive coordinator. Coslet spent four years without a winning season. After making the playoffs in 1991 as an 8-8 wild card, the Jets suffered through 4-12 and 8-8 seasons.\n\nTobin praised former Bears General Manager Jim Finks as his role model in structuring a team. He compared his situation in Indianapolis to the 1974 hiring of Finks by the Bears, who were a father-son operation. In that case, however, Finks was hired by son Mugs Halas, not father George. Mugs gave up his authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Irsay will keep his title as vice president and general manager. Tobin said Jim Irsay, assistant GM Bob Terpenning and general counsel Michael Chernoff would remain responsible for signing players and fitting them under the salary cap.\n\nThe Colts had the third-highest payroll in the league last season, according to NFL Players Association figures. At $40.2 million, they are more than $6 million over next year's projected cap of $34 million.\n\n\"I'm here to tell them who to spend the money on,\" Tobin said. \"That's my area of expertise.\"\n\nSince the Colts finished fifth in the AFC East, they will avoid a game against the Bears next season and play a fifth-place schedule instead. The Colts have the second pick in the April 24 draft. The Bears never picked that high during Tobin's 18 years in Chicago."}, {"url": "https://mutigers.com/hof.aspx?hof=91", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}, {"url": "https://mutigers.com/honors/hall-of-fame/bill-tobin/91/kiosk", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}, {"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/Bill_Tobin_(American_football)", "page_content": "Nathan D.
