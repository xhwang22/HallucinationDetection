Click here to see more.\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times Editorial Board sent nominees for the Illinois House of Representatives a list of questions to find out their views on a range of important issues facing the state of Illinois and their districts. Peter Breen submitted the following responses:\n\n1. The COVID-19 pandemic has hammered the finances of Illinois. The state is staring at a $6.2 billion budget shortfall in this fiscal year. What should be done? Please be specific.\n\nThe pandemic highlighted the historical short-sightedness of the General Assembly. We went into this horrific situation with absolutely NO money in a \u201crainy day fund.\u201d Further, for over a decade, the General Assembly knowingly passed underfunded budgets using every accounting scheme imaginable. Even when we had higher than anticipated tax receipts in the state, as the result of a very positive economy, we didn\u2019t save but spent every dime and more. Then the virus came and devastated business, personal income, taxes and user fees, etc. While the economy is beginning to rebound, Illinois must become far more proactive in helping grow small and midsize businesses, instead of again hiking crippling taxes to meet the voracious appetite for out-of-control spending in Springfield.\n\n2. What grade \u2014 \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d \u2014 would you give Gov. J.B. Pritzker for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic? Please explain. What, if anything, should he have done differently?\n\nThe grade has to be \u201cIncomplete,\u201d since we are still midway through the pandemic. We won\u2019t know the impact of the governor\u2019s lockdown and pandemic orders until at least next year: then, we can see the full results of these policies on the physical, mental, and economic health of our residents versus those of neighboring states.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Illinois imposed the worst tax burden on its residents of any state in the country, along with being known as a notoriously bad place to start, build, or bring a business. Gov. Pritzker then imposed one of the most severe lockdowns in the country. Predictably, Illinois residents have not recovered their jobs and businesses as quickly as folks in other states. Even with the lockdown, Illinoisans experienced worse physical health impacts from COVID than neighboring states.\n\nWe need a full post-COVID review of why we suffered such high infections and deaths in long-term-care facilities. Without that review, we won\u2019t know whether this was due to the governor\u2019s actions or inactions, or some other cause.\n\nFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve advocated against including my county of DuPage in a \u201czone\u201d with Cook County in terms of phasing openings and policies. That penalized and handicapped our ability to move more quickly to recovery.\n\nAnd it was wrong to ban small family retailers from in-person sales of their products, while large retailers could sell those same products.\n\nFinally, the Pritzker Administration entirely botched unemployment insurance, leaving the jobless with no one to answer the phone, trying to navigate a broken website, and suffering the indignity of their personal identification details put on the internet. With tens of thousands of government employees across Illinois at home, there were plenty of people who could have manned unemployment phone lines during this unprecedented crisis.\n\n3. In the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, legislatures in some states have taken up the issue of police reform. Should Illinois do the same? If so, what would that look like?\n\nEveryone was horrified by the tragic circumstances surrounding the needless death of George Floyd. It was inexcusable on every level. There are clearly agencies and departments that require more and better training of officers and a clear set of policies to prevent such a tragic result ever again. That officer in Minneapolis was acting outside of guidelines and deserves to be punished for his crimes. Our agencies are better than this, particularly in DuPage County.\n\nIn Illinois, I backed the bipartisan Police and Community Relations Improvement Act, which banned chokeholds, put standards in place for officer-involved deaths, and improved training requirements, among other reforms. While due to this Act, Illinois already has in place many of the reforms other states are now reviewing, we should always be looking at any and every helpful reform that protects the public and gives our agencies the ability to perform professionally in maintaining the law. As a Village Trustee, I was also a strong supporter of body cameras to protect both the public and police officers in altercations. This was at a time when there was significant resistance to these devices.\n\n4. Should the Legislature pass a law requiring all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras? Why or why not?\n\nAbsolutely. It protects both citizens and law enforcement. It can and does act as a deterrent for both parties. I would immediately sponsor or co-sponsor such a bill.\n\n5. Federal prosecutors have revealed a comprehensive scheme of bribery, ghost jobs and favoritism in subcontracting by ComEd to influence the actions of House Speaker Michael Madigan. Who\u2019s to blame? What ethics reforms should follow? Should Madigan resign?\n\nTerra Costa Howard, and enablers like her, are to blame. During the 2018 elections, Costa Howard promised the residents of the 48th District that she would be independent of Mike Madigan, but then she turned around and took $1.5 million in campaign contributions from him (more than any other state legislative candidate) and voted for him for Illinois House Speaker. Terra Costa Howard handed our vote\u2014and our voice\u2014to a crook and a thief.\n\nEven today, Costa Howard still refuses to return one dime of all the dirty money she\u2019s taken\u2014and she is still raking in money from Madigan-controlled campaign committees.\n\nMadigan has run state government as a pay-to-play scheme for decades. The monied interest groups pay into his campaign committees and hire his preferred lobbyists, guaranteeing them a seat at the legislative table. If you don\u2019t have money or the right lobbyist, you lose.\n\nAnd he\u2019s done this in plain sight, with increasing numbers of Illinoisans watching in horror, but unable to stop it. When reform-minded candidates like me step forward to run in competitive districts, they get hit with multi-million-dollar smear campaigns, executed by the Madigan machine\u2019s sophisticated political operation. Even post-Madigan, this won\u2019t change unless we elect new leaders clean of the taint of Madigan and his machine.\n\nOn Madigan, I called for his resignation last year. While in the House, I opposed Madigan for Speaker twice.\n\nOn reforms, we need term limits. We have a part-time citizen legislature, and term limits will strengthen the temporary nature of legislative service. There are a raft of additional reforms in this vein: bans on lobbying after legislating, strengthening lobbyist disclosure requirements, limits on legislative leaders, taking power away from legislative leaders and returning it to members, and putting teeth into laws prohibiting conflicts of interest by legislators, among others. Reform should be an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach.\n\n6. Please tell us about your civic work in the last two years, whether it\u2019s legislation you have sponsored or work you have done in other ways to improve your community.\n\nMy wife and I were blessed to be able to adopt our second son two years ago, literally a week before the last election. We\u2019re very committed to our community and blessed to raise a family here.\n\nDuring COVID, I\u2019ve been active running food drives that collected thousands of pounds of food and thousands of dollars for our local St. Vincent De Paul Societies. I\u2019ve also been handling requests from local residents who weren\u2019t able to get help from the Costa Howard district office. And I\u2019ve been putting out informational Facebook Live videos that have received tens of thousands of views, on a variety of topics of interest to our district.\n\nAt the end of last year, after our community suffered a spate of over-valuations on local properties, I put on multiple emergency property tax seminars, along with working directly with residents, to help folks get their assessments and taxes lowered. Ms. Costa Howard was not responsive to the needs of these residents, who are literally being taxed out of their homes.\n\nIn my professional capacity, I\u2019ve worked hard to assist churches to be able to open safely, with precautions, to enjoy the status that other \u201cessential places\u201d have had. My wife and I also participate with both time and treasure to many of the civic organizations in my community.\n\n7. Please list three concerns that are specific to your district, such as a project that should be undertaken or a state policy related to an important local issue that should be revised.\n\nThe people and businesses of our district are burdened the most by out-of-control spending and taxes, onerous mandates on businesses and local governments, and rampant corruption. We can\u2019t recover quickly and fully from COVID while suffering under these burdens.\n\nYet all of them have been made worse by Terra Costa Howard: she supported unbalanced budgets, new mandates on local businesses, and voted for Madigan for House Speaker. Costa Howard told voters during her 2018 campaign that she\u2019d be for \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d and \u201csmall business,\u201d but once she got to Springfield, her voting record was the exact opposite.\n\nCosta Howard even voted against a proposal to stop the conflicts of interest in General Assembly members, like Mike Madigan, writing the property tax laws and then raking in millions doing property tax appeals. The Chicago City Council banned that practice, in response to the Ed Burke prosecution, but Costa Howard rejected reform and stood with Madigan.\n\nFor our district, I\u2019ve succeeded in securing relief when state action was required. Whether it was securing IDOT approval for the new Mariano\u2019s on Roosevelt Rd in Lombard; helping a local nonprofit, SCARCE, with a law allowing it to collect cooking grease and oil; or changing state law to allow Noon Whistle Brewing to use innovative \u201c360-lid\u201d technology (allowing removal of nearly all the top of a beverage can, making it more like a cup), I got the job done.\n\n8. What are your other top legislative priorities?\n\nToo many Illinoisans feel they must uproot and leave the state they call home. We are now at six straight years of losing residents to other states, losing over 100,000 people net in just the past two years. Every person who leaves takes their hopes and dreams and contributions with them, pulling vitality and energy away from Illinois.\n\nAnd the latest data shows we\u2019re not just losing seniors\u2014it\u2019s prime working-age residents who are leading the exodus. Residents are taxed out of their homes, or are just tired of supporting a state government they see as disconnected and corrupt. Students are heading to college out of state, never to return. Families are packing up for places with more and better paying jobs.\n\nThe solutions are not easy, but they are simple. Lower the tax burden on our residents and businesses\u2014both income taxes and property taxes have to come down. Stop out-of-control spending at the state level, which is driving tax and fee increases. Embrace reform measures like Fair Maps and Term Limits, to ensure we have citizen legislators representing whole communities, not sliced up narrow groups of partisans. Our broken state government is the primary obstacle standing in the way of turning our state around.\n\n9. What is your position on Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s proposed graduated income tax? Please explain.\n\nI stand firmly against the graduated income tax. My greatest reason comes from my experience in the General Assembly, where I saw first-hand the amount of wasteful spending and poor fiscal policy being implemented in the state. The budgets passed always exceeded our anticipated income, and even those income numbers were artificially inflated as part of an obscene effort to call these budgets \u201cbalanced.\u201d They never were. In a state with an insatiable appetite for spending, feeding more hard-earned taxpayer money into that corrupt process is not the solution.\n\nOur entire budgeting process should be overhauled, a zero-based budget starting with a clean slate. There are numerous programs which are simply routinely re-appropriated, without careful assessment of effectiveness or necessity. They often become silos of money for discretionary spending, and they are rife for corruption. Before anyone asks an Illinois taxpayer for a single penny more, there should be an absolutely full accounting of all of the money this state already raises through every tax and fee we already levy. We\u2019re in recovery mode. Consumers will be a huge part of that. Taking away more money isn\u2019t the way to encourage growth.\n\n10. Illinois continues to struggle financially, with a backlog of unpaid bills. In addition to a progressive state income tax \u2014 or in lieu of such a tax \u2014 what should the state do to pay its bills, meet its pension obligations and fund core services such as higher education?\n\nAs stated before, this state needs to re-examine every dollar we are spending now. Illinois should do what any entity should do when they are spending more than they take in: reform, and spend less.\n\nIllinois government needs to innovate with a view to 2030, not 1830. Advancements in technology should lead to lower expense, not greater, but there\u2019s never a solution proposed in this state that doesn\u2019t include a tax hike. That\u2019s the first and only solution ever considered.\n\nThere also needs to be a very serious and fair discussion with relation to pension funds. These have become an eternal issue with no solvent funding solution in place. I lose sleep over the fact that these funds won\u2019t be there for people who have been made promises that are fiscally impossible to keep. I believe that before we can solve this problem, we have to stop the bleeding first. There are some measures with the tier system that have helped a little bit, but are still inadequate. For everyone\u2019s sake, including pensioners who deserve security and certainty, a fair, equitable set of agreements to tackle this dire issue over a reasonable period of time is the only realistic solution.\n\nAs for \u201ccore services\u201d, we need to narrowly define them and fund them properly. This area of funding suffers more than any other as they don\u2019t enjoy the auto-reappropriation so many other elements of the state budget do. The whole budget needs to be re-imagined and re-examined starting with a fresh balance sheet.\n\n11. Should Illinois consider taxing the retirement incomes of its very wealthiest residents, as most states do? And your argument is?\n\nThere aren\u2019t many incentives to remaining an Illinoisan. The policy of not taxing retirement income is among the few incentives any resident of Illinois has to stay here. If we were to selectively consider taxing retirement income, who would decide who is wealthy? Who would decide the rates? Who would decide when those rates should change, because Illinois still continues to spend more than it takes in? We know who. The same General Assembly that put us in the fiscal morass we\u2019re stuck in. Who would trust them to make those decisions? To make my answer clear: No, Illinois should not consider this.\n\n12. What can Illinois do to improve its elementary and high schools?\n\nIllinois schools spend double the national average on administration\u2014we have to move that money back to the classroom. And the state imposes numerous unfunded mandates that hike costs for local school districts.\n\nI put forward a bill to cap administrative spending at the national average, which would free up hundreds of millions of dollars for classroom needs and property tax relief. Whether this efficiency is achieved by consolidating districts or sharing administrative costs, this is a huge sum of money being wasted in our state.\n\nWhen I review our standards, I believe they\u2019re high enough, but we\u2019re not meeting them. There needs to be more accountability for doing so. We are in a financial crisis in this state that affects everyone, including school districts. It very much affects the families sending these students to schools. The funding of schools has experienced years of band-aid approaches, special legislation and a completely non-comprehensive approach.\n\nAt present, we\u2019re not even sure if schools are going to open this school year or how. I\u2019m a public high school graduate. I was fortunate to get an outstanding education and go on to very strong universities with that foundation. I don\u2019t believe that is the case for many of our students today.\n\nThe only way to truly improve schools is by actively reforming our education policy, cognizant of the needs of the various regions of the state, and with the full participation of all of the stakeholders in the process. That simply hasn\u2019t been done. There are too many golden calves, resulting in winners and losers with every partial-reform effort enacted. Too often the losers were a set of students in one part or the state or the other, or worse, everywhere. Educators are smart people by nature and experience. This is a solvable problem.\n\n13. Mass shootings and gun violence plague America. What can or should the Legislature do, if anything, to address this problem in Illinois?\n\nWe\u2019ve had selected success and failure with this issue in Illinois. It\u2019s both heart-breaking and frustrating to see our state on the national news every night reporting the most recent tally of shootings and killings in Chicago. The city has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and despite that, there are no shortage of guns or tragic carnage there. The General Assembly has also already tightened gun regulations to be some of the toughest in the country.\n\nThe other side of the equation is policing and prosecuting those misusing firearms. For instance, I have worked closely with our DuPage State\u2019s Attorney, Bob Berlin, on a variety of legislative measures, including enhancing penalties for those who commit crimes and then jump bail. Historically, DuPage has seen as much as 50% of felonies committed by individuals from outside the county, so laws like this one would give our prosecutors the tools they need to discourage crime locally.\n\n14. Do you favor or oppose term limits for any elected official in Illinois? Please explain.\n\nI am in favor of term limits. Legislators do need enough time to become effective and not let the permanent establishment of staff operate the government. In the State of Illinois, with the way legislative maps are gerrymandered, elections do not serve the function as term limits as it was intended. I believe strongly in a Citizen Legislature for a carefully prescribed period of service.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason a statewide official should serve more than 2 terms (8 years). And 8-10 years for Legislators in the State Senate or General Assembly is plenty. Controlled, centralized power for too long of a period is a recipe for corruption: we are watching this play out on our television screens as more and more long-serving members of the Illinois General Assembly are charged with various federal crimes.\n\n15. Everybody says gerrymandering is bad, but the party in power in every state \u2014 Democrats in Illinois \u2014 resist doing anything about it. Or do we have that wrong? What should be done?\n\nYou have it right. It is bad. Fortunately, more and more, the people of Illinois view gerrymandering to be unconstitutional and wrong. I drafted and championed a Fair Maps Amendment, presented as a citizen initiative, because of the block put on Fair Maps by the Democratic Party of Illinois. (We had over 10,000 signatures gathered, before being abruptly halted by the coronavirus.)\n\nEvery few years, you see cynical attempts by electorally vulnerable Democrats to file fair maps amendments, knowing full well these efforts will never see the light of day. We saw it in 2016 when then-Rep. Jack Franks was allowed to bring his amendment to the House Floor (where it garnered 105 votes), with the understanding that the Senate would not take it up. And we saw Ms. Costa Howard do the same thing this year, filing another dead-on-arrival amendment just two months before the deadline.\n\nWhat should be done? The media, private industry, and good-government groups should coalesce behind a citizen initiative that meets the requirements of the Illinois Constitution. My Fair Maps Amendment is one legally rock-solid way to meet those stringent requirements. Any system would be better than the current one.\n\n16. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Chicago is investigating possible official corruption by state and local officials. This prompted the Legislature to pass an ethics reform measure to amend the Lobbyist Registration Act (SB 1639). It was signed into law in December. What\u2019s your take on this and what more should be done?\n\nAs I noted previously, we need an all-of-the-above approach to ethics reform, starting with term limits. There are plenty of ideas out there, and if we need more, we can look to the many other states that are known for clean government, like Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\n17. When people use the internet and wireless devices, companies collect data about us. Oftentimes, the information is sold to other companies, which can use it to track our movements or invade our privacy in other ways. When companies share this data, we also face a greater risk of identity theft. What should the Legislature do, if anything?\n\nIllinois currently has some of the toughest laws in the country around information privacy. Even so, we can always be open to addressing the privacy challenges presented by tech advancements. For instance, the issues relating to Tik Tok and its undisclosed scraping of user data may present areas for us to legislate in Illinois, if the federal government does not act.\n\nThe General Assembly is severely lacking in the experience necessary to meet the challenges presented by emerging technology: I bring unique training and experience in computer science and telecommunications to bear on these issues. Voices like mine are missing from the General Assembly.\n\n18. The number of Illinois public high school graduates who enroll in out-of-state universities continues to climb. What can Illinois do to make its state universities more attractive to Illinois high school students?\n\nEvery Illinoisan deserves the opportunity to attend college or a trade school, and to graduate without debt. A big reason people leave Illinois for out of state institutions is the cost of education here. We are not as competitive as other state university systems. In my district, many students choose universities in Indiana, Iowa, or Missouri, instead of staying here. With few financial incentives available, U of I is also difficult for many of our best students to attend. Other states have aggressively recruited in Illinois and provided financing, to cherry pick our best students.\n\nParents also have a role in how students make these choices. They want what\u2019s best for their children, and because of the problems afflicting Illinois, many parents urge their kids to go elsewhere. Illinois needs to live up to the standard that \u201canything is possible\u201d to pursue and prosper here. This is another area where our state\u2019s horrible fiscal condition is negatively affecting us. All this adds up to students choosing less expensive, top-flight schools in other states, with better fiscal management and opportunity.\n\n19. What is your top legislative priority with respect to the environment?\n\nI\u2019m a husband and father of 2 little boys. Clean air and clean water are our most important environmental considerations. I am proud to have been one of the few Republicans regularly rated 100% by the Illinois Environmental Council.\n\nAs well, being the only person with an Electrical Engineering background in the General Assembly, I repeatedly worked with environmental groups to responsibly move Illinois to low- and zero-emissions energy. Illinois is recognized as a national leader in the field today, due to our efforts on that front.\n\n20. What historical figure from Illinois, other than Abraham Lincoln (because everybody\u2019s big on Abe), do you most admire or draw inspiration from? Please explain.\n\nI\u2019d choose the \u201cGreat Communicator,\u201d Ronald Reagan, since I can\u2019t pick Abraham Lincoln. Growing up, we knew President Reagan as a calm, upbeat presence for our country. He fought hard for his principles, but he united folks across partisan lines and was focused on getting things done. We could use more leaders like him today.\n\n21. What\u2019s your favorite TV, streaming or web-based show of all time. Why?\n\nAll-time would probably be Doctor Who. Some seasons are better than others, but the fact that the whole main cast changes every few years keeps up the variety of the show. You get something to latch onto with each crew. The show is wickedly funny and creative, and often bends your brain.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ilga.gov/house/Rep.asp?MemberID=2454", "page_content": "\u00d7\n\nThe Illinois General Assembly offers the Google Translate\u2122 service for visitor convenience.

Senior citizens are taxed out of their homes, or are just tired of supporting a state government they see as disconnected and corrupt. Students are heading to college out of state, never to return.

That\u2019s a lot of money sent to Springfield, with very little to show for it.\n\nFor our district, when we identify a local issue that requires some action by the state, I\u2019ve usually able to secure those changes. For instance, I was able to work with Sen. Chris Nybo and others on getting IDOT approval to bring in the new Mariano\u2019s on Roosevelt Rd in Lombard. He and I also successfully sponsored a bill to allow a local nonprofit, SCARCE, collect cooking grease and oil, which had been prohibited under state law. And when a popular local microbrewery, Noon Whistle, were prohibited by state law from using innovative \u201c360-lid\u201d technology (allowing removal of nearly all the top of a beverage can, making it more like a cup), I drafted the bill to get that changed.\n\nThe people and businesses of our district are burdened the most by out-of-control spending and tax increases, onerous mandates on businesses and local governments, and excessive debt, all caused by past mostly Democrat-led majorities of the General Assembly.\n\nWho is Peter Breen?\n\nHis legislative District: 48th Representative District His political/civic background: State Representative, 2015-present, Floor Leader, 2017-present Trustee, 2011-2014, & Acting President, 2012-2013, Village of Lombard His occupation: Constitutional Attorney & State Representative His education: Juris Doctor, University of Notre Dame Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Vanderbilt University Diploma, Naperville North High School Campaign website: votebreen.com\n\nWhat are the most important differences between you and your opponent?\n\nBreen: I\u2019ve been an independent advocate for the people of my district during my two terms in the Illinois House. There\u2019s no person or group that can claim to \u201cown\u201d me.\n\nHowever, my opponent is almost entirely funded by House Speaker Mike Madigan and his political operation. She\u2019s staffed with his people. She uses the talking points his people provide her.\n\nMy opponent sat on a school board for 8 years, and she voted to increase property taxes every single year, including during the worst depths of the Great Recession. She even broke ties several years to raise property taxes. And those were large increases, some years as high as 12% or 15%, well more than the rate of inflation. My opponent raises taxes, and she has zero credibility in addressing the massive property tax problem plaguing our state.\n\nI\u2019ve repeatedly voted to freeze property taxes, and I support reducing and capping them. This isn\u2019t new for me: while on the Lombard Village Board, I secured a freeze, the first property tax relief the people of the Lilac Village had experienced in 20 years. I also led the effort as Acting Village President to cut half a million dollars from our annual budget, with no loss of services, and return the money to the people by permanently eliminating the village vehicle sticker. If you drive in Lombard, you might see some folks still have a sticker on their car\u2013that\u2019s from 2012-2013, the final year of that most-despised fee.\n\nFinally, my opponent has pointed to abortion either as the primary reason she decided to run against me or the only issue she would discuss in interviews with reporters. That sort of single-issue focus doesn\u2019t fit our district, and it isn\u2019t the reason Illinois state government is broke and bankrupt either. On abortion, my opponent supports taxpayer funding of elective abortions, while I do not believe tax dollars should be used for elective abortions. But I\u2019m focused cleaning up the fiscal mess in Springfield and shining a bright light on the special interests who have taken hold of so much of Illinois government, at all levels.\n\nIllinois is now the sixth-most populated state, down from No. 5, after 33,703 people moved out between July 2016 and July 2017. What must the Legislature do to make Illinois a more desirable place to live?\n\nBreen: We should be terribly alarmed by our population loss. Our consumer base is powerful. But as we lose residents, the corporate and business base follows them out of state. Our start-up businesses, our education opportunities, and employment opportunities will all suffer. Reversing the trend means making Illinois a more hospitable place to live, with regard to our taxing policy, and a better place to start, expand, and run a business.\n\nOur border state neighbors take full advantage of our poor policies with regard to property taxes, sales taxes, fees, and regulations. When a huge corporation chooses a location a few miles north in Kenosha County, it takes advantage of our highly skilled, highly educated work force, but another state realizes the lion\u2019s share of the benefits of that corporation. Many residents will move a few miles to take even greater advantage of lower tax policies overall, and a lower cost of living. This scenario continues to happen to Illinois.\n\nWe have to lower the tax burden. Create policy that offers businesses a long-term vision of an Illinois that is hospitable to them and their growth. These are things that could happen quickly with the right governance. The reasons for not doing so are utterly selfish and self-dealing government policies. It\u2019s not too late yet, but we are absolutely on the verge of passing a point where it is.\n\nIn 2017, our state\u2019s unfunded pension liability ballooned to more than $130 billion. What\u2019s to be done about that?\n\nBreen: The General Assembly refuses to grapple with substantive pension reform. The Illinois Democrats rely heavily on government employee unions for campaign workers and dollars, and those government unions have taken a hard line against any pension reform. And the many government workers in downstate districts have firmly instructed their legislators, \u201cdon\u2019t touch our pensions.\u201d But these attitudes have us hurtling toward a future where our (clearly unsustainable) pension liabilities can\u2019t be paid. The problem stems from politicians over-promising pension benefits, mainly in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, leading to a 1000% increase in liability over the past 30 years.\n\nThe General Assembly should do everything possible to stem the tide of increasing pension liabilities. We should immediately convene a Blue Ribbon Commission, bringing together the top legal and economic experts, to lay out every option possibly available to us. That should lead into the broadest possible public, statewide debate on this crisis. Since Illinois politicians either refuse or feel they can\u2019t address this issue, avenues should be explored to put the matter directly to the People.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2016, the number of Illinois residents who enrolled as college freshmen outside the state increased by 73% (20,507 to 35,445). Why are so many more Illinois residents going to college elsewhere? What should be done to encourage more of them to go to school here?\n\nBreen: The causes for our college decline are both short-term and long-term. First off, we\u2019re not competitive enough in the short-term for the students looking at schools. Our kids who in years past would attend an Illinois school are headed out of state for a variety of immediate reasons, including because they got a better financial package or because they felt the programs offered by an out-of-state school would better meet their educational aims.\n\nA review of the data from the past few years shows that, for each of our state universities, the Illinois state government spends more money per pupil than nearly any other competing institution\u2013and at the same time, our schools charge a higher tuition per student than their competing schools! This imbalance, where we\u2019re pumping in more tax dollars but still charging more than competing schools, needs to be addressed openly and honestly.\n\nThe long-term issues relate to the desire of families and businesses to stay here. If families don\u2019t see a future for themselves in Illinois, why would their kids bother attending school in-state? If there are more and better jobs elsewhere, why stay? We have to fix our broader governmental problems before we will stem the long-term tide of students leaving.\n\nWhat laws, if any, should the Legislature pass to address the problem of gun violence?\n\nBreen: This term, I worked with Rep. Kathy Willis (D-Addison) to craft the state\u2019s new Firearms Restraining Order law, which provides a mechanism to get guns out of the hands of provably dangerous individuals. That law is a significant step forward to addressing the issue of gun violence. I\u2019ve also supported the licensing of firearms dealers, to stop the illegal flow of guns into the hands of criminals, and increased penalties on those who commit crimes with guns.\n\nOn-demand scheduling software now helps large retail companies determine how many staff members they will need on a day-to-day or even hour-to-hour basis. The downside is that employees may not receive their work schedules until the last minute. Oregon and a number of cities have responded by adopting \u201cfair scheduling\u201d laws. Would it be appropriate for the Illinois\n\nLegislature to pass a \u201cfair scheduling\u201d law? Please explain. What would such a law look like?\n\nBreen: At this point, we need to focus on reducing the burdens on businesses, and especially those facing small businesses, and help them create jobs and economic growth. In reviewing any regulation, my first question is \u201cwhat are our competing states doing?\u201d\u2013that means reviewing the policies of the states that are now home to former Illinois businesses.\n\nShould recreational marijuana be legalized in Illinois? Please explain.\n\nBreen: The law enforcement community is strongly against a full-scale legalization and commercialization of recreational marijuana, and their concerns should be thoroughly investigated, discussed, and analyzed before legalization is considered.\n\nOpioid overdoses and fatalities continue to rise in number. In Illinois in 2017, there were 13,395 opioid overdoses, including 2,110 deaths. What should the Legislature do, if anything, about this?\n\nBreen: Opioid abuse has destroyed families and taken too many of our loved ones. I\u2019m in favor of an all-of-the-above approach on this subject, whether in looking at alternatives to opioids, education campaigns, and law enforcement and criminal justice reforms, among others.\n\nThe Future Energy Jobs Act, passed in 2016, is generating job growth in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. Do you agree or disagree with the objectives and substance of the Act? What more \u2014 or less \u2014 should be done?\n\nBreen: I supported the Future Energy Jobs Act, and I was recognized this year by the Illinois Environmental Council with a 100% rating for my support of legislation protecting our environment. The Act appears to be working, but due to its complexity, it\u2019s taken a while to fully implement. There will inevitably be bumps in the road, which the General Assembly should monitor and intervene to address if necessary.\n\nWhat would you do to ensure the long-term viability of the state\u2019s Medicaid program? What is your view on managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries?\n\nBreen: Every state has different ways of providing care for those on Medicaid, so as we look at reforms, there are myriad examples to draw upon. Whether you\u2019re looking at managed care, or some form of individual savings accounts, or some of the innovative new medical practice models sweeping the country, let\u2019s take an honest look. The point is to get the best care possible at the best price, and if there are better ways to achieve that goal, we should assess them.\n\nUnderfunding at the Department of Corrections has led to troubling findings by the auditor general that many inmates don\u2019t receive services or opportunities for work while incarcerated. Is this a legitimate concern? What should the Legislature do?\n\nBreen: One of the purposes of prison is reformative, to provide the support necessary to the individual to be a productive member of society upon release. Whatever we need to do to bring that about, we should do. Work skills are absolutely critical to this\u2013without those skills, you can\u2019t get and keep a job. If folks who have been in prison can find good jobs after release, the incentives to commit crimes in the future obviously go way down.\n\nShould the state restore the practice of parole for people sentenced to long terms? Why or why not?\n\nBreen: At this time, with the terrible violence plaguing our communities, we need to first focus on protecting innocent folks across our state who are at risk of grave harm. The victims need to be our top priority.\n\nAhead of the historic 2018 elections, the Sun-Times is teaming up weekly with the Better Government Association, in print and online, to fact-check the truthfulness of the candidates.

In 2014, Peter mounted an underdog campaign to unseat a popular six-term incumbent Republican in the primary election, closing a 25-point margin and eventually securing a 14-point victory. In November 2014, he would go on to become the first resident of the Village of Lombard in 140 years to be elected to the General Assembly.\n\nIn November 2018, Breen lost a tight reelection in the midst of the national \u201cBlue Wave,\u201d with House Speaker Michael Madigan spending over $2 Million against Breen, outspending Breen\u2019s underdog campaign roughly 3 to 1. Breen concluded his two terms with 32 bills passed into law, more than any other second term legislator. His bills saved small businesses and nonprofits millions, protected seniors from having their estates raided by scammers, and shined a bright spotlight on the activities and spending of Illinois\u2019 many thousands of units of government. He enjoyed consistently high marks for his support of small businesses, manufacturing and technology jobs, lower taxes and balanced budgets, a healthier environment, craft brewers and organic farmers, transparency and openness, and free speech and personal freedoms.\n\nAn attorney by training, Peter left a lucrative private law practice in Chicago in 2004 to enter full-time public service. One year later, Peter founded a local not-for-profit, mobilizing hundreds of volunteers who have since served thousands of pregnant women in need and their children in DuPage and Will counties. He spearheaded the Chicagoland Project Gabriel campaign, which distributed tens of thousands of \u201cPregnant? Need Help?\u201d bumper stickers throughout local churches to reach out to women in difficult and untimely pregnancies. In 2008, Peter joined the Thomas More Society, a national not-for-profit law firm that focuses on the defense of First Amendment rights. As Vice President and Senior Counsel for the Society, Peter represents churches, organizations, and individuals in state and federal courts across the country, and he regularly advises state and federal elected officials on the effects of proposed legislation. Peter is sought out by local and national television, radio, and print media as an expert legal analyst.\n\nPeter served as an elected Trustee on the Lombard Village Board from 2011-2014, stepping in as Lombard\u2019s Acting Village President in 2012-13. One of his first initiatives as a trustee was authoring and securing passage of the strongest municipal transparency policy in the state of Illinois, earning Lombard a rare 100% transparency rating from the Illinois Policy Institute. When he took over as Acting Village President, Peter initiated a line-by-line review of the Village\u2019s proposed 2013 annual budget, identifying and cutting over half a million dollars in spending without the loss of Village services. He then ensured that those savings were returned to Lombard taxpayers by permanently eliminating the Village\u2019s annual vehicle sticker and fee. The next year, Peter led a successful fight to freeze property taxes in the Lilac Village, which was the first property tax relief residents experienced in 20 years.\n\nDuring his time as Trustee, Peter served as Chairperson of the Lombard Economic & Community Development Committee. Under Peter\u2019s leadership, the Committee took on numerous initiatives to help downtown Lombard and to improve the business climate generally in the village. He sponsored and worked to pass the Lombard \u201coutdoor dining\u201d program, rolling back unnecessary regulations to allow new outdoor dining options in the downtown area. He also started downtown Lombard\u2019s \u201cOutdoor Game Watches,\u201d bringing in hundreds of new patrons to shop at local businesses. In order to encourage lower prices for taxi service and to allow Lombard-based livery businesses to grow, Peter rewrote the Lombard Taxi Ordinance to wipe away outdated regulations and to allow a wider variety of vehicles to service residents\u2019 transport needs.\n\nIn 2009, Peter founded \u201cBanRedCams,\u201d a grassroots initiative that sought to ban unfair and punitive red light cameras in Lombard and surrounding communities. Lombard removed its cameras shortly thereafter. As a Village Trustee, Peter successfully worked to prevent garnishment of residents\u2019 state tax refunds to pay red light camera ticket fees.\n\nIn 2019, Peter began the Fair Maps Initiative to remove the redistricting power from Michael Madigan. This initiative would give voters the opportunity to pass a referendum in the 2020 November elections to amend the Illinois Constitution. If passed, redistricting would be put into the hands of a bipartisan commission, ending gerrymandering in Illinois. The goal is to give more residents in Illinois a voice when choosing representatives.\n\nPeter earned his Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, completing the program in just 3 years. Peter earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame, which he attended on scholarship. He is a member of the Father Boecker Council of the Knights of Columbus and is an Eagle Scout. Peter and his wife Margie have been married for 14 years, and they are the proud parents of two sons, Matthew Elijah, whom they adopted in August 2016, and James Francis, whom they adopted in September 2018.\n\nsource: VoteBreen.com"}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/elite-street/ct-re-elite-peter-breen-wheaton-20210714-r5virkbwrjg6po4ydlsc6zwnrm-story.html", "page_content": "Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Peter Breen and his wife, Margie, paid $495,000 for a four-bedroom, 2,723-square-foot Georgian-style house in Wheaton \u2014 two towns to the west of Lombard, where he lived when he served in the legislature.\n\nA Republican and a onetime Lombard village trustee, Breen represented the state\u2019s 48th district for two terms, from 2015 until 2019.

My law practice is national, so I\u2019m flying around the country more often than I\u2019m at our offices in downtown Chicago, and when I\u2019m at home, I do need to have a good spot to work from out of the house.\u201d\n\nBreen noted that he represented half of Wheaton when he was a state representative. And he grew up just 10 minutes away, in Naperville.\n\n\u201cFor my wife and me, our first home was in Lombard, and we absolutely love Lombard, but because of the low housing (inventory), we could not find a house in Lombard that really met the needs of our family \u2026 so we had to move a little farther out,\u201d he said.\n\nWould Breen run for another office in the future?\n\n\u201cYou never say never,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the people of our area want me to go to Springfield, and the courts redraw the maps so that we have an opportunity, obviously I would take a look at it, but I\u2019m not one of these people that needs an office in order to feel important.

He is vice president and senior counsel for the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit, national public interest law firm.

Here are Breen's responses.\n\nQ: Should Speaker Madigan resign from his leadership positions? If he does not resign, will you support him for a new term as House speaker?\n\nA: I called for Madigan to resign after it was disclosed earlier this year that his chief lobbyist, Mike McClain, protected a Madigan operative for covering up the rape of a child in Champaign.\n\nThat was the latest in a string of sexual misconduct by high-level operatives in the Madigan machine.\n\nMcClain personally backed Terra Costa Howard in the 2018 election cycle, and according to November 2019 reporting, he ran a \"secret project\" to fund the campaigns of his preferred House Democrats during the critical closing weeks of the 2018 cycle.\n\nCosta Howard did nothing about her supporter McClain's rape cover-up, or about any of the other sexual misconduct. She stuck with the Madigan machine through it all. And she's still taking his money and the support of his machine. No one who knows Illinois politics was surprised by the corrupt conduct detailed in the ComEd prosecution.\n\nMadigan has run state government as a pay-to-play scheme for decades. Every Republican in the legislature has demanded he step down, but the Democrats have lashed themselves to his mast. They deserve to go down with his ship. Some would say \"they stayed loyal.\" I'd say, \"they stayed bought.\"\n\nQ: What are the most important components that should be included in legislative ethics reform? What will you do to help them come to pass?\n\nA: We should start with term limits. Whether it's Mike Madigan or disgraced legislators like Louis Arroyo, Martin Sandoval, or Terry Link (and many others), term limits would likely have prevented their crimes.\n\nTerm limits ensure we have a part-time citizen legislature, as our Illinois Constitution calls for. With term limits, the Illinois General Assembly becomes less appealing for those who are corrupt coming in, and a short period of service hopefully ushers out those who are corruptible before they can \"break bad.\"\n\nEither way, with a brief time in office, you have to get your work done quickly, because you'll soon be back in private life. As to the myriad other ethics proposals out there, and we should take an \"all-of-the-above\" approach.\n\nSadly, there is also a great need for reform for personal ethics as well, with regard to personal behavior. Every manner of bad behavior is tolerated and covered up in Springfield, leaving far too many victims in its wake. I've been willing to sponsor this kind of legislation and will continue. I will sponsor, support vocally, and vote for any real reform bill that gets filed.\n\nQ: What should the General Assembly do to improve the state's unemployment benefits system?\n\nA: Our technology is so far out of date in Illinois that we couldn't even distribute federal money to Illinois residents.\n\nAdding to the problem of a website that couldn't handle the traffic were phones not being answered within the agency itself. With so many state employees at home on account of the virus, it's beyond imagination how there could not have been more support for millions of state residents who were suddenly in great need.\n\nTechnology can be upgraded quickly. Why this hasn't been done in so many years is inexcusable.\n\nI'm certain I'd be told it was a financial issue. The high cost of human involvement (state jobs) is many times more costly than technology upgrades. And when it came to humans; they weren't at work. Many state Reps and state Senators couldn't reach anyone in the agency to get any answers for constituents or for themselves. Residents couldn't get through and didn't receive any calls back if they somehow did get an opportunity to leave a message. This is by far the easiest fixable question on this entire survey. The philosophy of state government has to change drastically. Illinoisans pay a great deal of money for service. They deserve to get some.\n\nQ: Should Illinois use a non-partisam process to redraw legislative districts?\n\nA: The companion to term limits is Fair Maps. I drafted a Fair Maps Amendment citizen initiative that presented a legally rock-solid way to upend the corrupt system of partisan mapping in Illinois.\n\nUnfortunately, every few years, you see cynical attempts by electorally vulnerable Democrats to file fair maps amendments, knowing full well these efforts will never see the light of day.\n\nWe saw it in 2016 when then-Rep. Jack Franks was allowed to bring his amendment to the House Floor (where it garnered 105 votes), with the understanding that the Senate would not take it up.\n\nAnd we saw Ms. Costa Howard do the same thing this year, filing another dead-on-arrival amendment just two months before the deadline.\n\nThe media, private industry, and good-government groups should coalesce behind a citizen initiative that meets the requirements of the Illinois Constitution, to avoid the partisan logjam in the General Assembly. My Fair Maps Amendment is one way to do that, but any system would be better than the current one.\n\nQ: The graduated income tax is designed with the intent to reduce taxes for 97 percent of Illinoisans. Do you believe that will happen? Why or why not? What assurances can be given to voters?\n\nA: I stand firmly against the graduated income tax hike. We're in recovery mode. Consumers and small businesses will be a huge part of that. Taking more money away from them isn't the way to encourage growth.\n\nBut Terra Costa Howard, after promising the people of this district she'd oppose the graduated tax hike, turned around and voted for it. There is almost NO savings for anyone with this proposal. In my experience in the General Assembly, I saw up close the amount of wasteful spending and poor fiscal policy in our state. Budgets passed always exceeded anticipated income, and even income numbers were artificially inflated as part of an obscene effort to call these budgets \"balanced.\"\n\nIn a state with an insatiable appetite for spending, feeding more taxpayer dollars is not the solution. There are numerous programs which are simply routinely re-appropriated, without careful assessment of effectiveness or necessity. Before anyone asks an Illinois taxpayer for a single penny more, there should be a full accounting of all of the money this state already raises through every tax and fee we already levy.\n\nQ: Describe at least two circumstances in which you have shown or would show a willingness and capacity to act independently of the direction or demands of party leadership.\n\nA: In my two terms in the General Assembly, I shepherded 32 bills into law as Chief House Sponsor -- more than any other second-term legislator, Republican or Democrat. That's required me to work across the aisle on a regular basis, on a variety of issues and areas of law.\n\nI stood against my party on some significant issues, as well. One of the biggest was opposing an unbalanced budget that spent $39.7 billion, at least $1.2 billion more than we had funds available. I'm serious about fiscal reform and responsibility, and our state constitution requires a balanced budget. The Democrat majority refused to even consider a spending bill that lived within our means, and the people of Illinois suffered, and continue to suffer, the consequences of that action with more and more debt. As well, when the governor from my party broke his promise to Illinoisans not to spend precious taxpayer dollars on elective abortions, I opposed him, directly and publicly, not with a press release issued from my basement but with a full downtown media conference that you saw on the evening news. While I'm still a Republican, folks in our area appreciate my strong Independent streak.\n\nQ: How would you rate the governor's handling of the COVID-19 crisis? Does the legislature need to have more input and influence in establishing rules and policies related to stemming the spread of the disease? What would you have done differently, if anything? If nothing, please say so.\n\nA: The rating for Pritzker has to be \"Incomplete,\" since we are still midway through the pandemic. Next year we'll know the impact of the governor's orders on the physical, mental, and economic health of our residents versus those of neighboring states.\n\nThe legislature hid in the basement and shirked its duty to lead, to what should be its eternal shame: having one man run Illinois unilaterally for half a year violates our system of checks and balances.\n\nGoing forward, we need a full review of the high infections and deaths in long-term-care facilities -- we don't know whether this was due to the governor's actions, or some other cause.\n\nDuPage should never have been \"zoned\" with Cook County for phasing openings. And it was wrong to ban small family retailers from in-person sales of their products, while large retailers could sell those same products.\n\nPritzker botched unemployment insurance, leaving the jobless with no one to answer the phone, trying to navigate a broken website, and suffering the indignity of their personal identification details put on the internet. Thousands of government employees across Illinois were at home who would have been glad to handle unemployment phone lines.\n\nQ: Regardless of whether the federal government provides assistance, what is the impact of the pandemic on the state's economic outlook and what immediate and long-term actions should be taken to address it? Would you support increasing taxes to pay for COVID-19 response or to make up for lost revenue related to COVID-19?\n\nA: The last thing our state government needs is yet another special reason to tax residents. Our state may have been the most ill-prepared state in the country with literally no emergency fund and unpaid bills and liabilities that are beyond comparison.\n\nGiven we are still dealing with the pandemic and our businesses are still severely restricted in many cases, we can't even assess the economic cost of the pandemic. As businesses come on line in the recovery, we should do everything we possibly can to provide incentives for growth and productivity.\n\nOur best chance at economic recovery is more people working and paying taxes and companies maximizing their productivity and sales. This legislature has been content in normal times to pass out of balance budgets that spend billions more than available. Every other state is prioritizing and figuring out how to deal with reduced revenue, pandemic or not. The General Assembly needs to do the same. There's already a huge tax increase on the ballot, with a new discussion on taxing retirement income. It's time for responsible fiscal policy that doesn't conclude that every revenue issue is solved by socking it to Illinois taxpayers.\n\nQ: Should Illinois prohibit lawmakers from lobbying other levels of government? Should lawmakers be prohibited from becoming lobbyists after their term in office? For how long?\n\nA: Yes, of course. You can't serve two masters: a legislator is supposed to be dedicated to the service of the people, not special interest groups. Legislators should be banned from lobbying for the longest time allowed under the Constitution. Whether that's 10 years, or 5 years, or 2 years, I'm for it.\n\nQ: What should the state do to address the still-growing problems with its key pension programs?\n\nA: Stop ignoring the pension problem is the immediate answer. We've let this wound fester for decades. Pension holidays had become the norm. Lower than anticipated returns on investments made it even worse. And budgets that were cheered, when every sane person knew they were wildly out of balance.\n\nThe only answer to our hundreds of billions in unfunded pension liabilities is to reform the structure of the systems, before they go bankrupt. Reform is possible: Arizona has achieved it, as have numerous other states. Once you reform, then you have to maintain the discipline to pay the bills when they come due.\n\nQ: Protesters have massed in the streets in Chicago and other cities across Illinois for greater social justice and changes in the funding and responsibilities for police. How significant a role does systemic racism play in limiting equal opportunity in Illinois? To the degree that it exists, what should be done about it? What, if any, changes should be made in funding and duties of police?\n\nA: Two domestic terrorists recently tried to blow up the Lombard Police Department. Just a few weeks ago, three Cook County residents with guns broke into homes in Wheaton and Lombard, seeking to rape and murder sleeping residents. I stand firmly for public safety and in support our police officers who face incredible danger, especially in the current environment.\n\nAs for systemic racism, the primary solution is providing a world-class education to all children, no matter their family income or ZIP code. Imagine the impact of a full generation of highly educated, career-ready young people ready to enter the workforce and public life on systemic racism.\n\nUnlike those who want to condemn poor children to terrible schools in Chicago and elsewhere, I've taken the tough votes to get those kids the resources they need. On other policing issues, Illinois is already a leader on reforms: Back in 2015, we banned chokeholds like the one that killed George Floyd this year, along with regulating body cameras, in a bipartisan measure that I supported.\n\nQ: Do you believe climate change is caused by human activity? What steps should state government be taking to address the issue?\n\nA: Obviously, human activities impact the climate. I was proud to support the Future Energy Jobs Act, which made Illinois a national leader in clean energy, brought renewable energy spending that was out of state back to Illinois, and created numerous jobs in clean energy technologies.\n\nWe should be constantly looking for ways to improve our clean energy profile, while maintaining two critical factors: (1.) keep energy prices down for the sake of our residents and our business community who need low-cost electricity and (2.) maintain sources of energy that are rock-solid reliable during bad weather, from polar vortexes to heat waves, so we avoid the blackouts being suffered today by folks in California and Germany.\n\nSometimes the sun doesn't shine and wind turbines don't turn, so you need other technologies to keep the lights on."}], "Peter Breen attended St. Ignatius College Prep.": [{"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/opinion/ct-sta-slowik-high-school-reunion-st-1017-story.html", "page_content": "Thank you for supporting our journalism.

That\u2019s how at least one person felt after Saturday\u2019s 35-year reunion for the class of 1983 at St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago.\n\nClassmates from Beverly, other neighborhoods and suburbs seemed to enjoy seeing old friends and reminiscing about good times. Reunions serve that purpose by providing a reason for people who share a connection to get together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who had not returned to the school for many years were awed by the transformation. Jesuits founded the school in 1869 at 1076 W. Roosevelt Road. The original school building is one of only five public structures that predates the 1871 Chicago Fire, and the edifice is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nTours of the campus revealed stunning architecture in places like the Brunswick Room, which once housed a natural history collection and was off-limits to students 35 years ago. Beginning in the 1980s, funds were raised to restore intricate woodwork and other features in libraries and other rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brunswick Room at St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago originally housed a natural history collection. Prior to a restoration in 1985 it was used as a lounge and library for Jesuits who taught at the school. (Ted Slowik / Daily Southtown)\n\nA freshman in 1979 attended a completely different school prior to the restoration. Frost formed on windows and chilly drafts blew into classrooms during some of the coldest and snowiest Chicago winters on record. Conditions were just as bad in what students back then called the \u201cnew\u201d wing, which was completed in 1895.\n\nAcademics were rigorous. A first-year student\u2019s schedule likely included English, world history, typing, algebra/geometry, religious studies, speech, Latin/Greek or another foreign language and physical education.\n\nStudents formed friendships and sought ways to have fun without causing trouble, or least getting caught. Discipline consisted of \u201cjug,\u201d an after-school detention that was regularly crowded with miscreants. A common infraction that landed pupils in jug was getting caught using a stairwell that was reserved for use by faculty and other adults.\n\nPassing periods were so crowded in the four-story building that one stairwell was designated for traffic going up and another was the \u201cdown\u201d staircase. Students were frequently challenged to make it from one class to another in time.\n\nThe \"up\" staircase at St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago was crowded with students during passing periods when students from the class of 1983 attended the school. (Ted Slowik / Daily Southtown)\n\nThe fact that the school was crowded then is a testament to leaders who were concerned about declining enrollment in the 1970s. They decided to admit females to the formerly all-boys school, and 1979 was the first year girls attended St. Ignatius as freshmen.\n\nPlanners staged annual fundraisers that featured Bob Hope, Ella Fitzgerald and other big names. Alumni responded with generous donations. Philanthropic St. Ignatius graduates tended to excel in business, medicine, law, government, politics and entertainment.\n\nWell-known alumni include President Barack Obama\u2019s former Chief of Staff William Daley \u201966; Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan \u201960; U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski \u201984, D-Western Springs; actor Bob Newhart \u201947; former Cook County Board President Todd Stroger \u201981; and comedian and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer John Mulaney \u201900.\n\nFinancial support has expanded the 23-acre campus and funded numerous new buildings since the 1980s. Capital campaigns have enriched the educational experience with top-notch facilities, including the 380-seat McLaughlin Theatre, which features the Bob Newhart Stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe University Village/Little Italy neighborhood around St. Ignatius also has significantly changed since the 1970s. Gone are the public housing units along Taylor Street and the original Maxwell Street market featured in \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d film of 1980.\n\nThe neighborhood has gentrified and transformed into a desirable near-West Side locale surrounding the University of Illinois at Chicago campus. It bears little resemblance to what a 14-year-old from the western suburbs experienced in 1979.\n\nPeople in their 50s today might feel the same way if they attended Marist, Marian Catholic, Mother McAuley, Brother Rice, St. Laurence, Mount Carmel, Leo or other Catholic high school in the 1970s and 1980s. All buildings and neighborhoods have undergone some degree of physical transformation over the past 35 years.\n\nSpaces that have been newly constructed or significantly renovated do nothing to stoke memories of one\u2019s formative years. What was an asphalt parking lot at St. Ignatius is now a beautiful garden. It\u2019s stunning and glorious, but it wasn\u2019t there in 1983.\n\nVisiting a place to see spaces is one reason to attend a high school reunion. More likely, the wish to see former friends and classmates compels one to attend. In my case, I hadn\u2019t returned to St. Ignatius mainly because I was not officially a member of the class of 1983 \u2014 I transferred after my sophomore year in 1981.\n\nI finished up at Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, where I was active with the student-run radio station and newspaper. Last month, a couple hundred members of the LTHS class of 1983 got together for a 35th reunion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had stayed in touch through Facebook with some former St. Ignatius classmates, and a couple persuaded me to attend this year\u2019s reunion. At both my recent high school reunions, I asked people what they thought about the recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nDaily Southtown Twice-weekly News updates from the south suburbs delivered every Monday and Wednesday By submitting your email to receive this newsletter, you agree to our Subscriber Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy >\n\nWe\u2019re the same age, after all \u2014 53.

The school was founded in Chicago in 1869 by Fr. Arnold Damen, S.J., a Dutch missionary to the United States.\n\nHistory\n\nInception\n\nIn 1836, the Dutch Jesuit Fr. Arnold Damen, S.J. (March 20, 1815, Leur, Netherlands \u2013 January 1, 1890, Omaha, Nebraska),[13] was recruited to work with Native Americans in the Dakotas by Fr. Peter De Smet, S.J. In 1844 he was ordained a priest in Missouri. In 1857, Damen was first assigned to Chicago to start a parish for Irish immigrants on Chicago's near-West Side, then an area of the sprawling prairie. The construction of the Holy Family Church was completed in 1860.[13]\n\nThe culmination of Father Arnold J. Damen, S.J.'s work in Chicago, the St. Ignatius campus was opened in 1870 as St. Ignatius College. Loyola University originated from this institution but, since 1922, St. Ignatius has operated solely as a college preparatory school. The Second Empire-style edifice is among the oldest in the city, a rare and distinctive example of institutional designs pre-dating the Chicago Fire of 1871.\n\nAdmissions\n\nDemographics\n\nThe demographic breakdown by race/ethnicity of the 1,373 students enrolled for the 2019\u20132020 school year was:[1]\n\nEnrollment by Race/Ethnicity 2019\u20132020[1] White Hispanic Black Two or More Races Asian American Indian/Alaska Native 914 173 155 79 47 5\n\nExtracurricular activities\n\nAthletics\n\nSaint Ignatius competes in the Chicago Catholic League (CCL) and the Girls Catholic Athletic Conference (GCAC)[14] and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state. The school's teams are stylized as the \"Wolfpack\".\n\nNotable alumni\n\nNotable faculty\n\nDavid Abidor (born 1992), assistant soccer coach, and soccer player[31]\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nDirectory of Private Schools (2005).

In fact, it\u2019s probably fair to say Mrs Coffey, now aged 95, had a huge influence on the little boy who grew up to become Principal of Adelaide\u2019s Saint Ignatius\u2019 College.\n\n\u201cYes, my first teacher was my mum,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was in Year 1 in the local parish school in Henley South with Mum as the teacher. I wasn\u2019t allowed to call her Mum, I had to call her Mrs Coffey.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, she\u2019s still around, frail, but mentally she\u2019s terribly sharp. We have the same conversations we\u2019ve always had. I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d Peter is the first lay principal to head Saint Ignatius\u2019 College, a Catholic school founded on the Ignatian tradition by Jesuit priests in 1951, and lead the 1,365 students across senior and junior school campuses.\n\nThe Senior School, from Years 7\u201312, is located in Athelstone while the Junior School, from reception to Year 6, is in Norwood, next door to Ignatius Early Years where an additional 100 families send their preschoolers.\n\nAt enrolment interviews, we talk about the fact that we don\u2019t actually enrol students, we enrol families.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively young school, turning just 70 next year, with Peter having shared half those years as a student for a decade and a member of staff for 25 years. His deep connection with Saint Ignatius\u2019 College undoubtedly benefited his application to become Principal in 2018 and help break the tradition of appointing Jesuit priests.\n\nIt was a rigorous process and a position attracting numerous applicants, but Peter clearly had an edge with his experience in multiple roles at the school including Year Level Coordinator, Dean of Students, Dean of Administration and Head of Senior School.\n\nAs Principal he shares duties with Jesuit Rector, Fr Peter Hosking. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for the conduct of the college, while Fr Hosking as Rector contributes to the mission and identity of the school, our faithfulness to our Ignatian charism and spirituality.\n\n\u201cThis journey has meant an awful lot to me, starting all the way back in 1970 in Year 4 and continuing nearly 50 years later to become the school\u2019s first lay principal,\u201d he reflects.\n\n\u201cWhy did I get the job? Perhaps because I was so well-versed and well-formed in Ignatian spirituality. I\u2019d been in so many different roles, not just in curriculum, but also in pastoral positions. Other than grounds and maintenance, there\u2019s pretty much not been a role I haven\u2019t had some experience in.\n\n\u201cI also have a very strong connection to the community,\u201d he adds. \u201cI may have been seen as a logical bridge from having a priest, a religious head, lead the school to somebody well-known in the community who also understood Saint Ignatius\u2019 College in its context really, really well.\u201d\n\nPeter admits he was always attracted to teaching, even as a young boy, but influenced by an older brother and a curiosity to explore other avenues he went on to study economics at the University of Adelaide.\n\nHowever, with his passion to teach still niggling, he added a Diploma of Education to his skills. \u201cYou know how it is in adolescence when you think you should try other things,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cIt was like that with me so I went into economics, not really knowing what I was going to do, nor where I was going to finish up. But I still liked the idea of teaching so I decided to do a Diploma of Education just to give it a try. I\u2019ve never looked back.\n\n\n\nSaint Ignatius\u2019 College acted quickly when COVID-19 emerged. While some families kept their children at school, many others opted to access online learning via https://ignatius.sa.edu.au/student-life/online-learningduring-covid-19/. Meanwhile, fee concessions were provided according to need and capacity to assist families financially impacted by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cTeaching is a vocation. If you find something that you\u2019re really passionate about and you really enjoy, and are probably good at, then it doesn\u2019t feel like work. It feels like it\u2019s life, it\u2019s energy, it\u2019s meaning.\u201d\n\nBefore returning to Saint Ignatius\u2019 College as Religious Education Coordinator in 1995, Peter taught at St Michael\u2019s College and spent a year in Papua New Guinea teaching at a remote mission school accessible only by a dirt track and attended by students who also ran the local family farms.\n\nIt was a tough year, dogged even further when he became seriously ill from malaria, but it\u2019s a period in his life he regards as crucial for teaching him the practicalities of economic development and the relationship between rich and poor countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d taught economics and I actually wanted to experience its impact on a developing country,\u201d he explains. \u201cI wanted to see the way the world was for the haves and the have-nots.\n\n\u201cWe pumped our own water and generated our own electricity and while the kids weren\u2019t nearly as sophisticated as Australian schoolkids \u2013 they were quite innocent in a way \u2013 in many aspects, they were just the same. They loved their friends, they loved learning, they loved being involved in what was going on. Naturally, there were some rascals and there were some good ones. But it was largely relational and very much about community, a tight one at that because it was so self-contained and remote.\u201d\n\nAt Saint Ignatius\u2019 College, Peter, just like his mum, is Mr Coffey to all his students, including those related to him. And there are a lot of them. His son Sebastian is in Year 10, there are 10 nieces and nephews scattered throughout other years and Peter\u2019s wife, Miriam, is on staff.\n\nOne can only imagine the challenge for Miriam\u2019s father, John Doyle, a former scholar and Chief Justice, when it comes to choosing between weekend sports with 11 grandchildren at the school. With his family completely \u201csurrounded\u201d by Saint Ignatius, Peter values and appreciates the contribution the parents offer to the school.\n\n\u201cAt enrolment interviews, we talk about the fact that we don\u2019t actually enrol students, we enrol families. I love the community I\u2019m a part of, we\u2019re part of a grand endeavour, really engaged in something that is quite extraordinary. Young people are the future of our world. They are idealistic and they\u2019re passionate with all these gifts and graces they\u2019re growing into and developing. And the staff I work with are fantastic.\u201d\n\nProudly supported by:\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.ignatius.org/about-us/mission--vision", "page_content": "It is difficult for us in the beginning of the 21st century to believe that our beloved Saint Ignatius had its roots in what was then an upstart town on the prairie. In 1850, Chicago consisted of little more than nine square miles. Outbreaks of disease such as cholera, smallpox, and tuberculosis were common. Yet Chicago, on the doorstep to the rich soil of the Midwest, located on an inland port and connected to the Mississippi River by the Illinois and Michigan Canal, soon became the shipping point to the east for agricultural commodities. The new technology of the railroad further enhanced the city's stature as a transportation hub. Manufacturing and retail made household names of Field, Palmer, and McCormick.\n\nChicago had grown from a village of 3,000 in the 1830s to a population of 60,652 by 1854. An influx of immigrants, including considerable numbers of Catholics from Ireland and Germany, came to work on the railroads, in the mills, and in the slaughterhouses. The need for clergy to serve this influx was great.\n\n\n\nThe United States was a missionary country in the eyes of the Church, much as we view third- world countries today. The famous Jesuit missionary to the United States, Peter DeSmet, often made journeys to his native Belgium to recruit young men to become missionaries to take up the great task of serving the Church in the United States. One of these young recruits was Arnold Damen.\n\n\n\nAfter he completed his theology studies, Fr. Damen was ordained in 1844. He served as associate pastor and pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Saint Louis. In 1857, at the request of Most Reverend Anthony O'Reagan, Bishop of Chicago, Fr. Damen was assigned by Rev. J.B. Druyts, superior of the vice province of Missouri, to establish the first permanent Jesuit house in Chicago.\n\n\n\nThe Bishop of Chicago first offered to turn over to the Jesuits Holy Name Church along with the nascent University of St. Mary of the Lake. Fr. Damen, however, wished to found his mission with his own parish in what was then a sparsely inhabited part of the city. Critics questioned Fr. Damen's sanity at establishing a parish on the prairie southwest of the central city. How, some were wondering, could anyone build and expect to support a parish where there are no parishioners? Nevertheless, land was inexpensive and Fr. Damen answered his critics by saying, \"I shall not go to the people; I shall draw the people to me.\" Thus did Fr. Damen set up the present Holy Family parish.\n\n\n\nThe parish flourished so that within one year the church building had to be enlarged. More and more Irish immigrants were settling the prairie around the church as Fr. Damen had envisioned.\n\n\n\nSoon there was a need to educate the children of the parish and thus began a series of grammar schools staffed both by the Religious of the Sacred Heart and the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. By 1865, nine hundred boys and five hundred girls attended the parish schools.\n\n\n\nAs early as 1862, the Jesuit board of consultors to the Missouri vice province decided that there ought to be a Jesuit college in Chicago and it appears that a college was always in Fr. Damen's plans from the time he reached Chicago. The time, however, was not opportune. The country was engaged in the Civil War, and the cost of borrowing money was high. The new University of St. Mary of the Lake closed because of financial difficulties. Furthermore, Holy Family Parish consisted largely of newly arrived, mainly poor, Irish immigrants. It is a tribute to Fr. Damen's fund-raising ability that he could secure the funds for the Holy Family Church and the system of grammar schools.\n\n\n\nFr. Damen's tactics and financial management became legendary within the parish. Once, when invited to stay for dinner while visiting one of the families in the parish, Fr. Damen is said to have replied, \"I'm in great trouble today and what would be better than a dinner to me would be a helping from the sugar bowl.\" The sugar bowl contained this family's loose cash, from which this parishioner invited Fr. Damen to help himself. It was also said about Fr. Damen that \"whenever he wants a big collection, one-half of his sermon is about hellfire and the other half about St. Patrick.\" Another time, in an act smacking of showmanship, Fr. Damen auctioned his horse and buggy to raise funds for the parish.\n\n\n\nFr. Damen's management of funds also would raise a few eyebrows today for his audacity in using leverage to achieve his goals. The parish and its schools demanded a large amount of property, little of which during the early years was owned free and clear. It was Fr. Damen's practice to use whatever equity the parish held in its properties to borrow money to purchase more land immediately. The parish property was valued at $250,000 in 1865, according to a report written by Fr. Damen to his superior.\n\n\n\nSuch a far-flung enterprise, however, could not rely solely on the generosity of the early parishioners and Fr. Damen's aggressive style of fund-raising. Furthermore, the provincial insisted that no funds for the college be raised from Holy Family parish. Whence, then, would come the funds to start the college? Fr. Damen was well known throughout the country as a preacher and year after year he spent the months from September to June traveling the country giving parish missions. Not only did he employ his stipends toward the needs of his parish back home in Chicago, but he also would make a direct appeal to the congregations he was addressing on the mission circuit. It was especially through such appeals to people all over the United States, people who had never been to Chicago, that Fr. Damen raised the money to begin construction of Saint Ignatius in 1867. Still, Fr. Coosemans, the provincial, believed that the time still was not ripe. Fortunately, Fr. Coosemans was called to Rome on business and Fr. Damen, shrewd as a serpent, asked for and received permission to begin construction from Fr. Keller, the acting superior. When Fr. Coosemans returned from Rome, he discovered that the foundation of Saint Ignatius was completed and work on the first floor begun. There was no turning back.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, $100,000 was needed to complete construction, which required more borrowing. Fr. Coosemans, citing the debt Fr. Damen owed the province for the construction of Holy Family, refused any more credit for the construction of the college. Interest rates in a country just emerging from the Civil War were prohibitive at 10 to 12%. New sources had to be found and Fr. Damen turned to his native Holland.\n\n\n\nOne of Fr. Damen's companions on the missions was a fellow Hollander, Fr. Van Goch, whose brother was a wealthy businessman in Holland. Fr. Damen requested that Fr. Van Goch contact his brother to ascertain whether he could lend the money. Fr. Van Goch's brother agreed and, having obtained permission from both the provincial and the father general, Fr. Damen set out for Holland to close the deal. In a report to Fr. General Becks, written in the winter of 1868, Fr. Damen gives a glimpse of his business acumen:\n\n\n\nNow, to borrow money in this country I shall be obliged to pay ten per cent and perhaps more. This interest is too much and I am not in favor of paying so much. Therefore we have written to Holland to Mr. Van Goch, a very rich man, the brother of Father Van Goch, my companion on the missions. He has replied that if we come to Holland and give him the necessary security, he will give us all the money we need to finish the college, at four percent. That will save us six thousand dollars a year, and this saving, put out at interest here, will in ten years, with added interest, enable us to save more than a hundred thousand dollars. Thus in ten years we shall have paid all the debt of the college. This we can undertake without any difficulty or danger. The revenues of our Chicago house are at least thirty thousand dollars a year, of which we can save fifteen thousand dollars surely. Our other Fathers say twenty thousand, but I shall put it at fifteen thousand. Consequently in six or seven years we shall be able to pay all the debt, even without counting any revenue from the college.\n\n\n\nThese funds were enough to complete the part of the original building running north-south, plus the east wing on the front of the building facing Roosevelt Road. This L-shaped structure was ready to begin instruction with thirty-seven students and a faculty of three plus a president, prefect of studies (principal), and a prefect of discipline. It is worthwhile to pause here to emphasize that the construction of Saint Ignatius College was funded almost exclusively by persons with no connection to Holy Family parish and no connection to Chicago. The college's early donors most certainly never saw the results of their generosity. All looked promising for the new institution as it began its second year of operation with sixty-one boys enrolled. Then on 8 October, the Chicago fire began at Jefferson and DeKoven Streets, just five blocks from Saint Ignatius. Much legend has sprung up in the Saint Ignatius community about how the flames were headed toward the school, how Fr. Damen stood on the porch and prayed that his beloved church and college be saved. God heard his prayer. With flames about to reach the new college, the wind suddenly shifted and destroyed the central part of the city. Like all myths, there is a gram of truth to this one, which over time through exaggeration and confusion of facts became a wonderful story. In fact, Fr. Damen was in Brooklyn at the time, giving a parish mission. When he had heard of the great fire, he spent that night in a vigil praying that the college, the church, and his parishioners be spared. He made a vow that if his prayers were answered, he would keep in Holy Family seven lights burning in front of the picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. He then took the next available train to Chicago and arrived to find most of the city in ashes, but his parish and college spared. He kept his vow; to this day, seven lights burn in front of the picture of Our Lady in Holy Family Church. It is true that during the fire, the wind shifted, but not on the very doorstep of the school as the popular legend has it. Rather, the fire never came west of Jefferson Street where it had begun, well away from Saint Ignatius. As one of the few buildings left intact, Saint Ignatius immediately became a relief center and shelter. Among those who moved into the college were the Benedictines and the orphans of the Sisters of St. Joseph who occupied the classrooms in the main part of the original building, and the Bishop of Chicago, John Foley, who set up his residence and office on the first floor of the west wing where now is the Deans' Office. It is amazing that, with the demands put upon Saint Ignatius as a shelter and relief station, classes resumed a mere two weeks after the fire.\n\n\n\nThe term \"college\" as we conceive it does not adequately describe the institution or its course of studies. The concept of a high school was still in its infancy and the curriculum offered at Saint Ignatius ran the spectrum from junior high school to the bachelor's degree. A course was offered in basic grammar and arithmetic for those boys still needing to acquire or improve these skills. The next higher course of studies was a three-year program called Humanities, which concentrated on Latin, Greek, literature, and rhetoric. The final year leading up to the bachelor degree was called Philosophy. In addition, Saint Ignatius offered a commercial course, which concentrated on bookkeeping, business mathematics, and office skills for those not working toward the bachelor's degree. Saint Ignatius was thus a more comprehensive institution than it is today.\n\n\n\nAttendance rose steadily during the first decade from the original thirty-seven students in the first year to 215 by the end of the decade. It appears, though, that attendance was quite fluid and that very few students remained at Saint Ignatius for the full course leading to the bachelor's degree. In the academic year 1878-79, for example, there was no class higher than the second year of humanities and no degrees were awarded. This should not be surprising considering the period under discussion. One must remember that the regulations for attending school were not as strict as today and that there was no mandate that children attend school until the age of sixteen. Such decisions were left up to the family. Consider also the clientele of the school, made up of the sons of newly arrived immigrants. Those of us familiar with the stories of our own families know that the children were needed to go to work to help support the family. Education meant training for a better job than one's parents and so, many students went to school long enough to obtain job skills. Consider also that very few individuals, almost exclusively men, went to college and received degrees. Colleges and universities were the preserve of the well-off and offered a classical curriculum such as the one leading to the Saint Ignatius bachelor's degree and not geared to providing job skills. Furthermore, in an age when academic standards were really standards and little attention was paid to a student's self esteem, a survey of the student records from the early years shows that few received grades higher than \"C,\" and many received lower grades. So it appears that the attrition rate due to inadequate performance was higher than today. Given these factors operating against higher education, it is amazing that the college division managed to survive. Yet it is a tribute to Fr. Damen and the Jesuits that they had the vision to offer the opportunity for advancement through higher education where there seemed to be a small market for it.\n\n\n\nAttendance steadily increased through the '80s and '90s until, by 1894, 400 young men were attending Saint Ignatius. The school needed more space and it was decided that a new building was needed. Work began on the \"Hoeffler Building,\" known today as the \"1895 Building.\" Generations of students down through the 1970s have also tagged it the \"New Wing.\" In addition to new classrooms, the new building housed \"state of the art\" chemistry and physics labs that remained in use until 1992. It also was the first part of the physical plant to be wired for electricity. The new building marked the end of the first twenty-five years of Saint Ignatius and signaled further expansion of the Jesuit education apostolate in Chicago in the new century.

While many of our varsity sailors have been competing at a high level for years, no previous sailing experience is required to join, and a developmental program is in place for inexperienced sailors.\n\n\n\nMost sailing is in a two-person boat called a 420. The 420 is the most popular boat for both high school and collegiate sailing and is a slightly smaller version of the 470 used in the Olympics by both men and women. In addition, there are some opportunities to sail the single-handed Laser class and the larger four-person Sonar keelboat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sail in both the fall and spring seasons. The fall season starts just after Labor Day and continues until just before Thanksgiving. The spring season begins as soon as the ice leaves the harbor in March and continues until Memorial Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnatius Sailing uses Chicago Yacht Club\u2019s coaches and facilities. Detailed information on the program is available here. We practice at Belmont Harbor together with students from several other area high schools. Practices are 2-3 nights a week and on Saturdays. Regatta competitions are always held on weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegattas are most often held in the Chicago metro area, but can be as far away as Minneapolis or Detroit. Parent chaperones will always travel with the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compete as a member of the Interscholastic Sailing Association (ISSA) which includes over 300 schools nationwide. Our Midwest region includes over 30 schools from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois. At regattas, we typically compete with 10-20 other schools from Minneapolis, Detroit, southern Wisconsin, northern Indiana and Chicago-area schools that include New Trier, Loyola, Evanston, and Lake Forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint Ignatius Sailing has a tradition of consistently being one of the top schools in the Midwest region.

In 1958, Professor Xie Xide (1921-2000) founded the major of Semiconductor Physics, the predecessor of the school. Relevant doctoral programs were initiated in 1984. In 1988, Microelectronics and Solid-state Electronics was rated as a national key discipline; in May 2015, the school became one of the first national demonstration school of microelectronics.\n\nWith presence at both Handan campus and Zhangjiang campus of Fudan University, the School of Microelectronics hosts a couple of national, provincial, and ministerial research platforms. It has founded (1) in 1992 the National Key Laboratory of Application Specific Integrated Circuit and System (Fudan University), the only national key lab in the field of integrated circuit, (2) in 2013 the Yangtze River Delta Collaborative Innovation Center for Integrated Circuit Design and Manufacture, a project led by the school and approved by Shanghai Education Commission, (3) in 2014 the International Training Base (Shanghai) of National Integrated Circuit Talents, and (4) in 2018 the National Integrated Circuit Innovation Center, a project under the national strategy of Manufacturing Power. The school is currently focusing on the establishment of the International Innovation Center for Micro/Nano Electronics and Quantum, the mainstay of the Zhangjiang-Fudan International Innovation Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjects and Programs\n\nUndergraduate program: The undergraduate major of Microelectronic Science and Engineering enrolls about 120 full-time students annually. In accordance with the 2020 Fudan Initiative to Enhance First-class Undergraduate Education, the school designs a \u201c2+X years\u201d cultivation system that integrates the six educational approaches of classroom learning, Fudan College sessions, research and entrepreneurship, social practices, overseas study, and new media. The integrated system that involves all faculty members and covers the entire teaching proceedings offers wider choices to the students and unleashes their potential.\n\nPostgraduate program: The major of Semiconductor Physics, the predecessor of the School of Microelectronics, launched its doctoral program in 1984. Microelectronics and Solid-state Electronics was rated as a national key discipline in 1988. The school has now built an all-around postgraduate study syllabus, providing both master and doctoral degree programs. It has launched a master program, a doctoral program, a M.Eng program, and an engineering doctorate program. Every year, around 200 admitted postgraduates receive instructions from accomplished faculty with rigorous attitude and rich experience. The school has 31 master supervisors and 33 doctoral supervisors, employs more than 50 senior instructors from enterprises, and has co-founded internship and training bases with national key institutions and renowned enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\n\nThe school upholds a talent development strategy combining introduction with cultivation of faculty members. Its well-structured faculty is characterized by innovative minds and world-class academic performance. The 136 faculty members of the school include 69 full-time teaching staff, 22 engineering test technicians, 9 administrative staff, 8 project-based researchers, 6 project assistants, and 22 research team assistants. Among them are 40 professors, 34 associate professors, 1 academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 4 awardees of the fund offered by the China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, 4 awardees of the fund offered by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars., and 1 research team whose project has been supported by the Ministry of Education. In addition, the school has employed a number of experts as chair professors from universities and enterprises at home and abroad.\n\nIn recent years, the school has paid high attention to talent development by organizing a special working group to facilitate general coordination. The school has built a practical and efficient mechanism of talent introduction that responds quickly to the need of teaching and research and makes employment decisions based on comprehensive considerations. The mechanism helps gather a large group of advanced talents of both integrity and capability. The school is also forming a talent cultivation system with Fudan characteristics in accordance with Excellence 2025, a talent cultivation initiative of the university. The initiative cultivates talents based on their specializations, which contributes to the goal of building a first-class faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\nThe School of Microelectronics continues to enhance its research capability, as required by the Fudan initiative Progression 2025. With emphases on major platforms, research teams, projects, and achievements, the school relentlessly enhances its core competitiveness in scientific research, expecting a role transition from a follower to a leader. It is now constructing a technological innovation system in accordance with the national major development strategy and the development plan of the university. Led by strategic missions of the country, the system focuses on disciplinary research and develops disciplinary transformation and application. Currently, the school hosts the following major research platforms and innovation centers: the National Key Laboratory of Application Specific Integrated Circuit and System, the National Integrated Circuit Innovation Center, the Yangtze River Delta Collaborative Innovation Center for Integrated Circuit Design and Manufacture, and the International Innovation Center for Micro/Nano Electronics and Quantum (under construction).\n\nIn recent years, the school has made remarkable achievements in such research fields as the third type of storage technology, the two-dimensional neuromorphic devices, and the hypervelocity quasi-nonvolatile memory. On July 5, 2018, a professor of the school was awarded the first Best Paper Prize by Integration, the VLSI Journal at the 15th International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design in Prague. Several other papers have been brought to the International Solid-state Circuits Conference (ISSCC), the foremost forum on integrated circuit, and included in the conference publications.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\nThe School of Microelectronics plays an active role in international cooperation. The International Training Base of National Integrated Circuit Talents, founded in November 2014, draws support from Shanghai, a city of industrial concentration and technological advancement. It incubates disciplinary integration and facilitates international communication and cooperation, expecting to cultivate more well-qualified professionals with a global vision for the integrated circuit industry of the Yangtze River Delta and the country at large. It has made notable progress in introducing global talents, cooperating with global universities, and high-end training. The school is committed to the construction of Zhangjiang Comprehensive National Science Center, the introduction of faculty from enterprises and abroad, and the integration of the curriculum with global perspectives, aiming at taking the lead in faculty capability and education quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}
