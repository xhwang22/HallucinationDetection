But early efforts to protect themselves met with a lot of flak.\n\n\n\nWe used no mattress on our hands,\n\nNo cage upon our face;\n\nWe stood right up and caught the ball,\n\nWith courage and with grace.\n\n\u2014 Harry Ellard, \u201cThe Reds of Sixty-Nine\u201d (1880s)\n\nThe field position denoted on your scorecard as 2 has never been an easy job. Errant balls, foul tips, and flying bats are all a source of pain for catchers. Collisions at the plate occur with regularity, some more painful than others. The backstops from baseball\u2019s first fifty years endured daily physical punishment, all without the luxury of today\u2019s protective equipment. Virtues such as strength, stamina, and courage in collisions were in high demand.\n\nNo protection short of a bunker could have spared twenty-three-year-old Ray Fosse the career-impacting injury he sustained in the 1970 All-Star Game. Catcher-turned-announcer Tim McCarver says he still suffers from nerve damage in his neck caused by back-to-back plate collisions a quarter of a century ago. Today, catchers often put their bodies literally on the line, most often the one on the third-base side.\n\nCatchers are expected to take their lumps without grumbling. But the early efforts of catchers to protect themselves met with a lot of flak. A typical reaction came from the crowd at the Polo Grounds when the New York Giants opened the 1907 season against the Philadelphia Phillies. As the Giants took the field, star catcher and Hall of Famer Roger Bresnahan looked more like a goaltender than a backstop when he squatted behind the plate in a pair of thickly upholstered shin guards.\n\nIt was the first time a catcher had dared to don the protective gear in open view, and the crowd\u2019s reaction came as quickly as a foul tip and just as nasty. \u201cSpectators howled with delight when a foul tip in the fifth inning rapped the protectors sharply,\u201d reported the New York Times. Bresnahan, more concerned about his livelihood than remarks about his manliness, ignored the insults from fans and foes.\n\nBresnahan\u2019s shin guards were the final pieces of the catcher\u2019s major armor, following the glove, mask, and chest protector.\n\nThis armor kit was lovingly dubbed \u201cthe tools of ignorance\u201d by Herold \u201cMuddy\u201d Ruel, a backstop and a lawyer who caught for greats like Walter Johnson with the Washington Nationals in the 1920s. Ruel probably would have stayed a lawyer if he\u2019d caught in the late 1860s when catchers had no equipment.\n\nNew York Mutuals catcher Nat Hicks was the first backstop to start creeping closer to batters, in the 1870s. Before Hicks, catchers stood far behind the hitters, fielding pitches on the bounce. Hicks paid for his fearlessness with repeated and sometimes severe damage to his face and a near-loss of his right eye in 1873.\n\nMost backstops began crowding the plate in the early 1880s, especially when a rules change dictated that the final strike, including foul tips, had to be caught on a fly for a putout. Pitchers had begun throwing overhand by 1884, when, after a rule change in the National League, all restrictions on the pitcher\u2019s delivery were removed and he could throw underhand, sidearm, or completely overhand, as he wished. Also, the consensus is that the mound was created in 1893 or shortly thereafter. Up until that year the pitcher\u2019s position was known as the pitcher\u2019s box. In 1893 the pitcher\u2019s rear foot was moved farther from home plate to its current distance of 60 feet, 6 inches. Moving closer to the batter enabled catchers to better frame the pitches, field bunts, and throw out base-stealers.\n\nIn 1901 the National League instituted a regulation that a \u201ccatcher must stand within the lines of his position whenever the pitcher delivers the ball and within ten feet of the home base.\u201d The American League adopted this rule the following year. Current rules state that the \u201ccatcher shall station himself directly back of the plate . . . with both feet within the lines of the catcher\u2019s box until the ball leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand\u201d (Rule 4.03[a]). The catcher\u2019s box measures 43 inches across and 8 feet long from the plate backward.\n\nMASKED MEN\n\nThe first piece of protection for catchers, a rubber mouth protector, dates to the 1870s, purloined perhaps from the sport of bareknuckle boxing. George Wright, brother of Red Stockings founder Harry Wright, preceded the mask with this \u201cmouth protector.\u201d His invention was a fifty-cent rubber mouth guard, similar to the mouthpiece a boxer wears. This innovation, according to newspapers of the time, surely cut down on the talkativeness of catchers.\n\nMasks were more obviously a protective device. Probably the first one was invented by an Ivy League man, Fred Thayer, who in 1876 adapted a fencing mask for Alexander Tyng, then with the Harvard Nine. At first, Thayer\u2019s better mouse trap was derisively called a rat trap. But the catcher\u2019s mask caught on quickly among pros and amateurs alike and was in wide use by the 1880s. Besides affording protection, it helped fielding from the very first game. Harvard\u2019s Tyng made only two errors in that April 12, 1877, match, exceptionally low even for a pro catcher in those days.\n\nThayer\u2019s patented mask (patent 200,358) went into the Spalding catalog for the 1878 season, and adaptations followed quickly. Its simple forehead and chin rests were embellished with padding\u2014made from \u201cimported dog skin,\u201d according to one Spalding catalog\u2014 to insulate the steel-mesh frame from the catcher\u2019s face.\n\nBetter visibility was always a goal in catcher\u2019s masks. Inventor George Barnard patented his \u201copen view\u201d mask in 1888 (patent 376,278) that afforded both protection and vision. These wire-basket cages worn by the 1890s backstops like Roger Bresnahan and Marty Bergen gave way to the greatly improved peripheral vision of the so-called Open Vision and Wide Sight masks by the 1911 season. A. J. Reach created this mask (patent 1,012,223) for the purpose of removing the vertical bar for better visibility without sacrificing structural strength.\n\nThe \u201cplatform mask,\u201d a one-piece aluminum casting with horizontal crossbars instead of soldered mesh, was patented by umpire James E. Johnstone in 1921 (patent 1,449,183). Mesh still evolved, though, getting springy, shock-absorbing action and ball-deflecting shapes in the 1920s. One such mask designed by H. Goldsmith in 1923 (patent 1,475,991) had a padded \u201coval surround\u201d with two cross bars. Other mask materials have come along, but carbon-steel wire mesh remains the material of choice to this day. Catchers prefer the welded-wire guard because it has better air movement and fewer massive bars that could obstruct visibility. Carbon-steel wire is used because it\u2019s flexible but strong. The goal is to get some deformation in the mesh to reduce some of the shock but still retain structural integrity.\n\nSometimes one change in a piece of equipment necessitated changes in other catchers\u2019 equipment. For example, with two-handed catching, using the pillowstyle mitt, the catcher\u2019s hands followed the ball into his body. In the process, the catcher was tucking in his chin so his throat wasn\u2019t exposed. Catchers today, with the hinged-mitt, one-hand the ball farther away from their bodies, and they\u2019re frequently looking up, so the throat\u2019s more exposed. This is the reason why today\u2019s catchers wear masks with throat protectors, popularized by Dodger catcher Steve Yeager. In 1976 Yeager was kneeling in the on-deck circle when a bat shattered and a sharp piece slammed into his throat. To protect him from further injury, the Dodgers came up with the billygoat device hanging from his mask. However, throat protectors go back as early as 1888, as demonstrated by a Spalding advertisement for the Spalding\u2019s Trade Marked Catcher\u2019s Mask No. 30 with a patented neck protection. In 1903 the Victor Sporting Goods Company offered throat protection in its model 314N with a neck extension piece. The latest-version mask has the throat protector integrated with the wire face cage.\n\nThe end of the twentieth century has seen the mask evolve into something resembling what Darth Vader wears. Its genesis sprung from hockey\u2019s goalie mask, and it was introduced by catcher Charlie O\u2019Brien. It is made of new high-tech polycarbon, and O\u2019Brien\u2019s mask was designed by Jerry Van Valden of Toronto-based Catch You Later Headgear. The helmet protects the top, sides, and back of the head, yet the cage-like opening in the front is bigger than that of a normal mask. It increases a catcher\u2019s peripheral vision and deflects the ball rather than hitting the catcher flush as does the previous mask. At 50 ounces, the helmet is about 10 ounces heavier than a normal mask/helmet combination. Several major-league catchers have begun wearing it, and soon it may be a standard piece of equipment.\n\nMITTENS FOR THE HANDS\n\nMitts were a taken-for-granted part of catching. An early documented use of a glove by a player occurred on June 28, 1870, and that was by a catcher. A sportswriter for the Cincinnati Commercial cabled his office, \u201c[Doug] Allison caught today in a pair of buckskin mittens, to protect his hands.\u201d It was printed in the next day\u2019s newspaper in a recap of the game between the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Washington Nationals. Also, a report appeared in the Detroit Free Press on August 14, 1867, of a catcher named Ben Delaverage playing for the Victory Club of Troy using a catcher\u2019s glove. In the late 1870s gloves came into common use. At first players had to skulk onto the field. But star pitcher\u2013 turned\u2013first baseman Albert Spalding made it a manly thing in 1877, boldly donning a black glove that was fingerless but padded. Ever the entrepreneur, Spalding envisioned big sales for his mail-order sporting-goods business. Catchers were among his best customers. Inventor A. C. Butts patented a fingerless glove in 1883 (patent 290,664), and G. H. Rawlings added padding in 1885 (patent 325,968).\n\nHistorians quibble over whether Harry Decker, Joe Gunson, Ted Kennedy, or Jack McCloskey first used the padded catcher\u2019s mitt in the late 1880s. By one account, the Kansas City Cowboys\u2019 Gunson dreamed up the mitt, but he was too busy catching in Al Spalding\u2019s world baseball tour to take advantage of the idea. So, ex-catcher Decker filed a patent on his mitt design in 1889 (patent 408,650). The \u201cDecker Safety Catcher\u2019s Mitt\u201d was a contraption that was basically a glove stitched to the back of a round pad that covered the palm of the hand. These gloves were literally flat pillows that got their pockets broken in on the job at the expense of the catcher\u2019s palm. Decker modified his mitt in 1891 to a more comfortable design (patent 447,233) with the addition of leather lacing on the back of the hand to hold the mitt in place.\n\nIt was not until 1895 that stipulations concerning the use of gloves were included in the rules: Those limited the size of gloves to ten ounces and fourteen inches circumference for all players except catchers and first basemen, who were permitted to use any size glove. The early gloves, lacking webbing and lacing, merely provided protection for the hands. Nineteenthcentury players often wore gloves on both hands. For the throwing hand, they would simply snip the glove at the fingers for dexterity.\n\nIn 1899, J. F. Draper came up with the round, pillowstyle mitt (patent 627,687) that, with several minor modifications, remained the same tool that catchers wore up until the 1920s. R. H. Young in 1920 modified this standard pillow-mitt to disperse a billow of air to form a cushion when the ball was caught (patent 1,362,280).\n\nMitts were pretty small, flat, and shapeless throughout the dead ball era until a Rawlings employee, Harry \u201cBud\u201d Latina, who designed dozens of mitts/gloves, created a better mitt. This hand/fingers design made the mitt loose enough to permit it to be dropped quickly or thrown off but not accidentally by using finger loops (patent 1,562,176). This became the standard for more than forty years. Additionally, it had a real change in the depth of the mitt so the ball would really stick, even though the catcher still had to use two hands. The catching technique with the pillow mitt was to stop the ball with the relatively stiff mitt, then secure it with one\u2019s bare hand. This was accomplished by holding the bare hand behind the mitt and quickly moving it to the caught ball. But if the catcher had to move his mitt to catch a ball and failed to move both hands in unison, the bare hand could easily be exposed and subject to harm. Jammed and broken fingers were very common injuries during the pillow-mitt era.\n\nModern mitts have evolved to match today\u2019s style of baseball. Catchers now have to one-hand or backhand the ball, which means that they have to work much lower because now the pitching is lower (at or below the batter\u2019s knees). However, when a catcher is that low, he can\u2019t hold two hands out in front or even one with the fingers pointing up and parallel to the body.\n\nIn the 1950s, catcher Gus Niarhos cut an opening in the back of his mitt so he could squeeze the two sides together a little bit, like a fielder\u2019s glove. This led to catcher\u2019s mitts with breaks in them and long oval pockets. Previously, mitts had a pocket but no breaks, and the backstop caught two-handed so the ball wouldn\u2019t pop out. One-handed catching became possible with the hinged mitt, popularized by Johnny Bench and Randy Hundley in the late 1960s. With these, a spring-action hinge snaps the mitt closed on contact with the ball.\n\nThe ancestry of the flex-hinge catcher\u2019s mitt goes back to the first baseman\u2019s mitts of the 1950s. Logically, one might suppose that former first basemen (like J. C. Martin), converted to catchers in large numbers in the early 1960s, would have been the ones to introduce the mitt. But in fact, the flex-hinge catcher\u2019s mitt was introduced by Hundley in 1966 and Bench in 1968; neither of them had ever played first base.\n\nNew and sometimes quirky innovations in mitts have arisen since the 1960s. For example, in 1975, Al Campanis, former general manager of the Dodgers, introduced an orange fluorescent stripe around the perimeter of the mitt to help pitchers concentrate on their targets (patent 3,898,696). This caught on, but not every development met with acceptance. Most catchers didn\u2019t think much of another innovation in mitts, the oversized \u201cBig Bertha\u201d designed by Baltimore Orioles manager Paul Richards in the late 1950s. Supposedly it was to help his receivers handle the maddening knuckleball of Hoyt Wilhelm. Such baskets grew to a 45-inch circumference before being regulated to 38 inches in 1965. The surface area might help one knock down the ball, but it hindered one\u2019s view and cut down on hand mobility. One other drawback of the \u201cBig Bertha\u201d was that even if one caught the ball in that glove, it was hard to find it in time to catch base-stealers.\n\nSome current catchers are keenly interested in the latest wrinkle in mitts, a \u201cdigital leather\u201d glove made by Franklin. The innovation is already found in Franklin\u2019s current line of fielders\u2019 gloves and will make its debut in catchers\u2019 mitts soon. The facing leather is etched with a pattern of grooves and diamonds whose purpose is twofold. First, the pattern absorbs the shock of impact. Then, its contours grab the ball and stop its spinning action. Both attributes might turn some hardhands into soft ones. Webbing, air or gel cushions, and other elements of glove design have dealt with the velocity of batted and pitched balls, but only lately have manufacturers turned their attention to the spin factor. The rotation on a baseball can be quite high, 1800 rpm or more on a curveball, for example. Franklin likens its digital leather to the road-gripping pattern of a tire. That leaves the near-spinless knuckleball to contend with, a problem sure to be compounded as more hurlers follow knuckler Tim Wakefield and other \u201cgoofy\u201d tossers.\n\nBODY ARMOR FOR THOSE WAYWARD 95-MPH FASTBALLS\n\nWomen got into the act of making catching a safer profession. Legend has it that the wife of Detroit Wolverines catcher Charles Bennett devised a chest pad to protect her husband during games. He wore the creation outside his jersey in 1883. While some accounts say that catchers experimented with chest protectors earlier in the decade, these image-conscious receivers tried hiding the devices beneath their uniforms to avoid razzing. Left-handed throwing catcher Jack Clements in 1884 was quoted as saying that he wore a \u201csheepskin,\u201d as chest protectors were first called, beneath his uniform to avoid being called a sissy.\n\nJames \u201cDeacon\u201d White, a nine-year catcher in the 1870s who switched to third base for nine more years, supposedly created the first chest protector in the early 1880s. His design included a canvas-covered rubber bladder pumped full of air. Padding eventually replaced the air tubes.\n\nToday\u2019s chest protectors, although ribbed with light but shock-absorbing polyfoam, have come full circle from the original fur-stuffed sheepskin \u201cbreast protectors\u201d worn under the uniform until 1884. Along the way, catchers and umpires got inflatable vests. \u201cGray\u2019s Patent Body Protector\u201d (patent 295,543) with its rubber-bladder ribs sold for $10 in 1891, twice the price of stuffed canvas or leather. Gray\u2019s Protector didn\u2019t cover the shoulders, a prime target for foul tips. John Gamble in his 1903 design added inflatable pads that covered the shoulders (patent 745,007).\n\nAlthough umpires stuck to inflatable protectors until modern times, catchers quickly went for the maneuverability that lightweight stuffing like kapok afforded. Kapok is a lightweight material used in life jackets. Today, chest protectors are filled with foam. Stuffed protectors enabled backstops to crouch and to run to back up bases. F. W. Glahe in 1963 came up with a very flexible chest protector (patent 3,076,197) that greatly improved mobility.\n\nOne of the last modifications to the chest protector was the addition of removable shoulder flaps. M. Neuhalfen in 1991 patented his design (patent 5,020,156) that guarded against those nasty foul tips flying into the upper arms. With the advent of ballistic materials, velcro, breathable cloth, and polyfoam padding, catchers today are wearing the most protection possible with the minimum weight. The 2008 version of the chest protector weighs less than half the chest protector that was available in the 1920s through the 1940s.\n\nANTI-SPIKE PROTECTORS: THE SHIN GUARDS\n\nAmong the tools of ignorance, the designs of masks and mitts have evolved the most, in response to the way baseball is played. By contrast, chest protectors and shin guards haven\u2019t changed as much. As early as 1890, catchers began wrapping their bare lower legs with newspapers or leather, which was then hidden beneath their uniforms. This evolved into more elaborate pads, all under their pants, but it took tough-as-nails Roger Bresnahan to have the nerve to admit publicly that his legs hurt from all of the wild pitches, foul balls, thrown bats, and piercing spikes. The curiosities that Bresnahan wore more than a century ago actually were a modified version of the leg guards worn by cricket players. Rods of light cane encased in padded fabric covered the shins, and padding protected the knees.\n\nOver time, padded leather covered the kneecaps, insteps, and ankles. Hard, heavy fiberboard guards appeared in Rawlings ads in 1916. In the 1920s and 1930s, fiberboard supplanted cane. Various inventors played around with the fiberboard design, including D. Levinson in his 1918 idea (patent 1,253,260). William Barrett in 1927 patented the prototypical catcher\u2019s leg guards (patent 1,624,129) that uses essentially the design seen today.\n\nThe hinged shin guard was developed by the Dodgers in the late 1950s, one of three notable catcher inventions they created. (The billygoat throat protector and the hinged mitt were the other two.) By the 1960s, light but tough molded plastics replaced fiber. How tough? Announcer and former catcher Tim McCarver survived two collisions in which the spikes of ex-Met Tommy Agee became embedded in the guards.\n\nIn 1995, W. F. Hunt Jr. patented leg guards with adjustable lower thigh pieces to facilitate lower crouches and increased protection (patent 5,452,475). G. J. Collins followed up with his multiple-piece thigh and knee guards in 2004 (patent 6,687,912). The next generation might well include complete, flexible, and lightweight leggings made from Kevlar and worn throughout the game and not just when the catcher is behind the plate.\n\nCatching has never appeared to be an easy or cushy job. Even with protective accessories, the position seems to lead the league in injuries yearly. That\u2019s why safety and productivity have been the goals of a variety of catching inventions throughout the history of the game.\n\nBaseball, though it sometimes seems the most tradition-bound of sports, has always shown that all-American penchant for tinkering and innovation. This quest for the better mouse trap has been amply applied to catchers\u2019 gear. The evolution of the equipment corresponds to actual changes in the tactics and rules of the game. The tinkering continues. Already a new \u201cdigital\u201d catcher\u2019s mitt, designed to soften the ball\u2019s impact and reduce errors, has made its debut.\n\nToday the well-protected warrior behind home plate has taken advantage of modern technology, especially that developed for law enforcement. Body armor, for the catcher in the twenty-first century, might well be identical to the lightweight Kevlar vests worn under police officers\u2019 shirts today. After all, if a thin, almost shirt-like vest can stop a bullet, it certainly can stop a wayward 95 mph fastball. So perhaps chest and leg protection will come full circle and the catchers of tomorrow will be wearing their armor beneath their uniforms just as the players in the 1880s did.\n\nCHUCK ROSCIAM, a retired navy captain with 43 years of active service and an amateur catcher for more than forty years, is the creator of www.baseballcatchers.com.

Unlike the baseball bat or the baseball itself, the glove was not initially a part of the game. Players just used the mitts they were born with. Lest you think that all men were walking around with swollen and broken fingers, it\u2019s important to remember that this was a very different game than the today. There were a lot of differences in the game, not least of which is the fact that much of the throwing was underhand. In the beginning, there wasn\u2019t much need for hand protection, but even as the game evolved and balls were thrown harder and faster, there was some reluctance to use any protection or padding. These were the days when the measure of a man was the number of calluses on his fingers and of broken bones in his hand. Wearing a glove just wasn\u2019t manly.\n\nThe earliest gloves were simple leather work gloves, often with its finger removed to ensure that ball handling isn\u2019t inhabited in any way. It\u2019s hard to say exactly who wore the first glove, but some reports claim that catchers were wearing work gloves as early as 1860. A pitcher for the by the name of A.G. Spalding claims that it was New Haven first baseman Charles C. Waite who, in an 1875 game against Boston, first had the audacity (i.e. common sense) to take the field with a glove. Maybe \u201caudacity\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word. Though there were no rules against gloves, Waite tried to preserve his masculinity by wearing a tan, flesh-colored work glove, hoping no one would notice. People noticed. And Waite was ridiculed mercilessly by fans and players alike. Nonetheless, he persevered.\n\nSpalding thought Waite might be on to something.\n\n\u201cI had for a good while felt the need of some sort of hand protection for myself. For several years I had pitched in every game played by the Boston team, and had developed severe bruises on the inside of my left hand. Therefore, I asked Waite about his glove. He confessed that he was a bit ashamed to wear it, but had it on to save his hand. He also admitted that he had chosen a color as inconspicuous as possible, because he didn\u2019t care to attract attention\u2026.Meanwhile, my own hand continued to take its medicine with utmost regularity, occasionally being bored with a warm twister that hurt excruciatingly. Still, it was not until 1877 that I overcame my scruples against joining the \u2018kid-glove aristocracy\u2019 by donning a glove. I found that the glove, thin as it was, helped considerably, and inserted one pad after another until a good deal of relief was afforded. If anyone wore a padded glove before this date, I do not know it.\u201d\n\nThe year after Waite\u2019s debut, Spalding and his brothers started a sports equipment company and one of their first products, alongside the first official baseball, was a baseball glove \u2013though Spalding wouldn\u2019t wear one himself until 1877 when he started playing first base. Unlike Waite\u2019s glove, Spaldings was made from dark, almost black leather. Spalding\u2019s reputation kept away the ridicule and in fact, he may be responsible for helping to remove the stigma that came with wearing a glove.\n\nWith the stigma removed (mostly), the development of the glove accelerated. Along with that extra padding, shallow webbing was added between the fingers \u2013 most notably between the thumb and first finger. The glove caught on, much to the chagrin of some early baseball purists, and in 1895 the National League and American Association of Baseball Clubs created the first restrictions on glove size:\n\n\u201cThe catcher and the first baseman are permitted to wear a glove or mitt of any size, shape or weight. All other players are restricted to the use of a glove or mitt weighing not over ten ounces, and measuring in circumference around the palm of the hand not over fourteen inches.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the century, every player in organized baseball was playing with a glove.\n\nAfter padding, the next big innovation came in 1920 when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Bill Doak came up with a design to replace the leather webbing used in some gloves with a system of straps between the first finger and thumb, creating a larger, deeper pocket that would help relieve some of the impact on the players palms and fingers while also extending a fielder\u2019s reach. Doak patented his idea, the precursor to all modern gloves, and sold it to Rawlings. With it, Rawlings surpassed Spalding as the preferred glove of pro players and today, the sports equipment company provides gloves for about 50 percent of professional ballplayers and produces specialized designs for pitchers, catchers, first basemen, infielders and outfielders, as well as custom designs for individual players. While the pillow-like catchers mitt is obviously unique, and has been from the beginning, the differences between other gloves emerged more slowly over the years, and can be subtle to accommodate different styles of play.\n\nAccording to glove designer Bob Clevenhagen, known as \u201cMichelangelo of the mitt,\u201d \u201cFor outfielders, the ball will be funneled into the webbing. They are more apt to snag the ball up high in the web,\u201d while \u201can infielder wants the ball where there\u2019s no problem finding it with his bare hand, not in the webbing, but at the base of the fingers.\u201d From its humble beginnings as an home-made object of scorn and ridicule, the baseball glove has become an iconic piece of sports equipment and often stunningly crafted object that only gets better with time.

They used their bare, unguarded hands to field and catch screaming balls from hitters, fielders and pitchers. When asked about this style of barehanded ball, Hall of Famer Cap Anderson famously said:\n\n\u201cWe had a trick of making a spring-box of the fingers, the ball seldom hitting against the palm, and we could haul down even the hottest liners that way, though broken fingers happened now and then. The hands of the infielders and the catchers were awful sights, as a rule, but they stuck to their work even when bleeding fingers were useless at the broken joints.\u201d\n\nFor catchers in the game, this was an especially painful reality of the game. So how\u2019d the first catcher\u2019s mitt come to be? The story might just surprise you.\n\nTHE FIRST APPEARANCE\n\nGenerally known for his daring approach to the catcher\u2019s position, Cincinnati Red Stockings\u2019 Doug Allison was the first backstopper in the game to crowd the batter to be able to throw out base-stealers. This approach led to Allison injuring his left hand in the game prior to the matchup with the Nationals on June 28th, 1870.\n\nThe Red Stockings put the innovative Candy Cummings on the pitchers mound in the face-off against the Nationals. Candy was renowned for throwing a pitch that wildly confused batters \u2013 the curveball. There was only one downfall with the pitch; it would often escape the catcher\u2019s grasp and allow runners on base to advance.\n\nAllison knew he\u2019d have to find a way to hold on to the pitch in spite of his injured hand. Using the resources available, the catcher cut the fingers out of a pair of buckskin workman\u2019s gloves and donned them for the game. It was a simple means of protection for the catcher.\n\nA sportswriter for the Cincinnati Commercial would etch the scene in baseball history. Sending a cable back to his home office, he would send the words, \u201cAllison caught today in a pair of buckskin mittens, to protect his hand.\u201d The story was printed the next day and seemed to be regaled as little more than a novelty.\n\nINTO THE MAINSTREAM\n\nA few years later, however, the glove idea would begin catching on. Most sources attribute the consistent use of the equipment to a player named Charlie Waitt, a first baseman (and sometimes outfielder) for the St. Louis Cardinals. Beginning in 1875, Charlie donned a pair of flesh-colored leather gloves during each game.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for players to begin picking up the trend. Considering Cap\u2019s words at the start of this article, it\u2019s a bit surprising that it took so long. Beyond 1875, baseball companies of all sizes would begin the art of crafting leather gloves specifically fitted for each position on the field \u2013 each angling to get the biggest players to wear their mitts. But that\u2019s another story for another day.\n\nCheck out our related posts!"}, {"url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US780306A/en", "page_content": "7 No. 780,806.

ROGERS, OF SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nCATCHERS IVIITT.\n\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 780,306, dated January 1'7, 1905.\n\nApplication filed January Z, 1904. Serial No. 187,509.\n\nTo all IUII/OIII/ it 'mwy concern;\n\nBe it known that I, 'BURTT. Roenns, a citi zen of the United States of America, residing at Springfield, in the county of Hampden and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have invented a new and useful Catchers Mitt, of which the following is a specification.\n\nMy invention relates to gloves or mitts used by catchers in playing base-ball in which a pocket is formed in the manner hereinafter set forth; and the object of my improvement is to provide a pocket in a catchers glove or mitt in such manner as to enhance its usefulness. I not only furnish the glove or mitt at the outset with apocket which is of the desired shape, size, and location, but at the same time provide against displacement of the padding and make an article in which no aircushion is likely to form between the bottom of the pocket and the adjacent padding. This last is a valuable consideration, for the reason that when the bottom of the pocket does not come into contact with the padding an aircushion is the result, in consequence of which it is more difficult to hold the ball.\n\nA further object is to furnish a glove or mitt which does not need to have the pocket pounded into the same or to be distorted and drawn out of shape with straps in order to form the pocket. My mitt always retains practically the same shape given it when manufactured.\n\nI attain these objects by the means illustrated in the accompanying drawing, which shows, in perspective, a mitt embodying a preferred form of my invention.\n\nGenerally my invention consists in making the front of the glove or mitt in at least two pieces and fastening them, usually by sewing or stitching, so as to leave more or less slack in one of such pieces, which provides for the formation of the pocket.\n\nIn the drawing a mitt a is shown, which does not differ in general appearance from other mitts in this class. There are the finger and thumb portions 1) and 0, respectively, the heel outlined by the stitches cl and the pocket 6 in the palm portion; but it will be observed that the front of this mitt is in two pieces f and a united along a line it, representing a seam. By cutting out the pieces j and g so that their abutting edges are unequal and require more or less puokering adjacent the pocket 6 to unite them suiiicient slack is left in the piece 1 to allow for the pocket. Provision is thus initially made for the formation of a pocket around which the filling or padding of the mitt is properly placed during the process of manufacture, and the presence of this pocket serves to keep such padding in place. In short, it is in contact with it at all interior points, so that the impact of the ball does not disturb the internal arrangement. The foregoing being true, it will be readily seen that no air-cushion can form heneath the pocket or any part thereof, as is the case when no provision is made for slackness in the palm portion of the front without stretching or distorting the front of the mitt or the mitt as a whole. The direction of the line of separation may vary more or less. For example, the line or seam 71., instead of turning to the left, as shown at it, may continue forward onto the finger portion of the front of the mitt or follow the edge-of the pocket, a departure which necessarily changes somewhat the shape of the pieces f and g, but does not alter the essential feature of the invention, and other modifications of a simi lar nature may be made or the front of the mitt may be originally cut into more than two pieces, which are afterward united, all\n\nwithout departing from the nature of my invention, provided the pocket is formed in the manner substantially set forth.\n\nIt is to be understood that the mitt a, aside from the special feature of novelty hereinbefore fully described, is made up in the usual and well-known manner both interiorly and exteriorly.\n\nWhat I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is\n\n1. In a catchers glove or mitt, a front comprising two pieces joined to each other along contiguous edges, one of said pieces being provided with a fullness adjacent one edge to provide a pocket in the palm of the glove, substantially as described.\n\n2. In a catchers glove or mitt, a front comprising a heel and a palm and finger-piece, said IO fullness adjacent one edge to provide a pocket and being united by a seam along said edge to the contiguous edge of the heel-piece, substantially as described.\n\nIn testimony whereof I have signed my name to this specification in the presence of tWo subscribing Witnesses.\n\nBURT T.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US3141173A/en", "page_content": "July 21, 1964 J. A.

(Cl. 219) The present invention relates generally to a catchers mitt and more particularly to a catchers mitt having ball retaining means incorporated therein.\n\nThe primary object of this invention is to provide in a catchers mitt novel and effective means for insuring retention of a ball therein.\n\nIt is a further object of this invention to provide an improved catchers mitt which may be effectively used by the novice as well as the experienced ball player.\n\nIt is a still further object of this invention to provide an improved catchers mitt which may be used with a considerable variety of types of balls, the principal requirement being that the ball should be smooth surfaced.\n\nA still further and important object of this invention is to provide an improved catchers mitt having a plurality of ball retaining members therein which may be individually and cheaply replaced as they become damaged through extended use.\n\nFinally it is an object to provide a catchers mitt of the aforementioned character which is simple and convenient to use and which will give generally efiicient and durable service.\n\nWith these and other objects definitely in view, this invention consists in the novel construction, combination and arrangement of elements and portions, as will be hereinafter fully described in the specification, particularly pointed out in the claims, and illustrated in the drawings which form a material part of this disclosure, and which:\n\nFIGURE 1 is a front elevation view of the mitt;\n\nFIGURE 2 is an end elevation view as taken from the left end of FIGURE 1, and indicating the method of holding the mitt;\n\nFIGURE 3 is a sectional view taken on line 33 of FIGURE 1;\n\nFIGURE 4 is a rear elevation view of the mitt; and\n\nFIGURE 5 is a fragmentary view illustrating edge lacing applied to the mitt.\n\nReferring now more particularly to the drawings the reference number indicates generally the improved catchers mitt. This consists of a generally dish- shaped receptacle 12 which may be throught of as including a concave lateral lobe 13 or ear-shaped extension of the receptacle behind which the thumb rests when the receptacle 12 is hand-held as indicated in FIGURE 2. The receptacle may be formed of any size and shape desired. It should be understood that it is within the scope of this disclosure to make a range of sizes within the limits of the hand sizes of expected users of the mitt.\n\nReceptacle 12 may be formed of any suitable material but we have found that any of the well known synthetic plastics in sheet form provide the necessary rigidity together with light weight. The inner or concave surface of the receptacle, which constitutes the ball catching and holding portion, has mounted therein a plurality of conventional suction cup members 14. The suction cups 14 are generously distributed over said concave surface, including the lateral lobe 13 and those suction cups on the lobe 13 are of significant importance in making the item functional. As shown the cup portion 16 of each suction cup member 14 is connected, by means of a narrow neck 18 to a support portion 20. The periphery of support portion 20 is provided with a groove 22 which retainingly engages a hole in the receptacle 12. Suction cup mem- 3,141,173 Patented July 21, 1964 bers 14 are formed of any suitable resilient form retaining material such as rubber. It will be evident therefore that groove 22 will permit members 14 to be snapped into holes in the receptacle to be retainingly engaged thereby. It will also be evident that this construction facilitates removal and replacement of a damaged suction cup member. Although only one means of securing the suction cup members to the receptacle is shown it is understood that any other suitable means for removably securing suction cup members to a backing may be substituted therefor.\n\nSuitable means is provided to position and secure our catchers mitt to a persons hand. In the preferred form illustrated we mount a strap 24 on the back of receptacle 12. Three pairs of spaced slits 26, 28 and 30 are located adjacent one side 29 and the material of the strap is threaded therethrough as shown to provide two loop portions 32 and 34. The intermediate portion of strap 24 is slidable in slits 28 while the ends are suitably secured to member 12 at 36 and 38, respectively. It will be readily apparent that the loops 32 and 34 are of such size as to each receive two fingers, the thumb being positioned outside the loops as clearly shown in FIGURE 2.\n\nOperation The operation of our improved catchers mitt will be apparent from the foregoing description. It is primarily intended for use with a smooth surfaced ball since it is well known that suction cups will cooperate more effectively with a smooth regular surface than with a surface that has sharp ridges or irrigularities thereon. Since suction cups 14 are positioned to cover the complete concave surface of dish-shaped receptacle 12 a ball of suitable size striking the receptacle at any point on this concave surface will come in contact with one or more of these suction cups. This impact will deflect the suction cup or cups sufficiently to conform to the shape of the ball at the same time expelling the air therefrom and cause a gripping action with the ball in the well known manner of suction cup operation.\n\nFIGURE 5 shows a fragmentary section of our improved catchers mitt with stitching 40 applied to the edge thereof. The stitching may be of any suitable material such as plastic or leather strips and serves to reinforce as well as decorate our mitt.\n\nIt is understood that minor variation from the form of the invention disclosed herein may be made without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and that the specification and drawings are to be considered as merely illustrative rather than limiting.\n\nWe claim:\n\n1. A hand-held catchers mitt comprising:\n\na substantially rigid dish-shaped receptacle for receiving a ball; and\n\na plurality of suction cups mounted on the concave surface thereof adapted to receive and hold a smooth surfaced ball.\n\n2. A hand-held catchers mitt as claimed in claim 1 in which said receptacle consists entirely of a thin layer of plastic material.\n\n3. A hand-held catchers mitt as claimed in claim 2 in which said suction cups extend over substantially the entire concave surface.\n\n4. A hand-held catchers mitt as claimed in claim 3 in which said suction cups are removably mounted on said concave surface.\n\n5. A hand-held catchers mitt as claimed in claim 4 further including means mounted on the receptacle for receiving the hand of the user of the device.\n\n6. A hand-held catchers mitt comprising:\n\na substantially rigid dish-shaped receptacle consisting entirely of thin sheet plastic for receiving a ball and 3 having a plurality of apertures extending entirely therethrough; and a plurality of suction cups adapted to receive and hold a smooth surfaced ball, each cup having a support portion received in one of said apertures. 5\n\nReferences Cited in the file of this patent UNITED STATES PATENTS 4 Latina Nov. 17, 1925 Barden 'Mar. 17,1931 Wood Nov. 1, 1932 Schmidt July 28, 1936 Price Aug. 1, 1939 Stiller Apr. 5, 1949 Causse Mar. 1, 1955 MacChesney Nov. 20,1956\n\nFOREIGN PATENTS Canada May 7, 1957"}, {"url": "http://www.members.tripod.com/bb_catchers/catchers/equip1.htm", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nMitts were a taken-for-granted part of catching. The earliest documented use of a glove by any player occurred on June 28, 1870 and that was by a catcher. A sportswriter for the Cincinnati Commercial cabled his office \"[Doug] Allison caught today in a pair of buckskin mittens, to protect his hands.\" It was printed in the next day's newspaper in a recap of the Cincinnati Red Stockings versus the Washington Nationals in D.C.\n\n\n\n1883\n\n1905\n\n1920\n\n1930\n\nGloves then masks came into use in the 1870's. At first players had to skulk onto the field. But, star pitcher, turned first baseman, Albert Spalding made it a manly thing in 1877, boldly donning a black glove that was fingerless, but padded. Ever the entrepreneur, Spalding envisioned big sales for his mail-order sporting goods business. Catchers were among his best customers.\n\n\n\n1940\n\n1950\n\n1970\n\n1990\n\nBy 1890, ex-catcher Harry Decker had patented the \"Decker Safety Catcher's Mitt,\" a contraption that was basically a glove stitched to the back of a round pad that covered the palm of the hand. These gloves were literally flat pillows that got their pockets broken in on the job\u0096at the expense of the catcher's palm.\n\nHistorians quibble over whether Harry Decker or Joe Gunson first used the padded catcher's mitt in the 1880's. Supposedly, Kansas City Cowboy's Gunson dreamed up the mitt, but he was too busy catching in Al Spalding's world baseball tour to take advantage of the idea. So, Decker filed a patent on the now-familiar mitt design in 1889.\n\nIt was not until 1895 that stipulations concerning use of gloves were included in the rules: those limited the size of gloves to ten ounces and fourteen inches circumference for all players except catchers and first basemen, who were permitted to use any size glove. The early gloves, lacking webbing and lacing, merely provided protection for the hands. Players in the 19th Century often wore gloves on both hands. For the throwing hand, they would simply snip the glove at the fingers for dexterity.\n\n\n\n2000s\n\n\"They were still pretty small, flat and had no shape when I came into the big leagues in 1937,\" recalls former Brooklyn Dodger catcher Mickey Owen, who turns 77 this year.\n\n\"A fellow from Rawlings came in one day, Harry Latina, asked us a lot of questions and said he could build a better mitt. And he did, \"Owen tells PM. Harry \"Bud\" Latina, the legendary \"glove doctor,\" was Rawlings chief designer for four decades. \"He made a real change in the depth of the mitt so the ball would really stick,\" says Owen.\n\nAccording to Owen, Latina's innovations made catching easier, but you still had to use two hands. Modern mitts, he contends, have evolved to match today's style of baseball.\n\n\"Catchers now have to one-hand or backhand the ball,\" he points out. \"They have to work much lower than we did because the pitching's low now\u0096 at or below the batter's knees. When you're catching that low you can't hold two hands or even one with the fingers pointing up and parallel to your body.\"\n\nCatcher Earl Battey, a 3-time Gold Glove winner, notes that mitts have changed substantially even since he was battery mate with Gold Glover Jim Kaat on the Minnesota Twins in the 1960s.\n\n\"Today's mitts have multiple breaks and a long oval pocket, more like a first baseman's,\" says Battey. \"When I played, we had a pocket but no breaks, and we caught two-handed so the ball wouldn't pop out.\" One-handed catching became possible with the hinged mitt, popularized by Johnny Bench and Randy Hundley in the late 1960s. With these, a spring-action hinge snaps the mitt closed on contact with the ball.\n\nThe ancestry of the flex-hinge catcher's mitt goes back to the first baseman's mitts of the 1950's. Logically one might suppose that former first basemen (like Bob Tillman or J.C. Martin), converted to catchers in large numbers in the early 1960's, would have been the ones to introduce the mitt. But in fact, the flex-hinge catcher's mitt was introduced by Randy Hundley in 1966 and Johnny Bench in 1968, neither of whom had ever played first base.\n\nStopping the spin\n\nNot every development meets with acceptance, of course. Neither Owen nor Battey think much of another innovation in catcher's mitts\u0096the oversized \"Big Bertha\" designed by Baltimore Orioles manager Paul Richards in the late '50's to help his receivers handle the maddening knuckleball of Hoyt Wilhelm. Such baskets grew to a 45-in. circumference before being regulated to 38 in. in '65.\n\n\"The surface area might help you knock down the ball, but it hinders your view and cuts down your hand mobility,\" says Battey.\n\nOwen, who, by his own description, \"boxed\" with a few knucklers, notes another consideration.\n\n\"Even if you catch the ball in that glove, it's hard to find it in time to catch base-stealers.\"\n\nOwen, fittingly, is keenly interested in the latest wrinkle in mitts, a \"digital leather\" glove made by Franklin. The innovation is already found in Franklin's current line of fielders' gloves and will make its debut in catchers' mitts this August. The facing leather is etched with a pattern of grooves and diamonds which has a two-fold purpose. First, the pattern absorbs the shock of impact. Then, its contours grab the ball and stop its spinning action.\n\nBoth attributes might turn some hard-hands into soft ones. Webbing, air or gel cushions and other elements of glove design have dealt with the velocity of batted and pitched balls, but only lately have manufacturers turned their attention to the spin factor. The rotation on a baseball can be quite high\u00961800 rpm or more on a curveball, for example. Franklin likens its digital leather to the road-gripping pattern of a tire.\n\n\n\nThat leaves the near-spinless knuckleball to contend with\u0096a problem sure to compound as more hurlers follow 1992's pitching phenom, knuckler Tim Wakefield of the Pittsburgh Pirates. What do you do when glove technology is of little help?\n\n\"You just have to box with it,\" advises Earl Battey.\n\nBACK TO THE TOP"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.barnie/1752102", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nbaseball player\n\nJanuary 26, 1853 (age 47) New York City\n\nBorn in New York City, he played as a right fielder in the National Association in 1874-1875.

The real inventor may have been a Penn dentist and ballplayer who wanted to preserve his hands for his dental career.\n\nThe dentist was Albert \u201cDoc\u201d Bushong, who matriculated at the dental school (then the brand-new Department of Dentistry) in 1878 and received his dental degree in 1882.\n\nBy then he was already an old pro, having begun his professional baseball career by catching one game for the Brooklyn Atlantics in 1875. He played briefly with the Philadelphia Athletics during the National League\u2019s inaugural season in 1876, played minor-league ball for three seasons, and reached the majors again in 1880 with the Worcester Rubylegs.\n\nBushong was thus the first of 19 Penn medical or dental alumni who, over the next 53 years, also played major-league baseball. After graduation he continued to play major-league ball, and had a pretty interesting career. He was the first major-leaguer to catch at least 100 games in a season, and he played in five 19th-century \u201cWorld Series\u201d\u2014postseason exhibitions between the two league champions.\n\nIn his first World Series, in 1885, he was at bat when the series-winning run came home on a passed ball, an event immortalized as the \u201c$15,000 slide.\u201d The team owner was so pleased he arranged for several western towns to be named after team members\u2014resulting, in this case, in Bushong, Kansas.\n\nHe also may have invented the catcher\u2019s mitt. Hard as it is to believe, before 1875 catchers caught barehanded, making it an even more painful occupation than it is now. One commentator noted that shaking hands with a catcher was like \u201cgrasping a handful of peanuts.\u201d Then catchers started using a pair of thick work gloves behind the plate, with the fingertips cut off one hand to facilitate throwing\u2014an imperfect solution.\n\nSources generally credit the invention of the catcher\u2019s mitt to journeyman catcher Joe Gunson in 1888. Accounts have Gunson securing wool padding and a wire frame to a leather work glove with the fingers sewn together, then encasing everything in a buckskin sleeve. Decades later Gunson claimed that he \u201cfoolishly explained to [a teammate] the exact making of it,\u201d and then shortly thereafter \u201ceverybody began to make them.\u201d According to Gunson he was never able to patent the invention.\n\nAn account in the January 24, 1915 edition of The New York Times, however, credits Doc Bushong with the invention. Bushong \u201cwas very careful about his fingers, as he intended practicing dentistry after his days as a ballplayer were over,\u201d the article noted. \u201cHe wore the largest glove he could find, and had added pads until it looked like a pillow. Out of Bushong\u2019s idea grew the idea of the mitt.\u201d\n\nThe way the invention was reported fits Bushong\u2019s attitude towards his dual careers. He made it clear that, while he was a major-leaguer, he was also a dentist. He even studied dentistry in France after the 1883 season, and speculation over his possible retirement ended only when it was announced that Cleveland would allow him to report one month after the season started, so he could complete his studies. An 1887 injury was extensively covered, perhaps because of possible implications for his dental career. \u201cDr. A.J. Bushong is now in St. Louis, nursing a broken finger,\u201d began the story, followed by a long description of the accident and an expression of regret from the opposing team\u2019s president.\n\nSome even attributed Bushong\u2019s defensive talents to his dental training. \u201c\u2018Doc\u2019 Bushong\u2019s unusual ability as a catcher is believed by some to be due to his profession of dentistry,\u201d asserted one writer. \u201cHe yanks in a foul tip in just the same style that he yanks a three inch molar from a big granger\u2019s fly-trap.\u201d\n\nDid Bushong invent the catcher\u2019s mitt? The Times account does not date his invention, but perhaps the strongest argument is Bushong\u2019s well-documented concern over preserving his hands for dentistry. He did break his finger in 1887, and obviously didn\u2019t want to repeat the experience. If he started using his padded glove when he returned from his injury, he would have beaten Gunson by one season. There are no reports of hand injuries for Bushong after the 1887 incident, and he continued to catch for three seasons. While 19th-century reporting is spotty, it\u2019s still likely that if Bushong had suffered more hand injuries they would have been noted. Could his mitt have protected his hands?\n\nBushong\u2019s claim is strengthened by the respective descriptions of his and Gunson\u2019s inventions. Gunson\u2019s mitt consisted of a leather glove, with fingers sewn together, attached to a wire frame holding additional padding. This prototype bears little resemblance to a modern mitt in either composition or function. Mitts are not composed of a distinct glove floating in a structure of padding; nor are there wires or their modern equivalent (plastic?) in modern mitts. Moreover, the catching technique dictated by such a mitt is neither efficient nor modern. The sewn-together fingers would make it more difficult to encircle the ball with the hand, as catchers do with modern mitts.\n\nBushong\u2019s mitt, by comparison, is based on enlarged padded fingers. While modern mitts do not have distinct fingers, the placement of fingers in the modern mitt mimics that which would occur with padded, enlarged glove fingers. With modern finger placement comes modern catching technique, and it\u2019s easy to see the mitt evolving to accommodate the technique allowed by Bushong\u2019s invention\u2014and much less so by Gunson\u2019s.\n\nGunson\u2019s claim does not have the unqualified support of experts, either. Freddy Berowski, research associate at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, says he \u201ccan\u2019t say [Gunson\u2019s claim] holds more merit\u201d than competing claims. Hall of Fame curator Tom Shieber cautions against thinking that the catcher\u2019s mitt sprang forth as a complete invention\u2014there \u201cmay not have been an inception moment here,\u201d he says\u2014but adds that \u201cBushong may very well have played a role\u201d in the evolution of the mitt.\n\nThis perhaps-unrecognized inventor retired from baseball in 1890 and pursued dentistry full-time, first in Hoboken, New Jersey, and eventually in Brooklyn. His brother, Charles A. Bushong, and his son, Stuart Franklin Bushong, also studied dentistry at Penn. Bushong died in 1906, heralded by at least one newspaper as \u201cone of the most famous baseball catchers in the country.\u201d\n\n\u2014Steve Eschenbach"}, {"url": "https://www.rookieroad.com/baseball/catchers-mitts/", "page_content": "Baseball Catcher's Mitts Being the catcher on the baseball team is arguably the most physically demanding position. The catcher's mitt in baseball is designed differently than gloves for other positions on the field. They are thicker and larger in most cases, making them able to catch a baseball at its highest speeds.\n\nBenefits of Baseball Catcher\u2019s Mitts A catcher's mitt is similar to a baseball glove in the sense that they are both used for the same purpose. Catcher\u2019s mitts are mainly used to catch pitches, the occasional pop-up, and tag out runners attempting to cross home plate. They are extremely important to have as a catcher because catching a baseball with bare hands can cause serious injury, especially when that baseball is a 95 mph fastball delivered from a pitcher. Early catcher\u2019s mitts were similar to a flat pillow. Modern versions still have some similar characteristics to this original model, such as the extra padding. Besides catching the ball from the pitcher, a catcher\u2019s mitt is good for saving the ball from bouncing out of control after hitting the dirt. Catchers are also known for using their mitts to frame the baseball. Framing is a relatively new skill amongst catchers that involves them moving their mitts into the strike zone after catching the ball. They do this to try and trick the umpire into calling a bad pitch a strike.\n\nThings to Consider When looking for a catcher's mitt, you'll want to consider the following: What type of catcher\u2019s mitt are you looking for?\n\nAre you left-handed or right-handed?\n\nHow much money do you have to spend on a catcher\u2019s mitt?\n\nWhat Are You Looking For in a Catcher\u2019s Mitt? Maximum Protection\n\nYouth-Sized\n\nAdult-Sized\n\nDurability\n\nAffordability\n\nTypes There are two main types of catcher\u2019s mitts, the half-moon web and the one-piece web.\n\nHalf-Moon Web The half-moon web-style catcher\u2019s mitt features a web that contains two pieces of leather stitched together. The shape it creates when stitched looks like a half-moon, hence the name. This style creates a tight pocket for catchers to secure the ball, but it also has added flexibility due to its two different pieces of leather.\n\nOne-Piece Web Contrary to the half-moon, the one-piece web is constructed with one solid piece of leather. This is a popular choice among catchers because it creates a durable pocket, not letting the force of the ball weaken the leather. Since it has one piece, it is easier to make and creates a deeper pocket due to them requiring stitching.\n\nBrands The three most reliable catcher\u2019s mitt brands are Rawlings, Mizuno, and Wilson.\n\nRawlings Rawlings produces their catcher\u2019s mitts with various pro-grade materials. These include sheep\u2019s skin, kip leather, and wool. They also allow players to customize their mitts by engraving their names when ordering. Rawlings currently offers six styles of mitts on their website, ranging in price from $60 to $280.\n\nMizuno Mizuno boasts that they scan the gloves and mitts of hundreds of professional baseball players to perfect their production process. Their catcher\u2019s mitts feature both kip and shell leather. Mizuno\u2019s smallest mitt is 31.5 inches, while the biggest one they offer comes in at 34 inches.\n\nWilson Wilson\u2019s first catcher\u2019s mitt was released in 1922. They are also known for creating the A2000 glove, which is credited with drastically improving outfielder play. The quality of Wilson mitts comes with a hefty price tag, with their most expensive glove priced at almost $400."}]}
