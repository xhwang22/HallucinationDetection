He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/the-laramie-project-overview-2713500", "page_content": "\"The Laramie Project\" is a documentary-style play created by the Venezuelan playwright Moises Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project, an experimental company whose work has often touched on social themes. \"The Laramie Project\" analyzes the death of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who was brutally murdered in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998 because of his sexual identity. Shepard's murder is one of the most well-known hate crimes in recent American history; in 2009, the U.S. Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a piece of legislation that strengthens existing hate crime laws.\n\nFor \"The Laramie Project,\" the Tectonic Theater Project traveled from New York to Laramie in 1998, just four weeks after Shepard's death. There, they interviewed dozens of townspeople, collecting a wide array of different perspectives on the crime. The dialogue and monologues that comprise \"The Laramie Project\" are taken from these interviews, along with news reports, courtroom transcripts, and journal entries. The three-act play is written for a cast of eight, who play more than 50 different characters.\n\nDocumentary Theater\n\nAlso known as \"found poetry,\" a \"found text\" is a form of writing that uses pre-existing material\u2014anything from recipes and street signs to instruction manuals and interviews. The author of a found text arranges the material in a way that gives it new meaning. Some experimental poets, for example, create new works using texts such as Wikipedia articles, trial transcripts, old letters, etc. \"The Laramie Project,\" since it consists of documentary material from existing sources, is an example of a found text, or documentary theater. Although it was not written in a traditional way, the interview material has been selected and organized in a way that presents a creative narrative.\n\nPerformances\n\nHow does the material translate to the stage? Assuming the actors are up to the challenge, a live production can intensify the experience, bringing new emotion to the material. \"The Laramie Project\" premiered at The Ricketson Theatre in Denver, Colorado, in 2000. It opened off-Broadway less than two years later, at the Union Square Theatre, and the Tectonic Theater Project even performed the play in Laramie, Wyoming. \"The Laramie Project\" has also been staged at high schools, colleges, and professional theaters across the United States, as well as in Canada, Ireland, and Australia.\n\nFilm\n\nIn 2002, \"The Laramie Project\" was adapted into a film for HBO. Moises Kaufman wrote and directed the film; the cast included Christina Ricci, Dylan Baker, Mark Webber, Laura Linney, Peter Fonda, Jeremy Davies, and Steve Buscemi. The movie received a special mention award at the Berlin International Film Festival and a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Television Movie.\n\nLegacy\n\nSince it was first produced in 2000, \"The Laramie Project\" has become a popular work of theater, often used in schools to teach tolerance and inclusivity. In 2008, Kaufman wrote a follow-up play, \"The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later,\" dealing with the legacy of the Shepard murder. The two plays were staged together as part of a special production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2013."}, {"url": "https://www.bam.org/laramieproject", "page_content": "Bank of America cardholders save 10%\n\nBank of America cardholders save 10% on tickets for BAM 2013 Winter/Spring Season Theater productions*.\n\n\n\nTo purchase tickets, call BAM Ticket Services at 718.636.4100 or visit the BAM Box Office.\n\n*Maximum of 2 discounted tickets per production per household.

After the residents of Laramie introduce their town, members of Tectonic Theater Project describe how the theater company\u2019s leader, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, asked them to join him in Laramie, Wyoming to research a play about the murder of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay university student in Laramie. Some theater company members were initially hesitant, worrying both about their own safety and the ethics of representing a real community on stage. After some thought and convincing, though, they did eventually agree to participate.\n\nIn Laramie, the company meets first with Rebecca Hilliker, the head of the theater department at the University of Wyoming. Rebecca connects them with people to interview, and the company uses fragments from these interviews (conducted with many people connected to Matthew Shepard) to give the audience a sense of who Matthew was according to the people who knew and loved him. Characters like Romaine Patterson describe Matthew\u2019s \u201cmega-watt\u201d smile, while limousine driver Doc O\u2019Connor talks about Matthew\u2019s straight-forwardness regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe company also uses these interviews to establish the town\u2019s general attitudes towards LGBT people at the time of Matthew\u2019s murder. Often, these interview fragments contradict one another, forcing the reader to dwell in the residents\u2019 subjective memories and opinions, and question what is and isn\u2019t true. Some members of the community are extremely accepting of LGBT people (especially those who are LGBT themselves or are closely connected with the LGBT community). Meanwhile, many straight residents believe that Wyoming\u2019s philosophy of \u201clive and let live\u201d is sufficiently tolerant of LGBT people, despite the fact that it forces them people to keep their identities to themselves. Many residents, especially residents who practice more conservative religions, express varying degrees of discomfort at the idea of homosexuality, with some admitting to open dislike or disgust.\n\nThrough interviews with people working at the Fireside bar, the playwrights begin to reveal what happened on the night of Matthew\u2019s murder. They suggest that Matthew, who had been drinking a Heineken alone at the bar, met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson and left with them around eleven-thirty at night. Aaron Kreifels, the university student who found Matthew the next morning, recalls his shock at seeing Matthew badly beaten and tied to a fence, where Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson had left him to die. Officer Reggie Fluty responded to Aaron Kreifels\u2019 911 call, stabilizing Matthew and putting him in an ambulance. During this process, Reggie was exposed to significant amounts of Matthew\u2019s blood. In the emergency room, Matthew began treatment, during which it became clear that he had suffered brain damage and needed life support.\n\nThe company then interviews Matthew\u2019s friends about their reactions to the shocking news of Matthew\u2019s attack, including Matthew\u2019s friend Romaine Patterson and Matthew\u2019s academic advisor Jon Peacock, who recall their disbelief, horror, and grief. Following their arrest, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were quickly arraigned. With several hundred people in the audience, Aaron and Russell were charged with murder. As news of their arrest spread, newspapers from all over the country sent reporters to Laramie, who overwhelmed the community with their questions and judgments. Matthew, meanwhile, remained in critical condition.\n\nAaron McKinney and Russell Henderson both decided to plead not guilty, making investigator Rob Debree determined to work hard to ensure they would not walk free after their trials. Meanwhile, first responder Reggie Fluty learned that Matthew was HIV positive, and, due to her contact with his blood during the emergency response, she was at risk for contracting HIV as well. In interviews, Reggie discusses her aggressive treatment plan and remarks on her anxiety about the possibility of having contracted the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, communities throughout the country held vigils for Matthew, including one organized in Laramie by Catholic Priest Father Roger Schmit. Interviews with members of the Laramie community at this time reveal that many people are struggling to reconcile their personal and religious objections to homosexuality with their horror at Matthew\u2019s murder. Some residents, who are unable to understand or accept the role that homophobia played in Matthew\u2019s attack, feel that the media is using Matthew\u2019s murder to extort unfair special privileges for LGBT people. Friends of Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson express their shock, sadness, or frustration at their crimes. Meanwhile, gay, lesbian, and bisexual Laramie residents fear for their safety while walking alone or showing affection for their partners in public.\n\nMembers of the theater company also speak with numerous religious leaders in the community during this time and attend their church services. These leaders include: the Unitarian minister, Stephen Mead Johnson, who feels it is his purpose to help the community become more open and accepting after the murder; Father Roger, the Catholic priest who organized Matthew\u2019s vigil; Doug Laws, the Mormon minister who condemns homosexuality; and the Baptist Minister, who suggests Matthew\u2019s attack may have been punishment for his gay \u201clifestyle.\u201d Together, these different religious beliefs represent the range of viewpoints the residents of Laramie express in reaction to Matthew\u2019s murder.\n\nAfter a long struggle for his life, Matthew dies in the intensive care unit surrounded by his family. Rulon Stacey, a devout Mormon and the hospital\u2019s CEO, cries on national television as he announces Matthew\u2019s death. Arrangements for Matthew\u2019s funeral are made, and, on a snowy day in late fall, the attendees fill two churches and an entire nearby park. Although Reverend Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church attempts to protest the funeral, his rant is drowned out by a chorus of counter protestors singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\nSix months later, Fred Phelps also protests Russell Henderson\u2019s trial, and Romaine Patterson, a close friend of Matthew\u2019s who was inspired by the \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d singers, stages a counter protest. Romaine and the other protestors wear angel wing costumes and encircle Phelps to block him from sight. Inside the courthouse, the jury selection for the trial takes place, and jurors are asked if they would be willing to give Russell the death penalty, since his crimes qualify him for capital punishment. However, before the trial takes place, Russell Henderson changes his plea to guilty, and so he receives two life sentences instead of the death penalty. Just after Russell\u2019s trial, Reggie Fluty receives the happy news that she tested negative for HIV.\n\nNext, the play presents Aaron\u2019s trial. Before the trial, many characters debate their feelings on the death penalty, since Aaron, who did not plead guilty in exchange for a plea deal like Russell, is eligible to be put to death. Some characters are ideologically opposed to the death penalty, believing that violence is never an appropriate response to violence. Other Laramie residents believe that, in order for justice to be obtained, Aaron must be put to death. As the trial begins, the play enacts the dialogue from Aaron\u2019s taped confession to Rob Debree. In the confession, Aaron admits to beating Matthew to death and leaving him tied to a fence to die because Matthew hit on him.\n\nThe jurors convict Aaron of murder. Aaron\u2019s defense team then approaches the Shepard family to ask for life imprisonment for Aaron rather than capital punishment. The prosecution decides to honor the family\u2019s wishes regarding whether to ask for the death penalty, leaving the decision up to Matthew\u2019s parents, Dennis and Judy. Matthew\u2019s father Dennis Shepard makes an emotional statement about his son in which he describes his love for Matthew and his belief that Matthew was with God when he died. Dennis then tells the public that, although he and his family believe in the death penalty and although he thinks that Aaron deserves to die, Dennis and Judy decide to show mercy on Aaron and grant him his life in Matthew\u2019s memory. Dennis instructs Aaron to think of Matthew often and be grateful that he is alive because of him.\n\nWith the trials at last over, Laramie residents reflect on how the murder has changed both their community and their personal outlook. Jedadiah notes that he has become much more open to gay people since the murder, and will be playing a gay character in a university production of Angels in America. Many characters feel similarly changed. Some characters, however, like Jonas Slonaker, feel frustrated by what they see as a lack of progress. In the end, the theater company leaves with many emotional goodbyes and backwards glances and goes home to New York to produce their play."}, {"url": "https://www.amazon.com/Laramie-Project-Ten-Years-Later/dp/0804170398", "page_content": "These are essentially the scripts for the productions, which consist of a series of monologues or interviews. The actors each portray of several of the characters and without much--if any--scenery or costumes, they need to assume each new character by demeanor, since there are times when the same actor will segue from one part to another, simply by moving across the stage, or turning around.\n\n\n\nMy son was in a production recently that ran over two weekends. I read these works in between. Even though I'd seen both shows before, I found it enlightening to see the directions for how a characters was to be portrayed; the one sticking in my mind is in the second book, where the convicted killer is not supposed to be portrayed as dark or sinister; which makes it all the more disturbing to hear the matter of fact manner in which he offers the details of what he did..\n\n\n\nAfter reading these works, the following week's performances had a number of \"aha\" moments, but even without being a frequent flyer, these are illuminating and worthwhile reads. I enjoy being at a show that will later have a \"talkback\" with the director or various actors. It's a chance to get clarification about why something was said or done in a certain way. This gave me a similar feeling, and with the large number of people in the town who were interviewed, it kept track of a few of the names and relationships I had confused.\n\n\n\nThe Laramie Project Ten Years Later is not produced as often as the original work. I've seen the original a number of times, but only saw the ten year project once, at a simulcast when it was released. I'd forgotten a number of the details, yet this is as important as the original work, because it not only shows what has happened in the decade since then, but it includes interviews with the two convicted of killing Matthew Shepard. These two were only portrayed in the original piece in the courtroom, or through an interrogation transcript. Here they are interviewed by members of the same group that started the project.\n\n\n\nIn the years since this took place, alternate theories about the incident have been offered. They are mentioned in the second project, but addressing these theories is not their aim. The purpose of either project had never been to solve a crime; that had already been done. Their aim had been to observe and record reactions to the crime, and let those who see the show draw their own conclusions about what these reactions suggest. Every year, many productions of the show take place around the country. But every year, there are also groups that can't or won't, either because a school administrator vetoes the project, or or fear of audience reaction. Observing the unlikely subjects for shows that are produced--as musicals--with no censure, while the The Laramie Project is considered offensive and off limits is a good reason to read the stories, and decide for yourself."}, {"url": "https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/235626/the-laramie-project-and-the-laramie-project-ten-years-later-by-moises-kaufman-and-members-of-the-tectonic-theater-project-leigh-fondakowski-greg-pierotti-andy-paris-and-stephen-belber/", "page_content": "About The Laramie Project and The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later\n\nTwo classic plays in a single volume: One of the most-performed theater pieces in America about the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard and the town in which it happened, joined by an essential and moving sequel to the original play.\n\n\n\n\u201cA terrific piece of theater, history, and life\u2026.

The Laramie Project is a play about the community of Laramie, Wyoming in the aftermath of the 1998 tragic murder of Matthew Shepard, who was a gay student at the University of Wyoming. The murder was denounced as a hate crime and sparked a national debate.\n\nMembers of the Tectonic Theater Project flew from New York City to Laramie and interviewed over 100 members of the community about their reactions to the murder and to the media attention that engulfed their town. The resulting play presents the perspectives of multiple people simultaneously, including the citizens of Laramie, members of the Tectonic Theater Project, and members of the media. The themes that emerge from this documentary-style play transcend the small town of Laramie, making The Laramie Project one of the most performed plays in America. Matthew Shepard was killed 20 years ago this fall.\n\nDirector of the Common Reading Program, Dr. Martha McCaughey, said, \"The Laramie Project represents a creative and illuminating response to an act of inhumane violence. The various perspectives about exclusion, violence, and community membership offered by The Laramie Project are quite relevant for our incoming first-year students, whom we hope will engage in discussions about the issues that shape our community.\"\n\nJason Marsden, Executive Director of the Matthew Shepard Foundation, stated, \"Over the last two decades, Judy Shepard has delivered her message of inclusion and compassion to more than 800 colleges, workforces, and community organizations.

In today's moment where hate groups proliferate and violence mounts, this work remains sadly relevant.\n\n\n\nWhat this play says to me is that Small town America is big city America is rural America in one sense: The human animal strives for community, acceptance, love, calories, understanding, enthrallment in every context. But what's particular about this situation is that despite this being a city, most people know each other or are at most only one-degree of separation. And so, if it is true that much hate is borne from cognitive dissonance, an impersonal spacing, the fear of the Other, then you have to look at Laramie as interesting case study, where less fathomable explanations obtain. And grappling with these ideas, emotions and beliefs can be deeply troubling.\n\n\n\n\"What's come out of this that's concrete or lasting?\" (99)\n\n\n\nI remember when Matthew Shepard was killed. I was in high school. It was a news item. It entered my world briefly and receded just as fast. I remember hearing the criticism expressed in earnest near the end of the play about why this particular gruesome death would get so much coverage while many others went unrecognized. You still hear charges leveled about the bias reflected by the choice of which stories get a share of the blue light and which remain in the dark. So many arguments. So many points.\n\n\n\nAnother one of which is that humans are really only able to experience empathy on an individual scale.\n\n\n\nOn another day I will scrutinize and criticize mainstream media for dramatizing trivia and trivializing drama. But today, it's enough to say that sometimes important things come to light, if only briefly. And that sometimes people like Mr. Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project take that opportunity to ossify the moment. And so this play has coalesced as both tribute and meditation on how the world of phenomena impacts belief formation and so that perhaps, Mr. Shepard, you will not have died in vain.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nA quick note on why I did not star (though I reserve the right to go back and change that later): I could not read this with my normal aesthetic eye (though the prose was very thoughtfully curated) as the play is one that is less literary (though it does deconstruct its own form) and more political/social/historical.\n\n\n\nBut, to be clear, I think everyone should spend the hour or so it takes to read, as everyone can take something from it. I put off reading this for so long not because the subject matter was depressing. If I'm being honest, it was more likely that I thought it wouldn't tell me something I didn't already know. Going back as far as secondary school I have been concerned and involved with issues of social justice. I have long considered myself radically progressive and an LBGTQ ally. Nonetheless, I took quite a bit away from this experience, not the least of which was the philosophical meditation on apostasy.\n\n\n\n\"And I will speak with you, I will trust that if you write a play of this, that you say it right. You need to do your best to say it correct.\" (100)"}]}
