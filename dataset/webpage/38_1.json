You may remember the catchy girl-power anthem \u2018Not The Same Girl.\u2019 #throwback But, Seyi soon realized that she had her own message to put out and broke out as a solo artist in 2015 when she released her debut album with Island Records. Now Seyi has over 1 million followers on IG, a residency at legendary Biosdale of Canary Wharf, London and a musical collab with Teyana Taylor. How does she have the time? We managed to grab her for a quick chat during a typically busy week to find out.\n\nWe have to start with your collaboration with Teyana Taylor for the \u2018Gimme Love\u2019 remix. We\u2019re obsessed! Tell us a little bit about how this partnership came about and how you found your experience working with her.\n\nSS: This was set up by JQ of FTR, my international manager. I saw Teyana perform at a writer\u2019s award ceremony in Atlanta last year and I was blown away. So, when JQ said there would be an opportunity to feature her on the track, I said: \u201cyes!\u201d \u2018Gimme Love\u2019 was the perfect record for such an international collaboration.\n\nYou have been managed by some huge names in the music industry. How did you get your foot in the door?\n\nSS: Matthew Knowles was my first manager and he\u2019s still a mentor of mine. He managed the girl band I was part of at the time called \u2018From Above.\u2019 That was an audition process and I eventually joined as the lead singer.\n\nI started singing in my school choir, then my church choir, then auditioned to be part of girl groups and then eventually, years later after many failures and disbanding, I went solo as you see me today.\n\nYou have a massive presence on social media, particularly on Instagram; with more than 1 million followers. How is your relationship with social media and how do you think social media affects your relationship with your audience?\n\nSS: I feel very blessed to have so many followers on IG. They are not only my fans but friends. I listen to their opinions and I share mine. IG really helps me to know what people want to see and hear. It\u2019s also a great way to share new projects and keep my fans updated on what I\u2019m doing.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about fashion. Does your heritage influence your style? Do you have a favorite designer?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have a favorite designer, but I love all the ones I wear regularly. I like David TIale from South Africa, Orange Culture from Nigeria, DNA from Nigeria, Maxivive from Nigeria, Tokyo James from Nigeria, Clan, Tiffany Amber and House of CB to name a few.\n\nHow is your relationship with makeup? Is it something that you play with and are into?\n\nSS: I\u2019m really into make-up as you can imagine. I have to wear it all the time because of my job. I try to wear as little as I can though because I\u2019m an African woman and we like to stay as natural as possible. So my daily make-up routine would be a bit of concealer, lip tint, mascara and highlights on my cheekbones.\n\nDo you have an icon or idol that you look up to?\n\nSS: It used to be Michael Jackson. Now I think it would be Sade.\n\nWe\u2019re interested in your creative process for making music. Can you walk us through it?\n\nSS: I work with different writers and producers. We normally meet up somewhere secluded and just vibe to tracks in the studio. I normally write and sing about love and how vulnerable I can be to it.\n\nHow is the experience of being in a band different from being a solo artist? Do you miss that chapter of your life?\n\nSS: Although I miss the girls, I think my path is to be a solo artist. I prefer it because of the creative freedom I have and I get to move at my own pace.\n\nCan you give us a glimpse of what a typical day in the life of Seyi might look like?\n\nSS: I wake up, meditate, gym, shower and then studio/ interview/ event/ appearance/ travel/ show time!\n\nWhat can we look forward to seeing from you in the future? Any exciting projects in the pipeline?\n\nSS: I have new management out here in Africa called Aristokrat 360 who have partnered with my international management. After the release of \u2018Gimme Love\u2019 featuring Teyana Taylor, the first major project we will do together is complete my forthcoming EP which will be released in early 2020 featuring some more exciting artists.\n\nKeep up to date with Seyi\u2019s latest projects on her Instagram @iamseyishay .\n\nNext Up, Happy Socks X Macaulay Culkin \u2013 The Ultimate Holiday Collection"}, {"url": "https://naijabiography.com/biography/seyi-shay-biography/", "page_content": "TDeborah Oluwaseyi Joshua better known by the stage name Seyi Shay is a Nigerian-based singer-songwriter, recording artist, performer, and actress.

Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that. There is a type of glory that marriage gives you and your relationship as a woman or man and that is beyond the contract or the things you say to each other or the number of people in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nSeyi Shay quotes\n\nHere are some of her famous quotes\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t realize it, you are always moving forward and evolving.

She was born in Tottenham, London, England, to Nigerian parents who named her Oluwaseyi Odedere. Seyi\u2019s father is an indigene of Ife (a town in Osun State, South West, Nigeria), which means the singer\u2019s ethnicity is Yoruba. However, her mother hails from one of the Northern states in Nigeria. Nothing much is known about her parents and siblings except that they lived in the United Kingdom for many years.\n\nSeyi spent her early years in England until she was 2 years of age when she started visiting her home country, Nigeria. She eventually relocated to Nigeria, where she completed her high school education at Command High School, Maryland, Lagos State. She holds a degree in music and business management, which she obtained from a local UK college and the University of East London, respectively.\n\nHer Family Has an Extensive Background in Music\n\nBeing born into a family with proximity to a certain profession could help you develop a special interest in it, gain inside knowledge, and even be privy to career-centered opportunities that others may not have access to. This is a true situation for Seyi Shay, who grew up among family members with a passion for music. Shay was raised by her single mother, who, as a Christian, was a church chorister. She has three siblings- two brothers, one of which was a prominent club and radio DJ in London, and a sister who used to compose songs for the BBC.\n\nIt took Seyi Shay only a few years to master some aspects of music, after which she decided to pursue a professional career in music.

When it was time for Seyi to take up courses that would help her boost her career in music, she faced strong opposition from her mother, who wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer. However, before her death, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.\n\nA Look At Seyi Shay\u2019s Breakthrough in the Music World\n\nBeing a successful female musician in a competitive industry dominated by men is not an easy feat.

The girls also launched their own MTV reality show titled: \u201cBreaking From Above\u201d (it aired in over 166 countries worldwide) and were also present at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, where they presented an award to recipients.\n\nSeyi Shay later scored a recording deal with Sony and has continued to move from one level of success to another. Her return to Nigeria to pursue her music career was inspired by Nigerian rapper and singer Sound Sultan, who she met in London in 2011. After listening to her demos, Sultan convinced her to relocate to Nigeria and pursue her musical career. Under Cecil Hammond\u2019s record label Fly time Music, Seyi was able to launch her solo career in Nigeria and promote her brand.

Her debut album, Seyi or Shay, appeared in 2015, and she became an integral part of the Nigerian music scene before following it up with 2021's Big Girl.\n\nBorn and raised in Tottenham, North London to Nigerian parents, Seyi Shay (aka Deborah Oluwaseyi Joshua) was introduced to music at an early age, performing in her local community choir before finding her own voice while in high school. Early sessions with Grammy-nominated producer Harmony Samuels (Chip, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Rowland) while still in school cemented Shay's passion for music, and she eventually earned a BA in Music Business. By 2006, Shay had formed a group under the name Boadicea, but after a short spell the outfit went their separate ways, with Shay auditioning for another girl group, From Above, which had been created by Destiny's Child manager Matthew Knowles. Put through their paces on the 2011 MTV show Breaking from Above, the group performed as support on the U.K. leg of Beyonc\u00e9's I Am\u2026 World Tour, and released the album Breaking from Above. Following its release, the group split, with Shay moving to Nigeria to embark on a solo career.\n\n2011 saw her release her debut single, \"Loving Your Way,\" the blend of Afropop, R&B, and hip-hop was a new direction for Shay, and a string of singles followed, including the Wizkid collaboration \"Crazy,\" before she issued her debut solo album, Seyi or Shay, in 2015. Over the next couple of years she issued more singles and became an integral part of the Afropop scene, which had exploded across the globe. By 2021, she had signed a deal with Nigerian label Aristokrat Records, become a judge on the sixth edition of the talent show Nigerian Idol, and embarked on an acting career with a part in Lara and the Beat. Returning to music at the end of the year, she issued her sophomore album, Big Girl, in December, which saw her working with producers from Lagos, London, and L.A."}, {"url": "https://tooxclusive.com/album-review-seyi-shay-seyi-or-shay/", "page_content": "Artiste \u2013 Seyi Shay\n\nAlbum \u2013 Seyi or Shay\n\nGuest Appearances \u2013 Cynthia Morgan, Phyno, Sound Sultan, Wizkid, Patoranking, Shaydee, Timaya, Femi Kuti, D\u2019banj, Iyanya & Banky W\n\nProducers \u2013 Mike Okoigun, Harmony Samuels, Jerome Williams, Otee Beatz, Legendury Beatz, Tee-Y Mix, Pheelz.

After countless singles and management changes; \u201cShay\u201d, a fierce, sassy, eccentric, edgy persona manifests to counter, \u201cSeyi\u201d, the traditional, homely, sultry, sleek, sexy diva exhibited in her debut single \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d. Diamonds are formed under pressure; with Tiwa Savage championing the afro-pop/beats genre and Yemi Alade governing the world and highlife music realm, Seyi did not break, rather the contralto created an alter ego to aid her find sonic balance between her western music influences and afro music to ensure that her \u201cslayage\u201d was supreme.\n\nDid Seyi Shay deliver on her debut album? Yes, it is what the career doctor prescribed! Although Shay painfully dragged tons of male afro-pop giants to bless the set with \u201cstreet credibility\u201d at various stops; Seyi shines like an \u201cIrawo\u201d vocally, tackling various societal issues facing females and serving a near-perfect blend of ragga, afro-pop and highlife. Amidst the constant struggle between the different characters of \u201cSeyi\u201d or \u201cShay\u201d, she tackles each number with emotional precision, skill and exceptional singing. Seyi Shay might not have the most expansive vocal range or be a vocal powerhouse yet she one of the most technical vocalists Nigeria has to offer.\n\nFor deeper insight on the album, digest our track-to-track analysis of \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d.\n\nIntro: Having dealt with her alter-ego first hand, Seyi introduces us to the care-free Shay, so that we are not caught off guard by her larger-the-life personality. The Mic: Over a pop rock inspired instrumentation, Shay talks about Seyi\u2019s struggle and the constant pressure she faced from society to rise to the occasion and succeed; she also gets cocky about the success she has attained as she sings, \u201cI got the mic now, I guess I\u2019m famous\u2026I won\u2019t use a gun, I kill them with my mic now, right now..\u201d on the electronic guitar enriched chorus. In Public (feat. Cynthia Morgan): Attention demanding synths, claps and kicks explode as Shay and the controversial Cynthia Morgan sing about the battle of not being the \u201cside-chic\u201d and wanting to be seen \u201cIn Public\u201d with their lover. A perfect collaboration simply because Cynthia Morgan has the same persona with Shay. Mary (feat. Phyno): Seyi Shay enlists indigenous Igbo speaking rapper Phyno on Otee Beatz produced hip-hop influenced \u201cMary\u201d. She sings about the song\u2019s character, a girl with a bad reputation; not the strongest song on the set but it just slides in. It is very safe to say that the said Mary, Shay sings about is Marijuana. Right Now: The sultry \u201cRight Now\u201d is a mid-tempo reggae/R&B fusion that expresses the singer nostalgia about a former lover. She takes the bull by the balls proceeding to tell the said lover; \u201cTouch Me Now, Right Now, now, now\u2026\u201d on the explosive chorus. She wants to recreate the relationship that happened in the past; that said the sexy number sprinkled slightly with Pidgin English is a lush ear candy. Healer (feat. Sound Sultan): Seyi plans to heal the world with love accompanied by Sound Sultan. Just like \u201cRight Now\u201d, the ragga inspired \u201cHealer\u201d produced by Harmony Samuels is a sure winner. Crazy (feat. Wizkid): Shay takes centre stage, as the seventh track kicks in. A thumping high-octane afro-beat duet with Wizkid, on the production angle by Lgendury Beatz. No Vacancy: The Tee-Y Mix produced \u201cNo Vacany\u201d, sees Seyi return to the musical stylings of her debut singles \u201cNo Lele\u201d, \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d and \u201cIrawo\u201d. Seyi sings about out-growing a past lover from a hazardous relationship who is seeking to return. This is a captivating afro R&B gem, packed with brilliant vocal layering, background vocals and ad-libs. \u201cNo Vacany\u201d is a personal favourite from the LP; it showcases various shades of Seyi\u2019s vulnerabilities and strengths. Pack and Go (feat. Olamide): Aimed at gaining Shay, a street-hop base and give the LP some street cred. Olamide guest stars on \u201cPack and Go\u201d. Despite the annoying use of effects on Shay\u2019s vocals, \u201cPack and Go\u201d talks about domestic abuse in an interesting manner. The returnee vocalist wants out of an abusive relationship, while the street-hop titan wants to make it work; in all the Pheelz produced rap-sung track Murda (feat. Shaydee & Patoranking): Easy, breezy, and beautiful! Seyi Shay feeds off Patoranking ragga style and Shaydee\u2019s distinct vocals to deliver a clean mid-tempo summer ragga number. Higher: Seyi flips the coin as she brings her stellar pipes, hunting instrumentation on a powerful message that rises to unexpected heights vocally and musically. \u201cHigher\u201d showcases Seyi\u2019s amazing singing abilities, even more than the previously leaked \u201cAir Brush\u201d. Spiritually themed, \u201cHigher\u201d is arguably \u201cSeyi or Shay\u201d brightest moment. Everlasting Love: Although it becomes likeable when not fully paid attention, the lukewarm poppy \u201cEverlasting Love\u201d drops the bar. Killing Me Softly (feat. Timaya): Reworked and slightly different from the version released as a single in 2013; the album version of the Timaya assisted \u201cKilling Me Softly\u201d is very likeable and easy to digest. \u201cKiling Me Softly\u201d glides into the set without hassle. Church (feat. Boj): Seyi plans to take her haters and enemies to the church with this infectious, smooth and groovy mid-tempo duet with underrated alternative artiste Boj. Seyi exercises restraint allowing the calm melody and message do most the work although we would have loved to hear Seyi go big on the chorus like she did on \u201cNo Vacancy\u201d or \u201cHigher\u201d. Loud (feat. Femi Kuti): A Seyi Shay and Femi Kuti collaboration sounds fabulous on paper but not so much in reality. \u201cLoud\u201d is average at best as Shay employs the eldest son of afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, to bless her afrobeat inspired track with his Saxophone; Kuti delivered but Shay\u2019s lyrics and delivery missed the bull\u2019s eye. Tina (feat. D\u2019Banj): Featuring D\u2019banj to tap into his fanbase has it pros and Listeners might end up being torn between D\u2019banj drowning Seyi with his vocals and the beauty of the harmonica enriched highlife instrumentation. On \u201cTina\u201d, D\u2019banj fails to compliment Seyi\u2019s vocals or arouse any goosebumps. Love Wan Tin Tin: Seyi gets back on her feet with a racy delivery on \u201cLove Wan Tin Tin\u201d. Where did you go? The 3 minutes R&B and high-life fusion is short and sweet. \u201cLove Wan Tin Tin\u201d is the album filler the doctor prescribed. More Seyi and Tee-Y Mix please? Jangilova: Ending the musical ordeal is the Del B produced high-life romantic number \u201cJangilova\u201d. Seyi\u2019s shakes off her western musical styling and sings like a foreigner trying to impress a villager and tries to embody the \u201chighlife diva\u201d on \u201cJangilova\u201d. Not the most epic album finale to be experienced, yet a Seyi Shay and Del B combo is a meal not to miss. Right Now (Remix) : Iyanya and Banky W did not push right now to new boundaries; the original slays this remix. Camp Shay should have treated us to bonus tracks from previous released singles richer than this so-so remix; they could have picked from \u201cRagga Ragga\u201d, \u201cChairman\u201d, \u201cNo Lele\u201d, \u201cLoving Your Way\u201d, \u201cIrawo\u201d or \u201cAir Brush\u201d.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nReviewed by Ogaga Sakpaide\n\nOgaga Sakpaide is a music enthusiast and digital public relations expert.\n\nThe thoughts expressed in this article are solely the author\u2019s.

Men decide what the acceptable level of sexuality is. It is a precise calibration: Do it like this and you will be accepted; go against this and you will be scorned, or worse alone. And you know women are just dying for male company.\n\nThe push back has been less a shunning than a shunting of female desire: Women in pop took the freak out of the sheets and into the studio. It is a tricky paradigm given that that freedom just might make more males happy\u2014more \u2018happy\u2019 than happy in any case. But at least the woman gets to decide where exactly that \u2018freakishness\u2019 is displayed. We\u2019ll call that a victory, pyrrhic or no.\n\nSo when Nigerian singer Seyi Shay sings about making out in public (she isn\u2019t referring to PDA) on her debut album Seyi or Shay we have to consider this the literal endpoint of the pop music's push back.\n\nThis freak-in-studio scenario doesn\u2019t exclude the problem; it complicates it. As when Seyi Shay paints a picture of a sexually available woman on \u2018Right Now\u2019. \u201cThat is why I surrender\u2026from the midnight to the sunrise, the love dey enter\u2026\u201d Any man listening to that, with its clear invitation to what can be surmised as endless near-contortionist sex, is thinking: I need me one of that. What is the female response? Not sure but the feminist response should be enlightening. One can only imagine the horrified look on their faces when Seyi Shay goes literal on \u2018Crazy\u2019: \u201cYou tell me jump baby, I ask how high.\u201d Hmm, there you go, modern woman.\n\nOn the aforementioned song \u2018In Public\u2019\u2014where she says, \u2018I give it to him wherever like a freak\u2019\u2014she recruits Cynthia Morgan, another woman making a way through the testosterone-laden Nigerian scene, one sexual innuendo a time. Together they present the new woman in pop as an empowered being\u2014with both the libido and the dirty-mouth of their male colleagues. Suddenly Omawumi\u2019s singing about a young man\u2019s inability \u2018to handle it\u2019 on 2013\u2019s \u2018Warn Yourself\u2019 sounds toothless. Sass is out. Freak is in.\n\nSeyi or Shay runs the gamut of sex. Heterosexual coupling is dominant but there is also the subtly homosexual. On \u2018Mary\u2019, Seyi or Shay (hard to tell the difference, really) is attracted to the \u2018baddest b*tch in the club\u2019 whose virginal name must be part of the allure. A deliciously slow-burn tune that incorporates Beyonce-style shouts and chants of Hail Mary, our singer can\u2019t quite decide if the attraction is sexual or sisterly: towards the end, Mary is \u201clike a best friend now\u201d. It is with some disappointment the listener realises that what she assumed was female sexual empowerment is merely a projection of a male fantasy.\n\nIn case this reading of the song is missed, Phyno enforces it with a slurred braggadocio verse involving a threesome. It is easy to guess that Phyno's preferred arrangement involves two women, Seyi or Shay and new best friend Mary. So that, once again, female freedom appears indistinguishable from sexual availability forged around a man's desire.\n\nNon-sexual concerns don\u2019t quite work on Seyi or Shay. For example, the song \u2018Healer\u2019 has Ms. Seyi imply that love is what our economy needs. At that point, you want to tell the well-meaning madam to keep her solutions to herself. The song\u2019s reggae backing clearly meant to give gravitas by association only serves to amplify the song\u2019s corniness. It serves the album well, though, since it offers Ms. Seyi an opportunity to sneak in the popular \u201cmake love not war\u201d slogan\u2014considering the rest of the album, that line is, of course, accompanied with an audible wink.\n\nAt 19 tracks, Seyi or Shay is comprised of several sounds. Pop, Afro-pop, reggae, R&B, hip hop and Afrobeat find a place. And all of the genres are represented by a reigning male czar: Olamide and Phyno for hip hop, Wizkid, Timaya and D\u2019Banj for pop, Boj for the alternative sound, Patoranking for reggae, Iyanya and Banky W for R&B, and Femi Kuti scion of Fela for Afrobeat. It is hard to think of this collection of oft-engaging overproduced music as anything other than calculated and rehearsed. This may be the route to follow as a female artist in a male-dominated industry.\n\n\u201cBeen around the world/I\u2019m tryna get me famous,\u201d Ms. Seyi Shay sings at some point. Well, she has gotten some of the fame she seeks and has released a debut album in quite a short time. In essence, the singer will soar on her determination alone.\n\nWhat about the album? Well, sex, as they say, sells. So Seyi or Shay, designed for the market and for radio, should do just as well as the singer. Mind you, if her audience becomes puritan overnight and the sex on display sells neither singer nor album, then the successful acts she has featured will do so. As everyone knows by now, nothing succeeds like success.\n\nArtist: Seyi Shay\n\nAlbum: Seyi or Shay\n\nLabel, Year: Island/ Stargurl Ltd, 2015"}, {"url": "https://www.tooxclusive.i.ng/2022/08/album-seyi-shay-big-girl-ft-wande-coal.html", "page_content": "Last Updated on Aug 4, 2022 | 00:19 by Tommy\n\nSoulful singer, accomplished songwriter, and dynamic performer Seyi Shay says, \u2018No Be Today, Been A Big Girl Since Day One\u2019\u2026\n\nFinally Seyi Shay is here with the Highly Anticipated \u201cBig Girl\u201d Album.

As long as they're chics, and not one.

Eventually, anyway, he was cheating on me and I found out because I walked in on the situation. I really wish I didn\u2019t have to. So, the reason I decided and agreed to get married to this person is that I have a certain opinion on marriage. I don\u2019t believe in the typical generalization of marriage. I don\u2019t believe in that whole western type of ceremony or marriage \u2013 It is much deeper than that. Marriage to me is a bit more spiritual. It is much deeper than that.
