The Philadelphia Eagles had the most selections with eight players (six starters). The Dallas Cowboys and the Kansas City Chiefs were next with seven selections each.\n\nThe Pro Bowl is determined by a combination of votes by fans, coaches and players. Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce all received top votes from fans and made their respective teams.\n\nThe NFL announced in September that it would no longer play a conventional football game at the Pro Bowl and is instead opting for a rebranded series of events that will include multiple skill competitions in addition to three flag football games. Peyton Manning has been named the AFC coach and will be joined by Hall-of-Famer Ray Lewis as his defensive coordinator and Mexico Women's Flag National Team quarterback Diana Flores as offensive coordinator. Eli Manning was named the NFC coach alongside DeMarcus Ware as defensive coordinator and U.S. Women's Flag National Team quarterback Vanita Krouch as offensive coordinator.\n\nThe Pro Bowl is scheduled for Feb. 5 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas (ABC/ESPN).\n\nHere's a team-by-team look at the players chosen for this season's game. Analysis of top snubs is here:\n\nJump to:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nPro Bowlers: Josh Allen, QB (2), Stefon Diggs, WR (3), Mitch Morse, C (1), Jordan Poyer, S (1)\n\nFor the Bills, this year marks long-awaited nods for Morse and Poyer, both of whom are over the age of 30 and making their first Pro Bowls. Poyer was named first-team All-Pro for the first time last season. He is tied for fifth in the league with four interceptions. Morse is a leader on the offensive line and has started every game he has played (108). The nods for Allen and Diggs were expected, but it is notable this is a third straight season for Diggs, meaning he has been named to the Pro Bowl each year he has played in Buffalo.\n\nDid you know? The Bills did not have any player leading at his position in the fan vote, which counts for a third of the voting process alongside coaches and players. Despite that, four Bills made the roster, which is two more than last year (LT Dion Dawkins and Diggs). -- Alaina Getzenberg\n\nPro Bowlers: Tyreek Hill, WR (7), Terron Armstead, OT (4), Xavien Howard, CB (4)\n\nHill received the second-most votes of any player with more than 293,000 votes -- a much-deserved honor after setting a career high in receiving yards through just 14 games. Armstead was the Dolphins' most important free agent signing and has solidified the NFL's worst offensive line from a season ago. Howard's numbers are down slightly from a season ago, but he has still tallied three takeaways as the Dolphins' No. 1 cornerback.\n\nDid you know? Last week, Hill became the first player in Dolphins' franchise history with 1,500 receiving yards. The now seven-time Pro Bowler is 412 yards away from breaking Calvin Johnson's single-season receiving record of 1,947. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\n\nPro Bowlers: Matthew Judon, OLB (4)\n\nReflective of the Patriots' 7-7 season, the team has just one Pro Bowler. This is Judon's fourth consecutive Pro Bowl and his second straight with the Patriots. He has a career-high 14.5 sacks this season, becoming the fourth Patriots player with back-to-back 10-plus sack totals after reaching 12.5 sacks in his first season with the Patriots in 2021. Perennial Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater had his spot go to the Jets' Justin Hardee.\n\nDid you know? Andre Tippett is the only Patriots player to record more sacks in a season than Judon. The Pro Football Hall of Famer recorded 18.5 sacks in 1984 and 16.5 sacks in 1985. -- Mike Reiss\n\nPro Bowlers: Sauce Gardner, CB (1); Justin Hardee, DB (1), C.J. Mosley, ILB (5); Quinnen Williams, DT (1)\n\nIt's uncommon for the Jets to have multiple Pro Bowlers. The previous time it occurred was 2018 (S Jamal Adams, KR Andre Roberts, K Jason Myers). Come to think of it, the Jets usually don't have one Pro Bowler, let alone two or three. This ends a two-year drought for the Jets. Gardner and Williams were both named starters. Gardner is a strong candidate for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, and Williams (11 sacks) should be in the conversation for NFL Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nDid you know? Gardner is the first Jets rookie to make the Pro Bowl since S Erik McMillan in 1988. -- Rich Cimini\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nPro Bowlers: Justin Tucker, K (6), Patrick Ricard, FB (4), Mark Andrews, TE (3), Marlon Humphrey, CB (3), Devin Duvernay, Returner (2), Roquan Smith, MLB (1)\n\nThis marks the fourth straight season that Baltimore, with six players named to the Pro Bowl, has had at least five selections. Smith, who was acquired in a midseason trade with the Bears, is going to his first Pro Bowl in his fifth NFL season. Smith is the league's sixth-best tackler (130 tackles), and the Ravens have allowed the second-fewest points (13.3) in six games with him. Andrews is the best tight end in football not named Travis Kelce, and he now has been to more Pro Bowls than any other Ravens tight end. Ricard, who is a dominating blocker for the NFL's second-best run game, was named to his fourth straight Pro Bowl, the longest active streak on the team. Humphrey is one of the most versatile corners in the game with three interceptions and three sacks. Duvernay received the Pro Bowl nod one day after sustaining a foot injury that will sideline him for the rest of the regular season. The biggest snub was guard Kevin Zeitler, who didn't make the Pro Bowl for the 11th consecutive season despite leading his position in fan voting.\n\nDid you know? Tucker, the best kicker in the game, is closing in on another distinction. He was named to his sixth Pro Bowl, which ranks second all time among pure place-kickers, behind only Hall of Famer Morten Andersen, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection. This selection also puts Tucker in elite company with the Ravens. There have only been five players in franchise history who have been named to more Pro Bowls than Tucker: linebacker Ray Lewis (12), offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden (11), safety Ed Reed (nine), guard Marshal Yanda (eight) and linebacker Terrell Suggs (seven). -- Jamison Hensley\n\nPro Bowlers: Joe Burrow, QB (1), Ja'Marr Chase, WR (2), Trey Hendrickson, DE (2)\n\nFor the second straight year, the Bengals had three players earn Pro Bowl nods. Burrow headlines this year's group. The third-year player and former No. 1 overall pick was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career. Chase and Hendrickson return as Pro Bowlers for the second consecutive season. All three dealt with injuries at various points of the season, but their on-field merits were enough to give them the necessary votes for the honor.\n\nDid you know? Burrow is the first Cincinnati quarterback to reach the Pro Bowl since Andy Dalton in 2016 -- Ben Baby\n\nPro Bowlers: Joel Bitonio, OG (5), Nick Chubb, RB (4), Myles Garrett, DE (4)\n\nFor the third straight year, Bitonio, Chubb and Garrett will be representing the Browns. Bitonio, who hasn't missed an offensive snap since the 2016 season, is the ninth Brown to be named to five consecutive Pro Bowls, joining former Cleveland greats like Jim Brown, Lou Groza and Otto Graham. Chubb is third in the league in rushing, and with 1,252 yards, remains within striking distance of his first NFL rushing title. Garrett, who leads the NFL in pass rush win rate among edge rushers, also received the most Pro Bowl votes among AFC edge rushers.\n\nDid you know? Chubb is one of three Cleveland running backs to make four consecutive Pro Bowls, joining Jim Brown (Pro Bowler from 1957 to 1965) and Leroy Kelly (Pro Bowler from 1966 to 1971). -- Jake Trotter\n\nPro Bowlers: T.J. Watt, OLB (4), Minkah Fitzpatrick, FS, (3)\n\nIn a roller-coaster season, Fitzpatrick has been a constant force in the Steelers' secondary. He started the season with a pick-six in Week 1 and is currently second in interception yards (94) and tied for fifth in interceptions (four). Despite missing eight games on injured reserve, Watt was named to the Pro Bowl a year after earning NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors. In an abbreviated season, Watt has 4 sacks, 2 interceptions and 29 total tackles.\n\nDid you know? The Steelers have sent multiple players to the Pro Bowl for 22 consecutive seasons. --Brooke Pryor\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nPro Bowlers: Laremy Tunsil, LT (3)\n\nTunsil has been the Texans' best player by a landslide. For him to be named to the Pro Bowl from a one-win team shows how dominant he's been. Each week, Tunsil locked down the opposing teams' best pass-rusher. And it wasn't like the competition he battled was weak. Tunsil didn't allow a sack against Raiders defensive ends Maxx Crosby (11.5) and Chandler Jones (4.5), who have combined for 16 sacks this season.\n\nDid you know? Last season, the Texans didn't have any players make the Pro Bowl, which snapped a 17-year streak (2004 to 2020) of having at least one. -- DJ Bien-Aime\n\nPro Bowlers: Quenton Nelson, G (5)\n\nThe Colts had an NFL-high seven Pro Bowl selections in 2021. Having just one in 2022 speaks to the depths of the team's struggles this season. The Colts have lost seven of their past eight games and are in the midst of one of their worst seasons in the past decade. Nelson is part of an offensive line which had its worst season in years, and he did not personally play to his usual high standards. But his reputation as one of the stoutest blockers in the game likely helped his candidacy.\n\nDid you know? Nelson became the first Colts player to make the Pro Bowl in each of his first five seasons. He also becomes the first offensive lineman in the NFL to do so since Zack Martin (2014 to 2018). Wide receiver Reggie Wayne was the last Colts player selected to five consecutive Pro Bowls, earning spots from 2006 to 2010. -- Stephen Holder\n\nPro Bowlers: None\n\nLinebacker Foyesade Oluokun and punter Logan Cooke are the two players with the best argument to make the Pro Bowl. Oluokun leads the NFL with 156 total tackles (111 solo), the only player with more than 100 solos entering Week 16. Oluokun led the NFL in tackles last season with Atlanta before signing a three-year, $45 million free agent contract with the Jaguars. Cooke is third in the NFL in punt average (50.6) and fifth in net punt average (50.1).\n\nDid you know? The Jaguars have had 10 players make the Pro Bowl over the past 10 seasons. Eight have been defensive players: LB Paul Posluszny, CB A.J. Bouye, DE Calais Campbell (three times), DT Malik Jackson, DE Yannick Ngakoue, CB Jalen Ramsey (twice), LB Telvin Smith and LB/DE Josh Allen. WRs Allen Robinson (2015) and DJ Chark (2019) are the only offensive players who have made the Pro Bowl. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nPro Bowlers: Derrick Henry, RB (3), Jeffery Simmons, DL (2)\n\nEverything revolved around Henry on offense this season, so it's no wonder he is their lone offensive starter in the Pro Bowl. Henry bounced back from a Jones fracture that cost him nine games last season. He has rushed for 1,303 yards and 12 touchdowns. Despite playing most of the season with an injured ankle, Simmons followed his 2021 Pro Bowl selection with 7.5 sacks. He is on pace to surpass his career-high 8.5 sack total, set last season. The fourth-year defensive lineman also has 12 quarterback hits and nine tackles for a loss this season.\n\nDid you know? Henry's third Pro Bowl selection ties him with Chris Johnson for the third most by a running back in Oilers/Titans franchise history. -- Turron Davenport\n\nAFC WEST\n\nPro Bowlers: Pat Surtain II, CB (1).\n\nThis could be the start of a long Pro Bowl run for Surtain, who Hall of Famer Champ Bailey says will be a perennial selection. In his second season, Surtain, who was named to the All-Rookie Team last season, is one of the team's most important players -- a versatile, smart, skilled cornerback who is as big as almost any receiver he faces. Through 14 games, even as some quarterbacks have chosen to avoid him, Surtain has 55 tackles, 10 pass defenses and 2 interceptions.\n\nDid you know? Surtain is the first Broncos cornerback to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Chris Harris Jr. in 2018 and is the first Broncos cornerback to be selected to the Pro Bowl in his second year in the league since Deltha O'Neal in 2001. -- Jeff Legwold\n\nPro Bowlers: Orlando Brown Jr., OT (4); Creed Humphrey, C (1), Chris Jones, DT (4). Travis Kelce, TE (8), Patrick Mahomes, QB (5), Joe Thuney, G (1), Tommy Townsend, P (1).\n\nThe seven selections match the Chiefs' highest total since 2013, when they sent 10 players to the Pro Bowl. They also had seven selections in 2016 and 2020. Mahomes is on pace for his second career 5,000-yard season and is a strong candidate for the league's MVP. Kelce was selected for the eighth time, tying him with Pro Football Hall of Famers Buck Buchanan and Willie Lanier for sixth-most in franchise history. Jones is tied for seventh with 11 sacks and is tied for first among players who line up mostly at an interior line position. Townsend is second in average yards per punt at 51.8 and is first in net average at 46.5. The Chiefs had three offensive linemen chosen, including first-time Pro Bowl selections in Humphrey and Thuney.\n\nDid you know? The Chiefs' three offensive line selections tie a team record set in 2003 and 2004, when guards Will Shields and Brian Waters and tackle Willie Roaf were selected. Shields and Roaf are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. -- Adam Teicher\n\nPro Bowlers: Davante Adams, WR (6), Maxx Crosby, DE (2), Josh Jacobs, RB (2)\n\nNFL on ESPN+ Access elite coverage for every fan: highlights of the biggest games, original series from NFL legends, unprecedented analysis and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\n\nIf Crosby is the heart of the Raiders' defense, Adams and Jacobs are the lifeblood of Las Vegas' offense. Crosby, a Day 3 draft pick in 2019, is first in tackles for loss (19) and forced fumbles (3), second in tackles (77) and third in sacks (a career-high 11.5) among all NFL defensive linemen. Adams, acquired in a blockbuster offseason trade, is tied for the league lead in touchdown catches (12) and is second in 100-yard receiving games (7). He has 86 catches for 1,275 yards. Jacobs, in a contract year, is leading the NFL in rushing yards (1,495) and scrimmage yards (1,858).\n\nDid you know? Crosby, the reigning Pro Bowl defensive MVP, became the first Raider selected as MVP since quarterback Rich Gannon won the award in consecutive years, 2001 and 2002. -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nPro Bowlers: Derwin James Jr., S (3), Khalil Mack, OLB/Edge (7)\n\nJames, who became the highest-paid safety in NFL history before the season, is among the most versatile defensive players in the league, lining up as a safety, cornerback -- outside and in the slot -- as well as inside and outside linebacker. \"I don't look at Derwin as a safety,\" Chargers coach Brandon Staley said about the fifth-year pro. \"I look at Derwin as an impact player.\" Despite missing two games because of a quadriceps injury, James has 106 tackles, 4 sacks, 4 pass deflections, 1 interception and 2 forced fumbles. Eager to prove he has plenty remaining in the tank, Mack started the season fast with three sacks and a forced fumble against the Raiders, the organization that drafted him fifth overall in 2014. This season, his first in L.A., Mack has 7 sacks, as well as 2 pass deflections, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nDid you know? James made his mark in November, becoming the first defensive back in 30 years and the first player in a decade to have 30 tackles, multiples sacks (2), an interception and a forced fumble (2) in the month. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Month for his effort. Mack has earned Pro Bowl recognition for all three teams he's played for, and this is his second time earning the honor while teamed with Staley, who was his position coach in 2018 with the Chicago Bears. -- Lindsey Thiry\n\nNFC EAST\n\nPro Bowlers: Zack Martin, G (8), DeMarcus Lawrence, DE (3), Micah Parsons, LB (2), Trevon Diggs, CB (2), CeeDee Lamb, WR (2), Tony Pollard, RB (1), KaVontae Turpin, WR (1)\n\nNo true surprises here, but maybe some mild upsets with the selections of Lawrence, who has six sacks, and Pollard, who is closing in on 1,000 yards and started just three games. The voters deserve credit for looking past statistics and focusing on their all-around play. Martin's eighth selection is tied for sixth-most in franchise history and continues this remarkable stat: He has more Pro Bowl appearances than holding penalties (six) in his career. Parsons' 13 sacks makes him a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year. And the price goes up with the Cowboys' first two picks in 2020, Lamb and Diggs, who have made the game the past two years. Turpin wasn't able to match his two returns for touchdowns in the preseason but he has been effective.\n\nDid you know? Pollard is a \"backup\" running back and has made just three starts, with Ezekiel Elliott missing two games because of injury and another for a minor disciplinary reason. But he is not the Cowboys' first backup running back to make it to the Pro Bowl. In 2007, Marion Barber did not start a game behind Julius Jones but had 10 touchdowns and 975 rushing yards. Pollard is 31 yards shy of 1,000 on the season and his 12 touchdowns are more than he recorded in the first three years of his career combined. -- Todd Archer\n\nPro Bowlers: Saquon Barkley, RB (2); Dexter Lawrence, DT (1)\n\nThe Giants had two players reach the Pro Bowl after getting zero last year. Progress. It also means left tackle Andrew Thomas and kicker Graham Gano were snubbed. Barkley's inclusion is the culmination of perseverance after three straight injury-filled seasons. His previous Pro Bowl selection came as a rookie. \"It shows the respect of your peers, respect of the fans,\" a thankful Barkley said. Lawrence earned his first selection by taking his game to another level this season. He's tied for fifth in the NFL with 24 quarterback hits and already set a career high with 6.5 sacks.\n\nDid you know? Lawrence is the first Giants defensive lineman to reach the Pro Bowl since Jason Pierre-Paul in 2012. He's their first interior lineman to earn the nod since Eric Howard in 1990. -- Jordan Raanan\n\nPro Bowlers: Jalen Hurts, QB (1), Miles Sanders, RB (1), Landon Dickerson, OG (1), Haason Reddick. LB (1), Jason Kelce, C (6), Darius Slay, CB (5), Lane Johnson, RT (4), A.J. Brown, WR (2)\n\nFour of the Eagles' eight Pro Bowlers got the nod for the first time, led by Hurts, who put himself in the MVP conversation as arguably the most effective dual-threat player in the game. His running mate in the backfield, Sanders, is one of several Eagles enjoying career years, having already set highs in rushing yards (1,110) and rushing touchdowns (11). It's no surprise Hurts and Sanders have had such big years running behind this offensive line, with three-fifths of the unit getting selected to the Pro Bowl.\n\nDid you know? Hurts has scored 35 total touchdowns, including 13 rushing, which is one shy of the all-time single-season mark set by Cam Newton. No signal-caller in the NFC has generated more touchdowns than Hurts. Brown, his good friend, set a career high for receiving yards in a season with 1,201. -- Tim McManus\n\nPro Bowlers: Jonathan Allen, DT (2); Tress Way, P (2); Jeremy Reaves, ST (1), Terry McLaurin, WR (1)\n\nThe biggest surprise is that McLaurin finally earned the recognition he deserves. McLaurin, who is the only reserve of the bunch, topped 1,000 yards receiving for the third time in four seasons, despite never having played with a top quarterback. Allen leads all tackles with 19 for a loss, one more than teammate Daron Payne, a first alternate. Allen also has 6.5 sacks. Way is first in punts inside the 20-yard line, tied for third on punts inside the 10 and ranks eighth in net average (43.06). Reaves is a terrific story: He has been with Washington since 2018, but this was the first year he made the team out of training camp.\n\nDid you know? McLaurin is the first Washington receiver to be named to the Pro Bowl since Santana Moss in 2005 and only the third overall since 1991. This is the first time Washington has not had an offensive lineman named to the Pro Bowl since 2011 -- former Washington linemen Trent Williams and guard Brandon Scherff combined to make it the past 10 seasons. Reaves is the first special teams non-punter to make the Pro Bowl since Lorenzo Alexander in 2012. Allen is the first Washington defensive lineman to make it in consecutive years since end Charles Mann in 1989. -- John Keim\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nPro Bowlers: None.\n\nThe Bears did not have a player selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time in five years. They are the only team in the NFC North without a representative after Minnesota earned five Pro Bowl selections and Green Bay and Detroit had one each. Prior to sustaining a Lisfranc injury on Nov. 27, Chicago's Eddie Jackson led all NFC safeties in fan voting.\n\nDid you know? Former Bears linebacker Roquan Smith, who was traded to the Ravens in November, was named to his first Pro Bowl. Smith's 2.5 sacks in eight games remains the second-most by any Bears defender this season. Chargers edge rusher Khalil Mack, who was traded in March, earned his eighth Pro Bowl honor. -- Courtney Cronin\n\nPro Bowlers: Frank Ragnow, C (2)\n\nFor the second time of his career, Ragnow was named to the Pro Bowl. Coming off an injury-riddled 2021 season, when he was limited to four games after undergoing toe surgery, Ragnow has bounced back as the leader of the Lions' offensive line. He was also named to the Pro Bowl and earned second team All-Pro honors in 2020.\n\nDid you know? Although the Lions got off to a 1-6 start, they've emerged as one of the hottest teams in the NFL, winning six of their past seven games for the first time since 2016 with Ragnow anchoring the offensive line. Ragnow hasn't allowed a sack since the 2019 season. -- Eric Woodyard\n\nPro Bowlers: Jaire Alexander, CB (2)\n\nAfter missing all but four games last season because of a shoulder injury, Alexander has begun to round back into his 2020 form, when he not only made his first Pro Bowl but also was a second-team All-Pro. Despite missing a game and a half this season, he is tied for fifth with a career-high four interceptions and is tied for eighth in the league with 12 pass breakups. Early in the season, defensive coordinator Joe Barry was hesitant to match up against one receiver for an entire game, but when the Packers' pass defense struggled, Barry has matched Alexander at times.\n\nDid you know? This is the first time since 2013 the Packers have not had multiple Pro Bowl selections. Running back Eddie Lacy was the lone pick that year. -- Rob Demovsky\n\nPro Bowlers: Kirk Cousins, QB (4), Justin Jefferson, WR (3), LB Za'Darius Smith (3), TE T.J. Hockenson (2) and LS Andrew DePaola (1)\n\nCousins' appearance here might surprise those who have watched only parts of the Vikings' season. It's true that he ranks No. 19 among NFL quarterbacks with a 51.6 Total QBR, the lowest mark he's had after Week 15 in his career. But he has also led seven fourth-quarter comebacks, most recently throwing for 417 yards and four touchdown passes after halftime of the Vikings' historic victory over the Colts. Cousins has as much to do with the Vikings' 11-3 record as anyone on the team. Jefferson, who is leading the NFL in receptions (111) and yards (1,623), was a no-brainer. Smith has 10 sacks and leads the NFL with 49 quarterback hurries and Hockenson has the second-most catches (65) and yards (730) for a tight end in the NFL this season.\n\nDid you know? Jefferson has earned three consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl, joining Randy Moss as the only receiver in franchise history to do so. But he has much bigger goals on his mind. He said this week that he believes he deserves to be named a first-team All-Pro. \"I want to be recognized as one of the top players in the league,\" he said. \"Definitely I felt like I should have had it last year. My first year, I understand. [It was] my rookie year. But last year I felt I should have got it. It is what it is, at the end of the day. Nothing I can have control over. But it definitely drives me even more when I didn't get that first team.\" -- Kevin Seifert\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nPro Bowlers: Chris Lindstrom, OL (1)\n\nLindstrom probably should have been named to his first Pro Bowl last season, but one of the most underrated guards in the game finally picked up his first nod. Lindstrom is one of the most consistent interior linemen in the NFL and a big reason why Atlanta has the No. 3 rushing attack in the league. \"It would definitely mean a ton,\" Lindstrom told ESPN earlier this week. \"You always want to do team accomplishments before individual, but it would be a great honor. It's something that every player in the league is striving for on a personal level.\"\n\nDid you know? Lindstrom is the first Falcons offensive lineman to make the Pro Bowl since 2018, when offensive tackle Jake Matthews and center Alex Mack made the team. It's the second straight year a Falcons offensive player made the Pro Bowl after tight end Kyle Pitts did so as a rookie last season. -- Michael Rothstein\n\nPro Bowlers: Brian Burns, DE (2)\n\nBurns has shown why the Panthers turned down two future first-round picks at the trade deadline to keep him. He leads the team in sacks (10.5), tackles for loss (14) and quarterback hits (18). He is fourth among defensive ends in sacks. And he's only 24, so his best years likely are ahead of him as he continues to develop as a pass-rusher. He made the Pro Bowl as an alternate last season but was voted in as a starter this time. He'll be a tone-setter for whoever the Panthers next coach is moving forward.\n\nDid you know? Burns is best known for his Spiderman pose after sacks, but his real passion beyond superheroes is dogs. He's got several of his own and he's formed the Route #53 Dawg Rescue Foundation, an organization to rescue battered, neglected dogs and pair them with homes. -- David Newton\n\nPro Bowlers: Demario Davis, LB (1)\n\nThis selection has been long overdue for the 33-year-old, who has had a career resurgence since signing with New Orleans prior to the 2019 season. Davis was a first-team All-Pro in 2019 and made second-team All-Pro twice, but somehow a Pro Bowl selection has always eluded him. He has 89 total tackles this season (tied for 43rd in the NFL), 6.5 sacks, 1 interception and 1 fumble recovery. He is also the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee.\n\nDid you know? This is the fewest number of players the Saints have had voted to the Pro Bowl since 2016 when only Drew Brees made the roster. It's also the first time defensive end Cameron Jordan has not been voted to the roster since that season. The good: Davis is the first Saints linebacker to be voted to the Pro Bowl since Jonathan Vilma in 2010 and he unlocked a $500,000 contract incentive in the process. The bad? While his 6.5 sacks are a career-high, they also lead the team -- not ideal when three of its defensive ends are former first-round picks. -- Katherine Terrell\n\nPro Bowlers: Tristan Wirfs, OT (2)\n\nDrafted by the Buccaneers 13th overall in 2020, Wirfs has an exceptional mix of size and physical skills, propelling him to immediate full-time starting status his rookie season and a key role in the Bucs' Super Bowl LV run. Wirfs produced a 93.2% pass block win rate in 2022, fourth-best in the NFL, before suffering a high ankle sprain that's kept him out the past three games. He's also surrendered just one sack all season, tied for the best mark in the NFL. His 895 pass-blocking wins in 44 regular-season games is also ranked sixth among offensive tackles in that time span. In 2021, he was named an AP All-Pro. This is his second consecutive Pro Bowl selection.\n\nDid you know? Wirfs is just the third offensive lineman in Buccaneers history to receive multiple Pro Bowl selections, joining Tony Mayberry (three) and Davin Joseph (two). He is also the only one of the group to be selected multiple times in his first three seasons. -- Jenna Laine\n\nNFC WEST\n\nPro Bowlers: Budda Baker, S (5)\n\nIn a dismal season, Baker was one of the lone bright spots for the Cardinals. He continued to grow as a safety and a leader on a defense that needed both desperately. He leads the Cardinals in tackles and has 2 interceptions, 6 pass defenses, 2 quarterback hits, 1 forced fumble and 1 tackle for loss. It's his fourth straight Pro Bowl nod.\n\nDid you know? Baker is the only safety in the NFL to be named to the Pro Bowl in each of the past four seasons. -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nPro Bowler: Aaron Donald, DT (9)\n\nDonald has missed the Rams' past three games while dealing with a high ankle sprain, but his Pro Bowl streak continues for the ninth consecutive season. In 11 games this season, Donald has five sacks, 10 tackles for a loss, 11 quarterback hits and a forced fumble. Donald's nine Pro Bowl selections are the third-most in Rams history behind defensive tackle Merlin Olsen (14) and left guard Tom Mack (11).\n\nDid you know? Donald's nine Pro Bowl nods tie him with Randy White (14 seasons) and Alan Page (15 seasons) for the seventh-most among defensive tackles in NFL history. -- Sarah Barshop\n\nPro Bowlers: Trent Williams, OT, (10); Kyle Juszczyk, FB (7); George Kittle, TE (4); Nick Bosa, DE (3); Fred Warner, LB (2); S Talanoa Hufanga (1)\n\nWilliams and Juszczyk are mainstays as perhaps the best players at their positions. Kittle hasn't put up the big numbers he often does in the passing game but remains the best combination of a blocking and receiving tight end in the NFC. Bosa is in the midst of his best season and is a top contender for Defensive Player of the Year. He and Warner should be on this list for years to come. Hufanga has enjoyed a breakout season spurred by splash plays, including four interceptions. Linebacker Dre Greenlaw and running back Christian McCaffrey are notable omissions having Pro Bowl-caliber seasons.\n\nDid you know? Kittle's fourth Pro Bowl selection ties him with Brent Jones for the most by a tight end in franchise history. -- Nick Wagoner\n\nPro Bowlers: Geno Smith, QB (1); Tariq Woolen, CB (1); Quandre Diggs, FS (3); Jason Myers, K (2)\n\nSmith wasn't even expected to be the Seahawks' starter in 2022 after spending most of the previous seven seasons as a backup. Making his first Pro Bowl adds to what might be the most remarkable story of the NFL season. It was well-deserved, too, as Smith and Jalen Hurts have been the NFC's two best quarterbacks all season. Woolen was also an obvious choice, even if an unexpected one before the season. The rookie fifth-round pick is tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with six. Myers was another no-brainer. He's made 26 of 27 field-goal attempts to lead all kickers with a 96.3% rate. Diggs makes his third straight Pro Bowl despite not playing as well as he has the previous two seasons.\n\nDid you know? Having a Pro Bowl on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should help free-agent-to-be Smith in his upcoming contract negotiation. In the meantime, he'll cash in on a $500,000 incentive that was tied to throwing at least 20 touchdown passes (he has 26) and making the Pro Bowl as a starter or backup. Woolen is the Seahawks' first defensive player to make the Pro Bowl as a rookie since linebacker Lofa Tatupu in 2005.-- Brady Henderson"}, {"url": "http://www.themoderngladiator.com/2014/07/07/the-viper-interviews-danny-smith-professional-billiards-pro/", "page_content": "on July 7 | in Issue 8, Sports | by Melissa Little | with No Comments\n\nAn Interview with Professional Player Danny Smith\n\nViper: Where were you born?\n\nDanny: I was born in Toledo, OH in 1987.\n\nViper: What are your biggest accomplishments in the sport of billiards?\n\nDanny: In 2013 I won the Music City Open in Nashville and I defeated pro player Larry Nevel twice\u201411-10 both sets\u2014to win the championships. I finished fourth out of 419 players at the Derby City Classic Banks division a few years ago.\n\nViper: Do you have a nickname yet?\n\nDanny: They have been calling me \u201cShredder\u201d because I either shred my opponents or shred my entire bankroll.\n\nViper: What are your short-term goals?\n\nDanny: I\u2019m flying home from Denver to participate in a Thanksgiving tournament, then off to defend my title next month at the Music City Open in Nashville. From there, I\u2019m off to participate in the Derby City Classic in Louisville.\n\nViper: What do you do when you\u2019re not competing?\n\nDanny: On my off time I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, watching sports, movies, and I love engaging in outdoor sports activities.\n\nViper: Do you have siblings?\n\nDanny: I have an older sister named Lauren who plays in a weekly league.\n\nViper: Who got you started in playing pool?\n\nDanny: Both my parents played in tournaments and leagues; I tagged along to watch as a young kid. When I was 13 or 14, I had a few friends that I ran around with to different tournaments. At 16, I got an opportunity to play in the Glass City Open, which had some of the best pros around playing in it. That same tournament I drew legendary Rodney Morris, the crowd was packed in the stands rooting for me, and I almost beat him. At that moment I knew I had an opportunity to move forward playing professional pool. The thrill and having everyone watch and encourage me sparked me to keep going.\n\nAt that moment I knew I had an opportunity to move forward playing professional pool.\n\nViper: What do your parents think of your pool career?\n\nDanny: My parents always encouraged me to be one of the best, whether it was playing other sports or pool.\n\nViper: In your opinion, what parts of the world produce the best players?\n\nDanny: The best pool players are from the Philippines by far\u2014their practice regime is so superior. Pool is their whole livelihood. I admire that they take it so seriously and try hard on every shot.\n\nViper: Who is/was your favorite pro player growing up?\n\nDanny: Corey Deuel, because when I was just starting he was a young player. His stroke is so pure and fluid.

You don\u2019t see much luck in the game and playing One-Pocket forces you to be creative at times. It requires you to use most aspects of other games like banking, shooting, and safeties.\n\nFacebook fans weigh in with their own questions:\n\nColin Brandt asks: What\u2019s the biggest difference between pool in Colorado and Ohio?\n\nDanny: They have better players, more tournaments, and more competition.\n\nAnthony Gonzales asks: What is your favorite cue and why?\n\nDanny: I have always playing with a laminated shaft and I am a good friend with Lomax and OB cues; it was a perfect combination.\n\nA special thank you to Danny for taking time out of his busy schedule to participate in this month\u2019s \u201cAsk the Viper.\u201d\n\nTill next month, you can find me on Facebook!\n\nRelated Posts\n\n\u00ab Ramp Up Your Sales! 14 Powerful Sales Tips Denver\u2019s Dynamic Art Scene\u2014It\u2019s Gonna Be a Hot Summer, Check It Out! \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://www.hotchkiss.org/post-page/~board/athletics-news/post/athletic-director-danny-smith-receives-2023-md-nadal-sportsmanship-award", "page_content": "Director of Athletics Danny Smith Receives 2023 M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award\n\nDirector of Athletics Danny Smith P\u201918,\u201920,\u201924 is the recipient of the 2023 M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award in recognition of his dedication to the education and development of student athletes and athletic program at Hotchkiss.\n\nThe Founders League awards the M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award on an annual basis to a coach whose conduct exemplifies the proclamation \"play by the rules, accept victory or defeat graciously, respect all who assemble and participate.\" It may be awarded in recognition of sportsmanship during a particular contest, throughout a season, or for continued contributions to athletics and the league.\n\nSince arriving at Hotchkiss in the fall of 2000, Smith has been an avid spectator and active participant in the School\u2019s athletic program. He began his career in the admission office and as head coach of the varsity football team. Shortly thereafter, Smith was named co-director of athletics and has been a fixture in the Mars Athletic Center and on the Bearcat sidelines ever since.\n\n\u201cIn the 20 years I have worked side by side with Danny, I have been amazed by his ability to be connected to kids in all facets of School life,\u201d said Robin Chandler \u201987, former co-director of athletics and 2013 M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award winner. \u201cDanny's tireless dedication and loyalty to the athletic department, along with his fierce advocacy of our student athletes who are always first in his mind, have been inspirational.\u201d\n\nHotchkiss Director of Athletics Danny Smith P\u201918,\u201920,\u201924 received the 2023 M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award on April 24.\n\nThe M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award was originally given to a member of the Erickson Football League, but eligibility was expanded to other sports after the establishment of the Founders League. Smith has close ties to the origin of the award given his work with the Erickson League as a longtime head coach and commissioner. He was instrumental in leading this group with grace and goodwill during his tenure.\n\n\u201cDanny\u2019s graciousness and genuine interest in others is clear from the moment you first interact with him. He puts his team first and invests great time and care into the development of each of his players both on and off the field,\u201d Head of School Craig Bradley said.\n\nUpon Smith\u2019s retirement as head varsity football coach in 2021, Brian Allen \u201919 said, \u201cYou are the most genuine and down-to-earth man I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. You took a chance on me and changed my life forever by helping me attend Hotchkiss. I came to campus in the fall of 2017 as an overly confident kid who was self-centered and thought he knew everything. By the time I left Hotchkiss I had become a better person who was willing to learn from others and listen and learned to listen before speaking. You made me into someone better. The two years being coached by you made me a better man and that is something I cannot thank you enough for.\u201d\n\nDuring Smith\u2019s 21-year tenure as head coach, Hotchkiss football won a New England Championship in 2008 and back-to-back Erickson League Championships in 2008 and 2009, as well as one in 2002 in only his second year as head coach. Smith coached three NEPSAC Football Player of the Year recipients: Rob Schaeffer \u201901, Alex Amidon \u201910, and Derrick Wilson \u201911.\n\n\u201cThe quality I appreciate most about Danny is the incredible care he takes with developing his players as people\u2014not just athletes,\u201d Chandler added. \u201cHe has always been about character development, sportsmanship, and the true value of team and he ranks those well above wins and losses. These are the best lessons our students can learn in life, and they learned them well down on Baker from one of the most genuine men I have ever known.\u201d\n\nThe M.D. Nadal Sportsmanship Award was established in 1969 to honor Manuel D. \u201cBill\u201d Nadal, an outstanding athlete, coach and steadfast supporter of athletics at Kent School. A member of Kent\u2019s Class of 1917, Nadal excelled in football, hockey and baseball, earning a total of 14 letters and serving as captain of the hockey and baseball teams. After serving in World War I, Nadal returned to Kent and coached football, hockey, and baseball for a remarkable 89 seasons as a head coach. At different times during his long career at Kent, Nadal served as assistant to the headmaster and director of athletics. At the time of his death at Kent in 1977, he held the position of Director of Athletics Emeritus."}, {"url": "https://pro-football-history.com/coach/952/danny-smith-bio", "page_content": "Danny Smith\n\nCoaching Record\n\nYears Coached Record Win % Playoff record Playoff win % 29 226-221-3 50.56% 5-12 29.41%\n\nBiography\n\nCareer Summary\n\nDanny Smith is a football coach in the National Football League (NFL) and has been the special teams coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2013.

Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.\n\nSince joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).\n\nIn 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the NY Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history withat least 200 career field goals made.\n\nIn 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).\n\nSmith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.\n\nUnder the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.\n\nBoswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.\n\nBoswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.\n\nWide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).\n\nBoswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts \u2014 kicks within one minute of regulation \u2014 during the 2017 regular season.\n\nIn 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with 6 (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (5). Since 1960, his 5 made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).\n\nBoswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (6) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.\n\nThough Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.\n\nPrior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.\n\nThrough his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.\n\nBerry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.\n\nIn 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.\n\nIn the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.\n\nIn Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.\n\nIn addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.\n\nPrior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.\n\nPrior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).\n\nSmith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.\n\nSmith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86)."}, {"url": "https://www.speedsport.com/weekly-racing/midwest/racer-of-the-day-danny-smith/", "page_content": "Danny Smith has won in a sprint car every year for more than four decades.

After each match, they\u2019d be flanked by beautiful women who\u2019d seen them bowl on television, or had read about them in Sports Illustrated.\n\nToday, the glitz and glamour has faded. Pro bowlers supplement their careers with second jobs, like delivering sod, or working at a call center. They share Motel 6 rooms on tour to save on travel expenses, and thrive on the less-than-exciting dime of beef jerky sponsorships.\n\nOnce sexy, bowling is now synonymous with cheap beer and smelly feet. In an entertainment-saturated culture, has the once formidable sport been gutter-balled? What exactly is it like to be a professional bowler today?\n\nHistory of Bowling as a Sport\n\nPinsetters in NY subway bowling alley, c.1910; Source: Wikipedia\n\nBowling most likely originated in Germany around 300 A.D. as a religious ritual in which participants would roll stones at clubs to absolve their sins. The annals of history reveal little about where or how bowling gained traction, but according to written record, the sport was so popular in England by 1336, that King Edward III had to ban it to keep his troops focused on archery practice.\n\nYears later, King Henry VIII would ban bowling again for everyone but the upper crust: it had supposedly infatuated the working class so much that they were neglecting their trades and impeding the financial progress of their counties. By the time bowling was introduced to the United States during the colonial era, it had developed a rapport with the \u201ccommon\u201d man.\n\nKickerbockers, built in New York in 1840, was the United States\u2019 first modern, indoor bowling alley. Less than a year later, nine-pin bowling was banned in several states due to gambling and racketeering; enthusiasts added a tenth pin to circumvent the law. At the turn of the century, most bowling alleys were tiny, dingy, and frequented solely by men; rules were sparsely defined, and the game was unregulated and without governance.\n\nBut in 1895, Joe Thum, a restaurateur considered to be the \u201cgrandfather of modern bowling,\u201d pooled together representatives from local bowling clubs to create the American Bowling Congress (now known as the USBC). The organization set in place the rules and equipment used in bowling today.\n\nIn the following years, a variance of organizations were created: the Bowling Proprietors Association of America (1932), the International Federation of Bowling (1952), and the Professional Bowlers\u2019 Association (1958).\n\nWith a working-man image and promotion by the U.S. Armed Forces, bowling became a billion dollar industry by 1945. Major technological advancements streamlined the sport and made it more accessible: pinsetters (young boys who literally stood behind the bowling pins and set them back up after each roll) were replaced by machines in the mid-1930s. Likewise, wooden balls were ousted for more dynamic plastic models.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1970s, bowling saw a golden age, and the sport\u2019s professionals were its unbridled kingpins.\n\nWhen Bowlers Were Rockstars\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 40s, \u201cBeer Leagues\u201d dominated professional bowling. The best bowlers were recruited by beer companies \u2014 Miller, Stroh\u2019s, Budweiser \u2014 and pitted against each other in tournaments. The era\u2019s superstars \u2014 Buzz Fazio (Stroh\u2019s), Dick Weber (Budweiser), and like \u2014 faced off on televised events that attracted millions of viewers. During one 1961 performance on ABC\u2019s Make That Spare, pro bowler Don Carter won $19,000 ($149,000 in 2014 dollars), and a brand new Ford.\n\nThe creation of the PBA in 1958 brought even more attention to the sport; by 1965, the PBA tour was televised on ABC Sports nationally, and had formidable sponsors in Coca-Cola and Ford Motors. A 1963 article in Sports Illustrated harped on the glamorous explosion of the bowling scene (2014 dollars have been added in brackets):\n\n\u201cThis year the PBA will put on 38 tournaments and give away more than $1,050,000 [$7.9 million] in prize money. Of its 942 members, 65 are touring pros who compete in at least half of the tournaments. The minimum any one of them makes is $10,000 [$75,700] a year. Moreover, 15 of the bowlers are in the $30,000-a-year bracket [$227,200], and there are four or five, including Don Carter, the most famous name in bowling, and Harry Smith, who earn upward of $75,000 annually [$568,00].\u201d\n\nHarry Smith, the top bowler in 1963, made more money than MLB MVP Sandy Koufax and NFL MVP Y.A. Tittle combined. Sports Illustrated adds that Smith enjoyed a life of copious luxury:\n\n\u201cHarry does so well that he is able to support a wife and four children in style, tool around the circuit in a maroon Lincoln Continental and indulge a taste for epicurean delicacies. In short, he is the personification of the prosperity that has suddenly overtaken the world of professional bowling.\u201d\n\nIn 1964, \u201cbowling legend\u201d Don Carter was the first athlete in any sport to receive a $1 million endorsement deal ($7.6 million today). In return, bowling manufacturing company Ebonite got the rights to release the bowler\u2019s signature model ball. At the time, the offer was 200x what professional golfer Arnold Palmer got for his endorsement with Wilson, and 100x what football star Joe Namath got from his deal with Schick razor. Additionally, Carter was already making $100,000 ($750,000) per year through tournaments, exhibitions, television appearances, and other endorsements, including Miller, Viceroys, and Wonder Bread.\n\nA Miller High Life beer commercial starring bowler Billy Hardwick (1969)\n\nTo be fair, these guys were incredible bowlers. To qualify for PBA competition, a bowler had to carry an average of over 200 points per game over the course of two years; considering that the hypothetical mean score is a 79, that\u2019s no easy feat. Qualifiers also had to prove themselves in scratch matches and regional events. Nonetheless, by 1965, the PBA was offering unheard of prize money: $100,000 for its Tournament of Champions alone.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of televised bowling and its superstars, recreational bowling also saw a boom in the 1960s: over 12,000 sanctioned alleys were constructed during the decade. The U.S. Bowling Congress peaked at 4.6 million recreational members. As one long-time \u201cjust for fun\u201d bowler puts it: \u201cBowling was the thing to do back then. Every weekend, those places would be packed with kids, parents, grandparents. Everyone bowled.\u201d\n\nAction Bowling: Gangsters, Gambling, and Big Money\n\nIn New York from the 1940s to the 1970s, there also existed a lucrative underbelly to the sport called \u201caction bowling.\u201d Working-class Italians from Boroughs across the city would frequent bowling alleys and challenge each other to matches for money. Events would often start at midnight and go until 7AM. Action bowling legend Mike Limongello explains exactly what this entailed:\n\n\u201cWe would all go out late at night \u2014 every night of the week there was someplace to go \u2014 and the action would start right after the leagues were over. Everyone would match up and bowl for money \u2014 and there was a lot of street money in those days.\u201d\n\nLimongello says when he first started out in the early 1960s, he\u2019d be bowling for $200-300 per game; as he got better, he was pulling in $1,500 per game as a 17 year old kid. \u201cI learned to bowl for money from an early age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about the bowling \u2014 it was about the action.\u201d\n\nBowling historian Gianmarc Manzione describes a typical action bowling scene from the 1960s:\n\n\u201cThe carpet soaked up the reek of gamblers\u2019 cigars as handlers penciled their debts on the score table\u2026The dark bowling alleys bred their share of con men and clowns with nicknames like Goldfinger, Tony Side Weight and One Finger Benny.\u201d\n\nIndeed, these gambling events attracted more than the best bowlers \u2014 mobsters often got in on the bets and threw down \u201chuge wads of cash\u201d on their favorites for the evening, often placing local bowlers in hairy situations. In one such instance, bowler Iggy Russo fixed his match and bet a ton of money on his opponent to win. During his last frame, in which he was positioned to either win or lose the match with a spare, he learned that some \u201c\u201dunsavory characters\u201d were betting on him to win.\n\nHe was caught in a catch-22: if he won, his financial backer would kill him; if he missed the spare, the \u201cunsavory characters\u201d would. Instead, he avoided the entire predicament by faking a heart attack.\n\n\u201cLenny the Cane,\u201d another action bowling character, recalls going from making $55 a week as a working-class New Yorker to making thousands as Iggy\u2019s bowling partner in crime:\n\n\u201cI was bowling pretty good, and out of the crowd of a couple hundred at 3am comes Iggy and asks to be my partner; I said ok\u2026Iggy walks out at the end of the night with $3,500, and his partner in crime (who was in the back betting both ways) makes $10,000\u2026That night, Iggy and his \u2018partner\u2019 made $12,000.\u201d\n\nIt was an era in which cockiness, trickery, and flamboyance factored in as much as skill. Ernie Schlegel, an action bowling legend, would pour a shot of bourbon down his shirt before every match he bowled. He\u2019d walk in reeking of alcohol, leading his opponent to believe he was drunk and \u201ctake it easy.\u201d Then, Schlegel would proceed to crush his unwitting foe. These were the characters of action bowling.\n\nAs Manzione explains, big-time action bowlers would bust through the doors and announce their intent to challenge anyone in the room. They\u2019d be \u201clooking for fish,\u201d or easy-money opponents who thought too highly of their skills. But after some time, it got tough for the top bowlers to find willing challengers \u2014 they were simply too good. Manzione says this caused a \u201cdomino effect\u201d whereby big-name bowlers would leave the unorganized, hectic bowling scene for the PBA. In Mike Limongello\u2019s case, once word spread about his skill, \u201cthere was no one left for him to fool.\u201d\n\nThe lack of intense, head-to-head matches for big money made the PBA tour unappealing for many action bowlers, but they increasingly departed to join it nonetheless. Manzione adds that ego was a factor: \u201cSome guys wanted to prove to themselves and to others that they were the best on the planet, not just in New York.\u201d\n\nBut by the 1980s, bowling was starting to lose steam. Action bowling fizzled out as all the \u201cstuds\u201d left for the PBA, and the bowling in general wasn\u2019t receiving nearly as much buzz as it did twenty years earlier.\n\nThe Wane of Professional Bowling\n\nPBA bowler Michael Haugen sits in contemplation; Source: AZ Chad (Flickr)\n\nCarmen Salvino was one of the best bowlers in the 1970s, and he surrounded himself with equally successful lane lizards. \u201cWe were like rockstars,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different for the guys today.\u201d\n\nThat certainly seems to be true.\n\nThe sport lulled in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2000, the debt-riddled PBA was doing so poorly that Microsoft employee Chris Peters, along with two of his co-workers, purchased it for $5 million \u2014 less than the cost of a minor league baseball team. Peters set to work revamping the website (he purchased the domain pba.com), setting up the tech to stream every PBA tour event live over the internet, and pitching PBA coverage to major networks. Peters optimistically spoke with Sports Illustrated in 2000:\n\n\u201cThere was a time that NASCAR was just a bunch of Southerners turning left. We think the PBA can be the next NASCAR. Fifty million Americans bowl. A good number of them are watching now, with no promotion, no major effort in marketing.\u201d\n\nBut 14 years later, the results don\u2019t look so stellar. According to the United States Bowling Congress, league bowling once generated about 70% of a bowling center\u2019s business; today, it generates only 40% of overall bowling business. Likewise, membership in the organization declined 36% from 2000-2010, and the number of bowling sanctioned alleys in the United States has been cut in half since the 1960s.\n\nThings aren\u2019t looking stellar for PBA bowlers, either.\n\nOf the 300 bowlers who competed in PBA events during the 2012-2013 season, a select few did surprisingly well. The average yearly salary of the top ten competitors was just below $155,000, with Sean Rash topping the list at $248,317. Even so, in the 1960s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars \u2014 today, as the highest grossing professional bowler in the world, Sean Rash makes significantly less than a rookie NFL player\u2019s minimum base salary of $375,000.\n\nIn 1982, the bowler ranked 20th on the PBA\u2019s money list made $51,690; today, the bowler ranked 20th earns $26,645.\n\nWhile a few bowlers do well, the drop off after the top 10 is dramatic: the average for the remaining 250 competitors on the list is a mere $6,500 \u2014 this for some of the best bowlers in the world, who routinely bowl in the mid-250s.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that that these numbers are pre-expenses. Walter Ray Williams Jr. is arguably the best bowler of all time, with a record 47 career PBA tour titles. He started bowling in college in scratch tournaments, and was able to earn enough from it to pay his way through school and join the PBA tour upon completing his degree. Today, he tells us, even he has to pay for travel expenses out of pocket:\n\n\u201cMy expenses are quite a bit more than when I first went on tour. I would estimate that the lower end of weekly expenses are about $400 \u2013 $600 plus entry fees of $400. The higher end is probably around $1500 plus the entry fees. Even though I have a trailer which has a stove and oven, I usually eat out at restaurants. That is about $500 per week when my wife is with me.\u201d\n\nOver his 30 year career, Williams Jr. has made $4.4 million \u2014 about $147,000 per year on average \u2014 far from \u201cgravy train\u201d money. He\u2019s been one of lucky few able to sustain himself solely on bowling: many others have had to fall back on second jobs, or seasonal work.\n\nTom Hess, who was named PBA Midwest Player of the Year in 2011, delivers sod for a living when he\u2019s not busy bowling perfect games (he\u2019s had 13). In 11 years on the tour, he\u2019s averaged total earnings of about $24,000 a year. Mastery, he says, doesn\u2019t always come with a big pay check.\n\nBowling trading cards: an epic fail; Source: Clampants (Flickr)\n\n\u201cFor a lot of guys, being a professional bowler doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your whole income is derived from bowling,\u201d says Williams Jr., who is also a six-time World Horseshoe champion. \u201cBut becoming really good\u2026takes lots of practice.\u201d How much, exactly?\n\nOne PBA bowler, who wished to only be revealed as \u201cPW,\u201d claims to have practiced 6 hours a day, every day, for ten years before he was able to join the PBA tour \u2014 21,900 hours of practice. \u201cIt varies from bowler to bowler, of course,\u201d he tells us. \u201cBut the time commitment to get to where we are as professionals is very substantial.\u201d\n\nSubstantial, it seems, with little payoff. He tells us that in six years on the PBA tour, he\u2019s only made out with $12,700. He operates a small bowling shop to support his two children and wife, but tells us he doesn\u2019t mind bowling\u2019s small payday. \u201cThis is my dream. I\u2019m living it at any expense.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the Ball Rolling?\n\nWalter Ray Williams, Jr. remembers when there always seemed to be a good bowling match on TV:\n\n\u201cI got to see the \u2018heyday\u2019 of bowling, in the late 70\u2019s. There were a lot more average Americans who knew who the star bowlers were. Back when there were 3 channels to watch on Saturday afternoon, bowling did very well. But bowling has trouble getting the sponsors that it deserves due to media and corporate America ignoring it.\u201d\n\nOther bowlers speculate that the sport has suffered from the promulgation of technology that has made bowling easier: lane slicking machines, more \u201cdynamic\u201d balls, and electronic scoring systems that allow people to play without really getting to know how the rules work. During the 1968-69 season, 905 perfect games were rolled; the 1998-99 season saw 34,470. A 300 score just isn\u2019t as special as it used to be, and some surmise these numbers are a sign the game has become too easy to conquer.\n\nWilliams Jr. also surmises professional bowling has been relegated to the shadows by the \u201chipper,\u201d more appealing nature of \u201cparty bowling:\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that most of the popularity of bowling these days is going to what we call recreation bowling and not sport bowling. Basically having a party while you bowl, rock and bowl, cosmic bowling \u2014 expensive bowling bars where the emphasis isn\u2019t on your bowling score.\u201d\n\nBut how can we explain this: Research firm White Hutchinson reports that 52 million Americans \u2014 19.1% of the U.S. population aged 6 or older \u2014 bowl, and the average bowler visits a center 13 times per year. Bowling is, far and away, America\u2019s favorite recreational activity, according to multiple studies and surveys. \u201cMost of us in the sport side of bowling are hoping that the sport side is revitalized and all of the young talented bowlers have a great future ahead of them,\u201d says Williams Jr.\n\nThey\u2019re high hopes, but research insinuates there might be a revival on the horizon: more than one third of children between the ages of 6 and 18 bowl; 12 percent of them list bowling as their favorite activity. The White Hutchinson study finds that children are 80% more involved in bowling than any other age bracket \u2014 there is a steep drop off in participation after the age of 18.\n\nWhile bowling may never again see characters like Iggy Russo, dominant forces like Walter Ray Williams, Jr., or breadwinners like Don Carter, the sport could very well regain a solid stance in the American entertainment industry.\n\nPBA bowler \u201cPW\u201d has seen the game change from the days of his childhood, but the game hasn\u2019t changed him. He\u2019s a man of routine, he tells me over the phone, with the din of his bowling shop in the background \u2014 hard work, dedication, pride: the core principles of a working man. For most PBA bowlers, these are the cardinal virtues by which they carry themselves. If PW\u2019s life depends on it, he\u2019ll make sure his sport sticks around for a while.\n\n\u201cEvery morning, I wake up and bowl a set before the sun rises,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I will until I die. It\u2019ll never lose its magic.\u201d\n\nIf you liked this history, we think you\u2019ll enjoy our book \u2192 Everything Is Bullshit.\n\nThis post was written by Zachary Crockett.
