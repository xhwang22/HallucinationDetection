Why use this guide?\n\nUse this guide if you are searching for records of people who worked for railway companies in the UK before the railways were nationalised in 1947.\n\nIt is only the larger railway companies for which we have comprehensive sets of staff records. These records cover a broad range of occupations connected with the railways, such as:\n\nengine drivers\n\nwarehouse workers\n\ntypists\n\noffice managers\n\nPlease note that only a few records have survived for:\n\nmen who worked on the construction of the railways\n\nthe navvies\n\ncasual employees\n\nIf you are not looking for staff records but want to find other railway records, such as official reports or records of accidents or locomotives, please consult our Railways guide.\n\n6. Original records: railway staff in Britain\n\nTo see original records you will have to either visit us in Kew or, if you can locate document references, order copies.\n\nAs there is no central name index for employees who worked on the railways, to find most records (besides those covered in sections 4 and 5) you will usually need to know:\n\nthe name of railway company for which they worked\n\nthe type of work undertaken\n\ntheir place of residence or employment\n\nIt may also help to know:\n\ndate of birth (or date of death if applicable)\n\nor time of employment\n\nTo search for original records follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Establish the company\n\nBefore you search for records, you need to know which company the individual worked for. If you know this piece of information, go to step 2.\n\nIf you do not know, consult:\n\nStep 2: Establish if staff records exist and the series reference for the company in question\n\nConsult Appendix 1 for a list of surviving staff records by company, with their National Archives record series reference at the end of this guide. Where a company has amalgamated with or been taken over by another company, the staff records of both companies may need to be checked.\n\nStep 3: Establish catalogue search terms\n\nStaff records can be arranged by:\n\nplace of work\n\nstaff number\n\nthe department or office for which the individual worked, such as Carriage Works\n\nIf these are known, then it is relatively straightforward to choose the relevant document reference from Appendix 1.\n\nHowever, there are alternative terms commonly used in the catalogue descriptions for each occupation so you may need to check for various terms.\n\nSome common variants are in the following table:\n\nOccupation Common catalogue index term Guards; Porters; Signalmen Traffic; Coaching Engine drivers; Enginemen; Firemen; Cleaners; Wagon repairers; Workshop staff Locomotive; Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Staff handling collection, delivery or merchandise Goods Handling; Commercial Track maintenance staff (platelayers); Staff engaged on bridge and station construction and maintenance Signal; Signal and Telegraph Management and clerical staff Accountants; Audit Office; Headquarters; Divisional Superintendent; Secretary\u2019s Office; Clerical Staff\n\nFurther details of search terms for staff trades and occupations can be found in Appendix 2 of this guide, below (see also Appendix 6 of D T Hawkings\u2019 Railway Ancestors).\n\nStep 4: Search our catalogue\n\nUsing our catalogue, try searching using the index terms outlined in Step 3, restricting your search to the appropriate record series as detailed in Step 2.\n\n7. Original records: railway staff overseas\n\nLittle information is held on British railway staff working overseas, and there is no specific railway staff index to the surviving material. Searches will be speculative and time-consuming.\n\nOccasional references to individuals may, however, be found amongst the records of the Colonial, Dominions or Foreign Offices (The National Archives\u2019 department codes CO, DO or FO).\n\nThe best period for finding such career information is the 1920s and 1930s. This was a time of general retrenchment in the colonial service and appeals against being laid off or for compensation often includes career details.\n\nFor more information on how on these records read our guides:\n\n8. Records in other archives and elsewhere online\n\nAppendix 3 of Railway Records: A Guide to Sources by C J Edwards provides a guide to which record offices might hold the records of which railway companies.\n\nThe Cheshire Record office provides an index to railway staff registers for:\n\nCambrian Railway\n\nGreat Western Railway\n\nLondon and North Western Railway\n\nLondon and North Western\n\nGreat Western Joint Railway\n\nTo identify other archives which may hold records do a keyword search on our catalogue find out what is held elsewhere.\n\nUse the search engine on the National Railway Museum website, York, which holds staff magazines of the major railway companies of the 20th century, and which feature staff promotions, retirements, awards and photographs.\n\nConsult the \u2018Railway records across the land\u2019 resource on \u2018All change!\u2019 on Britain\u2019s railways.\n\n9.

In 1913 he became commander of the artillery of the Fourth Division (Woolwich), and led this unit in France in August 1914 during the battles of Le Cateau, the Marne, and the Aisne. When Sir John French transferred the British Expeditionary Force to Flanders in October, Milne was promoted brigadier general; the next year promotion to major general on the General Staff of the Second Army followed. Milne's career shifted radically when he was given command of the Twenty-seventh Division and ordered to Salonika: he was chosen for this post primarily because it was believed that he was sufficiently strong of character to resist the blandishments of the French General Maurice Sarrail, the overall Allied field commander in Greece. In January 1916, Milne was entrusted with command of the XVI Corps, and later that year with all British forces at Salonika under General Sarrail, and then those under General Franchet d'Esperey. The story of the British at Salonika is one of frustration: Milne possessed insufficient troops, his units suffered from disease, and they labored under the difficulty of the terrain. The chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir William Robertson, opted for a cautious stance in Greece against the Bulgars. It was not until April 24, 1917, that Milne was finally ordered to go on the attack near Lake Dorain, and he was repulsed with heavy losses. French and Serbian forces were finally able to advance against Bulgaria in 1918 and, after the collapse of the Sofia government, Milne advanced to the Turkish frontier, eventually occupying Constantinople after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Milne remained at the Porte until November 1920, being promoted general that same year. Two years later he was given the Eastern Command at home, and in 1926 was appointed chief of the Imperial General Staff. He was promoted field marshal in 1928 and five years later retired as Baron Milne, of Salonika and Rubislaw, county of Aberdeen. Milne spent the Second World War enrolled in the Home Guard, and died in London on March 23, 1948. He was known for his keen wit, immense energy, and penetrating intellect."}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/player/george-milne-17603", "page_content": "New Zealand\n\nAll\n\nAlphabetically sorted top ten of players who have played the most matches across formats in the last 12 months"}, {"url": "https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/people/george-milne", "page_content": "Swani, Kunal and George R.

It raised $1,100,000 for cancer research and lasted 16 hours.

Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus had previously prevented the students from entering the school at the beginning of the term with the Arkansas National Guard - they blocked the door. President Eisenhower ordered federal troops - the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army - to guard the students and allow them entry.\n\nIn 1963, at the age of 53 years old, George was alive when the British Secretary of War, 46 year old John Profumo ,was forced to resign when he lied about an affair with 19 year old Christine Keeler. Keeler was also involved with the Soviet naval attach\u00e9 and charges of espionage were feared.

John Milne. No posh Brit he: the Victorian geologist reached Japan mainly by train, foot and pack animal, ostensibly to avoid seasickness. As I write this, flying to Japan across eastern Siberia, I am amazed. I detect a whiff of the iconoclast. John Milne (left) with his wife Tone, seismologist Boris Galitzin and a lamp-post seismometer in 1910. Credit: CARISBROOKE CASTLE MUSEUM\n\nMilne's motivation for that epic journey was an invitation from Japanese officials of the Meiji era (1868\u20131912) to establish an Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, and to transfer Western knowledge to Japan. After arriving in 1875 to teach geology and mining, he became aware of the frequency of earthquakes and their damaging effects. Building designs transplanted from the West performed particularly poorly. By 1878, Milne determined that to study earthquake damage properly, he needed to quantify seismicity \u2014 or the frequency and strength of earthquakes \u2014 instrumentally. His goal became to build a standard seismometer and establish a seismic network across Japan. That plan was the inception of modern global seismology.\n\nTo mark this year's centenary of Milne's death, his great-nephew William Twycross made a documentary, The Man Who Mapped the Shaking Earth. Shown in July at the assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in Gothenburg, Sweden, the film immerses us in Milne's life in science, including his photographs and sketches. Often shooting on location, Twycross and his film crew trace Milne's travels in Iceland, the Canadian island of Newfoundland, Britain, Russia and the United States, as well as to and in Japan. Twycross imposes a fine narrative continuity despite the logistical complexities.\n\nMilne's astonishing saga began at King's College London, where he studied science. His published account of a study trip to Iceland in 1871, when he was 21, showed him to be a competent diarist and illustrator, and won him a scholarship to the Royal School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London). He suspended his studies there to complete a commercial geological survey of Newfoundland, where he incidentally studied the recently extinct great auk. On a Royal Geographical Society expedition to Egypt's Sinai peninsula in 1874, he marshalled his new skills in geology and illustration to create geographical cross-sections of the region \u2014 work that paved the way for his post in Japan.\n\nOnce there, he published his trans-Asian travelogue in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, and climbed, studied, sketched and even discovered some volcanoes, one of which is now named Milne. He made archaeological and anthropological studies of the indigenous Ainu culture and people of the northern Japanese islands, and met his wife-to-be, Tone Horikawa. After the Tokyo\u2013Yokohama earthquake of 1880, he established the Seismological Society of Japan and its journal \u2014 both world firsts. The Royal Society of London elected him a fellow in 1887.\n\nIn 1895, Milne left Japan with Tone for the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of Britain, building a seismological observatory there and working towards the standardization of instruments such as the horizontal pendulum seismograph to record earthquakes worldwide. The captaincy of the island's Newport Golf Club and membership of the local photography and chess clubs occupied his idle moments. By 1903 he had set up the world's first global seismic network, with 40 stations encompassing every continent reporting to his observatory, Shide Hill House. He also published the periodic Shide Circular Reports on Earthquakes from 1900 to 1912, a precursor to the seismological catalogues accumulated by national agencies around the world. His obituary (see Nature 91, 587\u2013588; 1913) hints at some resistance to coordinating his network with the International Seismological Association \u2014 not surprising, given his personal achievement."}, {"url": "https://oakland.edu/history/faculty-staff/george-milne/", "page_content": "Title: Associate Professor\n\nOffice: 106 Fitzgerald House\n\nPhone: (248) 370-3530\n\nFax: (248) 370-3528\n\nEmail: milne@oakland.edu\n\nEducation:\n\nPh.D., University of Oklahoma\n\nM.A., New York University\n\n\n\nMajor Fields:\n\nEarly American History, Native American History\n\n\n\nBiography:\n\nMy work focuses on the interactions between Native Americans and European colonists during the 17th and 18th centuries.
