{"He was traded to the Twins in 1989, and finished his career with them in 1990.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33497638/sources-new-york-yankees-finalizing-deal-acquire-josh-donaldson-isiah-kiner-falefa-minnesota-twins", "page_content": "TAMPA -- Isiah Kiner-Falefa thought he had found a new home with the Minnesota Twins. Less than 24 hours later, he was traded to the New York Yankees alongside former American League MVP Josh Donaldson and catcher Ben Rortvedt in exchange for catcher Gary Sanchez and infielder Gio Urshela.\n\nEarlier in the day, Yankees manager Aaron Boone had announced Urshela as the Yankees' starting shortstop. Urshela, whose natural position is third base, had started only 41 games at shortstop in six major league seasons with Cleveland (2015, 2017), Toronto (2018) and the Yankees (2019-21).\n\nNonetheless, Boone hinted that he was still expecting the Yankees to make some additional moves.\n\n\"I'm sure there are still things to be done across the game, and certainly with us, that are going to change that landscape potentially along the way,\" Boone said Sunday morning. \"I know Cash [GM Brian Cashman] and the front office right now are in overdrive and evaluating and having those conversations, whether it's free agents, through trade markets. I know they're working to find a place where it potentially improves our club.\"\n\nAcquiring Kiner-Falefa answers one the Yankees' biggest offseason needs after Gleyber Torres failed to make a successful transfer from second base. The Yankees were never willing to be players when it came to the two big-money free-agent shortstops on the market, Carlos Correa and Trevor Story.\n\nKiner-Falefa also plays third base and won a Gold Glove at the position during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. Kiner-Falefa batted .271/.312/.357 with eight home runs and 53 RBIs in his first full season as the Rangers' shortstop last year. He posted a .972 fielding percentage at the position, leading big league shortstops in total chances (669), assists (436) and double plays turned (98).\n\nThe Rangers, however, inked free-agent shortstop Corey Seager to a 10-year, $325 million deal this offseason -- an acquisition that eventually led them to trade Kiner-Falefa to the Twins on Saturday.\n\nOn a conference call with Minnesota reporters after the trade, Kiner-Falefa addressed his disappointment in getting dealt, saying Seager's acquisition \"definitely hurt.\"\n\n\"The fact that they couldn't make a spot for me was really tough,\" Kiner-Falefa told reporters. \"It ended up working out with them accommodating me and trading me here, and I can't be happier to be [in Minnesota].\"\n\nTwins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey praised Kiner-Falefa's defensive skills after the trade, describing him as \"a Gold Glove-level defender.\" Kiner-Falefa has also played 73 career major league games at catcher, recording a .996 fielding percentage.\n\nAfter the trade to New York was announced, Kiner-Falefa took to Twitter to express his enthusiasm in donning the pinstripes.\n\n\"Always wanted to be like #2!!!,\" he wrote, referencing Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter. \"Let's go @Yankees\"\n\nIn Donaldson, 36, the Yankees acquired a three-time All-Star, 2015 AL MVP and two-time AL Silver Slugger Award winner. Donaldson was also named the 2019 National League Comeback Player of the Year during his one-year stint with the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe third baseman has a career slash line of .269/.367/.505 over 11 seasons in the big leagues, having played with Oakland (2010, '12-14), Toronto (2015-18), Cleveland (2018), Atlanta (2019) and Minnesota (2020-21). Last year, Donaldson hit .247 with 26 doubles, 26 home runs and 72 RBIs in 135 games with the Twins.\n\nDonaldson joins the Yankees after being one of the most vocal critics of Gerrit Cole. Donaldson called out Cole's diminished spin rate after MLB started cracking down on the use of foreign substances by pitchers.\n\nNew York will pick up the remaining two years of Donaldson's contract, which is valued at around $42 million, from the Twins.\n\nThe Yankees also exchanged catchers with the Twins, flipping Sanchez for Rortvedt. Sanchez had become a liability behind the plate and lost starts to backup Kyle Higashioka, who developed into Cole's personal catcher. After a dreadful 2020 season, in which he hit .147/.253/.365, Sanchez had also been a shadow of his former self at the plate.\n\nRortvedt, 24, made his major league debut in 2021, batting .169/229/.281 with three home runs and seven RBIs in 39 games played. Rortvedt was a second-round (56th overall) selection in the 2016 draft and was named the best defensive catcher in the Twins minor league system by Baseball America after the 2019 season. Rortvedt also worked with current Yankees catching coach Tanner Swanson when Swanson was with Minnesota."}, {"url": "https://www.stlredbirds.com/2021/04/09/april-22-1988-cardinals-trade-tom-herr-to-the-twins-for-tom-brunansky/", "page_content": "Tom Herr knew that the Cardinals needed to shake things up after winning just four of their first 15 games in 1988.\n\nStill, he was just as shocked as Cardinals fans when he entered the clubhouse following a 4-0 loss to the Mets and was informed that he had been traded to Minnesota for power-hitting outfielder Tom Brunansky.\n\n\u201cI could see the writing on the wall,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think it would happen this soon.\u201d[1]\n\nThe 32-year-old second baseman had been with the Cardinals\u2019 franchise since August 22, 1974, when he signed with the Cardinals as an amateur free agent. In 1979, Herr earned his first taste of major-league action, making 12 plate appearances in 14 games as a second baseman and pinch hitter. His first game came the same night that Lou Brock earned the 3,000th hit of his career.\n\nIn 1980, Herr appeared in 76 games. Desperate to get the prospect into the lineup, interim manager Red Schoendienst, who was overseeing the major-league club while Whitey Herzog analyzed the Cardinals\u2019 farm system, used Herr in 14 games at shortstop to get a better look at the rookie.\n\n\u201cI called (Herzog) one night and said I\u2019d like to play this kid, Tommy Herr, at shortstop if it was all right with Whitey,\u201d Schoendienst wrote in his 1998 autobiography. \u201cI told Whitey I knew he was not a shortstop and was a second baseman, but this way I could get him some playing time and see what he could do. Whitey was all in favor of the idea. I told Tommy the next day about my plan. I told him, \u2018I know you\u2019re not a shortstop, but this will give you some playing time.\u2019 He said that was OK with him and he went out and played hard and did a good job. The next year he was our second baseman and one piece of the puzzle was in place.\u201d[2]\n\nHerr was the starting second baseman for the Cardinals\u2019 1982 world championship team and the National League champion 1985 and 1987 teams. The 1985 season was Herr\u2019s best, as he batted .302 with career highs in homers (8), RBIs (110), and stolen bases (31). That season, he made the only all-star game of his career and placed fifth in the National League MVP voting.\n\n\u201cThe most amazing hitter I had in those years might have been Tommy Herr,\u201d Herzog wrote in 1999. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better example of how having a plan, a sense of the situation you\u2019re in, can help you succeed.\n\n\u201cIf there was one guy I managed that I would want hitting for me in the stretch drive, in August and September, it\u2019d be hard to pick between George Brett and Tommy. He didn\u2019t have much power, but he\u2019d rope it to all fields, torch the lines, bleed it up the middle, even hit one out of the ballpark when you needed it. I don\u2019t know how he did that, but if he\u2019d hit you 10 homers a year, eight counted for something.\u201d[3]\n\nOne of those homers came almost exactly one year prior to the trade. On April 18, 1987, Herr hit a 10th-inning grand slam off the Mets\u2019 Jesse Orosco to secure a 12-8 victory. The win happened to come on Seat Cushion Night at Busch Stadium, and joyous Cardinals fans celebrated by tossing hundreds of seat cushions onto the field. In fact, fans threw so many that stadium personnel were still removing cushions from the field when players showed up for the next day\u2019s game.[4]\n\nThe 1988 season marked the final year of Herr\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cI came into this year knowing it was a pivotal year for me and the organization had to make a decision on me,\u201d Herr said. \u201cI prefer to look at it from a positive standpoint. There\u2019s a ballclub out there that wants me \u2013 a real enthusiastic club, a fun-loving club.\n\n\u201cI certainly loved my time here as a Cardinal. I\u2019m a winner, and the organization provided me a chance to play on a winner. It\u2019s really hard to say goodbye. I wanted to play my whole career here and that dream is out the window.\u201d[5]\n\nEven as the Cardinals struggled in the opening weeks of the 1988 season, Herr was batting .260 with a .393 on-base percentage. Nonetheless, with Jack Clark playing in Yankee pinstripes on a rich free-agent contract, the Cardinals desperately needed a power hitter for the middle of the lineup.\n\nEnter the 27-year-old Brunansky.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 right fielder from Covina, California, made his only all-star appearance in 1985, when he clubbed 27 homers and drove in 90 RBIs. In 1987, he helped the Twins capture the world championship, hitting 32 homers and driving in 85 runs. In the American League Championship Series against Detroit, he hit .412 with two homers and nine RBIs. Against the Cardinals in the World Series, he went just 2-for-25 with two RBIs and a stolen base.\n\nThe Twins, like the Cardinals, were off to a slow start to 1988. With their 11-6 loss to the Indians that night, they had fallen to 4-10 on the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going through this situation for the last couple of years,\u201d Brunansky said. \u201cIt had to happen. The team hasn\u2019t been playing well. Just by the way things were going, you felt they had to make a change. It\u2019s part of the business. There\u2019s not much you can say.\u201d[6]\n\nTwins manager Tom Kelly had plenty to say about Brunansky.\n\n\u201cHe played his heart out,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe was part of a championship team. You get close to players and it\u2019s tough to tell a guy he\u2019s been traded to another team. It\u2019s not easy to do.\u201d[7]\n\nThe day he made the trade, Cardinals general manager Dal Maxvill said the Cardinals hoped Brunansky could provide 20 homers per year in the more spacious Busch Stadium confines.[8] It proved to be an uncannily accurate prediction.\n\nThrough the remainder of the 1988 season, Brunansky hit 22 homers, more than twice as many as any other player on the roster (Tony Pena ranked second on the team with 10). Brunansky also drove in 79 RBIs and stole 16 bases. The following year, Brunansky again led the team in home runs, this time hitting exactly 20 to go along with 85 RBIs.\n\nDespite Brunansky\u2019s power production, the Cardinals won just 76 games in 1988 and 86 in 1989, when they finished third in the National League East. Brunansky played just 19 games in 1990 before the Cardinals sent him to the Red Sox for closer Lee Smith. In 320 games with the Cardinals, he hit .238/.327/.411 with 43 home runs and 166 RBIs.\n\nHe finished his 14-year major-league career with 271 home runs and 919 RBIs. Following his playing career, he served as a hitting coach in the Twins\u2019 development system, then was promoted to serve as the major league hitting coach from 2013 through 2016. He currently serves as hitting coach at the University of St. Katherine in San Marcos, California.\n\nHerr played the remainder of the 1988 season in Minnesota. It proved a difficult season, as he strained his left quadriceps and required two trips to the disabled list. In 86 games, he hit .263 with two homers, 24 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases.\n\n\u201cThe shock of the trade bothered me more than anything. \u2026 It really hit me out of the blue,\u201d Herr said. \u201cI can remember getting on the plane to fly to Minneapolis and crying like a baby. It was hard to go through. Looking back on it, I didn\u2019t handle it very well. I kept looking back instead of forward. I was looking at it more that the Cardinals didn\u2019t want me than that the Twins wanted me. If I had put a more positive spin on it, I would have reacted better.\u201d[9]\n\nKnowing that Herr had no intention of re-signing with them, the Twins sent Herr, Eric Bullock, and Tom Nieto to the Phillies in a rare October trade for Shane Rawley and $125,000. Following the deal, Herr signed a free-agent deal with the Phillies.\n\nIn 1990, the Phillies sent him to the Mets at the trade deadline for Nikco Riesgo and Rocky Elli. After the Mets released him in August 1991, he signed with the Giants and played the remainder of the season in San Francisco.\n\nHe finished his 13-season major-league career with a .271 batting average, 1,450 hits, and 188 stolen bases.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, and again in 2009 and 2010, Herr managed his hometown Lancaster (Pa.) Barnstormers in the Atlantic League, leading the team to the 2006 league championship. In 2007, he managed the Washington Nationals\u2019 Class A affiliate in Hagerstown, Maryland.[10]\n\nIn 2020, fans elected Herr to the Cardinals Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cI always feel the love whenever I go back out there (to St. Louis),\u201d Herr said. \u201cThis just puts an exclamation mark on that. It\u2019s overwhelming, really.\u201d[11]\n\nEnjoy this post?

Newman was a super utility man, having played five different defensive positions for the Twins in 1987. While he wasn't much with the bat (having a .231 batting average over his five seasons with the Twins), he gave manager Tom Kelly a good glove at any position he needed Newman at. He was also one of only seven players to play for both of the Twins World Series winning teams.\n\nDan Gladden\n\nGladden was another of the seven players to play for both Twins World Series winning teams. He also scored the winning run in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series after stretching a bloop hit into a double in the bottom of the 10th inning. He was an above average outfielder for the Twins and showed a knack for stealing bases at the most opportune times.\n\nEddie Guardado\n\nThe man nicknamed \"Everyday\" certainly lived up to that title, pitching in 648 games and being named an All-Star twice during his time in Minnesota. In 2002 and 2003 he was the closer for the Twins, shutting the door 86 times. He helped Minnesota to their first and second AL Central titles. Guardado left the Twins on less than great terms, but has finally reconciled his differences with the franchise and is taking part in the Twins spring training in some capacity as a coach this season.\n\nGary Gaetti\n\nGaetti spent 10 seasons with the Twins and was a part of the team that won the 1987 World Series. He was a two time All-Star and four time Gold Glove winner, as well as three times received votes for the AL MVP award. Throughout his time with the Twins he played as many as four different positions a season and was an integral part of the Twins clubhouse.\n\n\n\nGene Larkin and Randy Bush\n\nLarkin and Bush both get honorable mention mainly because they were in the group of seven players that won both the 1987 and 1991 World Series with the Twins. It was also Larkin that had the game-winning RBI in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Bush played his entire 12 year career with the Twins."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3451645/2022/07/26/twins-trade-deadline/", "page_content": "Joe Mauer called it a punch in the gut.\n\nRarely the player to criticize his team, Mauer was vocal in response to the front office\u2019s decision to tear down the 2018 Twins. Derek Falvey and Thad Levine officially pulled the plug on an under-.500 club on July 27, 2018, trading away Eduardo Escobar and Ryan Pressly in separate deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew what it meant for the Twins\u2019 chances. The clubhouse had been rocked by the news, which Escobar learned via a television report. His was the first of five trades in five days.\n\nUnderstanding it was a difficult period for players, Falvey, the team\u2019s president of baseball operations, immediately joined the Twins in Boston. He was similarly present last summer when the Twins traded Nelson Cruz and Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos.\n\nThis year is much different.\n\nBolstered by players acquired in those deadline deals in 2018 and 2021, a team that stunned the baseball world by signing free agent Carlos Correa in late March sits in first place in the AL Central with 66 games to go. But the Twins undoubtedly need pitching reinforcements and possibly more before the Aug. 2 trade deadline.\n\nEither way, Falvey anticipates this year\u2019s trade deadline will be a little easier for players to absorb.\n\n\u201cA better spot,\u201d Falvey said. \u201cIt feels a lot better to be on this side. I say this every year. The vast majority of what we\u2019re going to be able to do the rest of this year is already in this room. There\u2019s only so much you can do at any given deadline to make that much change.\n\n\u201cCan you add some things along the way when you\u2019re in this position? Absolutely, and that will be our goal.\u201d\n\nWhile the market will dictate what they do between now and next Tuesday\u2019s cut off, the Twins made their intentions for 2022 clear when they signed Correa. They think they can win now.\n\nThe Twins signed Byron Buxton to a seven-year extension in December and then overhauled the roster in March, trading Mitch Garver and Josh Donaldson for Gary S\u00e1nchez and Gio Urshela. Using the money saved on Donaldson, the Twins signed Correa a few weeks later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough they hoped to bolster the pitching staff with the additions of Sonny Gray, Chris Archer and Chris Paddack, injuries and an April 7 trade of Taylor Rogers have left the Twins\u2019 pitching thin.\n\nWhile he\u2019s generally optimistic and operates like a sage poker player unwilling to tip his hand, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli plans to go forward with the roster he has until informed otherwise.\n\n\u201cMaybe we do make some moves as the deadline comes, but we don\u2019t bank on those things,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look to those things as something we absolutely vitally need. \u2026 If those transactions or acquisitions come, then they come, and we\u2019ll adopt whoever shows up and work with those players and hopefully they can get us better, too. But if they don\u2019t come, I\u2019m comfortable right now.\u201d\n\nThe visiting clubhouse at Fenway Park feels no bigger than a shoebox. Whereas other stadiums provide locker stalls that seem like palatial estates, Fenway offers opponents minuscule spaces to store their gear.\n\nOver the years, couches and tables have been removed from the room\u2019s center to give it a more spacious appearance. Yet no visiting clubhouse in the league provides a more inhospitable environment.\n\nThere\u2019s little comfort and even less room to hide.\n\nIt made for a tough setting for Twins players to handle a sad scene.\n\nThe Twins entered 2018 hopeful. Then Jorge Polanco got suspended for 80 games for PEDs, Buxton got hurt and Miguel San\u00f3 struggled to recover from an offseason surgery to repair his broken leg. The team\u2019s chances of catching Cleveland were minimal.\n\nStill, Escobar\u2019s trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks upended them. Outfielder Max Kepler and Polanco are the only current Twins who were in the room (San\u00f3, Buxton and Tyler Duffey were in the minors).\n\n\u201cThat was a close-quartered clubhouse,\u201d Kepler said. \u201cYou really felt all the emotions. There were teary eyes here and there. Once that (All-Star) break comes around, people are excited to get a break. But then also if you\u2019re not winning, you worry about, \u2018Who am I going to see?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst it was Escobar. Pressly was traded that night. Lance Lynn and Zach Duke were jettisoned a few days after that. Brian Dozier was traded minutes before the deadline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always sad to see someone go that you play with a good bit and go through adversity with and grow with,\u201d Kepler said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you can\u2019t get used to.\u201d\n\nFalvey expected a negative reaction in the clubhouse.\n\nThe Twins had brought back most of the 2017 wild-card team. They hoped a trade for Jake Odorizzi and free-agent signees Fernando Rodney, Addison Reed, Duke, Lynn and Logan Morrison would result in a formidable club.\n\nIt never happened.\n\n\u201cIt was my first year in this leadership position where we weren\u2019t in a position to compete for the playoffs, where it felt like we were more seller than buyer,\u201d Falvey said. \u201cI just remember it being emotional. I felt like once you made those decisions, you\u2019re not going to hide in the shadows. Ultimately, it\u2019s a decision I had to make \u2026 I wanted to be there.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Falvey would definitely rather be in this position, sitting in first place.\n\nThe top prospect acquired for Escobar, Jhoan Duran, has been the life force of the Twins\u2019 bullpen this season. FanGraphs values him at 0.7 WAR after posting a 2.30 ERA with six saves, 10 holds and 52 strikeouts in 43 innings pitched.\n\nThough Devin Smeltzer\u2019s fWAR is minus-0.2, the Twins have received valuable contributions from Smeltzer, who is 4-2 with a 4.02 ERA in 62 2/3 innings and came over in the Dozier deal.\n\nAdded along with injured reliever Jorge Alcal\u00e1 in exchange for Pressly, Gilberto Celestino has produced 0.5 fWAR this season.\n\nThen there\u2019s Joe Ryan, who came over in a trade that sent Cruz to Tampa Bay. In 20 starts, Ryan has produced 2.1 fWAR by going 9-4 with a 3.18 ERA in 107 2/3 career innings.\n\n\u201cYour hope is somewhere down the line you\u2019ll look back and go, as painful as that was, you had to do it for the future,\u201d Falvey said. \u201cYou hope that.\u201d\n\nThe Twins have managed trades for Gray and Kenta Maeda, pitchers who have greatly enhanced their rotations but are viewed as No. 2s and 3s instead of an ace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough they\u2019ve pursued several No. 1s since Falvey and Levine arrived, the Twins have yet to land one.\n\nThe Twins wanted free agent Yu Darvish in early 2018 but were heavily outbid by the Cubs.\n\nThey pushed for Toronto pitcher Marcus Stroman at the 2019 trade deadline and were disappointed when the New York Mets won the bidding with what they felt was a lesser offer. They wisely didn\u2019t pursue a Noah Syndergaard-for-Buxton deal at the same deadline.\n\nThey were outbid for Zack Wheeler the following winter.\n\nThe Twins asked about Luis Castillo and Tyler Mahle this winter only to be denied by Cincinnati. There was an attempt to trade for Frankie Montas, too, but Oakland wouldn\u2019t engage.\n\nAs good as Ryan and Gray have been, the Twins understand yet again they need top-tier pitching if they want to compete in the postseason. Injuries to Paddack and Maeda, who could return in September as a reliever, have them needing more top options.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a finite number of those guys in the game, period,\u201d Levine said in February 2018. \u201cSome people subscribe to everyone has a No. 1 so there are 30 Nos. 1. We don\u2019t see that there are 30 bona fide top-of-the-rotations. That\u2019s part of the team we\u2019re trying to develop. \u2026 That\u2019s an area of our team we\u2019ll continue to try and address.\u201d\n\nThere could be chances to address pitching at the 2022 deadline.\n\nThe Twins continue to love Mahle more than Castillo and have also engaged the Miami Marlins, who are loaded with pitching and believed to be a good trade partner in terms of possible fits.\n\nIf San Francisco enters the sellers market, Carlos Rod\u00f3n and Alex Wood would be enticing options as would Boston\u2019s Nathan Eovaldi.\n\nOnce again, the Twins want to swim in the deep end of the pool. Whether they can make it a reality is the question.\n\n\u201cIf we think it\u2019s the right decision, the right investment \u2014 that\u2019s always going to be our jobs is trying to figure out what is the right investment \u2014 Jim Pohlad has supported that every step of the way,\u201d Falvey said in October 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rotation isn\u2019t the only investment needed.\n\nDuran has been magic, but he could use help.\n\nChicago\u2019s David Robertson profiles as a good fit and the Cubs are selling. But the Twins likely could use two relievers.\n\nThere\u2019s also been talk of adding a bat, though how San\u00f3\u2019s return could alter those plans is a wild card. With Ryan Jeffers out until September, the Twins might want to add a catcher, too.\n\nKepler agrees the Twins are in a better position than previous deadlines. He liked the impact Sergio Romo made when he was acquired in July 2019 and the \u201cgood vibes\u201d the veteran brought.\n\nBut Kepler isn\u2019t a fan of the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not as sad and people aren\u2019t grieving like they lost someone,\u201d Kepler said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a similar situation to just having to adjust to someone being added. Just a new setting, a new person in the clubhouse. A new co-worker is not always the easiest, depending on the person, obviously. You\u2019re having to build a relationship midseason or vice versa losing a relationship.\u201d\n\nFalvey is hopeful this could be a better deadline than in the past. When asked about it a week ago, Falvey said the market hadn\u2019t yet developed.\n\nEven so, he\u2019s optimistic the Twins can find pieces that could help give them enough energy to deliver the gut punches instead of taking them.\n\n\u201cHopefully,\u201d Falvey said, \u201cwe can add in a way that doesn\u2019t disrupt the chemistry in any way, just adds to it.\u201d\n\nSan\u00f3 rejoins club three months later\n\nHis role won\u2019t look the same. His chances to impact the team will be reduced \u2014 at least initially.\n\nBut San\u00f3 told reporters in Milwaukee he\u2019s happy to rejoin the Twins.\n\nSan\u00f3 hasn\u2019t played since April 30 after undergoing surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.\n\nInitially, the Twins hoped San\u00f3 could return to action in as few as six weeks. He missed 75 games and has seen his plate appearances consumed by Luis Arraez, Alex Kirilloff and rookie Jos\u00e9 Miranda.\n\nFor now, San\u00f3 might start only when the Twins face left-handed pitchers, as he did Tuesday. San\u00f3\u2019s season was off to a terrible start, as he produced a .397 OPS in 65 April plate appearances.\n\nBut San\u00f3\u2019s bat showed signs of life during a rehab stint this month.\n\nHe batted .333/.422/.795 with five home runs in 45 plate appearances against minor-league pitching. Baldelli said San\u00f3 responded well to a discussion about his role with the Twins.\n\n\u201cHe was great,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cEverything we talked about, he nodded and said, \u2018I\u2019m ready. Whatever you need me for I\u2019m ready for,\u2019 and I believe him. He\u2019s a pretty authentic guy. He\u2019s not going to feed you anything. He\u2019s going to tell you what he\u2019s thinking and he\u2019s a guy that does work hard and is a good teammate. All these things, they come easy to him.\n\n\u201cBut again, it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s played a big-league ballgame. I think he\u2019s just glad to be back and glad for the opportunity to be playing.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Jhoan Duran: Bruce Kluckhohn / USA Today)"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/yankees-acquire-josh-donaldson-twins-five-player-trade-2022-03-14/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-14 04:26:13 GMT+00:00 - The New York Yankees acquired veteran third baseman Josh Donaldson from the Minnesota Twins on Sunday night.\n\nShortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and catcher Ben Rortvedt also are headed to New York while catcher Gary Sanchez and third baseman Gio Urshela are going to Minnesota.\n\nDonaldson is a three-time All-Star who won American League MVP honors in 2015 when he was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays. He has 251 career homers, 26 of them coming last year in his second season with the Twins.\n\nDonaldson got into a verbal sparring match with Yankees ace pitcher Gerrit Cole last June. Donaldson expressed that he felt the spin rate on Cole's pitches had suddenly dropped due to other pitchers being disciplined by Major League Baseball.\n\nDonaldson implied that Cole had cut back on sticky substances due to the suspensions.\n\n\"Is it coincidence that Gerrit Cole's spin rate numbers went down (Thursday) after four minor leaguers got suspended for 10 games,\" Donaldson said. \"Is that possible? I don't know. Maybe.\"\n\nCole wasn't happy to have to address the topic.\n\n\"Obviously, it's undesirable. But I understand that this topic is important to everybody that cares about the game,\" Cole said. \"In regards to Josh specifically, I felt like it was a bit of low-hanging fruit, but he's entitled to voice his opinion. I have other things that I just need to keep my focus on.\"\n\nNow they will be teammates. Donaldson, 36, has a .269 career average and 728 RBIs in 1,201 major league games with the Oakland Athletics, Blue Jays, Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves and Twins.\n\nThe Twins reportedly wanted to dump Donaldson's contract. He is owed $50 million over the next two years, and they now will try to find a taker for Sanchez, who they have no interest in keeping.\n\nSanchez, 29, is a two-time All-Star but batted just .204 last season and .147 in 2020. He did belt 23 homers and drive in 54 runs in 117 games last season.\n\nSanchez has 138 homers and 340 RBIs in 538 career games in six-plus seasons, all with the Yankees.\n\nUrshela, 30, batted .267 with 14 homers and 49 RBIs in 116 games last season.

Earlier Sunday, Minnesota traded last year\u2019s first-round pick in the amateur draft, 18-year-old right-hander Chase Petty, to Cincinnati for starting pitcher Sonny Gray.\n\nNo cash was involved in this trade. The Yankees become responsible for Donaldson's US$21 million salary in each of the next two seasons plus a $16 million mutual option for 2024 with a $6 million buyout if declined by the team. He agreed to a $92 million, four-year contract with the Twins, the richest free-agent deal in franchise history.\n\nDonaldson was the 2015 AL MVP with Toronto and was an All-Star in three straight seasons from 2014-16. Now 36, he hit .247 with 26 homers and 72 RBIs last year in his second season with the Twins.\n\nNew York is looking to retool an offence that scored two runs or fewer in 44 games and was shut out eight times. Right-handed batters filled 68.6% of New York's plate appearances last season (4,160 of 6,060), and the Yankees are trying to add a left-handed-hitting first baseman.\n\nKiner-Falefa, who turns 27 on March 23, was a Gold Glove third baseman during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, then was moved to shortstop last year.\n\nHe became expendable when the Rangers signed Corey Seager on Dec. 1, the day before the lockout, and was traded Saturday to the Twns. He hit .271 with eight homers and 53 RBIs last season. Kiner-Falefa is eligible for arbitration for 2022 and '23, and for free agency after the 2024 season.\n\nNew York was looking to add a shortstop after shifting Gleyber Torres to second base on Sept. 13 for the remainder of the season. Torres had 18 errors at shortstop last season, second-most in the AL at the time of his move.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, 29, was an All-Star in 2017 and 2019 but has failed to match his production of 2017, when he hit .278 with 33 homers and 90 RBIs. He batted .204 with 23 homers and 54 RBIs last year\n\nS\u00e1nchez led the AL in passed balls in three of the last five seasons. He had eight last season, when pitchers threw 60 wild pitches with S\u00e1nchez behind the plate, a career high.\n\nHe is eligible for free agency after this season.\n\nBeside Sanchez, Ryan Jeffers is the lone remaining option at catcher for the Twins.\n\nUrshela, 30, is a smooth fielder who hit 267 with 18 doubles, 14 homers and 49 RBIs last season. He is signed to a $6.55 million, one-year deal.\n\nAfter trading their largest contract, the Twins could be setting themselves up to make a run at another high-profile, high-dollar player. They have a big hole at shortstop again, assuming Urshela will slide in at third base, and can certainly use more starting pitching."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2234367/2020/12/02/eddie-rosario-twins-non-tender/", "page_content": "Eddie Rosario was non-tendered by the Twins on Wednesday, joining a record number of arbitration-eligible players cut loose across MLB following a season in which team revenues crashed due to a pandemic-shortened schedule played without fans in the stands. After a decade in the Twins organization, including the past six seasons as their starting left fielder, Rosario is now a free agent as the team looks to the future at the position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was not a surprise move, or at least it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nI wrote last October about the upcoming clash between Rosario\u2019s rising salaries and his stagnant perceived value. Two months ago, in breaking down the 2021 payroll situation, I did not include Rosario and his projected $10 million salary in the Twins\u2019 plans, assuming he\u2019d be non-tendered or traded. During the past month, I\u2019ve written several times that Rosario was likely to be non-tendered.\n\nThe Twins shopped Rosario last offseason, but found his trade market lacking and hung onto him. They shopped him again this offseason, seeking a modest return because of his projected arbitration figure, eventually making Rosario available on outright waivers for nothing in return when they found no takers. He went unclaimed by all 29 other teams.\n\nWhile unlikely, it\u2019s still possible that Rosario could re-sign with the Twins at a reduced salary. But in the meantime, there are lots of stunned Twins fans with lots of questions after so many good years together. Why was one of their most popular, longest-tenured players deemed not worth a $10 million salary by the Twins and every other team in baseball? Let\u2019s examine the reasons.\n\nOverall hitting\n\nRosario arrived in style, homering on the first pitch he saw in the majors as a 23-year-old rookie in 2015, and he quickly became a fixture in the middle of the Twins\u2019 lineup. He was an above-average hitter in five of six Twins seasons, but Rosario never took the next step from good to great, in large part because he remained an undisciplined hitter all too willing to chase bad pitches.\n\nSince his 2015 debut, Rosario has swung at 42.8 percent of pitches outside the strike zone, fifth-most in the majors. And while most free-swingers tend to at least become a bit more discerning with age and experience, Rosario swung at 42.6 percent of non-strikes in 2020 and 44.3 percent in 2018-2020 combined. He\u2019s averaged just 25 non-intentional walks per 150 games, with a high of 34.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat type of approach leads to giving away too many outs to be a consistently great hitter, because you\u2019re upping the degree of difficulty by allowing pitchers to throw slop knowing you\u2019ll chase anything. For all of Rosario\u2019s obvious talent and memorable hot streaks, he\u2019s hit above .280 just twice in six seasons and his overall production has been nothing special for a corner outfielder.\n\n2018-2020 AVG OBP SLG OPS Eddie Rosario .278 .312 .488 .800 All corner outfielders .258 .332 .446 .778\n\nRosario slightly out-hit the average corner outfielder from 2018-2020, topping their collective OPS by 22 points, or 2.8 percent. However, because one point of on-base percentage is more valuable than one point of slugging percentage, the actual gap is even smaller. Beyond that, those MLB-wide totals include starters and bench players, making the comparison even less favorable for Rosario.\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in being an average hitter for a corner outfielder, but it\u2019s also not a particularly difficult skill set to find because there\u2019s an abundance of good hitters, in the majors and the minors, capable of playing there defensively. Jake Cave, for example, is no one\u2019s idea of an impact player, yet his production isn\u2019t that far off from Rosario\u2019s the past three years.\n\n2018-2020 AVG OBP SLG OPS Eddie Rosario .278 .312 .488 .800 Jake Cave .254 .321 .451 .772\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly not an apples-to-apples comparison, because Cave was a part-time player, but it\u2019s hard to look at those totals and conclude Rosario is worth $10 million when Cave \u2014 and readily available role players like him \u2014 make $600,000. Cave isn\u2019t better than Rosario \u2014 or even especially good relative to any number of other fungible corner bats \u2014 but is he $9.4 million worse?\n\nClutch hitting\n\nRosario gained a reputation as a clutch performer and chants of \u201cEddie! Eddie! Eddie!\u201d by the home crowd often accompanied his late-inning at-bats. It\u2019s what Rosario said he missed most about a 2020 season played without fans at Target Field. He lived for those tense moments with the game on the line and loved to soak in 35,000 fans screaming his name because they wanted him at the plate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his actual numbers in clutch situations weren\u2019t especially great, or at least not better than you\u2019d expect from a hitter of his caliber. Rosario certainly came through with his share of clutch hits in a Twins uniform, each of which \u201cconfirmed\u201d the reputation he established early, but he also was prone to giving away outs in key spots by recklessly chasing pitches out of the strike zone.\n\nRosario has a higher career OPS with the bases empty (.798) than with runners in scoring position (.775) despite league-wide numbers showing that hitters are generally at an advantage with runners on base. He posted a .752 OPS in high-leverage situations, 52 points lower than his OPS in low-leverage spots, and his undisciplined aggression became magnified with a .295 on-base percentage.\n\nIt can be difficult to separate high RBI totals from good clutch hitting, because for decades conventional wisdom treated them as one in the same. Rosario is an example of the out-sized role opportunity has in RBI accumulation. He always batted near the middle of the lineup, coming to the plate with the most runners on base, and he rarely passed up an RBI chance by drawing a walk.\n\nFor instance, Rosario led the 2019 Twins with 109 RBI, one more than Nelson Cruz. That season, Rosario came to the plate with a team-high 412 runners on base, compared to 332 for Cruz. Rosario received 80 more RBI opportunities, yet drove in just one more run. He also received the Twins\u2019 most RBI chances in 2018 and 2020, and the second-most in 2017.\n\nRosario drove in 15.5 percent of runners on base, compared to the AL average of 14.4 percent, and that doesn\u2019t fully account for how many outs he ate up or how infrequently he drew a walk to become an RBI chance for the next hitter. Justin Morneau, the team\u2019s \u201cRBI man\u201d before Rosario, drove in 17.8 percent for the Twins. Joe Mauer, long criticized for low RBI totals, drove in 17.0 percent.\n\nNone of which is to suggest Rosario is a bad hitter. He is, in fact, a good hitter. But citing RBI totals as evidence of great or clutch hitting is not unlike citing a basketball player\u2019s point total as evidence of great or clutch scoring while ignoring the shot attempts it took to get there. Rosario scored a lot of points for the Twins over the years, many of them in the clutch, but he also took a ton of shots, and they weren\u2019t always quality looks.\n\nOnce boasting elite range and speed, Rosario has been on the decline on the defensive side since his debut in 2015. (David Berding / USA Today)\n\nDefense\n\nRosario was once a great defensive left fielder, combining the range of a center fielder and the arm of a right fielder. He tracked down fly balls in the gap that would have been impossible for recent Twins left fielders Delmon Young, Josh Willingham and Jason Kubel. He made runners and third-base coaches pay for misguidedly testing his arm, racking up outfield assists at a record pace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once scouting reports on his arm circulated around the league, teams knew better. Rosario notched 26 assists in 1,791 innings his first two seasons, but just 27 in 3,923 innings after that. It\u2019s common for strong-armed outfielders\u2019 assists to dry up \u2014 Michael Cuddyer can relate \u2014 and there\u2019s still some value in never even being tested, but those baserunner kills often change games.\n\nRosario\u2019s speed also aged poorly, shrinking his range while leaving behind the same erratic, error-prone approach. He was legitimately fast when he debuted, with sprint speeds in the 87th and 86th percentiles his first two years. That fell to the 63rd percentile his third season and dropped again to the 56th percentile in 2019. In his final Twins season, at age 28, his sprint speed was just average.\n\nNot surprisingly, Rosario\u2019s fielding metrics followed a similar path, going from great to average in six seasons. In his first two seasons, Rosario rated plus-12 in Defensive Runs Saved and plus-10 in Ultimate Zone Rating. He was minus-8 and minus-2, respectively, in his last four seasons, during which time Statcast\u2019s outs above average \u2014 which didn\u2019t exist yet in 2015 \u2014 rated him minus-23.\n\nSalary\n\nArbitration is designed for players to receive gradual raises once they complete three full years of MLB service time while earning a minimum salary. Rosario, for instance, made the minimum from 2015-2018, making a total of around $2 million for his first four years (technically three-plus years of service time) with the Twins. Arbitration eligible for the first time in 2019, he made $4.2 million.\n\nFor the most part it\u2019s an extremely owner-friendly system, controlling costs and keeping players from earning anything close to what they would as free agents. It\u2019s also a rigid, outdated system in which players are evaluated based mostly on service time, position, and old-school stats like homers, RBIs, wins and saves. Because of that, there are some large blind spots.\n\nIn particular, good but not great position players in their third and final seasons of arbitration eligibility can have projected salaries above their perceived value, in large part because the system is overrating their raw \u201ccounting stats\u201d to paint them as higher-end players. As a result, they\u2019re at risk of being non-tendered by teams that might otherwise keep them at more reasonable salaries.\n\nExamples of that happening in recent Twins history include Trevor Plouffe in 2016 and C.J. Cron last offseason. And now it happened with Rosario. He got $4.2 million via arbitration in 2019, which was very reasonable. Then he made $7.8 million via arbitration in 2020, still reasonable but approaching borderline. His projected $10 million salary for 2021 priced him out of the Twins\u2019 plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosario was viewed as a non-tender candidate even before COVID-19 caused MLB-wide revenues to crash, making the decision an obvious one in this new reality. That type of money, while not outlandish, simply buys a superior hitter than Rosario in most free agent or trade markets, and especially in this one. Or, perhaps more accurately, Rosario-caliber hitters can be acquired for less.\n\nHeaded by Alex Kirilloff, the Twins have a crop of corner outfield prospects who are either ready for the big leagues or close to it. (Jesse Johnson / USA Today)\n\nReplacement options\n\nRosario went unclaimed on waivers prior to being non-tendered, which means none of the other 29 teams viewed him as worth his projected arbitration figure either. And most of those other 29 teams aren\u2019t as well-stocked in young, cheap corner outfielders as the Twins, who have top prospects and former first-round picks Alex Kirilloff, Brent Rooker and Trevor Larnach waiting in the wings.\n\nKirilloff is one of the dozen best hitting prospects in baseball and was deemed ready enough for the big leagues to be on the Twins\u2019 playoff roster before he\u2019d turned 23 or played a regular-season MLB game. It remains to be seen if he\u2019ll be the Opening Day left fielder, but he\u2019ll no doubt be a big part of the Twins\u2019 plans at some point in 2021 and projects as an impact bat long term.\n\nLarnach is another 23-year-old consensus top-100 prospect and left-handed-hitting corner outfielder who projects as a middle-of-the-order bat and is close to the majors. Rooker is older than Kirilloff or Larnach, and lacks their overall upside or defensive chops, but he\u2019s already gotten a taste of the majors and the right-handed slugger has elite raw power.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Twins could decide not to begin the season with any of those prospects in the lineup, starting them in the minors for development reasons or service-time suppression. Even in that scenario, they have Cave and LaMonte Wade available to keep left field warm until the inevitable call-ups, or they can invest some of the money saved on Rosario to add a different veteran stopgap.\n\n(Top photo: Brace Hemmelgarn / Minnesota Twins / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2022/06/07/gary-sanchez-trade-yankees-twins-stats-josh-donaldson/7540460001/", "page_content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 As breakups go, this wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad one.\n\nWith the New York Yankees and Gary Sanchez, the tough part was always about how to make it work.\n\nBy the end, everything seemed forced.\n\nThe Yankees were putting up with Sanchez\u2019s substandard defense because of his offensive upside, but ultimately that reasoning collapsed.\n\nWith a .187 batting average, .698 OPS and soaring strikeout rate over his final two Yankees seasons, even the staunchest Sanchez advocates had to acknowledge the burden of his presence in pinstripes.\n\nAn ever-present cloud around the Yankees was lifted with Sanchez\u2019s trade to the Minnesota Twins. In turn, moving beyond the Bronx might have been the best thing for Sanchez\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u2019\u2019 Sanchez said through an interpreter, when asked if the change of scenery had been personally beneficial.\n\n\u201cI got traded and then I got this opportunity.\u2019\u2019\n\nAppearing relaxed and sporting a beard \u2013 something he could never do in pinstripes \u2013 Sanchez was in the Twins\u2019 lineup at catcher Tuesday night, preparing to play against the Yankees for the first time.\n\nYankees at Twins:If you're betting, here are odds, pitching matchups & predictions\n\nA happier place\n\nNever the most quotable of players, it\u2019s still difficult to gauge how much of a weight was lifted from Sanchez becoming an ex-Yankee.\n\nSanchez, 29, was a teenager when he signed with the Yankees, and he stayed in the organization for 11 seasons, right up to the start of his free agent walk year.\n\n\u201cI think it was a good trade for him,\u2019\u2019 said infielder Gio Urshela, who sees Sanchez having a better chance of maxing out his potential in Minnesota.\n\nOn March 13, Urshela was sent with Sanchez to the Twins, in exchange for infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa, catcher Ben Rortvedt, third baseman Josh Donaldson and the $50 million remaining on Donaldson\u2019s contract.\n\nUrshela found the late-night trade \u201cconfusing\u2019\u2019 at first, since that was the day manager Aaron Boone had announced that Urshela was his starting shortstop.\n\nThat was never going to fly in the Bronx, where Urshela was much better suited at third base.\n\nKiner-Falefa isn\u2019t a Gold Glove-caliber shortstop, but he has solidified a position that wasn\u2019t nearly as stable with Gleyber Torres last season.\n\nBetter balance\n\nAnd once GM Brian Cashman swung another trade with the Texas Rangers to get Jose Trevino, the Yankees finally became untethered from their obsession with offense-oriented catchers.\n\nThe tandem between Trevino and Kyle Higashioka \u2013 plus a much more stable team defense overall \u2013 has greatly contributed to the Yankees\u2019 MLB-leading 2.74 ERA entering Tuesday.\n\nSanchez arrived at this series batting .229 with seven homers, 27 RBI and a .735 OPS in 43 games, essentially splitting time between catcher and designated hitter.\n\nWith an OPS-plus of 114, this is Sanchez\u2019s best offensive season since 2019, and there isn\u2019t the constant drumbeat about his defensive shortcomings on the AL Central-leading Twins.\n\nAs his manager during the previous four seasons, Aaron Boone said he \u201cfelt like I sat up here defending\u2019\u2019 Sanchez constantly.\n\nYet, \u201cno matter what he was going through, he was always a great teammate.

They are growing up. They know more about life and also some people,\u201d Berrios said, predicting the greatest difficulty for 7-year-old daughter Valentina.\n\nSoon-to-be-5-year-old Sebastian and 3-year-old Diego had grown fond of Minneapolis and their friends there, too.\n\nBerrios, drafted 32nd overall by the Twins in 2012, debuted with Minnesota in 2015. Though Puerto Rico was their home, he and his wife, Jannieliz, became strongly rooted in the community. He worked hard to be able to speak English effectively. Berrios felt strongly enough about the Twins that he asked the team\u2019s senior director of communications, Dustin Morse, to arrange a farewell Zoom session with reporters.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got your first team or your first time in everything, that\u2019s where I made my MLB debut, so it\u2019s going to be in my heart all my life,\u201d Berrios said from St. Louis, where he had been scheduled to start a three-game series against the Cardinals.\n\nInstead, the playoff-chasing Blue Jays won the aggressive pursuit for the two-time All-Star, who was one of the most attractive players available on the market. They parted with infielder/outfielder Austin Martin and right-hander Simeon Woods Richardson for the 27-year-old Berrios.\n\nBlue Jays general manager Ross Atkins called it \u201ca fair assessment\u201d that Berrios was one of Toronto\u2019s top deadline targets.\n\n\u201cWe felt as though the value was worth it,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cThe opportunity to acquire Berrios was exciting for us and a very difficult decision, not something that we just walked into. Austin Martin will be a great player and Simeon Woods Richardson is going to be a great pitcher, and we\u2019re going to be pulling for them. This was just an opportunity that we wanted to take.\n\n\u201cWe knew the price was going to be high,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cWorking through our system with not only the Twins but with other teams, there were clear targets that the entire industry was focused on. Fortunately, we had enough of them to meet the mark.\u201d\n\nLeft-handed reliever Brad Hand, traded from Washington to Toronto in a deal Thursday, was excited to see Berrios join him north of the border.\n\n\u201cI spent two and a half years in Cleveland so I saw him a lot in Minnesota,\u201d Hand said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great pitcher, a guy that can really carry a pitching staff at times. That was a big add to get here.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Jays began the day at 51-48, in the fifth spot chasing two AL wild-card slots with a 4 1/2-game deficit to make up.\n\n\u201cWe believe we haven\u2019t played our best baseball yet,\u201d Atkins said.\u201d Hopefully those days are here upon us.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, Toronto acquired right-hander Joakim Soria from Arizona for two players to be named.\n\nBerrios was 7-5 with a 3.48 ERA in 20 starts for the Twins this season, their unquestioned ace who has been as durable as any pitcher in the game and remains under team control through the 2022 season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about next year, too,\u201d Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said. \u201cA guy like Berrios is one of the best starters in baseball. And now we\u2019ve got control over him next year also.\u201d\n\nThe sadness of leaving Minnesota aside, the opportunity to return to a postseason race will help stem the blow a bit for Berrios.\n\n\u201cThey are competing and trying to get that push to the playoffs. I\u2019m so happy to be part of that, and I\u2019m going to put myself in the best position to help that team to make that this year,\u201d he said.\n\nBerrios has struck out 126 in 121 2/3 innings this season and held opponents to a .213 batting average. He was 55-43 with a 4.08 ERA in his career with Minnesota.\n\nDealing Berrios will set a struggling rotation back even further in the short term, but the Twins had leverage, with so many teams seeking high-end starting pitching. Minnesota decided to hasten the reset process for 2022 and beyond after this disappointing season on the heels of two straight AL Central titles.\n\n\u201cWe were setting a high bar for a lot of these conversations,\u201d president of baseball operations Derek Falvey said after the deadline passed.\n\nThe 22-year-old Martin hit .281 with a .424 on-base percentage and scored 43 runs in 55 games for Double-A New Hampshire. This is his first pro season after being drafted fifth overall in 2020 out of Vanderbilt, where he helped win the College World Series in 2019. Martin was ranked this year by MLB.com as the second-best prospect in Toronto\u2019s system and the 16th-best prospect in the minor leagues. He played for the American League in the All-Star Futures Games this month at Coors Field. That AL side was managed by Twins special assistant LaTroy Hawkins.\n\nThe 20-year-old Woods Richardson was 2-4 with a 5.76 ERA in 11 starts for Double-A New Hampshire. Listed 68th overall in MLB.com\u2019s prospect rankings, Woods Richardson is now playing for the United States in the Olympics in Tokyo with fellow pitcher Joe Ryan, who was acquired by the Twins last week in a trade that sent slugger Nelson Cruz to Tampa Bay. Woods Richardson was a second-round draft pick in 2018 by the New York Mets, who dealt him to Toronto in the trade for pitcher Marcus Stroman in 2019.\n\nThe Twins also traded two other pitchers on deadline day, sending starter J.A. Happ to St. Louis and reliever Hansel Robles to Boston.\n\nBerrios was one of the few homegrown pitchers the Twins had successfully drafted and developed over the last two decades, but they\u2019d been unable to secure him to a long-term contract and weren\u2019t prepared to try to outbid for him on the open market if he were to reach free agency next year. So they took advantage of his hot market this summer and took another step toward restocking.\n\nWith Ryan, Woods Richardson and Drew Strotman, who was also recently acquired from the Rays for Cruz, the Twins have three more viable options for their future rotation.\n\nOne player the Twins hung onto was oft-injured center fielder Byron Buxton, whom they\u2019ve also not yet been able to sign to an extension. Falvey said the Twins received plenty of interest in the multi-skilled Buxton, but not enough to warrant moving him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to continue to focus right now on him getting as healthy as possible, get him back on the field, and getting him playing for us,\u201d Falvey said."}, {"url": "https://www.nj.com/yankees/2022/03/gary-sanchez-gio-urhsela-react-to-yankees-twins-trade.html", "page_content": "For Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela, Monday was the first day of the rest of their lives.\n\nThe former New York Yankees stars were sent to the Minnesota Twins on Sunday night in a blockbuster five-player trade.\n\nBut according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, both players are taking the trade in stride.\n\nSanchez: \u201cIt just happened real quick. Phone calls everywhere. I was happy by the news. When I thought about it, I was happy that I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m going to represent Minnesota.\u201d\n\nUrshela: \u201cComing with Gary, it\u2019s a lot of confidence. I know a couple of players here. I know it\u2019s a really good organization with a lot of really good people here.\u201d\n\nSanchez also tweeted a goodbye message Tuesday morning:\n\nThank you New York. Thank you to the Yankees organization, its front office, coaches and my ex-teammates. Thank you to the fans and Yankee Stadium employees. I take with me a part of you.
