In fact, not to mince words, I think he was a dreadful character. I can't understand how he could have become so popular.\"\n\n(Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS)\n\nAfter Minder, he appeared in the BBC drama New Tricks, releasing his The World Was My Lobster memoir in his final years.\n\nSadly, in August 2015, he died in hospital at the age of 90 after suffering a short illness.\n\nHis former co-star, Dennis Waterman, gave a eulogy at his funeral and was permitted to visit him in his final days.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror in 2015, Dennis remembered his friend, saying: \"He was an amazing man, a wonderful actor and besotted with his family.\n\n\"Farewell old friend.\"\n\nDennis Waterman\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPlaying Terry McCann for most of the series, Dennis Waterman shocked fans when he unexpectedly left the role in the early 90s.\n\nThe actor, 73, decided to throw in the towel as the character had done \"everything he could do,\" according to the Minder fan-site.\n\nDennis' vocals could be heard on the theme tune, \"I Could Be So Good for You,\" with the track climbing the charts in the UK.\n\nAfter Minder, he went on to land a main role in BBC's New Tricks and was frequently parodied by Matt Lucas and David Walliams on Little Britain.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Ima)\n\nHis latest work was a 2020 Australian drama-comedy film titled Never Too Late, which told the story of four former prisoners of war.\n\nDennis' daughter, Hannah Waterman, has followed in his footsteps, famously playing Laura Beale on EastEnders in the early noughties.\n\nMarried four times, Dennis sparked controversy in 2012 when he admitted to hitting his former wife Rula Lenska during an interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.\n\nHe said: \"It's not difficult for a woman to make a man hit her. She certainly wasn't a beaten wife, she was hit and that's different.\"\n\nDivorcing Dennis in 1998 after 11 years of marriage, Rula is known to many as Coronation Street's Claudia Colby.\n\nGlynn Edwards\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nGlynn Edwards brought barman Dave Harris to life on Minder, looking the other way when dodgy dealings took place in the boozer.\n\nHe reluctantly became a message service for Arthur, pulling pints throughout nearly 100 episodes at the members-only Winchester Club.\n\nSpeaking about the role in an interview with the Express, he said: \"Playing Dave in Minder was my biggest TV role. Amazingly, it was just one day's work initially, and seeing the script made me realise why: there was only a couple of lines to say.\n\n\"My agent persuaded me to accept it, explaining that the part may grow and, of course, it did. One strange thing about the character is that he didn't have a surname initially.\"\n\nAfter a long and illustrious career as an actor, Glynn suddenly retired after Minder finished airing in the mid-90s.\n\nStepping out of the spotlight, he spent the rest of his life between his homes in Scotland and Spain.\n\nSadly, at the age of 87, he died in his Edinburgh home on May 23, 2018, with Minder fans mourning his legacy as Dave the Barman.\n\nHis cause of death was never reported.\n\nGlynn was survived by his third wife, Valerie Edwards, and his son from his second marriage to Benny Hill girl Christine Pilgrim.\n\nPatrick Malahide\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nTrying to govern the unruly crooks of Minder's West London, Patrick Malahide played the role of stern Detective Sergeant Albert Chisholm.\n\nEarning the nickname \"Cheerful Charlie,\" the 75-year-old was a regular on the series for nine years.\n\nThe role catapulted him to success, and he went on to appear in James Bond flick The World Is Not Enough in the late 90s.\n\nGame of Thrones fans will know him best as Balon Greyjoy, the father of Theon Greyjoy in the hit HBO drama Game Of Thrones.\n\nWith a clear knack for fantasy roles, he went on to play Magnus Crome in the 2018 film Mortal Engines.\n\n(Image: BBC/Des Willie)\n\nSpeaking to What's On TV, Patrick admitted taxi drivers always recognise him for his role on Minder, though younger fans know him best from Game Of Thrones.\n\nHe told the publication: \"When I get in the back of a cab I'm usually asked what was it like working with George Cole. If I had a quid for every time I was asked that! He was a lovely man.\n\n\"I was sad, but very pleased to be able to go to his funeral last year.

Is there anything he can hold hostage to bait the thief?"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/26/david-collings-obituary", "page_content": "After a spectacular start to his television career in the 1960s, when he played leading roles in two classics by Dostoevsky, the actor David Collings, who has died aged 79, became a cult favourite of sci-fi fans with weird appearances in UFO (produced by the Thunderbirds team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson), three Doctor Who sagas and the 1979 supernatural detective series Sapphire and Steel, co-starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum.\n\nAlthough he started out on the stage, Collings did not consolidate his reputation there until completing more than a decade of television stardom, after which he was in a string of important roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nAt the Open Air theatre in Regent\u2019s Park he was a genuinely funny Polonius opposite newcomer Damian Lewis\u2019s firebrand Hamlet in 1994, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith; he had first played a tetchy but benignly well-meaning Polonius for an RSC touring production with Philip Franks in 1987.\n\nCollings was a fine featured, red-haired actor with sensitive blue eyes who was equally good at playing neurotic and sweet-natured characters. On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/is-itvs-innocent-based-on-a-true-story-22869217", "page_content": "Following in the footsteps of A Mother's Son, ITV have queued up another brilliant \"whodunnit?\" drama from their vault to air during lockdown. Innocent, a four-episode mini-series, will be re-released on May 4, two years after it originally aired. Featuring an all-star cast, Innocent sees recently acquitted David Collins leave prison after seven years inside for the murder of his wife Tara. Though he protests his innocence, David is still despised family and friends. As you can expect, it's a tense watch, and one that may leave you wondering whether ITV's Innocent is based on a true story?\n\nSurprisingly, no. Although the plot read like a harrowing news story, Innocent isn't inspired by one single event. The series was written by screenwriters Chris Lang and Matt Arlidge, who appear to have drawn inspiration from a number of different real-life situations.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Drama Quarterly, Arlidge said reading news articles about \"miscarriages of justice\" led them to \"think about the impact of those judgments and the consequences for the families involved.\" He went on:\n\n\"If David\u2019s telling the truth, it means there\u2019s a killer out there. There\u2019s someone who\u2019s killed and got away with it, and that\u2019s something we were always interested in exploring. On the one hand, what\u2019s it like to be imprisoned for a crime you didn\u2019t commit? But conversely, if you did commit murder and get away with it and lived with it for eight years, what\u2019s that like?\u201d\n\nIt's a harrowing thought but one the writers' explore skilfully in the acclaimed ITV drama. Filmed both in Malahide in Ireland and on the South Downs in England, Innocent stars Lee Ingleby as David and Cold Feet's Hermoine Norris as Alice, the sister of David's late wife. It also stars someone\n\nNow, without sharing any spoilers, Innocent comes to a dramatic and fairly conclusive end, leading some to think the series would be \"one-off.\" However, after the finale in 2018, Lang tweeted: \u201cVery pleasantly surprised to learn today that #Innocent was the most watched new drama across all channels this year. Hmmm. I wonder if we could interest an audience in a completely new #Innocent story? I wonder\u2026\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Radio Times confirmed that writers were working on a second series. \"While the story of Tara Collins\u2019 murder is over, writer Chris Lang has revealed that he working on another series of Innocent with brand-new characters and a new story,\" the publication wrote.\n\nFilming for the second series was supposed to start early this year, but it looks like filming will be delayed due to the COVID-10 pandemic. Until then, we at least get to see the first series play out again in 2020."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/David-Collings", "page_content": "David Collings (born 4 June 1940) is an English actor.

He was 74 years old.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to announce that our beloved Dennis passed away very peacefully at his home in Spain,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe family kindly ask that our privacy is respected at this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nBeginning his career at the age of 12 with a role in the film Night Train For Inverness, Waterman\u2019s career spanned over 60 years. As well as Minder and New Tricks, he also appeared in movies including Up The Junction and Scars Of Dracula, while he portrayed Detective Sergeant George Carter in the ITV police drama The Sweeney.\n\nHis last released project was the Australian film Never Too Late, which followed four former prisoners of war in their old age as they plotted to break out of the retirement facility they called home. The movie was released in 2020 and also starred James Cromwell and Jacki Weaver.\n\nWaterman was also a star of the stage, appearing in productions of My Fair Lady, Saratoga, Oliver!, and more.\n\nThe actor was immortalised in David Walliams and Matt Lucas\u2019 hit comedy series Little Britain in the noughties, with Walliams playing a caricature of the star who insists on singing the theme tune for any new project he is offered. In 2006, Waterman made a guest appearance in Comic Relief Does Little Britain Live, playing himself alongside Walliams\u2019 comedy version of him.\n\n\u201cI grew up watching Dennis Waterman\u2019s iconic performances in The Sweeney and Minder,\u201d Lucas wrote on Twitter following the news of his death. \u201cHis guest appearance in our Little Britain Live show at Hammersmith Apollo \u2013 in which he hilariously duetted with David\u2019s absurd impersonation of him \u2013 remains the absolute highlight of my career.\u201d\n\nI grew up watching Dennis Waterman's iconic performances in The Sweeney and Minder.

A brilliant actor who was a staple on our screens throughout the 70s and 80s. Loved The Sweeney. Loved Minder more. He was 74. My apologies for using the incorrect first name for Dennis in a previous tweet which I have deleted. pic.twitter.com/7j95qDXZCB \u2014 Kay Burley (@KayBurley) May 8, 2022\n\nDennis Waterman has left us.

Loved working with him in \u201cOn The Up\u201d over the three series we did. Such happy memories. Can\u2019t believe he\u2019s left us so soon. #OnTheUp #Minder #NewTricks #TheSweeney pic.twitter.com/8EsKXBa6uV \u2014 Judy Buxton \ud83d\udc99 (@JudyBuxton7) May 8, 2022\n\nSo sad to read this. Back in the 80s I spent a while managing a newsagents in Chiswick where John Thaw was a regular customer. More than once Dennis came in with him and they were always totally charming and good fun. #RIPDennisWatermanhttps://t.co/iullwhLjvo \u2014 Mike Godfrey (@uncletatty) May 8, 2022\n\nIt's a strange, unique sadness when a stranger dies, someone you only knew through a television screen.\n\nIt marks the passing of your own life, I guess, and a little bit of you leaves with them. Rest in peace, Dennis Waterman. \u2014 Joanna Cannon (@JoannaCannon) May 8, 2022"}]}
