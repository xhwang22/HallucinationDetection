He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal. Although he has won six titles at Arsenal, the coveted Premier League title has eluded him."}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-laurent-koscielny-pre-season-tour-transfers-312742", "page_content": "Arsenal touched down in the United States without captain Laurent Koscielny after the Frenchman refused to take part in their four-game pre-season tour.\n\nThe 33-year-old, angry at being denied a free transfer return to his homeland, is set to be stripped of the captaincy, with the club immediately opening disciplinary proceedings. Koscielny\u2019s decision to press the button marked \u2018player power\u2019 had been against \u201cclear instructions\u201d according to his employers.\n\nHis stance represents a big headache for the club\u2019s new technical director Edu, who was only appointed on Tuesday, as it directly affects already-complex transfer negotiations.\n\nArsenal\u2019s furious reaction\n\nWhile 29 of his team-mates were posing at Stansted Airport in front of the Emirates Airlines Boeing 777 that was to take them across the Atlantic Koscielny was training at the club\u2019s London Colney base.\n\nArsenal\u2019s US tour fixtures Colorado Rapids (16 Jul)\n\nBayern Munich (18 Jul)\n\nFiorentina (20 Jul)\n\nReal Madrid (24 Jul)\n\nThat was to avoid being in complete breach of a contract that has one year still to run and that the player had repeatedly asked to be terminated so he could take up one of three offers to return to his native France.\n\nArsenal were quick to release a statement of condemnation after the defender made it clear on Thursday morning that he was prepared to play hardball over his future by refusing to fly.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed by Laurent\u2019s actions, which are against our clear instructions,\u201d it read. \u201cWe hope to resolve this matter and will not be providing any further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nThat stance pleased many Arsenal fans, who felt betrayed by a player who has worn their colours for almost exactly nine years and remained a key figure on his return from a serious Achilles tendon injury that prevented him from helping his country win the 2018 World Cup.\n\nSympathy for Koscielny\n\nSome were able to appreciate the player\u2019s position however. The player has offers from three French clubs of contracts in excess of the length of his current deal which, given his age and injury record, would have been unlikely to be extended anyway. None of the trio was prepared to pay a fee, for precisely those reasons, however.\n\nBordeaux, Rennes and Lyon are understood to be the clubs in question, with Bordeaux offering the veteran two seasons with an option of a further 12 months.\n\nKoscielny decided such a prospect was worth fighting for but Arsenal, who will play Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in two of their Trans-Atlantic fixtures, had already adopted a similar stubborn approach.\n\nRebuild needed\n\nThat was because rebuilding the defence is the number one priority for manager Unai Emery and the Gunners were adamant Koscielny should honour his contract to smooth the process.\n\nArsenal have been busy negotiating a \u00a325m deal for St Etienne defender William Saliba but that would see the 18-year-old loaned back for a season.\n\nEmery has also been hoping to offload Germany international Shkodran Mustafi \u2013 a move that would delight many fans \u2013 but Koscielny\u2019s actions may now have scuppered hopes of that.\n\nThe Gunners are also trying to coax Crystal Palace into parting with Wilfried Zaha, with centre-back Calum Chambers a potential makeweight to get the price down for buyers who were unable to make a single permanent signing during the previous transfer window.\n\nArsenal have been bullishly upfront about an incident other clubs might have tried to cover up, but it nonetheless reinforces the impression that the club, and Edu in particular, have a lot of negotiating to do before the new Premier League season begins."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48948345", "page_content": "Koscielny has played 353 times for the Gunners and won the FA Cup in 2013-14 and 2014-15\n\nArsenal captain Laurent Koscielny has refused to travel on the club's pre-season tour of the US.\n\nThe 33-year-old France defender is out of contract at the end of the 2019-20 season and is a reported target for French clubs Bordeaux, Rennes and Lyon.\n\n\"We are very disappointed by Laurent's actions, which are against our clear instructions,\" said Arsenal.\n\n\"We hope to resolve this matter and will not be providing any further comment at this time.\"\n\nBordeaux have reportedly offered Koscielny a three-year deal.\n\nThe central defender joined Arsenal in the summer of 2010 for a fee of around \u00a310m.\n\nA frustration that had been brewing for some time -

hence the contract talks - missing out exacerbated his misgivings and led him to decide the time had come to move back to France.\n\nOn returning from a summer break and with firm interest from clubs in his homeland, Koscielny informed Arsenal of his wish to leave and hoped his nine years of service and professionalism until this point would help achieve an amicable resolution.\n\nHowever, Arsenal rejected the request and made it clear that they need and expect the Frenchman to honour his contract and be a key part of their squad in the coming campaign.\n\nEmery is said to be furious with Koscielny's refusal to go to the USA\n\nGiven that head coach Unai Emery was happy with Koscielny's performance in 2018-19 and already faces other issues in central defence, the view was that he could only go if a bid landed that reflected his value and importance to Arsenal.\n\nKoscielny argues that Arsenal are reneging on an agreement that would allow him exit as a free agent during the current transfer window, something the Gunners strenuously deny.\n\nHe is also thinks Arsenal have - or will receive - an \"acceptable\" offer, but some privy to the proposal admit that \"acceptable\" is subjective and others insist there is nothing on table.\n\nWhen Koscielny told Emery in a face-to-face meeting on Wednesday morning that he would not be joining the team on their pre-season tour to the USA, the Spaniard was furious.\n\nArsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi later sent Koscielny a message expressing bitter disappointment and warning the player that not travelling would be in breach of contract.\n\nKoscielny replied emphasising his stance and on arrival at Arsenal's London Colney training ground on Thursday morning the captain confirmed he would not be boarding the flight.\n\nHe will be required to train alongside the players who are not on the America trip -

If Koscielny is stripped of the armband, or if he gets his wish and leaves the club, then Emery's options are limited.\n\nThe Spaniard named a captaincy group of five players last season, Koscielny being one of them, but of the other four, Petr Cech and Aaron Ramsey are gone and Mesut Ozil's future is uncertain. That leaves Granit Xhaka as the only logical option, although the Swiss international is not universally popular among supporters.\n\nCould Emery look elsewhere? There are few standout candidates. Nacho Monreal has the experience having been at the club since 2013, but his place in the team is far from guaranteed. Sokratis could be seen as captaincy material, but he has only been at the club for a single season. Hector Bellerin, an Arsenal player since 2011, might be a left field alternative.\n\nIt is another conundrum for Emery in what's turning into a difficult summer."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48948345", "page_content": "Koscielny has played 353 times for the Gunners and won the FA Cup in 2013-14 and 2014-15\n\nArsenal captain Laurent Koscielny has refused to travel on the club's pre-season tour of the US.\n\nThe 33-year-old France defender is out of contract at the end of the 2019-20 season and is a reported target for French clubs Bordeaux, Rennes and Lyon.\n\n\"We are very disappointed by Laurent's actions, which are against our clear instructions,\" said Arsenal.\n\n\"We hope to resolve this matter and will not be providing any further comment at this time.\"\n\nBordeaux have reportedly offered Koscielny a three-year deal.\n\nThe central defender joined Arsenal in the summer of 2010 for a fee of around \u00a310m.\n\nA frustration that had been brewing for some time - analysis\n\nBBC Sport's David Ornstein\n\nTowards the end of last season, Arsenal and Koscielny were in negotiations over a contract extension - most likely for an additional year on top of his remaining 12 months.\n\nThe conversation was progressing positively but then Arsenal were beaten by Chelsea in the Europa League final, a result that has had major repercussions for the Gunners.\n\nAs well as causing significant damage to their recruitment plans and possibilities, it also changed certain situations regarding existing players and none more so than Koscielny.\n\nThe 33-year-old is understood to have become increasingly discontent since his return in December from an Achilles injury, primarily over the management of his playing schedule and the direction in which he feels the team and club are moving.\n\nWhile Koscielny was optimistic that Champions League qualification could lead to a better future for both parties - hence the contract talks - missing out exacerbated his misgivings and led him to decide the time had come to move back to France.\n\nOn returning from a summer break and with firm interest from clubs in his homeland, Koscielny informed Arsenal of his wish to leave and hoped his nine years of service and professionalism until this point would help achieve an amicable resolution.\n\nHowever, Arsenal rejected the request and made it clear that they need and expect the Frenchman to honour his contract and be a key part of their squad in the coming campaign.\n\nEmery is said to be furious with Koscielny's refusal to go to the USA\n\nGiven that head coach Unai Emery was happy with Koscielny's performance in 2018-19 and already faces other issues in central defence, the view was that he could only go if a bid landed that reflected his value and importance to Arsenal.\n\nKoscielny argues that Arsenal are reneging on an agreement that would allow him exit as a free agent during the current transfer window, something the Gunners strenuously deny.\n\nHe is also thinks Arsenal have - or will receive - an \"acceptable\" offer, but some privy to the proposal admit that \"acceptable\" is subjective and others insist there is nothing on table.\n\nWhen Koscielny told Emery in a face-to-face meeting on Wednesday morning that he would not be joining the team on their pre-season tour to the USA, the Spaniard was furious.\n\nArsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi later sent Koscielny a message expressing bitter disappointment and warning the player that not travelling would be in breach of contract.\n\nKoscielny replied emphasising his stance and on arrival at Arsenal's London Colney training ground on Thursday morning the captain confirmed he would not be boarding the flight.\n\nHe will be required to train alongside the players who are not on the America trip - mainly youngsters - with disciplinary proceedings under way to determine his punishment.\n\nArsenal officials are fuming about the situation, which from a sporting perspective gives them a headache in central defence - an area they were already looking to strengthen this window.\n\nThey were thought to be close to completing the 30m euros signing of William Saliba from Saint-Etienne, with plans to loan the 18-year-old back to the Ligue 1 side for the entirety of next season.\n\nBut in a dramatic twist on Friday, Tottenham reignited their interest in Saliba and were pushing hard to complete the transfer from under the noses of Arsenal.\n\nMeanwhile, Rob Holding is recovering from a knee injury and there are concerns over the development and readiness of Konstantinos Mavropanos to provide a credible option.\n\nArsenal are keen to sell Shkodran Mustafi but the German is under contract until 2021 and has no desire to depart."}, {"url": "https://www.walikali.com/laurent-koscielny/", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny is a professional football player from France.

He was born on the 10th of September, 1985 in Tulle. Koscielny is a center back who is currently the vice-captain of the English Premier League team Arsenal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman began his career with Guingamp in 2004 which has produced players like Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Koscielny played as a fullback for Guingamp in most of the matches.However, he felt that center back was his forte and this made him join Tours FC to take a chance at center back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his debut season with Tours FC in 2007, Koscielny showed remarkable progress and played a major role in his team\u2019s promotion to Ligue 1. He was also named in the best XI of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back continued his good form with Lorient FC in 2009 where he was regarded as one of the best players in his position. He was developing reputation as a clever and an agile defender. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\n\n\n\n\nDebut\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurent Koscielny had the opportunity to represent Poland but decided to ply his trade with France. He made his first appearance for France on the 9th of February, 2011 in a friendly match against United States. Koscielny played the entire game and his side sealed a 1-0 victory. On the 4th of June, 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise to Glory\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny had a great debut season with Arsenal. He was constantly making great tackles and preventing the opposition from penetrating their back line. In 2011, Koscielny had one of his best performances till date that saw Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1 in the round of 16 Champions League tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman was a great asset to the team as apart from acting as a defender, he had a great goal scoring ability. Till date, Koscielny has scored 24 goals for Arsenal. He is the highest scoring defender for Arsenal in the history of EPL. He is regarded as one of the most important players for Arsenal in the past seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He has also won the FA Community Shield in 2014, 2015 and 2017. The center back has made a major contribution in his team\u2019s success in the FA Cup over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow Points\n\n\n\n\n\nKoscielny has got more than thirty yellow cards and as many as five red cards. This has forced him out of a few crucial encounters and has affected the team\u2019s performance. He has missed more games due to suspension and not because of injury.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center back must work on preventing harsh tackles so as to represent Arsenal in more and more games and increase their chances of winning more trophies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frenchman is yet to win the Premier League with Arsenal.

We need a dependable established centre-back and look whom he\u2019s brought in!\u201d\n\nThese were all the questions/statements that were raised/made when he joined from Lorient in the summer of 2010. And suffice to say not one has been left unattended.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Laurent Koscielny, the dynamic Arsenal defender. And how Arsene Wenger, despite being under such immense pressure in recent seasons, still has the innate quality to unearth a gem from places no one else\u2019s sight reaches.\n\nAnd so arrived Koscielny, with a hefty price tag of \u00a310 million (for a player of his reputation at that time). From there on, there was no looking back, and his inexorable journey from being a French third-tier player to becoming a first-choice for Arsenal and a French international is what this encomium will highlight.\n\nThe beginning of his Arsenal career was not so smooth, to put it mildly. Joe Cole, an otherwise clean player, took the responsibility of welcoming him to the league with a reckless tackle which meant he had to be carried off. Cole was shown red, and the half-time whistle was blown.\n\nThankfully, he returned in the second half only to be sent off himself for a \u2018deliberate\u2019 hand ball. The match ended with some serious questions being asked about the physical prowess of the new capture. Koscielny answered them with his actions on the field.\n\nHe slowly started getting accustomed to the league and its physical nature, and soon started receiving the plaudits for his immaculate performances. Performances which were usually marred by a mistake, every now-and-then, the most noticeable one coming in the Carling Cup final which led to Arsenal missing out on perhaps their easiest chance of ending the ever-so-hyped trophy-drought.\n\nThe media and the fans alike were quick to pounce upon him, and the tag of a talented but error-prone player was bestowed upon him. To recover from such a scarring incident shows majestic character and mental strength, something which our manager emphasises upon a lot.\n\nBut, in between his first season came a match which showed Koscielny had the weaponry in his \u2018arsenal\u2019 to make the very best look like amateurs. In the Champions League match against Barcelona, he kept Lionel Messi, a player every defender on the planet fears, in his pocket for the entire match.\n\nHis positioning was immaculate, and so was his reading of the game. He shrugged off Messi as if he was a nobody. Never had I seen Messi so helpless for the entirety of a match before this, which was enough to suggest signing Laurent was the biggest magic trick Arsene had pulled off in recent years.\n\nHe still lacked consistency to be considered amongst the top defenders in England. But such has been the progress of the player, he now is, in my humble opinion, one of the very best ball-playing defenders Europe currently has.\n\nHis countless interceptions and last-ditch tackles is second to none and his stats show nothing to suggest otherwise. He also possesses the knack of scoring goals at the other end with the ones against Man City, Bayern, Newcastle and West Brom(2011-12 season) showing how vital they\u2019ve been.\n\nTo put it in one line, he\u2019s a calm player having very nimble feet, who anticipates the game shrewdly, is tenacious and fearless in a tackle, is expeditious in possession and a defensive stalwart who\u2019s managed to add consistency to his game with persistent hard work.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Tony Adams says, \u201cHe reminds me a lot of Martin Keown. He\u2019s very tenacious. I hate labelling people because Martin Keown was one of the best we\u2019ve ever had. To put Koscielny in the same category(of Keown) is an enormous compliment I think.\u201d\n\nAnd that reason is why he has become one of the most important(yet hugely underrated) players at the club within the span of three years, and rigorously pursued by Barcelona and Bayern in this transfer market. And that reason is why this article pays a tribute to one of the best \u201crags to riches\u201d story of modern times.\n\nPaul Merson predicts the result of Man City vs Inter UEFA Champions League final!

He is vice-captain of Arsenal.\n\nBorn in Tulle, Koscielny began his football career playing for a host of youth clubs before moving to Guingamp in 2003, where he quickly progressed through the youth ranks, making his professional debut the following season. After becoming frustrated at being played out of position as a right back, he joined Tours for an undisclosed fee, quickly establishing himself as the team\u2019s star player in his desired position, ultimately aiding in the club\u2019s promotion into Ligue 1, while also being named in the Ligue 2 Team of the Season.[3] Koscielny continued his impressive performances following a \u20ac1.7 million transfer to fellow French outfit Lorient in 2009, receiving multiple plaudits for his performances, largely cultivating a reputation as a clever, agile, ball-playing defender.[3] His achievements and footballing potential attracted Arsenal, ultimately moving to the Premier League side for a fee of \u00a38.45 million the following season.\n\nFollowing his arrival to England, Koscielny has widely been regarded to be one of the best players in his position, as well as one of the best in the world.[4][5] He has since established himself as a core component in the Arsenal first team, as well as contributing with a host of individual performances, including aiding in ending the club\u2019s nine-year trophy drought, scoring a crucial equalizer en route to winning the FA Cup in 2014. He was also crucial in further club successes that followed, winning another two FA Cups and the FA Community Shield on three occasions.\n\nDespite having the ability to represent Poland, Koscielny instead decided to represent France, and first appeared up for the national team against Brazil in February 2011.[6] Koscielny has since become a regular starter for the nation in every major tournament that they have appeared in, including UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while also leading France to the final of UEFA Euro 2016. He scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland in 2016,[7] and has since amassed forty-nine appearances for the national side.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Koscielny announced that he would be retiring from international football after the competition, and thus no longer be playing for France.\n\nKoscielny was born in Tulle, Corr\u00e8ze. His career began in 2004 with Guingamp, a team that had produced such talents as Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda. Three years later, Koscielny was forced to take stock and drop down to the French third tier. He made 47 appearances for Guingamp, between 2004 and 2007, mostly as a right fullback.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, Koscielny joined Tours FC, deciding that he wanted a chance at centre back. He showed remarkable improvement in aerial ability and positional awareness that limited him to just three yellow cards. During the 2008\u201309 season, Koscielny made 34 Ligue 2 appearances, scoring 5 goals from defence, and was named in the division\u2019s best XI at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal confirmed the signing on 7 July 2010 and Koscielny was handed the club\u2019s number 6 shirt, previously worn by Philippe Senderos, who had moved to Fulham earlier in the summer. Wenger explained he bought Koscielny due to the fact he added height to the team and Arsenal were low on centre backs.[10] Koscielny made his debut against Barnet in a pre-season friendly in July 2010. One month later in his competitive debut against Liverpool at Anfield, he was sent off in the 94th minute for a second bookable offence. Both of his yellow cards were shown beyond 90 minutes. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both teams having debut players sent off.[11] He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 11 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 win against Bolton Wanderers.[12]\n\nKoscielny made his debut in European competition on 15 September 2010, when he partnered S\u00e9bastien Squillaci in a 6\u20130 win over Braga at the Emirates Stadium. Koscielny was praised for performances against Sunderland and made a brilliant tackle against Tottenham Hotspur to stop Aaron Lennon from scoring during their Football League Cup tie. On 27 October, he blocked a shot off the line and provided an assist to Theo Walcott against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the League Cup, where Arsenal went on to win the match 4\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park. Koscielny was given a straight red card in Arsenal\u2019s 0\u20131 loss at home against Newcastle United on 7 November 2010. This was his second sending off of the season.\n\nKoscielny playing for Arsenal on 10 September 2011 against Swansea City.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Koscielny scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 win over Ipswich Town in the League Cup semi-final second leg win at the Emirates Stadium. Throughout January 2011, Koscielny and Johan Djourou were a part of a defence that did not concede a goal in the Premier League. On 1 February, he scored his third goal of the season, which proved to be the winner in a 2\u20131 turn around victory over Everton. Koscielny had arguably his best performance to date for Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16 match against Barcelona. The match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Arsenal. Koscielny\u2019s performances were applauded and praised in many media reports of the game. Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown, said his performance was \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201cmagnificent throughout\u201d.[13] On 27 February, in the last minute of the 2011 Football League Cup Final, Koscielny was involved in a mix-up with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, which resulted in Birmingham City striker Obafemi Martins scoring the winning goal.[14]\n\n2011\u201312 season\n\nKoscielny and Fernando Torres in a Premier League match on 21 April 2012.\n\nKoscielny started the 2011\u201312 season alongside Thomas Vermaelen in central defence. Koscielny was injured and taken off the pitch 10 minutes into a 2\u20130 home loss to Liverpool on 20 August 2011. However, he returned to the starting line-up Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever Premier League defeat, losing 8\u20132 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. On 17 September, Koscielny scored an own goal as Arsenal lost 4\u20133 to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League. He went on to be named man of the match away at Olympique Marseille in the Champions League, where Arsenal won 1\u20130 at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, keeping their first clean sheet in a Champions League away game since 18 August 2009 against Celtic, where the Gunners had won 2\u20130.\n\nOn 29 October, Koscielny received praise for his solid performance in Arsenal\u2019s 5\u20133 away win against Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 2 January 2012 in a 2\u20131 away defeat against Fulham. He scored his first Champions League goal against A.C.

His goal put Arsenal 2\u20130 ahead on the night and level at 3\u20133 on aggregate, but they still exited the competition on the away goals rule.[21]\n\nOn 19 May, Koscielny scored the winning goal as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1\u20130 at St James\u2019 Park in their final Premier League fixture of the season to secure a fourth-placed finish and qualification to the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League play-off round.[22]\n\nKoscielny was voted as Arsenal\u2019s second best player of the season.[23]\n\n2013\u201314 season\n\nKoscielny started the 2013\u201314 season by conceding a penalty and getting sent off in Arsenal\u2019s 3\u20131 Premier League opening day defeat at home to Aston Villa.[24] However, his partnership with Per Mertesacker saw the Gunners achieve the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League at the halfway point of the season, as the team topped the table.[25]\n\nOn 22 February 2014, Koscielny scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 defeat of Sunderland.[26] In the team\u2019s penultimate home match, Koscielny scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[26]\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Koscielny signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[27]\n\nOn 17 May, Koscielny scored Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as the team came from 2\u20130 down to defeat Hull City 3\u20132 in the 2014 FA Cup Final, winning his first piece of silverware with the club.[28]\n\n2014\u201315 season\n\nKoscielny and Kieran Gibbs playing for Arsenal in a match against Chelsea on 5 October 2014\n\nOn 16 August 2014, Koscielny opened his goal-scoring account for the season, scoring Arsenal\u2019s first goal in the 2014\u201315 Premier League. The goal was header from a free-kick in first half stoppage time against Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium.[29] After sustaining an achilles tendon injury during the October international break, Koscielny was absent from the Arsenal team for seven weeks.[30] On 29 November, he returned to Arsenal\u2019s starting line-up alongside Per Mertesacker in central defence, as the Gunners kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns.[31] In the team\u2019s following fixture at home to Southampton, Koscielny helped Arsenal to record a second consecutive clean sheet and 1\u20130 win.[32]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Koscielny scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Stoke City.[33] On 18 January, he started in central defence as Arsenal shut out defending champions Manchester City to win 2\u20130 at the City of Manchester Stadium.[34] On 10 February, he scored the opening goal as Arsenal defeated Leicester City 2\u20131.[35] On 30 May 2015, Koscielny was selected to start in the 2015 FA Cup Final, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4\u20130 defeat of Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium.[36]\n\n2015\u201316 season\n\nKoscielny started every game in the first month of the season, excluding a 0\u20130 draw with rivals Liverpool at Emirates Stadium,[37] due to an injury. Koscielny played a vital part as Arsenal won 5 games out of six in October to go second in the Premier League, with Koscielny scoring in successive Premier League wins against Everton and Swansea.[38][39] With manager Arsene Wenger opting to play Gabriel Paulista ahead of vice-captain Per Mertesacker, Koscielny began appearing as captain in February, due to injuries to other captains Santi Cazorla & Mikel Arteta. This ended after a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester United, when Koscielny missed four games through injury, including a North London derby at White Hart Lane.[40] He returned in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League, as Arsenal exited the competition at the round of 16 for the sixth season running.[41] Koscielny scored his fourth of the season in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham.[42]\n\n2016\u201317 season\n\nKoscielny started his first game of the season in a goalless draw against Leicester City.

Neither the perceived deliberate handball or offside offenses were deemed to be infringements and the goal was later correctly credited to Koscielny.[44][45][46] On 12 January 2017, Koscielny, alongside teammates Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud signed a new long-term contract with Arsenal.[47] Two days later, he made his 200th appearance for Arsenal in the Premier League on a 4\u20130 away victory against Swansea City.[48][49]\n\nOn the last day of the 2016\u201317 season he received red card for a tackle on Enner Valencia of Everton. Arsenal lost an appeal and Koscielny was banned for three games, meaning he would miss FA Cup final.[50]\n\nAlthough he was absent from the FA Cup final and the Community Shield, Koscielny lifted both trophies alongside Per Mertesacker.\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French national team on 3 February 2011. Before his call up for France, Koscielny was also eligible to play for Poland and initially considered applying for Polish citizenship.[6] In August 2010, it was reported that he had not submitted an application and cancelled a meeting with Poland national team coach Franciszek Smuda in Warsaw on 7 August. Koscielny later declared that his priority was to play for France.[53]\n\nKoscielny was called up to the French team for the first time on 3 February 2011, for the team\u2019s friendly versus Brazil on 9 February.[54][55] Koscielny made his first appearance for les Bleus in a friendly match against the United States on 11 November, playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 win.\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major tournament during UEFA Euro 2012, when he played the entire match in a 2\u20130 defeat to Spain in the quarter-finals but was voted Man of the Match by the French media. On 15 November 2013, he was sent off in a 2014 World Cup qualifying play-off against Ukraine.\n\nOn 13 May 2014, Koscielny was named in Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[56] He made his FIFA World Cup debut as a substitute for the injured Mamadou Sakho in a 5\u20132 defeat of Switzerland in the team\u2019s second group match.[57] He was then named in the starting line-up for the next match against Ecuador, helping the team to a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.[58] On 4 June 2016, Koscielny scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Scotland."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/koscielny-already-plotting-arsenal-exit-admits-former-chairman/1mj5ec05hwvwx1bz3qg8beu4xz", "page_content": "Laurent Koscielny has his exit from Arsenal planned out, with the defender intending to finish his career at Lorient.\n\nThe France international has been with the Gunners since 2010, when Arsene Wenger moved to snap up a relatively unknown talent for \u00a38.45 million.\n\nArsenal 4/6 for Terriers clean sheet\n\nKoscielny has been a model of consistency throughout his time in north London and is showing no sign of slowing down at the age of 32.\n\nHe penned a new contract with the Gunners in January, which is set to take him through to 2020, but there is a desire on his part to head home before hanging up his boots.\n\n\u201cHe told me last week in London that he wanted to finish his career at Lorient,\u201d president of the Ligue 1 outfit, Loic Fery, told Canal+ Sport .\n\nWith a deal in place at Emirates Stadium and plenty more football left in him yet, Lorient are aware that they are going to have to play a waiting game.\n\n\u201cI hope he has a few more years playing at Arsenal,\u201d added Fery.\n\nKoscielny previously spent just one year on the books at Lorient before being snapped up by Arsenal.\n\nHe had joined the club in 2009, but 40 appearances later his performances had earned him a move to England.\n\nLorient are currently competing in the second tier of French football, having suffered relegation last season, so will hope to have clambered back up the ladder by the time an opportunity to bring Koscielny back presents itself.\n\nFor now, the classy centre-half is fully focused on events at Arsenal, having reached 300 appearances for the club in memorable fashion with a derby victory over Tottenham."}, {"url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/5023394/arsenal-transfer-news-laurent-koscielny-lorient/", "page_content": "Defender is under contract at the Emirates until 2020 but Lorient chief says the star informed him last week of his desire to go back to the Ligue 1 side\n\nLAURENT KOSCIELNY has reportedly told former club Lorient he wants to leave Arsenal to return to the French side.\n\nThe defender has been at the Gunners since 2010 and has become one of the first names on Arsene Wenger's teamsheet due to his displays at the back.\n\n4 Laurent Koscielny has told Lorient he wants to leave Arsenal Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nHowever, the 32-year-old has no desire to stick around in North London for the rest of his career, and it appears he already has his exit planned out.\n\nAt least that is according to Lorient president Loic Fery, who claims Koscielny informed him of his desire to head home despite being under contract at the Emirates until 2020.\n\nFery told Canal+ Sport: \"He told me last week in London that he wanted to finish his career at Lorient.\"\n\nKoscielny has been a major player for Arsenal over the past couple of seasons in what has been a rocky period for the club.\n\n4 The defender spent a season with the French side before joining Arsenal in 2010 Credit: AFP\n\n4 Koscielny has made over 300 appearances for Arsenal under Arsene Wenger Credit: Reuters\n\n4 Lorient's chairman says Koscielny told him he wanted to return last week Credit: Reuters\n\nThe vice-captain has helped them to three FA Cup victories, but they have failed to mount a serious title challenge.\n\nAnd last year they missed out on qualification for the Champions League.\n\nHowever, the day Koscielny departs will be a sad one for the Gunners faithful - although Fery does not think it will happen any time soon.\n\nHe added: \"I hope he has a few more years playing at Arsenal.\"\n\nKoscielny spent just one season at Lorient before he was snapped up by Wenger.\n\nHe joined them back in 2009 but made only 40 appearances before he moved to England.\n\nSince then he has appeared over 300 times for Arsenal, marking his landmark treble century in the recent victory over Tottenham in the North London derby."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/07/arsenal-sign-laurent-koscielny-lorient", "page_content": "Arsenal have signed the defender Laurent Koscielny from Lorient on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. The 24-year-old, who predominantly plays as a centre-back, made 40 appearances for the Ligue 1 side last season.\n\nAlthough born in France, the uncapped Koscielny, who helped Lorient to seventh in Ligue 1 last season, would also qualify to represent Poland. The Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, said: \"Koscielny is a central defender with great ability who performed extremely well last season for Lorient. We identified him as a very strong centre-half, who has made big progress very quickly. He has shown he is mentally strong, he's a fighter and a very strong competitor. Koscielny is a great addition to our squad.\"\n\nKoscielny said: \"I'm very excited to be joining Arsenal. They are one of the biggest teams in Europe with many great players. I'm really looking forward to playing in the English Premier League and the Champions League with my new club. Also, in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Arsenal has one of the best managers in the world and I can't wait to work with him and do my best for the Arsenal supporters.\"\n\nKoscielny, who will wear the No6 shirt vacated by Philippe Senderos's move to Fulham, is scheduled to make his first appearance at the Emirates Stadium over the weekend of 31 July-1 August, when Arsenal play in the Emirates Cup with Milan, Celtic and Lyon.\n\nWenger was in need of cover in defence, with Sol Campbell considering a one-year deal and fellow veterans William Gallas and Mikael Silvestre set to leave after the end of their contracts.\n\nWenger has already signed long-term target Marouane Chamakh, the Morocco striker, to bolster the Arsenal attack, which could be missing Nicklas Bendtner ahead of their opening game of the new Premier League season at Liverpool on 15 August. Fulham's Australia international goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has also been linked with a switch to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nWenger has been in South Africa working as a pundit for French TV, but the future of midfielder Cesc F\u00e1bregas, who is wanted by Barcelona, will be at the forefront of his mind when he returns, with the Arsenal squad heading to their Austrian training base before the Emirates Cup. Barcelona appear to be growing impatient in the pursuit of their former trainee, whose new president, Sandro Rosell, maintains will not come at any cost.\n\nRosell is due to travel to South Africa shortly, where he hopes to meet Wenger. \"It's now or never,\" he said in an interview with Sport. \"We will do it fast. It won't be protracted. I'll try to see Wenger in South Africa, then we'll tell you what happens. We would not pay the \u20ac50-60m that I have read about. If Arsenal do not go crazy, he might play at Bar\u00e7a.\"\n\nLorient have moved quickly to fill the gap left by Koscielny's departure by signing the 21-year-old Gabon international Bruno Ecuele Manga from newly promoted Angers. \"The timing is perfect. The arrival of Bruno is not a coincidence,\" the Lorient manager Christian Gourcuff said. \"We have been following him for two years and when it became known that Arsenal were interested in Laurent, we became active.\""}]}
