He was admired and respected not only in his own community, but also in many other districts of Liverpool where his enviable reputation had spread.\n\nBorn in Georgetown, British Guyana, Jim arrived in Liverpool in 1900, as a fourteen-year-old stowaway aboard a cargo vessel. The priests of St.Augustine\u2019s, Great Howard Street, found him cold and hungry wandering around the streets, and took him into the presbytery where they provided food and shelter. Later they arranged lodgings for the youngster with a local Irish family, and soon the well-mannered likeable young-man became a popular member of the community. In 1914, he was married to Elizabeth Murphy, in the church of Our Lady of Reconciliation, Eldon Street, and set up home in Elizabeth Terrace, Silvester Street. In later years as the family grew-up, the family moved to Ashfield Cottages, in St Sylvester\u2019s parish. He was a natural athlete, ideally built for the sports he loved \u2013 swimming, running, and boxing, yet despite his incredible sporting achievements, he remained a humble and kind person who cherished his family and friends The family were very close and in the summer months Jim often took them all over to New Brighton on the ferry-boat. He had a passion for music and particularly liked to listen to the renowned American singer Paul.Robeson. He worked as a docker in the North-end of Liverpool, and each evening, groups of youngsters would wait for him coming home, because he always brought them \u2018handfuls\u2019 of peanuts, which they took home and roasted on a shovel over a coal-fire.\n\nThroughout his lifetime he was a tremendously gifted swimmer and from an early age his capability was far superior to that of youngsters of his own age. During his adult life, Jim used his swimming skills to save the lives of many people who were in danger of drowning in the River Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The deep canal ran between Burlington Street and Athol Street, not far from where Jim lived, and many children although they had been forbidden to do so, went swimming or fishing in the canal and were soon in difficulties. As soon as he was alerted by neighbours or police that someone was in danger, Jim would race to the spot, dive in and swim at amazing speed to rescue the person. He saved the lives of many children in the canal, and between 1911-1916, he bravely rescued several seamen and dock-workers from the River Mersey. He started his swimming career with the Wavertree Swimming Club, where he won many medals between 1908-1910, but he also swam for Bootle, Waterloo, and Everton Swimming Clubs. He made a very valuable contribution to the history of the Everton Swimming Club, being instrumental in their winning the coveted North Lancashire League Cup on many occasions. During these years he was often called upon by the Liverpool Police, to assist with the coaching of the Police Boxing and Swimming teams. He was very involved in charity work, frequently donating some of his more elaborate trophies to various organisations to raise money for their appeals.\n\nThere were instances when the police were unable to locate the body of a drowned person, and on these occasions they would enlist the assistance of Jim Clarke. Calling to his home or his place of work the police would quickly take him to the scene of the tragedy. He would dive in and remain underwater for an incredibly long period of time. Occasionally surfacing for air, he would dive repeatedly until he eventually located and recovered the body. Having saved numerous children from drowning, and having been involved in the recovery of so many bodies and witnessing the sorrowful aftermath, Jim was convinced that positive efforts should be made to ensure that all local school-children were able to swim. He expressed his concerns to the authorities and largely due to his initiative and enthusiasm, the children from local schools were brought along to Burroughs Gardens Baths, where Jim was responsible for teaching countless numbers of youngsters to swim.\n\nFor more than forty years he delighted swimming gala spectators all over the country with his skilful display of synchronised swimming. One of his favourite routines was a swimming demonstration he called \u2018Me and My Shadow\u2019, which he performed with one of his swimming colleagues. He would swim underwater whilst his partner swam on the surface, turning and diving in perfect harmony, the pair enthralled the crowds wherever they performed. Another display of his ability to remain underwater was to put a bucket over his head and sit on the bottom of the baths singing \u2018Oh My Darling Clementine\u2019. Jim continued to give exhibitions of his swimming skills up to several months before his death in 1946, at the age of sixty. Swimmers and officials throughout the Liverpool area, were saddened at the news of the death of their old comrade, as were his friends and neighbours who had such genuine respect and admiration for him. He was regarded as a local hero in the Scotland/Vauxhall district and on the day of his funeral, the children from the local schools of St,Anthony\u2019s and St.Sylvester\u2019s, lined the pavements from Jim\u2019s home in Ashfield Cottages, to St.Sylvesters Church, where his funeral Mass was conducted. His great friend, Olympic Swimming Champion ,Austin Rawlinson, who became a senior officer in the Liverpool City Police, came to pay his respects to his pal, and to offer condolences to the Clarke family.\n\nJim Clarke, a well-respected gentleman, who made such a positive contribution to the well-being of his fellow man, remains a legend in the Scotland/Vauxhall neighbourhood, and today his family speak with pride of their fathers achievements and the honest way in which he lived his life, always looking for the good in people and helping out wherever he could. In 1986, a fitting tribute was made to Jim Clarke\u2019s name, when a local street was named after him. James Clarke Street, which runs between Tatlock Street and Hornby Walk, is not far from where he once lived, and where many of the older generation still recall his name with affection.\n\nHistory\n\nA PLAQUE honouring the Liverpool hero who taught children to swim after rescuing school children from the Leeds Liverpool Canal, was unveiled November 18, 2008 at Liverpool Aquatics Centre in Wavertree.\n\nThe late James Clarke, who became a champion swimmer and boxer across Liverpool was remembered\n\nA blue plaque was unveiled by his only surviving daughter Winnie Clarke, 75, and the great-granddaughter of the man who adopted James as a young boy.\n\nBorn in British Guyana, Clarke arrived in Liverpool in 1898 as a 14-year-old stowaway. He was found wandering the docks by Edward Crawford who brought him to his home in Vauxhall.\n\nEdward and his wife applied for James to become a resident and had him baptised as a Catholic.\n\nIt was at the home in Eldon Street that Edward taught James how to box in the cellar, which was converted into a boxing gym.\n\nHe went on to defy the racists by marrying a white-Irish woman, Elizabeth Murphy in 1914 in the Church of Our Lady of Reconciliation, in Eldon Street, Vauxhall. They set up home in Elizabeth Terrace and had 13 children.\n\nAs well as becoming a top boxer he went on to win numerous swimming medals between 1908-1910.\n\nHe was a member of Wavertree and Everton swimming clubs winning the Lancashire League Cup and captained Woolton Polo team.\n\nHe became a local hero and was admired across the city after rescuing numerous children who got into difficulty in the canal at the back of his home.\n\nHe began to visit schools to encourage children to learn to swim and held swimming lessons for everyone at the local pool.\n\nOne of his favourite tricks was sitting underwater on the bottom of the pool with a bucket over his head either drinking a glass of lemonade or singing \u201cOh My Darling Clementine\u201d.\n\nHis daughter, near to tears after pupils from St Hugh\u2019s Catholic Primary performed a short play on James\u2019 life, said he would have been delighted by the plaque.\n\nWinnie Clarke said: \u201cI was evacuated during the war and when I returned to Liverpool my father took ill with TB and died a year later. But I still have happy memories and I remember he used to read us Bible stories. It was amazing because he had taught himself to read and write from the Bible and everything he did was always for charity and people less fortunate.\u201d\n\nAmong the friends, family and dignitaries was Bernadette Crawford, great-granddaughter of Edward Crawford.\n\nShe has spent the last few years researching the history of her family and James Clarke after her father recognised a picture of Clarke in a newspaper.\n\nMs Crawford said: \u201cI\u2019ve traced back to the day James arrived in Liverpool and it\u2019s been great meeting up with his family and putting the story together.\n\n\u201cMy father, Thomas, remembers James having to fight against racism but earned respect with his natural athletic ability and personality. He was asked by Merseyside Police to teach their officers how to box which he did.\u201d\n\nLiverpool Council leader Cllr Warren Bradley installed the plaque after pleas from pupils at St Hugh\u2019s Primary who campaigned for the Aquatic Centre to be named in his memory.\n\nCllr Bradley said: \u201cWe see swimming as an integral part of the development of this city and that is because of the work James Clarke did in rescuing lives and ensuring children were taught to swim. When I met the pupils they wanted James Clarke to be remembered, he is not just a local hero and swimmer but was a tremendous sportsman for the city.\u201d\n\nThe children came up with the idea while carrying out a school project looking at black history and positive role models.\n\nSt Hugh\u2019s class teacher Diane Crute, added: \u201cThe children thought Clarke was a great role model, especially as many pupils come from different countries. They see how he succeeded and became a local hero and they know they can do the same.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Freeman-Clarke", "page_content": "James Freeman Clarke, (born April 4, 1810, Hanover, New Hampshire, U.S.\u2014died June 8, 1888, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts), Unitarian minister, theologian, and author whose influence helped elect Grover Cleveland president of the United States in 1884.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard College in 1829 and Harvard Divinity School in 1833 and serving his first pastorate in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1833 to 1840, Clarke established in 1841 the Church of the Disciples in Boston, where he was minister from 1841 to 1850 and from 1854 until his death. He was also professor of religion at Harvard (1867\u201371). He worked closely with many of the significant persons of his day, and he printed original works by his friends Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Nathaniel Hawthorne in the Western Messenger, a short-lived magazine he edited while at Louisville. A versatile reformer, Clarke opposed slavery and advocated changes in the civil service. The latter reforms were part of Grover Cleveland\u2019s platform as a candidate for president in 1884, and Clarke lent his influential support to Cleveland\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn addition to editing such magazines as the Christian World (1843\u201348) and the Monthly Journal of the American Unitarian Association (1859\u201361), Clarke published more than 1,000 articles and sermons and 32 books, including Ten Great Religions, 2 vol. (1871, 1883). His Autobiography, Diary, and Correspondence, edited by Edward Everett Hale, appeared in 1891."}, {"url": "https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/clark-james-gardner", "page_content": "A notorious foe of the African American freedom struggle, James Clark served as sheriff of Dallas County, Alabama, from 1955 to 1967. After years of antagonizing local civil rights workers, Clark clashed with Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) during 1965 voting rights protests in Selma, Alabama. Clark\u2019s brutality became a rallying point for King, who said: \u201cUntil Sheriff Clark is removed, the evils of Selma will not be removed\u201d (Herbers, \u201cDr. King Urges\u201d).\n\nClark was born in Alabama in 1922. Prior to serving as sheriff, he worked as an assistant revenue commissioner for the state of Alabama. In February 1963 the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee began a voter education and registration campaign in Selma, the seat of Dallas County, where a mere 242 of the 15,000 eligible African American voters were registered. By October 1963 Clark had arrested hundreds of civil rights activists. Frustrated by their limited success, in December 1964 local black activists asked King and SCLC to come to Selma. Aware of the violence that Clark and his officers routinely employed, King believed that a confrontation in Selma might attract the national attention necessary to pressure President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for voting rights legislation. On 2 January 1965, SCLC sent staff members to begin a protest campaign.\n\nAfter initially refraining from violent confrontations, on 19 January Clark pulled Amelia Boynton, a local black civil rights activist, out of a voter registration line and pushed her down the street into a waiting patrol car. King denounced Clark: \u201cIt is a tragedy when a man becomes so depraved and so sick that he will grab a woman and push and shove and all but kick her in the process as if he were dealing with some wayward dog\u201d (King, 20 January 1965). A week later, Clark\u2019s violent behavior landed him on the front page of the New York Times, when a cameraman captured him beating a 53-year-old woman over the head with his nightstick as two officers held her down. Clark\u2019s brutal tactics prompted a federal court to issue a restraining order prohibiting Clark from employing intimidation and harassment. Clark was fined later that year for violating the order by interfering with registration applicants.\n\nIn the weeks following Boynton\u2019s arrest, King was also arrested, along with hundreds of black citizens seeking to exercise their constitutional rights. Commenting on how effective Clark\u2019s racist aggression was at attracting popular attention, one SCLC staff member reportedly said: \u201cWe should put him on the staff\u201d (Garrow, Bearing, 381).\n\nThe showdown between Clark and civil rights activists climaxed on 7 March 1965, when Clark and his men brutally attacked civil rights demonstrators seeking to march from Selma to Montgomery. National television coverage of Clark\u2019s deputies using clubs, whips, and tear gas prompted Johnson to submit legislation that became the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe violent events of 1965 eventually turned Clark\u2019s constituency against him, and in 1966 he lost his bid for reelection as county sheriff to Selma\u2019s public safety director, Wilson Baker, a moderate who had disapproved of Clark\u2019s tactics. After losing the election, Clark became active with the John Birch Society, touring the country to speak about his experience in Selma."}, {"url": "https://www.resilientworker.net/snake-clark-breaking-glass-for-the-warfighter/", "page_content": "If you accept the morality of going to war, the task then becomes to win at the least loss to your own side. \u2013Richard Whittle\n\nRetired Colonel James G. \u201cSnake\u201d Clark is, and always will be, an United States Air Force legend. He is widely known as the \u201cGodfather\u201d of the Predator, an unmanned aerial assault vehicle that forever changed military combat. But his contributions to supporting soldiers in combat stretches far beyond that. Snake breathed creativity and innovation back into the military-industrial complex. He overhauled the outdated imagery and mapping services to bring near-real-time satellite information directly to the front lines. He cut through bureaucracy and wasn\u2019t afraid to create his own rules as the chief \u201cfixer\u201d in the Air Force. There simply was no stopping Snake Clark from his relentless mission to aid and assist the warfighter. And if he had to break a little glass along the way, so be it!\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t always the most popular. Half the people loved me. Half the people hated me. But I didn\u2019t care. The half that hated me were bureaucratic weenies!\u201d\n\nSnake didn\u2019t care about the bureaucrats because that was NOT where he was focused. He simply had no time for them. Snake was driven to serve the greater good of the military. He was driven to save lives. He was driven by one singular mantra that permeated his every action.\n\n\u201cThe person in the greatest harm\u2019s way is where you have to focus. Always.\u201d\n\nAmen, Snake.\n\nA Military Man\n\nGrowing up as an only child in the suburbs of Northern, New Jersey, James Clark learned the power of independence. And his Catholic education at Essex Catholic, and later at the Catholic University of America, reinforced his dedication to his country and his faith. His days at CUA proved to be particularly transformative. He entered the ROTC Program and developed increasing respect and love for military life, eventually becoming the President of his Class. But perhaps more importantly, it was during these years that he earned his infamous nickname.\n\n\u201cWhen your name is \u2018Snake\u2019, it opens a lot of doors and takes on a personality of its own. It only added to my renegade reputation.\u201d\n\nAnd Snake leveraged every bit of that angle to aid the warfighter.\n\n\u201cIt was kinda like being \u2018Cher\u2019. I was just \u2018Snake\u2019. And that allowed me to get things done!\u201d\n\nIn 1973, through the CUA ROTC Program, Snake was commissioned into the United States Air Force.\n\nSnake Clark rose up through the ranks of the Air Force and spent various stints at Air Force bases in Florida, Texas, England, and South Korea. He was no non-sense, brash, and outspoken, which allowed him to bypass bureaucracy and cut through the politics.\n\nIn 1982, Snake was assigned to Ramstein Air Base in Germany where he worked for Major General (later, General) Bill Kirk and Colonel Moody Suter. General Kirk wanted Colonel Suter to examine how the US would prepare to fight in Europe using real-world scenarios. It was a massive vision. And Colonel Suter was just the man to make this happen. But they had no money, space, or people to get it done. He needed someone who could bypass traditional systems. He needed someone who could break glass and beg, borrow and steal to corral funds and resources to help the warfighter. He needed Snake.\n\nUnder Colonel Moody\u2019s leadership, Snake and a handful of Air Force innovators established the Warrior Preparation Center (WPC) in 1983. Little did they know the impact this Center would have on preparing our troops for battle. Today the WPC is the premier training facility for our forces around the world.\n\n\u201c I am forever in honor to Colonel Suter, he truly was one of the great visionaries of the U. S. Air Force.\u201d\n\nSnake rose up through the ranks, constantly furthering causes for the warfighter, eventually reaching Lieutenant Colonel. But he could rise no higher. By 1995, there were no more mountains to climb and Snake planned for his retirement. But then something happened that changed the trajectory of his life forever.\n\nAt the time, Snake was reunited with Colonel Suter in the Pentagon. He told the Colonel about his plans to retire. Colonel Suter smiled, and knew exactly what to do. He immediately reached out to General Ronald Fogelman.\n\nGeneral Ronald Fogelman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, was in the process of wrestling control of the Predator Program away from the Army. General Fogelman needed a right-hand man with vision, innovation, and guts. He needed someone who wasn\u2019t afraid to \u201cbreak a little glass\u201d in order to get things done. Was there any better man for the job?\n\n\u201cA week after announcing my plans to retire, General Fogelman sent me a short, handwritten note: \u2018I was very pleased to see your name on the Colonel\u2019s list. I need warriors like you in our Air Force!\u2019 How do you say no to that?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t. Retirement plans canceled. On October 31, 1996, James \u201cSnake\u201d Clark was promoted to full Colonel! Snake was ready to break some glass for the Air Force once again!\n\nAt the time, nobody wanted to touch the Predator. But Snake sensed the potential strategic impact of this weapon system and he had the full backing of General Fogelman. The General trusted him completely and once famously quipped: Snake, you\u2019re too stupid to lie to me!\u201d And with that backing, a legend was born.\n\nThe Transformational Power of the Predator\n\nAbraham Karem is the father of modern drone technology. After emigrating from Israel in the 1970s, he manufactured his first drone, Amber, which eventually evolved into the famous Predator drone. He was a man ahead of his time. But innovation did not typically come quickly to the military. Why?\n\n\u201cIt is a risk-averse structure where too many people have access to the original requirement. Things can get lost in translation in a bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nBut after years of getting \u201clost in translation\u201d, the Predator drone was ready to spread its wings.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Predator was still considered a \u201cnew technology\u201d in 1996. Some people found it interesting but most weren\u2019t sure how to exploit it. But Snake immediately recognized the power this could have for waging war and the benefit to the warfighter. It just needed to be fast-tracked and implemented. It just needed someone who could innovate quickly and get it to the front lines.\n\n\u201cThe warfighter would rather have something 70 percent done and deployed to the field quickly, than wait months or even years for the 100 percent solution. A lot of lives will be lost waiting for 100 percent.\u201d\n\nSnake Clark teamed with a highly secretive Air Force division based in Dayton, Ohio known as Big Safari. The Big Safari Team specialized in modifying standard Air Force aircraft for time-sensitive and highly classified operations. They understood the importance of innovating rapidly and bypassing bureaucracy. They were the perfect partner for Snake Clark and the Predator mission!\n\nThe Big Safari Team innovated and iterated and eventually equipped the Predator with sophisticated commercial satellite receivers and a state-of-the-art imagery processing capability while allowing for easy remote control. Soon Predator was flying missions over war-torn regions around the world. And the best was yet to come.\n\n\u201cWe were making great progress but the stakes just kept getting higher. If we failed, we were curtains.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t realize at the time how high the stakes were about to get.\n\nIn September of 2000, Osama Bin Laden was identified as a chief target for the US military. And the revamped Predator drone was the perfect instrument to help track him down.\n\nActing on some intelligence uncovered by the CIA, the Air Force-led Predator flew to Tarnak Farms, a walled compound near the Kandahar airport where Bin Laden was thought to be living. Sure enough, the sophisticated cameras of the Predator caught Bin Laden emerging from the compound. But there was one problem. The Predator was a surveillance and intelligence-gathering vehicle only.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating. But I knew right then what we needed to do.\u201d\n\nTime for that 100 percent solution!\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to look inside yourself. \u2018Where is your heart? What is your motivation?\u2019 There can be no ambiguity. We needed to arm these things!\u201d\n\nSnake knew the hard decisions they would need to make and Big Safari was the perfect team. There was no time for bureaucracy. They tested the resiliency of the Predator and determined it could only withstand 175 pounds of extra weight before the wings snapped off. They retrofitted the aircraft with Hellfire missiles and tweaked the design until it reached the minimum threshold. What would normally take years, took months. Now the Predator had teeth. Armed with Hellfire missiles on each wing, the Predator morphed from strictly surveillance and intelligence into an offensive weapon. And not a moment too soon.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, almost a year to the day after the Predator spotted Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, the deadly attacks on New York City and Washington, DC (and subsequent tragedy over Shanksville, PA) unfolded like a horror movie in slow motion. But the military\u2019s response, thanks in part to men like Snake, was anything but slow. That evening, three Predators landed at Andrews Air Force Base, and by the evening of September 16th, the Predators were flying over Afghanistan. It was time to break some glass.\n\nThe impact of the innovative Predator development cannot be overstated. This technology ignited a drone revolution that has changed the way we wage war, altered the military, altered the CIA, and saved untold thousands of American lives. The US military now owns more than 8,000 drones and, once an afterthought, they have become an integral part of the military-industrial complex.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t out to change the nature of warfare. We were just relentlessly focused on the American soldier. We just wanted to go to bed each night and say \u2018We did some good today.\u2019\u2019\u201d\n\nMission accomplished, Snake!\n\nA Legacy Beyond the Predator\n\nWhile \u201cGodfather of the Predator\u201d will always be his legacy, Snake Clark offered so much more to the military over the course of his illustrious career. Notably, he is widely credited with revolutionizing the maps, imagery and digital capabilities extended to the men and women on the front lines. And that alone saved countless more lives in the process.\n\n\u201cReliable real-time data saves lives. Especially in battle. Nothing is more critical.\u201d\n\nSnake invented the world\u2019s first deployable commercial imagery downlink system, EagleVision, which is still in use today. Over the course of the last twenty years, FEMA has leveraged this technology to aid and assist in recovery after hurricanes and other natural disasters. Again, accurate data saves lives.\n\nBut the legacy of Snake does not just reside in the data or the machines he helped create, but in hearts of the men he served. And the stories never end. Snake used his gift for cutting through red tape and breaking glass to load up duffel bags full of GPS units to ship directly to the front lines. When Snake heard that troops in Afghanistan were using their boots as pillows and coats as blankets, he requisitioned a C-130 supply plane and loaded up pillows, blankets, and other provisions from a private supplier. Snake was not one to wait for the \u201csystem\u201d to aid the troops.\n\n\u201cInfluence and power can be seductive, but you can\u2019t abuse it. You have to find the sweet spot and leverage that influence to take care of people and get stuff done. Whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nSnake believed in taking care of the people above him and below him. This created trust and an endless circle of goodwill. If Snake was in your corner, you were always protected. And this built incredible loyalty throughout his sphere of influence.\n\n\u201cWhen you take care of people, they take care of you.\u201d\n\nEven today, the stories of the men he helped and the lives he changed live on. One officer under his command, long since retired, put his current priorities this way:\n\n\u201cGod first. Then my wife. Then my kids. Then Snake.\u201d\n\nAnother officer succinctly captured his essence:\n\n\u201cFor Snake, it was all about helping those in the \u2018zipper suits\u2019, those going into battle. That\u2019s all he cared about.\u201d\n\nStill another retired officer recalls the story of the day his own life changed forever. He was an Airman (lower rank) at the time and went into his boss, Captain Bryan Denson, and told him his plan to retire. He wanted to move back to his hometown and become a police officer. With the help of Captain Denson, Snake caught wind of this decision and acted immediately. 3-Star General William Begert was soon visiting the young Airman and imploring him to stay in the military and reach his potential. The young Airman had one condition:\n\n\u201cI want to work with Snake.\u201d\n\nThe General made one phone call to the Personnel Center at Randolph Air Force base, seeking assistance with the Airman\u2019s request. The rest is history. The young Airman blossomed under Snake, rose to the level of Major, and separated with a full pension from the Air Force. It was a small act, but it was so powerful. A life forever changed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help everyone, but the key is to find the person you think will do great things with the opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnd so you did, Snake.\n\nFocus on the Warfighter\n\nAfter so much conviction and single-minded focus, and so much subsequent success, it is hard to imagine that Snake was ever discouraged.\n\n\u201cOf course! I had plenty of bad days. There were times when I was bludgeoned and beaten down by the bureaucracy. Anyone who tells you they never struggled is lying.\u201d\n\nBut there are so many stories to help him overcome those bad days. Stories of soldiers sleeping more soundly on the front lines with a pillow and blanket. Stories of the Predator rescuing trapped warfighters and eliminating the threat. Stories of young Airmen changing the trajectory of their life. Stories of saving the lives of those in the greatest harm\u2019s way.\n\nHis success didn\u2019t come without struggle. There were times when Snake colored outside the lines and ruffled a few feathers in the process. Breaking glass can cause collateral damage. But he did it all for the warrior. And because of that, he was able to continue his fight.\n\n\u201cMy success was due in no small part to the dynamic and courageous leaders in the Air Force who took a chance on a brash young captain and always had my back.\u201d\n\nAnd that is what it is all about. When you take care of people, they take care of you.\n\nToday, one of the three Predators originally deployed on 9/11 hangs in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Udvar-Hazy Center. Inside the cockpit is the signature of the man who helped pioneer the greatest tactical weapon in modern military history. Colonel James \u201cSnake\u201d Clark made it happen. And he wasn\u2019t afraid to break a little glass to keep our warfighters out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nWhat Does It Mean for Us\n\nSnake Clark retired as a Colonel from the Air Force and then spent 19 years as a Senior Executive in the US Federal Government. And, after reflecting on his career, Snake put it all in perspective.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you have to ask yourself, \u2018If what I am doing ends up on the front page of the New York Times, am I okay with it?\u2019 I was okay with everything I did, inside and outside the lines. It was always about arming and protecting the warfighter.\u201d\n\nWhat do Snake Clark\u2019s career and legacy mean for us?\n\nHow many of us are single-mindedly focus on our mission?\n\nHow many of us struggle against a bureaucracy to keep our ideas alive?\n\nHow many of us are not afraid to break glass in the name of what we hold true?\n\nHow many of us understand the power of accelerating other people\u2019s careers?\n\nHow many of us leverage our influence to help people and get stuff done?\n\nAnd so it is with all of us. It will not always an easy journey. There will be barriers placed in our path. There will be seemingly insurmountable challenges posed from all sides. We will be beaten down at various times. But we have to maintain our conviction. We have to stay maniacally focused on our mission. We have to stay resilient in the face of adversity. Nothing worth fighting for is easy.\n\nThank you, Snake, for showing us the way!\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/james-paul-clarke-93/", "page_content": "James Paul Clarke, eighteenth governor of Arkansas and a United States senator, became an advocate of the silver monetization crusade associated with the William Jennings Bryan wing of the Democratic Party. He was also a defender of white supremacy as the key doctrine of his party.\n\nJames Clarke was born in Yazoo County, Mississippi, on August 18, 1854, to Walter Clarke, an architect, and Ellen White, daughter of a prominent planter. After editing a paper in Yazoo City, Clarke received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1878.\n\nIn 1879, Clarke moved to Arkansas, settling first at Ozark (Franklin County). Within a year he moved to Helena (Phillips County), where he began a successful law practice. Clarke married Sallie Moore Wooten of Moon Lake, Mississippi, on November 10, 1883; they had one son and two daughters. In 1886, Clarke won election to a two-year term as the Phillips County representative to the Arkansas House of Representatives. In the 1888 election, Clarke won a seat in the state Senate, where he served two successive terms, holding the position of president of the senate and lieutenant governor ex officio during his second term in 1891. In 1892, he easily won election to the office of attorney general but chose to serve only one term in order to seek the governor\u2019s chair.\n\nAt their state convention in July 1894, Arkansas Democrats chose Clarke as their gubernatorial nominee by acclamation. Clarke called for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, and this inflationary idea had wide support among Arkansas\u2019s farmers who earlier had abandoned the party in order to support the Union Labor party. This defeat for conservative or \u201cgold\u201d Democrats soon led the party to appropriate more planks from the Populist movement.\n\nThe Democratic candidate also struck at both the Populist and Republican threats by upholding white supremacy as the keystone of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe people of the South,\u201d he said in his closing speech of the election, \u201clooked to the Democratic party to preserve the white standards of civilization.\u201d Clarke easily defeated his opponents.\n\nOne of the most dramatic populist reforms debated during Clarke\u2019s administration concerned regulation of the railroad corporations. Joseph Taylor Robinson, who would later serve as Arkansas governor and United States senator, introduced in the Arkansas House of Representatives a bill creating a state railroad commission. The bill was defeated. On March 5, 1895, in an interview with a reporter from the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Governor Clarke charged that the Iron Mountain Railroad had \u201cpurchased the defeat of the Railroad Commission Bill.\u201d Clarke\u2019s statements cast suspicions on those who had voted against the bill.\n\nWilliam Robert Jones, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who had led the opposition to the commission bill, took heated exception to Clarke\u2019s insinuations of bribery. He and Clarke exchanged angry words on April 7, 1895, and Clarke\u2019s famous temper was evidenced when he spit in Jones\u2019s face.\n\nRather than seek the second term Arkansas traditionally granted most governors, Clarke tried to win the U.S. Senate seat of James K. Jones in the 1896 primary elections but was defeated. Before returning to politics, Clarke practiced law in Little Rock.\n\nIn 1902, Governor Jeff Davis and Clarke formed a political alliance that gave the Davis machine new strength in the Delta region and gained Clarke a powerful advocate in his second attempt to unseat Jones. To avoid conflict within the party, both Clarke and Jones agreed that the state legislature should choose the winner of the primary as senator. After Jones lost the primary, he began to hedge on his promise. The state legislature upheld the decision of the primary election and sent Clarke to the Senate. He was reelected in 1909 and again in 1915. In the 1914 primary election, William Fosgate Kirby, an agrarian Radical Democrat, gathered the remnants of the Davis political machine behind him and almost unseated Clarke.\n\nIn Clarke, the Senate gained an independent-minded and volatile personality. The Arkansas Gazette characterized him as having a \u201ctongue like a scythe blade that can cut and carve.\u201d He served as president pro tempore of the Senate in Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congress. He also served as chairman of the Commerce Committee. During his tenure in the Senate, he frequently supported progressive legislation. He voted for the Hepburn Bill, strengthening the rate-setting powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and supported the creation of a children\u2019s bureau in the Labor Department, the direct election of senators, and the Clayton Anti-Injunction Act. He unsuccessfully proposed a measure to grant independence to the Philippines.\n\nAfter an illness of a few days, Clarke died on October 1, 1916, at his home in Little Rock (Pulaski County) and is buried at Oakland Cemetery. William F. Kirby was elected to complete Clarke\u2019s term as senator. In 1921, the Arkansas General Assembly approved a statue of Clarke to stand in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol; however, in 2019, the Arkansas General Assembly voted to replace the statues of Uriah M. Rose and Clarke with statues of Daisy Bates and Johnny Cash.\n\nFor additional information:\n\nDonovan, Timothy P., Willard B. Gatewood Jr., and Jeannie M. Whayne, eds.

Leitrim, bombardier in the Royal Artillery, and Mary Palmer of Clogheen, Co. Tipperary. His father was an anglican and his mother a catholic, and Thomas was baptised a catholic. In April 1859 James Clarke was posted to South Africa and took his family. In 1867 he was sent to Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, and quit the army 26 December 1868 with the rank of sergeant. Thomas was educated in St Patrick's national school, Dungannon, where he became a monitor, and he always considered Dungannon his home town. Sympathetic to nationalist politics, he was impressed by the visit in 1878 to Dungannon of John Daly (qv), a national organiser for the IRB , and later joined the organisation, becoming first district secretary of the Dungannon IRB.\n\nPrison and New York, 1880\u20131907\n\nSought by police after firing buckshot at them during a riot in Dungannon, in August 1880 he emigrated to New York, where he was employed as a hotel porter. He joined Clan na Gael, attended the bomb-making classes of Dr Thomas Gallagher (1851\u20131925), and in March 1883 went on a bombing mission to England. Spotted in London carrying a suspiciously heavy black bag, he was arrested 5 April 1883 with Gallagher in possession of explosives. On 11 June 1883 he was convicted of treason-felony and sentenced to penal servitude for life. Held in Millbank, Chatham, and Portland prisons, he used his alias, \u2018Henry Hammond Wilson\u2019, throughout his imprisonment. The regime imposed on treason-felons in Chatham (where he served most of his sentence) was particularly severe: in addition to hard labour, little exercise, and enforced silence among prisoners, there were harassments such as interruption of sleep and frequent punishments for infringing prison rules. Under this pressure several Fenian prisoners, including Gallagher, went insane. However, Clarke's reason remained unimpaired, thanks to his own mental resilience and the support of his fellow inmates John Daly and James Francis Egan (qv), also convicted on dynamiting charges. The three worked out ingenious ways of communicating together and forged strong and lasting friendships. Clarke's account of his imprisonment was published in Irish Freedom in 1912 and as Glimpses of an Irish felon's prison life (1922). After repeated requests from the Amnesty Association, he was released 29 September 1898. Fifteen years in prison had left their mark: he was socially awkward and prematurely aged, slightly stooped, with a gaunt and sunken face. He was, however, as zealous a Fenian as ever and never forgot nor forgave the harsh treatment that he and his comrades had suffered. F\u00eated in Dublin and Dungannon, he received the freedom of the city in Limerick (2 March 1899), where John Daly had become mayor.\n\nHe settled with his mother and sister in Kilmainham, Dublin, but found it difficult to find work and emigrated to America in 1900. In New York he was employed as a metalworker and also as a clerk for Clan na Gael, acting as private secretary to John Devoy (qv). Here he was joined by John Daly's niece Kathleen (qv) (as Kathleen Clarke) whom he had met in Limerick; they were married 16 July 1901 in New York (Maj. John MacBride (qv), was the best man) and had three sons. In September 1903 Clarke helped launch the Gaelic American, on which he worked as assistant-editor to Devoy. He became a naturalised US citizen on 2 November 1905. During these years he was active in several Irish-American organisations and in promoting Irish cultural events. In 1905, with his wife suffering from ill-health, he resigned from the Gaelic American, and bought a small market garden farm at Manorville, Long Island; afterwards, gardening was his only hobby.\n\nConspiracy, 1907\u201316\n\nAnxious to renew his Fenian activities, in November 1907 he returned to Ireland, and in February 1908 rented a tobacconist's and newsagent's shop at 55 Amiens St., Dublin; in 1909 he bought another shop at 75a Parnell St., and in 1910 moved shop from 55 to 77 Amiens St.; he also took a house at 10 Richmond Avenue, Fairview. He arrived back in Ireland at a time when younger IRB members were attempting to breathe new life into a largely moribund organisation. Because of his sufferings and dedication to Fenian ideals he was revered by young IRB radicals, who regarded him as the embodiment of militant Fenianism, and he was coopted on to the IRB supreme council and appointed treasurer. He helped young militants gain control of the organisation and befriended several of them, especially Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada (qv), who became his right-hand man; he assisted Mac Diarmada's appointment as IRB national organiser in 1908. Much of the IRB's business was transacted through front organisations, particularly the Dublin Central Wolfe Tone Clubs Committee, founded in 1910 and presided over by Clarke, and his shop in Parnell St. became the hub of IRB activity in the city. In July 1911 he organised a pilgrimage to the grave of Wolfe Tone (qv) in Bodenstown to counter the visit of George V to Dublin, and during the visit displayed a large poster outside his shop, proclaiming \u2018Damn your concessions, England, we want our country!\u2019\n\nActive in almost all aspects of the nationalist movement, Clarke joined the Gaelic League. Although he spoke little Irish, he saw the League as a useful vehicle for separatist ideals, and attempted to manipulate its appointments. With similar intentions he joined Sinn F\u00e9in. Griffith admired him and asked him to stand as Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for Dublin corporation but Clarke was dismissive of electoral politics and his response was \u2018none of that for me\u2019 (Le Roux, 84). He regarded Sinn F\u00e9in as \u2018all right as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough\u2019 (Glimpses, 8). He sympathised with the working class and supported trade unionism, but deplored Irish trade unions' dependence on English unions, and regarded labour agitation as a minor sectional struggle compared with the great national struggle for independence.\n\nWith IRB militants Denis McCullough (qv), Bulmer Hobson (qv), and Mac Diarmada, he published the republican journal Irish Freedom from 15 November 1910 and kept it going until its suppression in December 1914. Although sharply critical of the Irish parliamentary party and its pursuit of home rule, Clarke was overjoyed at the way in which the home rule crisis polarised Irish politics: colleagues remembered him rubbing his hands with glee whenever he spoke of the UVF . Always on the lookout for dedicated activists, he invited Patrick Pearse (qv) to give the oration at the Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown in June 1913 and facilitated his entry into the IRB in November 1913, overriding the reservations of those who suspected Pearse of personal ambition and political unreliability. Operating behind the scenes, Clarke helped found the Irish Volunteers in November 1913, and strongly opposed accepting the nominees of John Redmond (qv) on to the Volunteer executive in June 1914 \u2013 an issue on which he broke bitterly with Hobson, accusing him of being a Castle spy. Clarke and Mac Diarmada were the main figures behind the coup of 24 September 1914, when anti-Redmondites seized the Volunteer headquarters at 41 Dawson St., and issued a manifesto repudiating Redmond's leadership. They were delighted with the ensuing split, which increased their control over a militant rump of Volunteers.\n\nOn 9 September 1914 Clarke presided at a conference of separatists, mostly IRB men, which decided in principle to use the opportunity of European war to mount an insurrection. Clarke, as treasurer, and Mac Diarmada, as secretary, were the key figures on the IRB supreme council \u2013 McCullough's presidency was essentially nominal. They were fervent advocates of revolutionary action and increasingly bypassed the supreme council. To prepare for insurrection they established in May 1915 a military committee (later council) which became the real power in the IRB and which they themselves joined in September 1915. During his long imprisonment Clarke had brooded on the inadequacies of previous Fenian conspiracies; now that he was in control, he insisted on rigorous planning and absolute secrecy. He hid his intentions from almost all his IRB colleagues and responded to their suspicions with evasion, indignation, and, on occasion, lies. Anxious to control all aspects of the physical-force movement, Clarke was president of the O'Donovan Rossa (qv) funeral committee and it was at his instigation that Pearse gave the famous graveside oration (1 August 1915). When Pearse asked how far he could go, Clarke replied \u2018Make it as hot as hell, throw discretion to the winds\u2019 (Le Roux, 156). The funeral, well orchestrated and marshalled, attracted a huge crowd and was a great propaganda coup for the IRB, strongly associating the Volunteers with the Fenian tradition.\n\nAs a close friend of Devoy, Clarke was an essential link between the IRB in Dublin and Clan na Gael in New York. Wary of the negotiations of Roger Casement (qv) with the German government, in October 1915 he sent Robert Monteith (qv) to Germany to assist and monitor his activities. By December 1915 the military council had decided to rise at Easter 1916 and Clarke worked feverishly with Devoy to arrange the landing of German arms in Ireland. He also planned many of the details of the Dublin rising but his preparations were interrupted in January 1916 when he was accidentally shot in the right arm by Sean McGarry (qv); Clarke never regained use of his arm. Although he generally shunned the limelight, his reputation and position at the centre of a web of separatist committees could not fail to attract the attention of Dublin Castle, which regarded him as the brains behind republican revolutionary activity in Ireland. DMP detectives rented a room opposite his Parnell St. shop to observe his movements, and the government was preparing to arrest him just days before the outbreak of insurrection. At a meeting on 18 April 1916, the other leaders insisted that he be first to sign the revolutionary proclamation since he had done more than anyone else to bring about the rising.\n\nThe Easter rising\n\nClarke denounced the countermanding orders of 22\u20133 April from Eoin MacNeill (qv) as treachery, and was determined to press on as originally planned. Presiding at a military council meeting in Liberty Hall on Easter Sunday (23 April 1916), he alone advocated a rising that evening and only reluctantly agreed to a day's postponement. He served in the GPO during Easter week (24\u20139 April), and although he held no official position or military rank he presided at military council meetings and, after James Connolly (qv) was badly wounded (27 April), played a major part in directing military operations. After fleeing the blazing GPO to a makeshift headquarters at 16 Moore St., Clarke was the only leader who insisted on fighting on to the end, but was overruled, and he broke down sobbing when Pearse decided to surrender. Many Volunteers were incensed by Clarke's treatment on the Rotunda hospital steps after the surrender, when he was verbally abused and roughly stripped by a British army officer, Capt. P. S. Lea-Wilson (who, as an RIC officer, was shot dead in Gorey in 1920). During the search Clarke was greatly taken aback when a DMP detective read from his police file a detailed account of his entire career, from his conduct in prison, to his time in America, to his recent IRB activities. Court-martialled in Richmond barracks (2 May), Clarke made no attempt to defend himself and was sentenced to death. Allowed to see his wife, he told her that \u2018between this and freedom Ireland will go through hell, but she will never lie down again until she has attained full freedom\u2019 (Kathleen Clarke, 95); he also told her he was glad he would be shot, his greatest dread being that he would be imprisoned again. He was shot in the first round of executions at Kilmainham jail (3 May 1916), and buried at Arbour Hill prison cemetery.\n\nAssessment\n\nClarke was probably the most single-minded of all the 1916 leaders, fervently committed to the pure Fenian doctrine of achieving an Irish republic through force of arms. For him there could be no compromise on Irish independence, and all other goals were secondary. Modest and unassuming, he hated public speaking and had little personal ambition, but he was a relentless and ruthless conspirator who masterminded the Easter rising, and his thoroughness and tenacity were afterwards much admired by Michael Collins (qv). His frail and inoffensive appearance concealed a fierce revolutionary spirit, and he was capable of great hatred, particularly for Irishmen he believed had betrayed their country, such as Hobson and MacNeill. During the rising several observers noted how happy Clarke looked, the insurrection being for him the culmination of a decade's work and a life's ambition."}, {"url": "https://delawarewwiifallen.com/2022/09/28/2nd-lieutenant-james-c-clark/", "page_content": "2nd Lieutenant James C.

He was the first child of James Marshall Clark (a carpenter, 1890\u20131988) and Helen Gould Clark (n\u00e9e Byrd, 1899\u20131964). The Clark family was recorded on the census on January 2, 1920, living on Main Street in Elkton. The family moved to 222 North Franklin Street in Wilmington, Delaware, prior to June 26, 1922, when Clark\u2019s younger brother, Harlan Heath Clark (1922\u20131994), was born. Harlan served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\nAt the time of the next census, on April 4, 1930, the Clark family was living at 506 10th Street in Chester, Pennsylvania. Census records indicate that the Clark family returned to Wilmington by April 1, 1935. Clark graduated from Wilmington High School. The Clarks were recorded on the next census on April 15, 1940, living at 1216 Conrad Street. Father and son were both working for a pigment company: James M. Clark as a millwright and James C. Clark as a clerk. Clark\u2019s mother was working as a cook at a private school.\n\nJames Clark (squatting at left) with his brother, parents, and grandmother in 1942 or 1943 (Courtesy of Barbara Clark McDowell)\n\nOn January 11, 1941, Journal-Every Evening announced Clark\u2019s engagement to Helen M. McCool (1919\u20131988), a classmate at Wilmington High School. The couple wed at her parents\u2019 home in Wilmington on the evening of June 14, 1941. The Wilmington Morning News reported:\n\nA reception followed at the Hob. After a wedding trip south, Mr. Clark and his bride will live at 1608 Broom Street. Miss Edith DiSabatino was the bride\u2019s only attendant and Mr. Harlan H. Clark, brother of the bridegroom, was best man.\n\nThe following month, on July 1, 1941, Clark registered for the draft. He was living with his wife at 1608 North Broom Street in Wilmington and working as a timekeeper for the DuPont Company Krebs Division in Edgemoor, Delaware. The registrar described him as standing five feet, 10\u00bd inches tall and weighing 140 lbs., with blond hair and blue eyes.\n\nAviation Cadet Clark in 1943 or 1944 (Courtesy of Barbara Clark McDowell)\n\nMilitary Career\n\nAccording to his wife\u2019s statement to the State of Delaware Public Archives Commission, Clark joined the U.S. Army in Camden, New Jersey, on July 13, 1943. It is unclear if he volunteered or was drafted. In most cases, voluntary enlistments ended by presidential order later in 1942. However, in some cases, due to limited training billets, a man who passed the battery of tests in order to become an aviation cadet was not called up for months.\n\nClark\u2019s wife wrote that her husband began his training at the U.S. Army Air Forces Miami Beach Training Center in Florida, where he was stationed until August 25, 1943. She wrote that he continued his training as an aviation cadet at the University of Pittsburgh (August 28, 1943 \u2013 November 5, 1943). She added that he was stationed at Nashville, Tennessee, and Selman Field, Louisiana (November 1943 \u2013 July 13, 1944, apparently referring to both). After completing his training as a navigator, Clark was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Forces on July 13, 1944. Following two weeks of leave, he was stationed at Boca Raton, Florida (July 28, 1944 \u2013 August 28, 1944).\n\nClark\u2019s wife wrote that her husband transferred to his last duty station on September 27, 1944: Great Bend Army Air Field, Kansas. Indeed, 2nd Lieutenant Clark appeared as a navigator on a roster of the 28th Bombardment Squadron (Very Heavy), 19th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), dated September 30, 1944. Helen Clark, by then pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, accompanied him to the base.\n\nLieutenant Clark and his wife in 1944 (Courtesy of Barbara Clark McDowell)\n\nOn November 27, 1944, Clark and his crew, a total of 12 men, took off from Great Bend at 1145 hours Central War Time on a long training flight aboard a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, serial number 42-24447. The pilot, 1st Lieutenant Eugene W. Hammond (1920\u20131950), had logged over 1,350 hours of flight time as lead pilot including 69\u00bd hours flying B-29s. The B-29 flew south to the Gulf of Mexico, where the crew made several bomb runs over Freemason Island, Louisiana. After the bombing practice, the flight plan was for Clark to guide the B-29 by celestial navigation to Havana, Cuba, and then back to Kansas, a roundtrip distance of about 3,000 miles. The overall length of the mission was similar what the crew would be flying from bases in the Mariana Islands to bomb Japan in a few short months.\n\nA B-29 Superfortress coming in for a landing at Okinawa (Official U.S. Army Air Forces photo, National Archives via Fold3)\n\nAround 1715 hours, some five hours and 30 minutes into the flight, a crewmember noticed the No. 1 engine (left outboard) smoking just after the plane\u2019s third pass over Freemason Island. Within moments, the engine burst into flames. The investigation board later concluded that the fire was caused by an undetected fuel leak.\n\nThe crew responded quickly to the emergency. Lieutenant Hammond throttled down the engine and attempted to feather the propeller, but the mechanism had already been burned through. He directed his copilot to have the crew prepare to bail out. The bombardier jettisoned the remaining bombs and bomb bay fuel tanks. The flight engineer used an extinguishing system on the affected engine without success.\n\nThe B-29 was on the cutting edge of aircraft design but had been plagued by engine fires during its development. In previous incidents when the Wright R-3350 caught fire during B-29 flights, it led to the rapid failure of the spar on the affected wing.\n\nLieutenant Hammond quickly ordered his crew to bail out. 11 men bailed out over Breton Sound. Before Hammond could follow, the burning engine suddenly dropped from the wing, extinguishing the fire in the process. Hammond placed the aircraft on autopilot long enough to retrieve the radio facility chart and transmit a distress call, then brought the plane in for an emergency landing at Keesler Field, Mississippi, at 1730 hours.\n\nView of the B-29\u2019s wing after it landed at Keesler Field (\u201cArmy Air Forces Report of Major Accident 45-11-27-2,\u201d courtesy of the Air Force Historical Research Agency)\n\nView of the remnants of the B-29\u2019s No. 1 engine nacelle after it landed at Keesler Field (\u201cArmy Air Forces Report of Major Accident 45-11-27-2,\u201d courtesy of the Air Force Historical Research Agency)\n\nThe crew members\u2019 parachutes functioned correctly. They were equipped with life vests as well as dye packs to increase their visibility in the water. Unfortunately, the incident occurred only a few minutes before sunset and the men were not equipped with any lights.\n\nThe search began even before Hammond landed. Multiple boats and search aircraft responded to the scene, but only three men were rescued from the water alive that night. A Consolidated OA-10 Catalina flying boat rescued the first survivor quickly, at 1810 hours. A U.S. Coast Guard boat rescued two more men shortly after midnight. At 1357 hours, nearly 21 hours after the accident, crash boat P-630 recovered Lieutenant Clark\u2019s body roughly two miles from where the Coast Guard rescued the second and third survivors.\n\nClark and seven other members of his crew had drowned despite being equipped with life vests. In his report, regional safety officer, Captain Eugene W. Roddenberry (1921\u20131991) wrote that the bulky flight suits may have been responsible for the deaths:\n\nIt appears likely that most of the crew members believed that their clothing although water soaked, offered some protection against cold. Information at the Keesler AAF Sea Rescue School indicates that this is not the case. The failure to remove flying clothing will result in the expension [sic] of much energy to keep afloat.\n\nRegarding Clark in particular, he continued:\n\nIt is probable that the death of the crewman found on the second day was at least partially accountable to this fact. He was found in a partially submerged condition with lungs full of water. His flying boots were still on. Probable exhaustion and drowning were listed on the autopsy report.\n\nThe crew\u2019s actions, however, were consistent with their training. At the time, U.S.A.A.F. air crew were not trained to remove their flying clothing (except boots) in the event a plane made a water landing, and it appears they were not given different instructions for the event of a parachute descent into water. Investigators recommended that training materials be changed to explain that waterlogged flight suits would not provide warmth and should be removed in the water.\n\nThe tragic outcome was compounded by several additional factors. The crew had not been provided emergency frequencies in their briefing folders, causing a delay of several minutes in mobilizing rescuers. A rescue boat was already standing by near Freemason Island, but did not observe the crew bail out. Poor radio communication also prevented authorities from notifying the boat for 15 minutes after Hammond reported the emergency.\n\nPerhaps the most critical problem was that two OA-10 flying boat crews made navigational errors. Although they rescued the first survivor, Corporal Ned C. Johnson, despite the errors, the search subsequently focused on the erroneous position. The OA-10s estimated that Johnson had been found about 14 miles north of the position provided by Lieutenant Hammond, which was in fact quite accurate. The flying boat that rescued Johnson also inadvertently dragged him underwater after he became entangled in a rescue rope. The rescuers managed to revive him but as a result, he was in no condition to share any information about the locations of other crew members.\n\nA map with various positions pertaining to the accident marked. The bomb range at Freemason Island is labeled \u201cDanger Area\u201d at upper right, with the rescue boat standing by at position 2. Hammond estimated the crew\u2019s bailout position as 1, and a B-24 pilot observed dye packs in the water around position 5. The flying boat crews\u2019 estimates of the first survivor\u2019s position are labeled 3 and 4 but later investigation revealed both positions were in error. The two survivors found by a Coast Guard vessel were rescued at position 6, while Lieutenant Clark\u2019s body was located at position 7.

On June 12, 1953, she remarried to David Alfred Reese (1917\u20131960), himself a widower.

The move came in a republican attempt to force the issue of what happens to men still on the run - of whom there are scores. It is understood that the sentence review commission, set up under the terms of the Good Friday agreement, freed them under licence in the same way as prisoners belonging to republican and loyalist paramilitary groups on ceasefire have been let out over the past two years.\n\nSinn Fein has been agitating for some sort of gesture on escaped prisoners as part of an overall package of demilitarisation and more extensive policing reform to end the current political deadlock threatening the future of the power-sharing executive at Stormont.\n\nThe government has never officially announced an amnesty and yesterday played down this latest development as part of an ongoing assessment process.\n\nA Northern Ireland Office spokesman said: \"As the former secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, announced in September, these prisoners have been allowed to return to Northern Ireland to make an application to the sentence review commission.\"\n\nSinn Fein and prison authorities refused to comment.\n\nBut a security source said: \"It's just one stage in a process the former secretary of state announced he was working toward. These men contacted the authorities and spoke to a government official. They have been freed under temporary licence just like others in similar organisations.\"\n\nA republican source said: \"Last year Peter Mandelson acknowledged an anomaly had arisen with regard to people on the run. Last May, the British government agreed to remove the anomaly but it is only now they are moving on it.\n\n\"It's a welcome move for these men and their families but it is only a small step and much, much more is needed. There are lots of people in the same position.\"\n\nThe timing of the gesture is highly symbolic, given the importance of prisoners' rights to republicans, particularly in this 20th anniversary year of the death of 10 hunger strikers, who were trying to gain political status in the Maze, Co Antrim, in 1981.\n\nWith the IRA's recent re-engagement with General John de Chastelain's disarmament body, it could be read as part of a carefully choreographed sequence of moves to try to get the provisionals to decommission their weapons.\n\nBut unionists will be furious at what they will view as virtually an official pardon for murderers and bombers.\n\nOne of the freed men is Liam Averill, a member of the Irish National Liberation Army, convicted of two murders in 1994. He made an audacious escape dressed as a woman during a Christmas party on December 10 1997.\n\nThe others are all thought to be IRA men. One, Gerard Sloan, was one of eight men who shot their way out of Belfast's Crumlin Road jail in 1981. Four fellow gang members, Angelo Fusco, Robert Campbell, Patrick Magee and Anthony Sloan, were effectively pardoned in December.\n\nThe four were captured in the Irish Republic and served jail terms there but did not qualify for early release because they had served less than two years in prison in Northern Ireland.\n\nAt the time, the Ulster Unionist deputy leader, John Taylor, condemned the decision to free them as deplorable and far too liberal.\n\nFive of those freed in this latest gesture are Seamy Campbell, Gerard Fryers, James Clarke, Dermott McNally and Seamus Clarke, brother of Terence \"Cleeky\" Clarke, Gerry Adams's minder and friend, who died of cancer last year.\n\nThey escaped during the mass breakout from the high-security Maze jail in 1983, when 38 inmates, armed with guns and knives, seized a lorry in the prison compound. One prison officer was killed and another seriously wounded.\n\nNineteen prisoners were quickly recaptured but the rest got away. By 1992, five had been recaptured, three killed in ambushes and 11 were still on the run.\n\nThe other man involved in the apparent amnesty is Patrick McIntyre, who failed to return from home leave in 1986."}, {"url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxj574/ceo-celebrates-worker-who-sold-family-dog-after-he-demanded-they-return-to-office", "page_content": "In a virtual town hall last week, the CEO of a Utah-based digital marketing and technology company, who is forcing employees to return to the office, celebrated the sacrifice of a worker who had to sell the family dog as a result of his decisions. He also questioned the motives of those who disagreed, accusing some of quiet quitting, and waxed skeptical on the compatibility of working full time with serving as a primary caregiver to children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision by Clearlink CEO James Clarke to mandate in-office work had come as a surprise to many workers, seeing as Clarke himself had said over email as recently as late October that he had \u201cno plans\u201d to mandate in-office work and some Clearlink employees had been hired with the understanding that the company was \u201cremote-first.\u201d\n\nClearlink CEO James Clarke had told employees in no uncertain terms as recently as October that there were \"no plans\" to require a return to office.\n\nBut \u201ccircumstances\u201d had \u201cchanged,\u201d the company told employees this month, as Clearlink, like many others, has struggled to adapt to a teetering economy and recently undergone a round of layoffs. To jumpstart the firm, Clarke sent a company-wide email on April 3 saying that people who live within 50 miles of the company\u2019s new headquarters in Draper, Utah, would be required to come into the office four days a week, with limited exceptions, starting April 17. The decision, he wrote, was made to improve the company\u2019s performance amid a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment.\n\nDuring a video meeting to explain the reasoning behind the changes, Clarke unleashed on his employees, saying he had deduced that some 30 employees had not opened their laptops for a month (the quiet quitters); wondering aloud if some remote employees were secretly working multiple jobs; and asking the company to increase productivity to \u201c30 to 50 times our normal production\u201d as a result of recent advances in artificial intelligence while also making reference to the \u201cJudeo-Christian ethic\u201d and noting, for unclear reasons, that he went to Oxford and Harvard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll he was asking, he said, is that people come into the office and give their \u201cblood, sweat, and tears\u201d to the company. \u201cI challenge any of you to outwork me, but you won\u2019t,\u201d he added.\n\nIn hopes of rallying the troops, Clarke took the time to pay special attention to one employee who had sold the family dog as a result of his decision, describing it as an example of the \u201csacrifices that are being made\u201d and saying it broke his heart as someone who, he claimed, has been at the \u201chead of the humanization of pets movement.\u201d\n\nClarke also focused on concerns that the shift would cause undue harm to people who serve as primary caregivers for their children, who would have to pay for additional childcare. The CEO expressed skepticism that single and working mothers could meet company expectations while continuing to take care of their children, saying that while \u201cit can be done \u2026 it adds so much stress to a working mother\u2019s life that I would never want to put on anyone.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he said, it could be argued that having a full-time job and serving as a primary caregiver is \u201cneither fair to your employer nor fair to those children.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t necessarily believe that,\u201d he clarified. \u201cBut I do believe that only the rarest of full-time caregivers can also be productive and full-time employees at the same time.\u201d He proceeded to say he believed the data would support this \u201cin time,\u201d though he then noted that data can be warped and manipulated to prove any one particular point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have a tip about bosses behaving badly? From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.\n\nClearlink spokesperson Layne Watson declined to answer specific questions about the company\u2019s decision and communications, saying only that it was a matter of \u201cinternal Clearlink business\u201d and that the return-to-office mandate would help the company achieve its \u201ccollective goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to having these team members join us at our new world-class Global Headquarters in Draper, UT and appreciate the efforts of all of our committed team members\u2013which includes those who work in office and those who will continue to work remotely\u2013as we accomplish our best work together,\u201d Watson added.\n\nAlmost three months before the town hall, the Utah-based company had opened its new headquarters, which Clarke has referred to as \u201camazing,\u201d \u201ctop-tier,\u201d and \u201cworld class.\u201d As recently as October 26, Clarke had said over email that \u201cthere are no plans to require anyone to work in the new Draper office or the St. Pete office,\u201d even bolding the words for emphasis.\n\nBut in the video meeting, he admitted that he \u201cperhaps\u201d was \u201cnaive\u201d in hoping that people would come anyway. \u201cI thought those of you\u2014all of you\u2014would want to be in this world-class facility every single day. Alas, that\u2019s not been the case,\u201d he said in the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CEO said he had seen improved \u201ccollaboration, productivity, and accountability\u201d among those who had started to come in, and since the country had \u201cmoved out of the pandemic\u201d he believed it was time for the shift.\n\nJames Clarke said he was inspired to make the decision, in part, after talking to people who told him \"how much better they feel being\" in the company's new headquarters.\n\nIn a company document further explaining the decision, Clearlink said it was a \u201cpermanent decision,\u201d \u201cnot optional\u201d and would not be revisited \u201cunless specific needs for the business arise.\u201d However, the company also noted that the mandate would only apply to the 35 percent of the workforce (\u201cabout 275 people\u201d) that lived within the 50-mile radius of the company headquarters, as determined by a combination of employees\u2019 on-file addresses and Google Maps.\n\nThe company added that the employees could not bypass the mandate by now moving outside of the radius, saying that would be \u201ccounterproductive to the purpose of this decision.\u201d\n\nOutside of special exceptions, those workers unwilling to come into the office would face \u201ccorrective action,\u201d according to the document. \u201cLeadership believes this is the best decision at this time to ensure the near and long-term success of the company,\u201d Clearlink stated.\n\nIn the document, the company addressed a number of potential concerns, like why a phased approach was not taken (\u201cthe urgency to improve our business results accelerated the need to to have as many hands on deck as possible\u201d); whether people who live as far away as 49 miles from the office will receive raises in order to live closer (\u201cThere is no requirement for employees to move closer to the office. As such, no additional compensation or reimbursement will be offered\u201d); and whether the company would consider offering in-office daycare (\u201cGiven the recent business results, this is not something that can be considered at this time\u201d). The company added it would not be reinstituting UberEats vouchers either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company indicated that it understood the mandate might anger employees who had started a job at Clearlink since the pandemic with the understanding that they would be allowed to work remotely, but that such understandings were no longer relevant in the new climate.\n\nClearlink indicated that it understood the mandate might anger employees who had started a job at Clearlink since the pandemic with the understanding that they would be allowed to work remotely.\n\nAn edited video of Clarke\u2019s remarks was soon uploaded to Reddit and YouTube, eliciting outrage online. \u201cWho would want to work for someone like this?\u201d one Reddit user asked. Said another, \u201cIf you work at clear link you should quit [sic].\u201d\n\nClearlink successfully got the sites to take the video down, citing a copyright claim. But Motherboard was able to obtain a copy\u2014which has since been reproduced online\u2014as well as speak with two employees and obtain various emails, memos, and additional video materials.\n\nLast year, Clarke returned to the company as CEO after selling the company a decade earlier and starting an investment firm. He had been inspired to start the company and become his own boss in 2001 after dealing with an \u201cextremely difficult manager\u201d in college, he has said.\n\nIn a column for the tech and business site Utah Business last year, Clarke wrote about the struggles of re-joining the company during the pandemic. He said he felt like an \u201coutsider,\u201d \u201csome outside \u2018Wall Street\u2019 guy\u201d and \u201ca nobody who has to re-earn the respect of the people who make Clearlink the great company it is.\u201d What made it worse, he wrote, was that everyone was working from home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cClearlink declared itself a virtual company, and we miss out on that tactile, real element that the best of business requires. Getting to know the current employees and trying to pivot and scale the business has been challenging in this virtual environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that a combination of some virtual but primarily an in-person environment is what we really allow for the best of business\u2014and the best of people\u2014to operate.\u201d\n\nIn the meeting this month, Clarke\u2019s tone was substantially harsher. At one point, he seemed to lash out at the people who had controlled the company before he regained power, referring to one as a former \u201cski guide\u201d and another as a former bank teller.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who you trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also leveled accusations at his own employees that seemed to have been building up inside him since he returned to the company, criticizing what he described as too many people\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d willingness to \u201cbackbite or murmur or find fault or criticize.\u201d He brought up \u201cnonsense\u201d questions and a lack of general \u201crespect\u201d; referred to some of his own employees as \u201ccritics or pundits\u201d with no real answers; and proclaimed that diversity, equity, and inclusion \u201ccan only exist where you can respect and even revere the person who directly opposes your view or those of your chosen community.\u201d (Clarke reportedly hosted a series of fundraisers for Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis in Utah last summer alongside other high-profile business leaders.)\n\n\u201cMany would argue that you are only the voice of your underserved community,\u201d he said, presumably referring to employees who had said things that upset him. But, he added, \u201cMany who have been the loudest voices are not representing their community at all\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these town halls, I alone have been compared to a convicted Wall Street felon. I\u2019ve been criticized for my faith, where I went to college and it wasn\u2019t at all about Harvard or Oxford, two universities of which I'm an alum, but were also founded and operated under the Judeo-Christian ethic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prejudice, contention, hypocrisy and unfairness of these statements made by many who remain at Clearlink were made by none who knew me.\u201d\n\nClarke attended Brigham Young University as an undergraduate. A separate video reviewed by Motherboard showed Clarke stating that the \u201cconvicted Wall Street felon\u201d in question was Gordon Gekko, the antagonist of the 1987 Oliver Stone movie Wall Street. It appears that such comments will no longer be tolerated."}]}
