{"Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was born on November 21, 1963.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moises-Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, (born November 21, 1963, Caracas, Venezuela), Venezuelan-born playwright and director who is best known for perceptive and moving plays often rooted in issues of sexuality. He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-08-09/review-moises-kaufman-here-there-are-blueberries-play", "page_content": "\u201cHere There Are Blueberries,\u201d a play conceived and directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, tells the true story of an album of photographs that was sent to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2007.\n\nThe sender, a retired United States Army intelligence officer, found the album shortly after the war when he was living in Frankfurt, Germany. Nearing the end of his life, he believed the collection of photos from the Auschwitz concentration camp would be of historical interest. He was right, though it took some impressive detective work to reveal the value of what had been gathering dust in his archives for more than 60 years.\n\nThe play, which is having its world premiere at La Jolla Playhouse in a co-production with Tectonic Theatre Project, meditates on the many aspects of this disturbingly resonant story. Kaufman, the artistic director of Tectonic, and Amanda Gronich, a charter member of the company, co-wrote the script, which hews to the factual record while taking artistic liberties for the sake of dramatic clarity, economy and force.\n\nThe authors worked closely together on \u201cThe Laramie Project,\u201d the groundbreaking nonfiction drama about the 1998 murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. In \u201cHere There Are Blueberries,\u201d they tackle with courage and compassion the nature of murderous complicity on an unfathomable scale.\n\nThe story of the album is told from the vantage of the researchers who are piecing together information about the figures in the photos. The images, which are integral to the play, received so much attention when the news broke of their discovery that the museum\u2019s website crashed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebecca Erbelding (Elizabeth Stahlmann), an archivist at the museum, is initially skeptical of the claim that the photos are from Auschwitz when she\u2019s first contacted by the donor. But after the album arrives, her attention is seized by a photo of Josef Mengele, one of the most depraved doctors of the Third Reich.\n\nPreviously, she explains, there had been no photographic evidence of Mengele at Auschwitz. Sensing the import of what was sent to her, she consults with a senior colleague.\n\nA closer look at the photos by Judy Cohen (Rosina Reynolds), the director of the museum\u2019s photographic collection, reveals a central figure in upholding the Nazi regime, Rudolf H\u00f6ss. As Judy explains, \u201cHe built Auschwitz, and he ran it for years. He\u2019s responsible for everything we think of as the camp: the barracks, the guard towers, the electrified fences, the extermination infrastructure ... the whole organization.\u201d\n\nThe album contains 116 photos with captions in German. The figures in the photos aren\u2019t the prisoners but the people who ran the camp. Ordinary Germans, bonding together on the job, taking part in official ceremonies and enjoying recreational activities. The pictures provide a haunting illustration of what the philosopher Hannah Arendt famously called \u201cthe banality of evil.\u201d\n\nPhotographic analysis augmented by ingenious research leads to the conclusion that the album belonged to Karl H\u00f6cker (Scott Barrow). A former bank teller, he rose to become a top administrator of Auschwitz \u2014 motivated, it seems, not by ideology but by the career opportunism of a petty bureaucrat.\n\nKaufman and Gronich deliberate on the many historical and moral questions that the real-life Rebecca and her colleagues grappled with as they closely studied the album. The more information they uncover, the more they struggle to understand the reality before them.\n\nThere is particular interest in a lodge that was built to provide a place for Nazi officers to vacation with their families to relieve job stress. This rustic leisure stands in stark contrast to the grim reality of the crematoria blowing smoke a few miles away.\n\nA photo of women who worked in the camp as telephone, telegraph and radio operators captures them doing calisthenics with a look of relaxed bonhomie. Another shows them on a bridge in uniform exuberantly gathered as a man plays the accordion.\n\nWhat did these people know about their place of employment? Specialization of labor allowed the workers to deny any knowledge of what was happening at Auschwitz. But as the researchers reveal, their ignorance was a convenient ruse.\n\nA photo of H\u00f6cker at the lodge serving blueberries to female personnel (the caption provides the play\u2019s title) is all the more horrifying for seeming so serene. The smiling faces suggest a utopia, but these are the managers and custodians of a living hell.\n\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was set up to remember the victims of the Nazi genocide. The staff is therefore forced to examine whether it is right to devote space to a collection of photos of perpetrators.\n\nHow should history be recalled? Should those who enabled atrocities have their names and faces blotted from the record? Ultimately, the museum staff deems it necessary to call attention to the way everyday citizens were corrupted by ideology, self-interest and a conspiracy of lies. How else can humanity be prevented from falling again into darkness?\n\n\u201cHere There Are Blueberries\u201d extends itself perhaps too far in following the stories of descendants of Nazis coming to terms with their heritage. The structure of the play assumes the elasticity of a PowerPoint presentation, scattering focus.\n\nAlthough this is not a verbatim drama, interviews are the source of the dramatic material. The editing hasn\u2019t yet reached its optimal form. But the strength of the work is less in the dramatic writing than in the creation of a contemplative theatrical space.\n\nKaufman, who\u2019s the son of a Holocaust survivor, infuses his company with a quiet moral purpose that had me shedding tears for much of the production\u2019s 90-minute running time. An ensemble of eight, with each actor taking on multiple roles, majestically balances thought and feeling.\n\nPhotographs are projected onto Derek McLane\u2019s set, which moves from the museum\u2019s research office into a realm of fluid memory. The pictures are brought to life aurally as well as visually, with cast members contributing to the soundscape. But what is most powerful is the way silence is interwoven. Kaufman conducts this impeccable production with symphonic subtlety.\n\nThe sincerity of this collective effort powerfully communicates the grave significance of this trove of artifacts almost lost to time. History is once again knocking. Will we unstop our ears and learn from the mistakes of the past?"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsages.com/moises-kaufman/", "page_content": "Birth Name: Moises Kaufman Occupation: Playwright Born In: Venezuela Birthdate: November 21, 1963 Age: 59 years old (as of 2023) Ethnicity: Unknown Nationality: Venezuelan Sexuality: N/A\n\nMoises Kaufman was born on the 21st of November, 1963.

During the next year, we would return to Laramie several times and conduct over two hundred interviews. The play you are about to see is edited from those interviews, as well as from journal entries by members of the company and other found texts. Company member Greg Pierotti:\n\ngreg pierotti: My first interview was with Detective Sergeant Hing of the Laramie Police Department. At the start of the interview he was sitting behind his desk, sitting something like this (he transforms into Sergeant Hing):\n\nI was born and raised here.\n\nMy family is, uh, third generation.\n\nMy grandparents moved here in the early nineteen hundreds.\n\nWe've had basically three, well, my daughter makes it fourth generation.\n\nQuite a while. . . . It's a good place to live. Good people--lots of space.\n\nNow, all the towns in southern Wyoming are laid out and spaced because of the railroad came through.\n\nIt was how far they could go before having to refuel and rewater.\n\nAnd, uh, Laramie was a major stopping point.\n\nThat's why the towns are spaced so far apart.\n\nWe're one of the largest states in the country, and the least populated.\n\nrebecca hilliker: There's so much space between people and towns here, so much time for reflection.\n\nnarrator: Rebecca Hilliker, head of the theater department at the University of Wyoming:\n\nrebecca hilliker: You have an opportunity to be happy in your life here. I found that people here were nicer than in the Midwest, where I used to teach, because they were happy. They were glad the sun was shining. And it shines a lot here.\n\nsergeant hing: What you have is, you have your old-time traditional-type ranchers, they've been here forever--Laramie's been the hub of where they come for their supplies and stuff like that.\n\neileen engen: Stewardship is one thing all our ancestors taught us.\n\nnarrator: Eileen Engen, rancher:\n\neileen engen: If you don't take care of the land, then you ruin it and you lose your living. So you first of all have to take care of your land and do everything you can to improve it.\n\ndoc o'connor: I love it here.\n\nnarrator: Doc O'Connor, limousine driver:\n\ndoc o'connor: You couldn't put me back in that mess out there back east. Best thing about it is the climate. The cold, the wind. They say the Wyoming wind'll drive a man insane. But you know what? It don't bother me. Well, some of the times it bothers me. But most of the time it don't.\n\nsergeant hing: And then you got, uh, the university population.\n\nphilip dubois: I moved here after living in a couple of big cities.\n\nnarrator: Philip Dubois, president of the University of Wyoming:\n\nphilip dubois: I loved it there. But you'd have to be out of your mind to let your kids out after dark. And here, in the summertime, my kids play out at night till eleven and I don't think twice about it.\n\nsergeant hing: And then you have the people who live in Laramie, basically.\n\nzackie salmon: I moved here from rural Texas.\n\nnarrator: Zackie Salmon, Laramie resident:\n\nzackie salmon: Now, in Laramie, if you don't know a person, you will definitely know someone they know. So it can only be one degree removed at most. And for me--I love it! I mean, I love to go to the grocery store 'cause I get to visit with four or five or six people every time I go. And I don't really mind people knowing my business--'cause what's my business? I mean, my business is basically good.\n\ndoc o'connor: I like the trains, too. They don't bother me. Well, some of the times they bother me, but most times they don't. Even though one goes by every thirteen minutes out where I live. . . .\n\nnarrator: Doc actually lives up in Bossler. But everybody in Laramie knows him. He's also not really a doctor.\n\ndoc o'connor: They used to carry cattle . . . them trains. Now all they carry is diapers and cars.\n\napril silva: I grew up in Cody, Wyoming.\n\nnarrator: April Silva, university student:\n\napril silva: Laramie is better than where I grew up. I'll give it that.\n\nsergeant hing: It's a good place to live. Good people, lots of space. Now, when the incident happened with that boy, a lot of press people came here. And one time some of them followed me out to the crime scene. And uh, well, it was a beautiful day, absolutely gorgeous day, real clear and crisp and the sky was that blue that, uh . . . you know, you'll never be able to paint, it's just sky blue--it's just gorgeous. And the mountains in the background and a little snow on 'em, and this one reporter, uh, lady . . . person, that was out there, she said . . .\n\nreporter: Well, who found the boy, who was out here anyway?\n\nsergeant hing: And I said, \"Well, this is a really popular area for people to run, and mountain biking's really big out here, horseback riding, it's just, well, it's close to town.\" And she looked at me and she said:\n\nreporter: Who in the hell would want to run out here?\n\nsergeant hing: And I'm thinking, \"Lady, you're just missing the point.\" You know, all you got to do is turn around, see the mountains, smell the air, listen to the birds, just take in what's around you. And they were just--nothing but the story. I didn't feel judged, I felt that they were stupid. They're, they're missing the point--they're just missing the whole point.\n\njedadiah schultz: It's hard to talk about Laramie now, to tell you what Laramie is, for us.\n\nnarrator: Jedadiah Schultz:\n\njedadiah schultz: If you would have asked me before, I would have told you Laramie is a beautiful town, secluded enough that you can have your own identity. . . . A town with a strong sense of community--everyone knows everyone. . . . A town with a personality that most larger cities are stripped of. Now, after Matthew, I would say that Laramie is a town defined by an accident, a crime. We've become Waco, we've become Jasper. We're a noun, a definition, a sign. We may be able to get rid of that . . . but it will sure take a while.\n\nMoment: Journal Entries\n\nnarrator: Journal entries--members of the company. Andy Paris:\n\nandy paris: Mois?s called saying he had an idea for his next theater project. But there was a somberness to his voice, so I asked what it was all about and he told me he wanted to do a piece about what's happening in Wyoming.\n\nnarrator: Stephen Belber:\n\nstephen belber: Leigh told me the company was thinking of going out to Laramie to conduct interviews and that they wanted me to come. But I'm hesitant. I have no real interest in prying into a town's unraveling.\n\nnarrator: Amanda Gronich:\n\namanda gronich: I've never done anything like this in my life. How do you get people to talk to you? What do you ask?\n\nnarrator: Mois?s Kaufman:\n\nmois?s kaufman: The company has agreed that we should go to Laramie for a week and interview people.\n\nAm a bit afraid about taking ten people in a trip of this nature. Must make some safety rules. No one works alone. Everyone carries cell phones. Have made some preliminary contacts with Rebecca Hilliker, head of the theater department at the University of Wyoming. She is hosting a party for us our first night in Laramie and has promised to introduce us to possible interviewees.\n\nMoment: Rebecca Hilliker\n\nrebecca hilliker: I must tell you that when I first heard that you were thinking of coming here, when you first called me, I wanted to say, You've just kicked me in the stomach. Why are you doing this to me?\n\nBut then I thought, That's stupid, you're not doing this to me. And, more important, I thought about it and decided that we've had so much negative closure on this whole thing. And the students really need to talk. When this happened they started talking about it, and then the media descended and all dialogue stopped.\n\nYou know, I really love my students because they are free thinkers. And you may not like what they have to say, and you may not like their opinions, because they can be very redneck, but they are honest and they're truthful--so there's an excitement here, there's a dynamic here with my students that I never had when I was in the Midwest or in North Dakota, because there, there was so much Puritanism that dictated how people looked at the world that a lot of times they didn't have an opinion, you couldn't get them to express an opinion. And, quite honestly, I'd rather have opinions that I don't like--and have that dynamic in education.\n\nThere's a student I think you should talk to. His name is Jedadiah Schultz.\n\nMoment: Angels in America\n\njedadiah schultz: I've lived in Wyoming my whole life. The family has been in Wyoming, well . . . for generations. Now when it came time to go to college, my parents can't--couldn't afford to send me to college. I wanted to study theater. And I knew that if I was going to go to college I was going to have to get on a scholarship--and so, uh, they have this competition each year, this Wyoming state high school competition. And I knew that if I didn't take first place in, uh, duets that I wasn't gonna get a scholarship. So I went to the theater department of the university looking for good scenes, and I asked one of the professors--I was like, \"I need--I need a killer scene,\" and he was like, \"Here you go, this is it.\" And it was from Angels in America.\n\nSo I read it and I knew that I could win best scene if I did a good enough job.\n\nAnd when the time came I told my mom and dad so that they would come to the competition. Now you have to understand, my parents go to everything--every ball game, every hockey game--everything I've ever done.\n\nAnd they brought me into their room and told me that if I did that scene, that they would not come to see me in the competition. Because they believed that it is wrong--that homosexuality is wrong--they felt that strongly about it that they didn't want to come see their son do probably the most important thing he'd done to that point in his life. And I didn't know what to do.\n\nI had never, ever gone against my parents' wishes. So I was kind of worried about it. But I decided to do it.\n\nAnd all I can remember about the competition is that when we were done, me and my scene partner, we came up to each other and we shook hands and there was a standing ovation.\n\nOh, man, it was amazing! And we took first place and we won. And that's how come I can afford to be here at the university, because of that scene. It was one of the best moments of my life. And my parents weren't there. And to this day, that was the one thing that my parents didn't see me do.\n\nAnd thinking back on it, I think, why did I do it? Why did I oppose my parents? 'Cause I'm not gay. So why did I do it? And I guess the only honest answer I can give is that, well (he chuckles) I wanted to win. It was such a good scene; it was like the best scene!\n\nDo you know Mr. Kushner? Maybe you can tell him.\n\nMoment: Journal Entries\n\nnarrator: Company member Greg Pierotti:\n\ngreg pierotti: We arrived today in the Denver Airport and drove to Laramie. The moment we crossed the Wyoming border I swear I saw a herd of buffalo. Also, I thought it was strange that the Wyoming sign said: wyoming--like no place on earth instead of wyoming--like no place else on earth.\n\nnarrator: Company member Leigh Fondakowski:\n\nleigh fondakowski: I stopped at a local inn for a bite to eat. And my waitress said to me:\n\nwaitress: Hi, my name is Debbie. I was born in nineteen fifty-four and Debbie Reynolds was big then, so, yes, there are a lot of us around, but I promise that I won't slap you if you leave your elbows on the table.\n\nmois?s kaufman: Today Leigh tried to explain to me to no avail what chicken fried steak was.\n\nwaitress: Now, are you from Wyoming? Or are you just passing through?\n\nleigh fondakowski: We're just passing through.\n\nnarrator: Company member Barbara Pitts:\n\nbarbara pitts: We arrived in Laramie tonight. Just past the welcome to laramie sign--population 26,687--the first thing to greet us was Wal-Mart. In the dark, we could be on any main drag in America--fast-food chains, gas stations. But as we drove into the downtown area by the railroad tracks, the buildings still look like a turn-of-the-century western town. Oh, and as we passed the University Inn, on the sign where amenities such as heated pool or cable TV are usually touted, it said: hate is not a laramie value.\n\nnarrator: Greg Pierotti:\n\nMoment: Alison and Marge\n\ngreg pierotti: I met today with two longtime Laramie residents, Alison Mears and Marge Murray, two social service workers who taught me a thing or two.\n\nalison mears: Well, what Laramie used to be like when Marge was growing up, well, it was mostly rural.\n\nmarge murray: Yeah, it was. I enjoyed it, you know. My kids all had horses.\n\nalison mears: Well, there was more land, I mean, you could keep your pet cow. Your horse. Your little chickens. You know, just have your little bit of acreage.\n\nmarge murray: Yeah, I could run around the house in my all togethers, do the housework while the kids were in school. And nobody could see me. And if they got that close . . .\n\nalison mears: Well, then that's their problem.\n\nmarge murray: Yeah.\n\ngreg pierotti: I just want to make sure I got the expression right: in your all togethers?\n\nmarge murray: Well, yeah, honey, why wear clothes?\n\nalison mears: Now, how's he gonna use that in his play?\n\ngreg pierotti: So this was a big ranching town?\n\nalison mears: Oh, not just ranching, this was a big railroad town at one time. Before they moved everything to Cheyenne and Green River and Omaha. So now, well, it's just a drive-through spot for the railroad--because even, what was it, in the fifties? Well, they had one big roundhouse, and they had such a shop they could build a complete engine.\n\nmarge murray: They did, my mom worked there.\n\ngreg pierotti: Your mom worked in a roundhouse?\n\nmarge murray: Yep. She washed engines. Her name was Minnie. We used to, you know, sing that song for her, you know that song.\n\ngreg pierotti: What song?\n\nmarge murray: \"Run for the roundhouse, Minnie, they can't corner you there.\"\n\n(They crack up.)\n\nalison mears: But I'll tell you, Wyoming is bad in terms of jobs. I mean, the university has the big high whoop-de-do jobs. But Wyoming, unless you're a professional, well, the bulk of the people are working minimum-wage jobs."}, {"url": "https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/america-the-day-msna216146", "page_content": "Like a lot of Americans, I remember November 22, 1963, but not November 21.

And most people alive today have no memory of the run-up to Kennedy\u2019s assassination in Dallas, for an even simpler reason: they had not yet been born.\n\nWhat was America like in 1963, before Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby became household names?\n\nThe price of a stamp, at five cents, was lower, after inflation, than it is today; the minimum wage, at $1.25 an hour, was higher.\n\nMedian family income was about $6,200, but for \u201cnonwhite\u201d (mainly black) families, it was $3,465. The black-white income gap is narrower today, but only by about six percentage points.\n\nMartin Luther King had given his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech three months earlier; all the major civil rights laws had yet to be enacted.\n\nNew York City still had six daily newspapers. A seventh, the Hearst-owned Daily Mirror, had died the month before, the victim of a lengthy newspaper strike whose aftereffects would, over the next four years, kill off three more.\n\nDiane Sawyer, age 17, was America\u2019s reigning Junior Miss--a competition since renamed \u201cDistinguished Young Women,\u201d probably in deference to the social movement that Betty Friedan helped create that same year by publishing \"The Feminine Mystique.\"\n\nRonald Reagan--having recently ended an eight-year stint with General Electric, for whom he\u2019d been a TV host and speechmaker\u2014accepted his final film role, that of mob boss Jack Browning in \"The Killers.\" It would be the only movie Reagan made after switching his registration from Democrat to Republican, and (coincidentally) the only one in which he played the bad guy.\n\nThe U.S. media was starting to take note of the Beatles phenomenon in Britain, though mainly to sneer. \u201cThe London Times has carried the sobering report that the Beatles may bring their Mersey sound to the United States,\u201d Edwin Newman reported November 18 on NBC\u2019s Huntley-Brinkley Report, \u201cto which it may be rejoined, \u2018Show us no Mersey.\u2019\u201d\n\nChronologically, 1963 marked a rough midpoint between the death of the last surviving veteran of the Civil War (1956) and the first moon landing (1969); between Hitler\u2019s defeat (1945) and the first clinical recognition of the AIDS epidemic (1981); and between the Paris premiere of Stravinsky\u2019s \"Rite of Spring\" (1913) and the final episode of \"Breaking Bad\" (2013).\n\nOn November 21, 1963, Robert Stroud, the \u201cBirdman of Alcatraz\u201d whose life was romanticized in a 1962 movie starring Burt Lancaster\u2014Stroud\u2019s ornithological enthusiasms did not, in fact, gentle his violent impulses\u2014died at 73. (Stroud was never permitted to see the film.) That same day saw the births of the actress Nicollette Sheridan (\"The Sure Thing,\" \"Desperate Housewives\"), the playwright-director Moises Kaufman (\"The Laramie Project\"), and Tony McConkey, a conservative Republican member of Maryland\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nIt\u2019s November 21, and you want to go to the movies. What\u2019s playing? \"Under The Yum Yum Tree,\" \"The Incredible Journey,\" \"It\u2019s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,\" John Wayne in \"McClintock!,\" Vincent Price in \"Twice-Told Tales,\" and James Stewart and Sandra Dee in \"Take Her, She\u2019s Mine\" (remembered today solely because the Dee character was loosely based on the teenage Nora Ephron; her parents wrote it).\n\nHmm. Maybe you\u2019ll stay in.\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday, right? ABC\u2019s got \"Donna Reed\" and \"My Three Sons,\" CBS has \"Rawhide,\" and NBC has something called \"Temple Houston\" (Perry Mason-goes-west drama starring Jeffrey Hunter; lasted only one season).\n\nOr maybe you\u2019ll just catch up on your reading. Mary McCarthy\u2019s racy \"The Group\" tops The New York Times best-seller list for fiction. The non-fiction list is headed by \"JFK: The Man and the Myth,\" a hatchet job by Victor Lasky, followed (somewhat ominously) by \"The American Way of Death,\" Jessica Mitford\u2019s expose of the funeral industry, at number two.\n\nKennedy was on his way to Dallas, but on November 21 Richard Nixon was already there, to attend a meeting of the American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages. After losing the 1960 presidential race to Kennedy, Nixon had lost the 1962 California gubernatorial race to Pat Brown. Now he was a partner in the New York law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, & Mitchell, where Nixon\u2019s friend Donald Kendall, president of Pepsi, was a client. Also in attendance at the bottlers meeting was the actress Joan Crawford, widow of Pepsi\u2019s former chairman.\n\nOn the morning of November 21, Nixon met with reporters at the Baker Hotel in downtown Dallas. He noted that Kennedy had lost support in Texas, which was true; indeed, that was Kennedy\u2019s main reason for visiting the state with his Texan vice-president, Lyndon Johnson.\n\n\u201cWe were going to do something about Castro in Cuba,\u201d Nixon told the reporters. \u201cWe were going to do something about American prestige abroad, and also about sort-of-permanent unemployment\u201d (then 5.7%). \u201cWe find that on all of these issues there\u2019s been no action.\u201d Nixon added that Johnson\u2019s \u201cstock is not as high in Texas, at least from what I\u2019ve seen, as it was. In 1960, Lyndon was a help. In 1964 he might not be.\u201d A Dallas News headline the next day blared, \u201cNixon Predicts JFK May Drop Johnson.\u201d\n\nThere was, in fact, much gossip about whether Kennedy might dump Johnson from the 1964 ticket, and Kennedy\u2019s secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, later recalled that before he left for Dallas Kennedy told her he might replace Johnson with North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford. Of particular concern was the ethics investigation of Bobby Baker, Secretary of the Senate and a Johnson prot\u00e9g\u00e9 when Johnson was Senate majority leader. Outrageous stories alleging that Baker paid bribes and hosted debauched parties in which naked young prostitutes poured champagne over each other were embarrassing the Kennedy administration, and the investigation was starting to suggest Johnson knew about them.\n\nAn article published in Life magazine on Nov. 18 quoted one anonymous source calling Baker (who eventually did jail time for larceny, fraud and tax evasion) \u201cLyndon\u2019s bluntest instrument in running the show.\u201d Two former Life magazine editors later told Johnson biographer Robert Caro that the magazine was preparing a more ambitious investigation into Johnson\u2019s own extensive history of ethically questionable financial dealings. Life would scrub the project after November 22, first because the assassination was the only story, and later because it wanted to give the new president a chance to succeed.\n\nAnother journalistic casualty of the assassination was a special CIA issue of the short-lived satirical magazine Monocle, edited by Victor Navasky and dated November 19, 1963. Because of the assassination, Navasky would recall in his 2005 memoir, \"A Matter of Opinion,\" \u201cmost of the 75,000 copies never left the warehouse.\u201d The decision not to distribute was a costly one, and within a couple of years Monocle was no more.\n\nDuring a Nov. 21 stopover with Kennedy in San Antonio, Johnson suffered another setback. Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough, a Democrat, was feuding with Texas Governor (and fellow Democrat) John Connally. Kennedy wanted Johnson to put an end to it; winning Texas in 1964 would be difficult enough without a Democratic party riven by conflict. To resolve the matter, Johnson had to talk to Yarborough. But Yarborough refused--in full view of reporters--to ride in a motorcade with Johnson. A headline in the next morning\u2019s Dallas News would read, \u201cYarborough Snubs LBJ.\u201d Connally, Johnson felt, was also treating him disrespectfully, and later, in a Houston hotel room, Caro writes in \"The Passage of Power,\" \u201cthere were, perhaps for the first time since Kennedy had been elected, loud, angry words directly between the president and the vice president.\u201d\n\nAll of this\u2014the investigations, the slights, Johnson\u2019s fears about his political future\u2014would evaporate on Nov. 22.\n\nIn San Antonio, Air Force One landed in Lackland Air Force Base, where the future playwright John Guare (\"Six Degrees of Separation\") had reported the previous month for basic training. November 21 marked the first interruption Guare recalls from \u201cthe endless calisthenics, aimless marching, learning to fire a rifle, kitchen duty, learning to take orders.\u201d Guare\u2019s platoon stood at attention and saluted the president, vice president, and their wives on a distant landing strip. Then it was time for a smoke. According to Guare (whose monologue about that day was included in a recent multimedia event at New York\u2019s Symphony Space and reprinted in the Huffington Post) his \u201cfellow airmen basics\u201d used this precious free time to mutter one hateful thing after another about the visiting party: \u201cWe got to stand in this hot sun for a n----- lover?\u201d \u201cHe don't belong in Texas.\u201d \u201cHe ain\u2019t my president.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to show that wife of his what a man is.\u201d And so on. When word came the next day that Kennedy was dead, Guare writes, \u201ca cheer went up\u2026. I have never felt so isolated in my life as I did that day.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s own experience of November 21 is, like Kennedy himself, a bit of a cipher. His aide Kenny O\u2019Donnell recalled him saying that morning, in the White House, \u201cI feel great. My back feels better than it\u2019s felt in years.\u201d The historian William Manchester reported in his book \"Death of A President\" that Kennedy told Jackie he looked forward to riding that weekend at the Johnson ranch. But he was wearing a back brace, and at a speech later that day in Houston, Johnson aide Jack Valenti told Manchester, he observed Kennedy\u2019s hands \u201cvibrating so violently at times that they seemed palsied,\u201d a symptom of Kennedy\u2019s Addison\u2019s disease.\n\nA helicopter flew the Kennedys to Andrew Air Force Base at 10:45 a.m.; on the flight to San Antonio, the president asked aides about his brother Bobby\u2019s 38th birthday party the night before, which he hadn\u2019t attended. (Bobby himself spent most of Nov. 21st in a Justice department meeting about targeting organized crime.) None of Kennedy\u2019s public comments that day is particularly memorable. Kennedy spent much of the day trying to get aides to twist Yarborough\u2019s arm into talking to Johnson. He and Jackie spent the night at Fort Worth\u2019s Texas Hotel, in a suite decorated with paintings by Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, and others, lent by local collectors. The splendor was lost on them, because they didn\u2019t arrive at their hotel until after midnight and went straight to bed.\n\nNot quite one month before, on October 24, United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had given a speech in Dallas and been jeered by an angry right wing crowd shouting \u201cCommunist!\u201d and \u201cTraitor!\u201d and \u201cKennedy will get his reward in hell.\u201d Stevenson said to one heckler: \u201cSurely, my dear friend, I don\u2019t have to come here from Illinois to teach Texas manners, do I?\u201d The protesters, egged on by a rally staged the night before by retired Army Major General Edwin Walker, a prominent, mentally unstable, and ultraconservative Dallas activist, had spat upon Stevenson and whacked him in the head with a placard that said \u201cIf You Seek Peace, Ask Jesus.\u201d The bearer was Cora Lacey Frederickson, wife of a Dallas insurance executive; Dallas\u2019 haters were drawn not from society\u2019s fringes but from its pathologically angry haute bourgeoisie.\n\nThis was well known to the rest of the country. James McAuley argued in a recent New York Times essay on Dallas before the assassination that it was parodied by Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews in a (retrospectively creepy) TV production number of the song \u201cBig D\u201d that ended with Burnett pulling a gun on Andrews and saying, \u201cWhat are ya, some kinda nut?\u201d\n\nThe Stevenson incident left Dallas\u2019s hard right feeling more aggrieved than ashamed. On the morning of November 22, an ad in the Dallas News read: \u201cWelcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas. A city so disgraced by a recent Liberal smear attempt that its citizens have just elected two more Conservative Americans to public office.\u201d The ad, taken out by a group that called itself The American Fact-Finding Committee, continued: \u201cA city that will continue to grow and prosper despite efforts by you and your administration to penalize it for its nonconformity to \u2018New Frontierism.\u2019\u201d\n\nKennedy laughed it off, but the hatred in Dallas was real. A \u201cWanted For Treason\u201d leaflet distributed in Dallas in the days before Kennedy\u2019s visit accused Kennedy of (among other crimes) giving \u201csupport and encouragement to the Communist inspired racial riots\u201d and appointing \u201canti-Christians to Federal office.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Stevenson incident, a woman named Nelle Doyle had written White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger to urge him not to send the president there because of \u201cthis \u2018hoodlum mob\u2019 here in Dallas\u2026 it is a dreadful thought, but all remember the fate of President McKinley.\u201d\n\nStrangely, though, it wasn\u2019t a right-wing extremist who would end Kennedy\u2019s life, but a confused and angry Marxist\u2014one who, seven months earlier, fired a shot not at Kennedy, nor Connolly, nor Johnson, nor Yarborough, but at Walker, whom he considered a fascist.\n\nThat time, Oswald missed."}, {"url": "https://glreview.org/article/the-curious-case-of-gordon-merrick/", "page_content": "The work of Kinsey, Hooker, and others all emboldened a new brand of post-Stonewall gay liberation activists ready to engage in dramatic and confrontational tactics, including disrupting APA meetings and demanding equal time to refute the theories of homosexual pathology.\n\nTHE FIRST GLIMPSE I had of Thom Gunn was his picture in a poetry anthology titled The Modern Poets, edited by John Malcolm Brinnin and William Read.

He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein.

And as his theater group celebrates its 25th anniversary, he can reflect on a body of work that has impacted social and cultural norms worldwide.\n\nOn Thursday, September 22, in the East Room of the White House, President Barack Obama awarded the 2015 National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities Medal to distinguished recipients.

He founded his theater company, The Tectonic Theater Project, in 1991 with his now-husband Jeffrey LaHoste.\n\n\u201cWe started it in the dining room of our apartment. The first four years, we were performing in church basements,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cOften there were more people onstage than in the house.\u201d\n\nRELATED: These Latinos Were Honored with National Medals for Art, Humanities\n\nThe Tectonic Theater Project uses a unique process for conceiving and reimagining theater known as \u201cMoment Work.\u201d It enables actors, writers, designers, and directors to collaborate in creative storytelling.\n\nVenezuelan-born playwright/director. Moises Kaufman. The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\n\nUsing this technique, Kaufman wrote and directed Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde in 1997. This off-Broadway play, which The New York Times called \u201cabsolutely gripping,\u201d utilized actual testimony and transcripts from the trials of the iconic Wilde. Kaufman won a Lambda Literary Award, an award given for works that explore LGBT themes, for \"Gross Indecency\" in 1998.\n\nThat same year, just three months after the brutal murder of gay student Matthew Shepard, Kaufman took his theater group to Laramie, Wyoming to interview people in the town where the killing had taken place. They conducted over 200 interviews, totaling 400 hours, and the company then used these oral histories to write The Laramie Project.\n\n\u201cThe community was in shock,\u201d Kaufman recalled. \u201cThey never expected a murder like that to occur in their midst. We managed to capture, I think, something of the rawness and the experience the town was having at that time.\u201d\n\nKaufman and his siblings. Moises Kaufman\n\nActress Mercedes Herrero, who collaborated in the creation of \"The Laramie Project,\" described the process as \u201cpretty extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came from the Stanislavski (acting) tradition,\u201d Herrero said. \u201cMois\u00e9s was using this experimental form, not only gathering interviews, but also literally writing current events as they were happening. This was a new kind of theater to me, and it was mind-blowing.\u201d Herrero, who co-stars in House of Cards, added that working with Kaufman has made her \u201ca more politically aware being.\u201d\n\n\"The Laramie Project,\" about the town\u2019s reaction to Shepard\u2019s brutal killing, went on to become one of the most acclaimed plays of the year, and one of the most-produced works of the decade. It has been performed worldwide, and is often used to educate people about homophobia and anti-LGBT violence. It was also made into an HBO film written and directed by Kaufman.\n\nJudy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, told NBC News that \"The Laramie Project\" was very special to her. \u201cI think everybody can relate to an actor who is on stage. The audience is seeing somebody who is like them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings home how differently we all feel about things, and how we respond to things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt (the play) is not specifically about Matt,\u201d Shepard pointed out. \u201cBut it shows how society looks when we don\u2019t accept each other for who we are. It shows what happens when we are at odds with each other for no reason.\u201d\n\nShepard said that she hears from people all over the country who have \u201ccome out\u201d as LGBT after seeing or having been a part of the play.\n\n\u201cPeople say to me, are you a Latino writer? Are you a gay writer? Are you a Jewish writer? And I say yes to all.\"\n\n\u201cMois\u00e9s has absolutely moved the needle in terms of how people view bullying and hate crimes against LGBT people,\u201d said Shepard.\n\nKaufman and his theater company revisited Laramie to produce The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later in 2008.\n\nIn 2003, Kaufman directed the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning play I Am My Own Wife on Broadway. Also on Broadway, in 2009 he directed Jane Fonda in 33 Variations, and Robin Williams in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011. Kaufman\u2019s most recent Broadway show was a 2012-2013 revival of The Heiress, starring Jessica Chastain.\n\nGlenn Davis, Brad Fleischer, playwright Rajiv Joseph, Robin Willams, director Moises Kaufman, Arian Moayed & Hrach Titizian during the Broadway Opening Night Curtain Call for 'Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo' at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City.

When \"The Laramie Project\" was first being produced at colleges, there were protests from people who claimed it was being used to recruit students into homosexuality. Last year, Russia cut off funding for a production of \"Gross Indecency\" at the Moscow New Drama Theater because of its gay themes.\n\nBroadway writer/director Moises Kaufman as a young actor. Moises Kaufman\n\nKaufman is currently working on an adaptation of the opera \"Carmen,\" and has several events planned for this fall. On November 7, Jane Fonda will host the 25th anniversary gala for the Tectonic Theater Project. The event will feature celebrities reading excerpts from Tectonic\u2019s plays, including The Laramie Project and 33 Variations.\n\nOn November 10, Kaufman will be presented with the American Artist Award by Arena Stage in Washington D.C.\n\nThe Artistic Director of Arena Stage, Molly Smith, said that she was proud to have known Kaufman for almost two decades. \u201cI watched him in the initial stages of developing \"The Laramie Project.\" I have been so moved by his combination of theater, social commentary, and political fervor in the projects he has taken on,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe is a bold theater artist, and I think our audience loves that.\u201d\n\nWhen Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Smith noted, the president had Kaufman there as a recognition of the impact of his work.\n\nSmith also mentioned that Kaufman was \u201cone of the most gracious and warm individuals you could ever meet.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Kaufman has dealt with issues of identity. \u201cPeople say to me, are you a Latino writer? Are you a gay writer? Are you a Jewish writer? And I say yes to all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I am any good at what I do, then I\u2019m a Latino writer and I am a Jewish writer and I\u2019m a gay writer, and I\u2019m a New York writer. And I\u2019m a writer of all the things that I am as a human being.\u201d\n\nStill, Kaufman said that LGBT youth continue to face challenging circumstances as they grow up. \u201cAnyone who has ever had the experience of coming out will tell you that it is a process. It is a process for the person coming out, and for the people you are coming out to,\u201d he said. In his case, he explained, because his work dealt so publicly with issues of gender and sexuality, his parents had to learn how to deal with it.\n\nA picture of Moises Kaufman and his father Jose. Moises Kaufman\n\nAlthough Kaufman describes his mother and late father as \u201cvery proud and supportive\u201d of his work, he stressed that young LGBT kids often struggle with acceptance. \u201cThe question of whether things are getting better for LGBT youth is a complicated one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, yes, they are getting better. Having said that, there is an epidemic of bullying in high school, especially against LGBT kids,\u201d Kaufman continued, mentioning the high rates of suicide and depression among LGBT youth.\n\n\u201cSo I think that yes, things are getting better,\" said the playwright. \"But there is still a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-immigration-q-a-broadway-new-york-b2093556.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSeven years ago, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was approached to direct the Broadway musical \u201cParadise Square\u201d and, after reading it, he immediately said yes.\n\n\u201cI did this show because it spoke to me,\u201d the Venezuelan theater director and playwright says. \u201cSo much of my work occurs at the intersection of the personal and the political. I like to look at history through the eyes of the other, through the eye of the person that doesn\u2019t get to tell their story.\u201d\n\nNow \u201cParadise Square\u201d \u2014 about unity and racism in New York\u2019s notorious Five Points neighborhood, where Irish immigrants and Black Americans jostled to survive in the years before the Civil War \u2014 is nominated for 10 Tony Awards, including best musical, best lead actress for Joaquina Kalukango, and best featured actor for both Sidney DuPont and A.J. Shively.\n\nDuring a recent interview with The Associated Press, Kaufman, himself an immigrant based in New York City, reflected on immigration and the roots of American divisions.\n\n\u201cImmigration is a great fallacy, because you never leave the country where you were born, and you never arrive in the country where you land. Your being is always divided, part of you is there and part of you is here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe founder of Tectonic Theater Project \u2014 best known for \u201cThe Laramie Project\u201d and who has received awards including the National Medal of Arts \u2014 also spoke about the relevance of the show today and the powerhouse that is Kalukango as the courageous bar owner Nelly O\u2019Brien.\n\nRemarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n___\n\nAP: You have directed plays on Broadway, but this is your first Broadway musical. Did you expect \u201cParadise Square\u201d to get 10 nominations?\n\nKAUFMAN: No, I did not expect it. It was a great joy to hear that and to get that, and it's been really rewarding! I did this show because it spoke to me. I don't know, something about looking at America through the eyes of that community, a community where Irish immigrants and Black natives were getting married and living together and doing business together in 1863! When in the South, Black people were still slaves, here there was a community where people were living and loving together. It spoke to me.\n\nAP: You are also an immigrant directing a show about immigrants. How did this inform the process?\n\nKAUFMAN: Well, that was another way into the material. Like a lot of immigrants, we arrive here with a dream, with an expectation of what we want our lives to be like. And we have this whole mythology of what America provides and what one is able to do in America. And invariably, whether you succeed or you fail, you have to confront the reality of America. There's always a gap between the reality of America and the dream of America. I think that the poorer you are, the distance between that reality and that image widens. So, of course, it's much harder for a poor person to come to America and realize their dreams than it is for a wealthy person to come to America and realize their dreams. I don't know, there was something about these immigrants arriving in this country and then finding community with the least likely of partners that really spoke to me.\n\nAP: What was the biggest challenge of directing this show?\n\nKAUFMAN: The biggest challenge was that we knew that we wanted to tell an epic story. You don't see musicals of this size on Broadway anymore or on the West End. You know, they're un-producible \u2014 36 actors on stage, 10 more actors off stage just being standbys, an orchestra of 50 people. It is a very big musical. At times we felt like, who do we want the audience to fall in love with and follow for the course of the play when you have so many characters? And how do you craft it in a way that you can follow all of them, and that you can follow the intricacies of this historical musical?\n\nAP: Joaquina Kalukango gets a standing ovation before the show even ends \u2014 after \u201cLet It Burn.\u201d What can you tell me about her? Do you ever worry she might get sick?\n\nKAUFMAN: We have two understudies for her, and they're both very good. But Joaquina \u2014 every so often a monster arrives at the theater and that's her, she's a theatrical monster. And in real life she's the most unassuming person in the world. She's a Juilliard graduate, she's a brilliant actor, and she can sing like that. It's just an astonishing thing to watch.\n\nAP: \u201cParadise Square\u201d happens in the 1800s, but it is still very relevant. What is the most important message that people can get from this musical today?\n\nKAUFMAN: I'm always a little afraid of that question, because I feel that if I tell you the message that I want people to get, I am denying the audience part of the fun, which is for them to figure out what they see in the play. But what I can tell you is that what interested me is to see how deep the roots of our divisions are, and to see what are the forces that keep fueling those divisions. You know, America is a melting pot where nothing ever melted. So how do we aspire to a more perfect union? I think that the answer to that is by really understanding what are the things that tear us apart, and the play talks a lot about that.\n\n___\n\nSigal Ratner-Arias is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner."}, {"url": "https://www.theatregold.com/content/moises-kaufman/", "page_content": "Let's Get Social\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman (born November 21, 1963) is a playwright, director and founder of Tectonic Theater Project.

His family is Orthodox Jewish of Romanian and Ukrainian descent. He attended a yeshiva (a Jewish religious school) as a child. While growing up, he was first exposed to theatre on family vacations to New York City. As a teenager, he attended a Caracas theatre festival which introduced him to the work of avant grade theater artists Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cites as his earliest influences. He attended Metropolitan University in Caracas. During his time at university, he acted in a touring experimental theatre group.\n\nIn 1987, Kaufman moved to New York City to study directing at NYU's Tisch School of the Performing Arts. Four years later, he and his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, created the Tectonic Theatre Project. The company is dedicated to addressing contemporary social issues, as well as to explore the structure and language of theatre.\n\nKaufman has stated that he is primarily drawn to moments in history that unintentionally reveal a society's views and belief systems. His first play, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, premiered in New York City in 1997. It won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway play.\n\nFrom 1998-1999, Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie, Wyoming to interview those connected to the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard. The ensuing work compiled from their interviews, The Laramie Project, premiered in 2000 and was made into a film for HBO on 2001. The play gathered a worldwide following and has become a seminole work for the LGBQT community and for professional theaters, universities, high schools, and community theaters.\n\nIn 2003, Kaufman directed Doug Wright's I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. The play follows a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. Kaufman received a Tony Award nomination for his direction. In 2007, Kaufman directed for Broadway again, this time for his own play, 33 Variations starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. This garnered him his second Tony nomination.\n\nIn 2009, Kaufman and other members of the Tectonic Theater Project reunited to create The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, a sequel to the original piece. It was performed in staged readings around the globe.\n\nIn 2011, he directed Rajiv Joseph's Bengal Tiger At the Baghdad Zoo on Broadway starring Robin Williams. In 2012, he directed a revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's The Heiress on Broadway.\n\nMr. Kaufman has been honored with a Steinberg/ATCA Best New Play Award, a Dike Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, a GLAAD Media Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Lucille Lortel Award, a Carbonell Award, a Bay Area Theater Critics Circle Award, a Lambda Book Award, Venezuela's Casa del Artista, American Library Association's GLBT Literature Award, the Matthew Shepard Foundation\u2019s \u201cMaking A Difference Award\", the Artistic Integrity Award from the Human Rights Campaign, the National Board of Review Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie, a Golden Bear Award from the Berlin Film Festival, the Humanitas Prize,the Joe A.

Photo courtesy: Ana Sofia Pelaez\n\nLike a significant number of Miami\u2019s residents, Hausmann left Venezuela\u2019s political turmoil, albeit under uniquely dramatic circumstances. In 2010, when he was presenting a production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" in his native Caracas, masked assailants attacked the packed theater with tear gas. Firefighters advised against evacuating since there was no guarantee of what they would find outside.\n\n\u201cNow I can talk about it with distance, but at the time it was the scariest thing that had ever happened to me,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSuddenly,I realized I had 2,000 people who were all my responsibility.\u201d\n\nTo keep the audience calm, the show continued with actors sharing a gas mask in between scenes. Though it was impossible to determine who was behind the attack, it came after a fraught confrontation with the Venezuelan government, then under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Shortly before the premiere, Hausmann was informed the show would lose key sponsorship if they placed advertisements with independent media outlets; Hausmann responded with a public letter to the proscribed outlets.\n\nFollowing the attack, Hausmann left for the U.S. to pursue a master's in theater directing at Columbia University in New York City. He went on to write and direct the critically-acclaimed musical, The Golem of Havana, about a Hungarian-Jewish family living in Cuba on the eve of the Cuban Revolution. It was inspired by his maternal grandmother, who lost most of her family after they were killed in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nAfter the musical\u2019s success, Hausmann decided to move to Miami, a city that he used to visit as a child and that now is home to a large and growing Venezuelan community.\n\n\u201cAs an immigrant in a city of immigrants, both Hispanic and Jewish...this was as close to home as I could get,\u201d said Hausmann.\n\nHe produced \"Golem\" at The Colony, then an underused event space in Miami, to much success. He then approached his friend, mentor and fellow Venezuelan Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, about starting a new regional theater in Miami.\n\nFile photo of Venezuelan-American playwright Moises Kaufman, one of the founding members of Miami New Drama. Jemal Countess / Getty Images\n\nAt first, the acclaimed Tony and Emmy nominated Kaufman - whose works include \"The Laramie Project\" and \"Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde\" - said it was \u201cthe stupidest idea he\u2019d heard in his life,\" recalled Hausmann laughing.\n\n\u201cHe called me two days later and said, 'Okay Michel, I thought of it, it\u2019s brilliant, and I\u2019m doing it with you,'\u201d said Hausmann. Kaufman became the co-founder and will present the workshop version of his new play, \"The Album,\" inspired by real-life photographs depicting Auschwitz-Birkenau officers at a staff retreat, in partnership with Tectonic Theater Project this summer.\n\nAfter selling out the winter run of Golem, Hausmann approached the City of Miami Beach with an 80-page memo detailing how they could become the Colony\u2019s resident theater company. City commissioners handed Hausmann the keys in October 2016.\n\nLast November, Miami New Drama premiered with a multilingual production of Thornton Wilder\u2019s \"Our Town,\" the revered American play about life and death in a small New England town. Hausmann was granted permission by Wilder\u2019s estate to directly translate portions of the text into Spanish by Pulitzer Prize winning Cuban-American playwright Nilo Cruz and into Creole by Jeff Augustin. In an otherwise traditional production, the Haitian and Latino families speak their own languages at home - much like the audience.\n\n\u201cWhat do we lose when we do that to the text,\u201d said Hausmann. \u201cNothing - we gain. Haitian families said you got the Haitian family right and Latinos said you got the Latino family was right. But Thornton Wilder got humanity right.\u201d\n\nThis was followed up with \"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Diety,\" a political satire set in the world of professional wrestling written by Obie-award winning playwright Kristoffer Diaz, presented with Asolo Repertory Theater. Written 10 years ago, it unnervingly resonates with the racial and cultural conflicts coming to a head in Trump\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cThat man Kris Diaz understood where the country was heading in a way that none of us got,\u201d said Hausmann.\n\nThis spring, the company takes on income inequality with \"Queen of Basel,\" an adaptation of the late acclaimed playwright August Strindberg\u2019s \"Miss Julie.\" Often criticized for its misogynistic undertones, Hausmann entrusted Latina playwright Hillary Bettis, one of the writers for the hit FX show The Americans, to \u201cwrite an adaptation that would make Strindberg roll in his grave.\u201d Set during the carnival-like atmosphere of the swanky Art Basel Miami Beach art festival, the central conflict takes place between Julie, a hotel owner\u2019s daughter, a Venezuelan waitress and her Afro-Cuban fianc\u00e9.\n\nHausmann\u2019s approach to adapting classics may rankle theater purists, it might be the very thing that connects with contemporary audiences.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a conversation if we\u2019re not talking about what matters to our community and our country,\u201d said Hausmann. \u201cWe have a responsibility by being an immigrant city and a diverse city to defend those values in a time of Trump.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Mois%C3%A9s_Kaufman", "page_content": "What we do.

The medal recognizes outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States. Kaufman is in good company; among this year's other recipients are film director Mel Brooks, author Sandra Cisneros, actor Morgan Freeman, composer Philip Glass, and actress-singer Audra McDonald. (See the full list here.) Kaufman has had a long and varied career, and some facts about his life and work may surprise even devoted fans. Read on for 10 things you should know about Moises Kaufman.\n\nHe is the son of a Holocaust survivor.\n\nKaufman's father, Jose, was a Romanian Jew who survived the Holocaust. As a boy, Jose earned money by making and selling the yellow Stars of David that the Nazi regime forced Jews to wear. \"He spent most of the war alternately hiding in a small room and selling Stars of David,\" Moises Kaufman recalled in the book A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer, edited by Eve Ensler. After World War II was over, Jose made his way to Caracas, Venezuela. There he worked in a grocery store and eventually bought one, and he married Dora Akerman, a Venezuelan-born woman of Ukrainian descent. Moises was born in Caracas in 1963. His parents brought him up in the Orthodox branch of Judaism, and he attended a yeshiva -- a Jewish religious school -- which made Moises quite the outsider in the heavily Catholic nation, as did his realization at age 11 that he was gay. Moises moved to New York City in 1987 to pursue his theatrical career, in which many of his projects have dealt with outsiders, and some have touched directly on the Holocaust. In 2015 he directed a revival of Bent, Martin Sherman's play about gay men in a concentration camp, at Los Angeles's Mark Taper Forum.\n\nThe Laramie Project was a massive undertaking.\n\nFor The Laramie Project, which deals with the brutal murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard and the reactions of the townspeople in Laramie, Wyo., Kaufman and his colleagues at the Tectonic Theater Project compiled 400 hours of interviews from over 200 people. Kaufman was in New York City when he heard about the attack on Shepard in October 1998. \"I started getting phone calls -- 'Did you hear what happened?' -- and then I read it in the newspaper and I saw it on television,\" he recalled to The Advocate in 2008. \"People have spoken about how we as gay people feel attacked, injured, constantly in our culture. And that image of that boy tied to the fence spoke to so many of us about our pain and about our sense of how we fit into the landscape of this country. The impact of seeing what this was doing to the country--that's when I decided to go to Laramie and do The Laramie Project.\" The Laramie Project premiered in 2000, has been performed widely, and was adapted into an HBO movie, directed by Kaufman, in 2002. And 10 years after Shepard's death Kaufman and his Tectonic collaborators returned to Laramie to compile a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, which premiered in 2009.\n\n[rebelmouse-image

It received numerous critics' awards and a GLAAD Media Award. It has been produced in dozens of cities in the U.S. and abroad, but a planned production in Moscow was abruptly canceled in 2015. The production was to be funded in part by the U.S. State Department, but the Russian government stepped in and said the Moscow theater company that was to stage it could not accept foreign funds. The real reason for the cancellation, Kaufman believes, was that this depiction of the great gay author and wit ran afoul of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" law, which bans any positive discussion of LGBT people or issues in forums accessible to minors. The play did receive a a star-studded benefit reading in New York City in the fall of 2015 to support the Tectonic Theater Project and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n\nPictured: Kaufman (left) and Ben Foster clown around at the premiere of the HBO film of The Laramie Project.\n\nThe Laramie Project has run into trouble a few places too.\n\nThe Laramie Project's gay subject matter has led high school administrators to cancel performances of the play in places as varied as Spokane, Wash.;Ottumwa, Iowa; and Burbank, Calif. The students in Burbank eventually were able to stage their production, although not at their high school -- it went on at the Los Angeles suburb's Colony Theatre, which donated the space, and with help from Tectonic. But the play also has had well-received, school-supported productions in many places in the U.S., including Xavier High School, a Roman Catholic institution in New York City.\n\nHis play 33 Variations gave Jane Fonda her first Broadway role in 46 years.\n\nKaufman wrote and directed 33 Variations, about a music scholar studying one of Beethoven's most enigmatic works, and when it premiered on Broadway in 2009, Jane Fonda played the lead role. This was Fonda's first Broadway appearance since 1963, and she received positive reviews. \"Whatever discomfort the actress may feel melds into her portrayal of Dr. Katherine Brandt, whose naturally assertive nature is humbled by the progressive, atrophying illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease,\" Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, adding, \"For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"\n\nHe discovered a different side of Robin Williams during Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.\n\nFonda isn't the only major movie star who has appeared in a Kaufman play. In 2011, Robin Williams starred in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a meditation on the Iraq war written and directed by Kaufman. Williams portrayed a tiger who is killed in the first scene and then haunts the rest of the characters for the remainder of the play. Williams initially started rehearsals with what Kaufman called \"the 10 a.m. stand-up.\" \"He would start talking about whatever crossed his mind and would riff on it for the next 20 or 30 minutes, keeping all of us -- actors, designers, stage management -- roaring with laughter,\" Kaufman wrote in Salon in 2014, after Williams's suicide. \"Like everyone, I was dazzled by the speed of his brain and the quickness of his wit, but I also noticed something else: an actor's natural trepidation about tackling a demanding role. As he developed his character ... the 10 a.m. monologues became shorter and shorter. He was feeling more at home in the rehearsal room, finding his groove in the role. Until, finally, the monologues were gone.\" Williams also developed \"a real camaraderie\" with his castmates -- and he occasionally showed signs of depression, the playwright noted. \"For me, it isn't his brilliant sense of humor, or his wit, or his chameleon abilities that I'll miss,\" Kaufman concluded. \"I'll miss the guy who came to rehearsal every day with humility and kindness, who sat around at lunch and shot the breeze. I'll miss the man who loved what he did every day. And who loved this community. I will miss my friend.\"\n\nHe's even directed operas, including one based on Puss in Boots.\n\nKaufman has proved his versatility time and again. In 2010 he took on the direction of Spanish composer Xavier Montsalvatge's chamber opera adaptation of the popular fairy tale. The production incorporated both puppets and human actors. Staging a show aimed at children was intimidating and also rewarding, Kaufman told the New York Daily News. \"I've never been more scared in my life, because children don't lie,\" he said. On the other hand, he noted, \"There's nothing better than hearing children laugh.\"\n\nHis most recent project is a reimagining of Bizet's Carmen.\n\nNothing if not adventurous, Kaufman and cowriter Eduardo Machado adapted Georges Bizet's 19th-century opera into Carmen: An Afro-Cuban Jazz Musical, set in 1958, changing the locale from Spain to Cuba, and making the sensuous factory worker Carmen a black woman who supports Fidel Castro's revolution. Composer Arturo O'Farrill adapted Bizet's melodies into jazzy tunes with lyrics by Kaufman and others. The play had its world premiere, directed by Kaufman, in February of this year at the Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite all his success, Kaufman describes himself as shy and socially awkward.\n\n\"I'm incredibly shy, I am socially awkward, and I don't have many other interests other than my work,\" he told Los Angeles's Jewish Journal in 2011. \"When I'm in the rehearsal room, I'm my best self. I've always known how to live in my work. I am not so good at living my life.\"\n\nBut he has managed to have a long-term relationship. He is married to Jeffrey LaHoste, with whom he founded the Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman and LaHoste founded Tectonic in 1991, with the goal of \"developing innovative works that explore theatrical language and form, fostering an artistic dialogue with audiences on the social, political, and human issues that affect us all,\" according to the New York-based company's website. Kaufman is its artistic director, and LaHoste, a writer and producer, is a member of the board of directors. LaHoste has produced many of Kaufman's plays and several other projects, such as Kirby Dick's 2009 documentary film Outrage, about closeted politicians who support anti-LGBT legislation. He is also the author of author of Elysian Fields, a television series in development that was chosen as a participating project in the Producers' Guild of America's Diversity Workshop. Kaufman and LaHoste have been together for more than 20 years, and they were married in 2014."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-new-york-city-theater-aj-shively-c62c294d48749ab1ce5aaf7670157dc1", "page_content": "FILE - Director and playwright Moises Kaufman appears during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House for the National Medal of Arts in Washington on Sept. 22, 2016.

Kaufman's latest production, \"Paradise Square,\" is nominated for 10 Tony Awards. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Seven years ago, Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was approached to direct the Broadway musical \u201cParadise Square\u201d and, after reading it, he immediately said yes.\n\n\u201cI did this show because it spoke to me,\u201d the Venezuelan theater director and playwright says. \u201cSo much of my work occurs at the intersection of the personal and the political. I like to look at history through the eyes of the other, through the eye of the person that doesn\u2019t get to tell their story.\u201d\n\nNow \u201cParadise Square\u201d \u2014 about unity and racism in New York\u2019s notorious Five Points neighborhood, where Irish immigrants and Black Americans jostled to survive in the years before the Civil War \u2014 is nominated for 10 Tony Awards, including best musical, best lead actress for Joaquina Kalukango, and best featured actor for both Sidney DuPont and A.J. Shively.\n\nDuring a recent interview with The Associated Press, Kaufman, himself an immigrant based in New York City, reflected on immigration and the roots of American divisions.\n\n\u201cImmigration is a great fallacy, because you never leave the country where you were born, and you never arrive in the country where you land. Your being is always divided, part of you is there and part of you is here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe founder of Tectonic Theater Project \u2014 best known for \u201cThe Laramie Project\u201d and who has received awards including the National Medal of Arts \u2014 also spoke about the relevance of the show today and the powerhouse that is Kalukango as the courageous bar owner Nelly O\u2019Brien.\n\nRemarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n___\n\nAP: You have directed plays on Broadway, but this is your first Broadway musical. Did you expect \u201cParadise Square\u201d to get 10 nominations?\n\nKAUFMAN: No, I did not expect it. It was a great joy to hear that and to get that, and it\u2019s been really rewarding! I did this show because it spoke to me. I don\u2019t know, something about looking at America through the eyes of that community, a community where Irish immigrants and Black natives were getting married and living together and doing business together in 1863! When in the South, Black people were still slaves, here there was a community where people were living and loving together. It spoke to me.\n\nAP: You are also an immigrant directing a show about immigrants. How did this inform the process?\n\nKAUFMAN: Well, that was another way into the material. Like a lot of immigrants, we arrive here with a dream, with an expectation of what we want our lives to be like. And we have this whole mythology of what America provides and what one is able to do in America. And invariably, whether you succeed or you fail, you have to confront the reality of America. There\u2019s always a gap between the reality of America and the dream of America. I think that the poorer you are, the distance between that reality and that image widens. So, of course, it\u2019s much harder for a poor person to come to America and realize their dreams than it is for a wealthy person to come to America and realize their dreams. I don\u2019t know, there was something about these immigrants arriving in this country and then finding community with the least likely of partners that really spoke to me.\n\nAP: What was the biggest challenge of directing this show?\n\nKAUFMAN: The biggest challenge was that we knew that we wanted to tell an epic story. You don\u2019t see musicals of this size on Broadway anymore or on the West End. You know, they\u2019re un-producible \u2014 36 actors on stage, 10 more actors off stage just being standbys, an orchestra of 50 people. It is a very big musical. At times we felt like, who do we want the audience to fall in love with and follow for the course of the play when you have so many characters? And how do you craft it in a way that you can follow all of them, and that you can follow the intricacies of this historical musical?\n\nAP: Joaquina Kalukango gets a standing ovation before the show even ends \u2014 after \u201cLet It Burn.\u201d What can you tell me about her? Do you ever worry she might get sick?\n\nKAUFMAN: We have two understudies for her, and they\u2019re both very good. But Joaquina \u2014 every so often a monster arrives at the theater and that\u2019s her, she\u2019s a theatrical monster. And in real life she\u2019s the most unassuming person in the world. She\u2019s a Juilliard graduate, she\u2019s a brilliant actor, and she can sing like that. It\u2019s just an astonishing thing to watch.\n\nAP: \u201cParadise Square\u201d happens in the 1800s, but it is still very relevant. What is the most important message that people can get from this musical today?\n\nKAUFMAN: I\u2019m always a little afraid of that question, because I feel that if I tell you the message that I want people to get, I am denying the audience part of the fun, which is for them to figure out what they see in the play. But what I can tell you is that what interested me is to see how deep the roots of our divisions are, and to see what are the forces that keep fueling those divisions. You know, America is a melting pot where nothing ever melted. So how do we aspire to a more perfect union? I think that the answer to that is by really understanding what are the things that tear us apart, and the play talks a lot about that.\n\n___\n\nSigal Ratner-Arias is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner."}], "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is a director, playwright, and screenwriter.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moises-Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, (born November 21, 1963, Caracas, Venezuela), Venezuelan-born playwright and director who is best known for perceptive and moving plays often rooted in issues of sexuality. He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein.

And the rallying cry of the movement became: \u201cWe must all come out of the closet. We must make ourselves known.\u201d\n\nCamus also states in his book that \u201cin every act of rebellion,\u201d the rebel experiences a \u201ccomplete and spontaneous loyalty to certain aspects of himself.\u201d Just four years after the riots, in 1973, we said \u201cno\u201d to the American Psychiatric Association, and its leaders at long last removed the diagnosis of homosexuality from its official list of mental illnesses.\n\nThe next year, 1974, we said \u201cno\u201d to being politically powerless when Elaine Noble, the first out lesbian to run for a state-level political office, was elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature. And, famously, in 1977, an openly gay man, Harvey Milk, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nBut as the battle went on, and as the character of the homosexual was being redrawn in revolt, 1981 brought about the first cases of the AIDS epidemic. And the death toll \u2014 and the country\u2019s initial refusal to respond to it \u2014 brought to the surface the depth of homophobia, transphobia and other queer-centered bigotry in the American psyche.\n\nA radical rethinking of tactics and actions was needed, and a new kind of gay activist was born.

He was born in Caracas to Orthodox Jewish parents and is of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. Kaufman\u2019s work is heavily influenced by his identity as a gay, Jewish man.\n\nIn 1985, he got his BA in Business Administration at the Metropolitan University in Caracas where he joined a touring experimental theatre group. He then relocated to New York to study theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nIn 1991 he founded the Tectonic Theater Project, a theatre group based in New York City that develops productions focused on political and social issues. Their ideas stem from the collaboration of diverse individuals as well as extensive research on a multitude of topics.\n\nKaufman is an activist at heart and his company has created a plethora of plays and musicals that take on social and political issues that are relevant to modern audiences. His work includes Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde, 33 Variations, and The Laramie Project, among others.\n\nHis Broadway work includes directing plays such as the Pulitzer Prize finalist Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo by Rajiv Joseph (starring Robin Williams), Doug Wright\u2019s Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning play I Am My Own Wife (starring Jefferson Mays and earning Kaufman a Tony Award nomination for Best Direction of a Play), Harvey Fierstein\u2019s Torch Song, The Heiress by Ruth and Augustus Goetz (starring Jessica Chastain), and even his own play 33 Variations (starring Jane Fonda).\n\nThe Laramie Project is among the most performed plays in the country. The collaboratively written piece is a response to the brutal and senseless killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student. The murder took place in Laramie, Wyoming. Kaufman and his team at the Tectonic Theater Project interviewed family, friends, neighbors, and more within the small town of Laramie and their words are front and center in this documentary-style theatre production. This high-profile hate crime was one of many turning points in the LGBTQ+ community and inspired not only plays, but songs, films, novels, and other forms of media.\n\nIn September of 2016, Kaufman was awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities by President Barack Obama.
