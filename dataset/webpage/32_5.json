Sometimes they invite the eye to adjust to subtle markings, or minute changes in tone. Frequently there is a haunting resonance, as well as a sense of the profound and mysterious. ''The unknown is comfortable for me,'' he said in an interview with Mrs. Flomenhaft.\n\nIt is also obvious to the visitor that the Yunkers oeuvre was quite unpredictable. This 40-year overview includes a number of radical changes in style. Tactile qualities, for example, become an important part of the content in his group of rope collages from the 70's. Here paint-encrusted frayed roping acts as pattern, as composition, and also substitutes for brushstroke or gesture in directing the eye.\n\nSocial concerns are sometimes present in the Yunkers art, too. One strong late canvas, ''In Memory of the Disappeared'' (a reference to political turmoil in Argentina and El Salvador), draws attention to its large, black central field. In the works that are the most spacious, the Aegean Series, a few undulating marks act as contour, and it is intentionally ambiguous as to which area is pushing against the curving shape, and which is receiving the action.\n\nFor many years Mr. Yunkers was known best as a printmaker, and a first-rate group of woodcuts from the 40's represents the early segment of the retrospective (a 1947 fire in his Stockholm studio destroyed accumulated works from earlier decades). The woodcuts blend solidity and transparency, curving and angular shapes, motion, rhythm and bold color, and appear to be an important precursor for the energetic work of the next decade.\n\nMissing and missed here is a fuller range of the Yunkers prints.

He left his homeland in 1919 and began a period of restless wandering in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, including Hamburg, where he had his first exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Gallery; Cuba in 1926; and shortly after that, Mexico, where he met Diego Rivera. From 1933 he was based in Sweden and during the Second World War published the Swedish surrealist journal Cr\u00e9ation and the Ars magazine; he also began to produce albums of original prints called the Ars-portfolios, which included his own colour woodcuts, a technique he had first taken up in 1939. After the war he decided to emigrate to America where his work drew a favourable response but just before his departure from Stockholm a fire in his studio destroyed thirty years of work. Yunkers arrived in New York in 1947 and produced six woodcuts in his first year. He sometimes combined different blocks from earlier prints to make new compositions. He taught intermittently at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1947 to 1956, and during the summers from 1948 to 1952 at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. Inspired by the New Mexico landscape, the forms and the intensity of colour in his woodcuts changed. He also started to experiment with monotypes, often using textures to manipulate the inking. In 1952 he produced a set of five colour woodcuts under the imprint of the Rio Grande Graphics Workshop which he had helped to establish. But after a desert flash flood destroyed his adobe studio with the loss of much of his work, Yunkers left New Mexico and returned to New York in 1952. He then embarked on the most ambitious print project of his career, the woodcut Polyptych, a summation of fifty years of his life and work. It consisted of five large woodcut panels, which were completed in 1953, after the disastrous collapse of his studio ceiling. The central panel alone was printed in fifty-six colours by hand. In 1955, while in Rome, he produced a series of twelve woodcuts and monotypes entitled Ostia Antica. Thereafter he abandoned the colour woodcut and concentrated on large-scale pastels until 1962, and then on painting with torn-paper collage. In 1960 he produced at the Tamarind Workshop, Los Angeles a suite of nine gestural abstract lithographs entitled Skies of Venice, one of his most important series of prints. The British Museum owns fifteen prints by Yunkers, including the Rio Grande Portfolio, two monotypes and seven colour woodcuts. The largest public holdings are to be found in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/adja.yunkers/1108438", "page_content": "Adja Yunkers\n\nartist painter printmaker\n\nJuly 15, 1900 (age 83) Riga, Latvia\n\nAdja Yunkers began his career from the military service at the Russian Army beginning at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1917. After Yunkers left the country and in 1921 settled down in Hamburg, Germany where he had his first solo exhibition at the Maria Kunde Galerie. Later the same year, Adja Yunkers participated at the group show in Hannover along with such artists, as Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall and Vasily Kandinsky. He rented a studio with the money he earned from the exhibitions. While in Germany, Yunkers took an active part at artistic movements, joining the members of the Sturmgruppe, including Emil Nolde and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Since 1923, Adja Yunkers had travelled around Europe and Latin America visiting Spain, the Canary Island, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Cuba where he spent one year from 1926. He then moved to Mexico where he met Diego Rivera. At the end of 1927, Yunkers came back to Europe settling down in Paris. While in the capital of France, the artist worked on multiple artistic projects, like murals for the City Hall in Ivry or his woodcut series \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d. During 1936-1939, Adja Yunkers participated in the Spanish Civil War. After, he moved to Stockholm, Sweden. The artist got acquainted with the Swedish Surrealists and exhibited widely. While in the country, he published and edited the periodicals on art and politics called Creation, Arts and Art portfolio. Since then, Yunkers devote much of his time to printmaking and soon became recognized for his graphic work. During the 1940s, he produced a great number of woodblock prints showing deformed objects and figures similar to German Expressionism in style. The fire accident of 1947 destroying Yunkers\u2019s studio with almost all of his artworks pushed the artist to relocate to New York City where he joined the teacher\u2019s staff of the New School for Social Research working in the summers at the University of New Mexico. His popularity continued to grow and soon his artworks were acquired by several public and private collections. Two years after his arriving in America, Adja Yunkers formed the Rio Grande Workshop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which issued a handmade art magazine titled \u2018Prints in the Desert\u2019. In 1960, Yunkers produced his first lithographs including two series called \u2018Salt\u2019 of five lithographs and \u2018Skies of Venice\u2019 of ten lithographs at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles. At the end of the decade, the artist worked on two commissioned projects, a mural for Syracuse University called a \u2018Human Condition\u2019 (1966) and a tapestry for Stony Brook University (1968). The same time, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz illustrating his book. Octavio became Yunkers\u2019s and the following years, the artist illustrated many of his other writings. Adja Yunkers exhibited a lot in the United States and in Europe, having the retrospectives at the Baltimore Museum of Art (1960), at the Brooklyn Museum (1967), at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City (1968), at the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City, Mexico (1975) and at the Fine Arts Museum of Long Island in Hempstead, New York (1983).

While Larionov, Malevich, the Italian Futurists, and the Mexican muralists figure among the early influences of the Russian-trained Yunkers, the seven paintings and three works on paper in this show demonstrate the degree to which his mature work was informed by postwar developments in abstraction. While formal affinities with the work of artists as diverse as Mark Rothko, Lucio Fontana, and even Yves Klein are evident, the unassuming and somewhat \u201cawkward on its edges\u201d quality of Yunkers\u2019 work clearly values poetic introspection over formal cohesiveness and expressive intensity.\n\nThe Illusionist\u2014Third Version, 1973, with its Rothko-like floating rectangle painted in thin washes, is a palimpsest, a tabletlike surface covered with overlapping autographic inscriptions. As if unable, or perhaps unwilling, to reach the absolute, Yunkers built his image from layers of abstract, amorphous erasures, which nevertheless interact harmoniously, building overall order and coherence. Pueblo X, 1977, with its two rows of embossments that recall the sponges in Klein\u2019s late-\u201950s and early-\u201960s monochromes, downplays a virtuoso technique so dear to the French artist in favor of a more ascetic preoccupation with surface sensuality as the mark of emotional experience. Executed in a reductionist palette of earth colors, the work has an organic quality and manages to communicate the onset of decay as well. The brushstrokes in the gouache The Hour of the Bullfrog, 1961, reveal Yunkers\u2019 mastery of painterly gesture while conjuring the fluidity and fragility of a primal chaos. These works take us in different stylistic directions; avoiding the false sense of security that can emerge from taking refuge in a single painterly convention, Yunkers largely forsook stylistic consistency in his quest for direct expression and relentlessly pursued the right, introspective note.\n\nGiven the extent to which Yunkers drew on the poetic impulse of postwar abstraction, it seems appropriate that the exhibition was accompanied by an extract from a 1979 Art International article by Mexican poet and philosopher Octavio Paz (whose book containing the poem \u201cBLANCO\u201d was illustrated by Yunkers in the mid \u201970s). Both Paz and Yunkers attempted to combine an interest in the universal with \u201clocal\u201d concerns, particularly the private domain of memory. Just as the Mexican poet often referred to his \u201clost\u201d Aztec heritage, Yunkers never forgot his Russian past. Like Malevich, who perceived the white fields around his geometric figures as an all-inclusive void beyond the personal feeling those figures evoked, Yunkers vacillated between seeking to express the materiality of painting and attempting to transcend this materiality in order to reach an analogue of the open universe. Referring to one of his acrylics that depicted a Greek column, Yunkers said: \u201cThe column does not matter; it is static. But the aura around it counts. It breathes.\u201d\n\n\u0097Marek Bartelik"}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geab/hd_geab.htm", "page_content": "The pictorial language of geometric abstraction, based on the use of simple geometric forms placed in nonillusionistic space and combined into nonobjective compositions, evolved as the logical conclusion of the Cubist destruction and reformulation of the established conventions of form and space. Initiated by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in 1907\u20138, Cubism subverted the traditional depiction relying upon the imitation of forms of the surrounding visual world in the illusionistic\u2014post-Renaissance\u2014perspectival space. The Analytic Cubist phase, which reached its peak in mid-1910, made available to artists the planarity of overlapping frontal surfaces held together by a linear grid. The next phase\u2014Synthetic Cubism, 1912\u201314\u2014introduced the flatly painted synthesized shapes, abstract space, and \u201cconstructional\u201d elements of the composition. These three aspects became the fundamental characteristics of abstract geometric art. The freedom of experimentation with different materials and spatial relationships between various compositional parts, which evolved from the Cubist practice of collage and papiers coll\u00e9s (1912), also emphasized the flatness of the picture surface\u2014as the carrier of applied elements\u2014as well as the physical \u201creality\u201d of the explored forms and materials. Geometric abstraction, through the Cubist process of purifying art of the vestiges of visual reality, focused on the inherent two-dimensional features of painting.\n\nThis process of evolving a purely pictorial reality built of elemental geometric forms assumed different stylistic expressions in various European countries and in Russia. In Holland, the main creator and the most important proponent of geometric abstract language was Piet Mondrian (1872\u20131944). Along with other members of the De Stijl group\u2014Theo van Doesburg (1883\u20131931), Bart van der Leck (1876\u20131958), and Vilmos Husz\u00e1r (1884\u20131960)\u2014Mondrian\u2019s work was intended to convey \u201cabsolute reality,\u201d construed as the world of pure geometric forms underlying all existence and related according to the vertical-horizontal principle of straight lines and pure spectral colors. Mondrian\u2019s geometric style, which he termed \u201cNeoplasticism,\u201d developed between 1915 and 1920. In that year, he published his manifesto \u201cLe N\u00e9oplasticisme\u201d and for the next two-and-a-half decades continued to work in his characteristic geometric style, expunged of all references to the real world, and posited on the geometric division of the canvas through black vertical and horizontal lines of varied thickness, complemented by blocks of primary colors, particularly blue, red, and yellow. Similar compositional principles underlie the work of the De Stijl artists, who applied them with slight formal modifications to achieve their independent, personal expression.\n\nIn Russia, the language of geometric abstraction first appeared in 1915 in the work of the avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich (1879\u20131935) (Museum of Modern Art, New York), in the style he termed Suprematism. Creating nonobjective compositions of elemental forms floating in white unstructured space, Malevich strove to achieve \u201cthe absolute,\u201d the higher spiritual reality that he called the \u201cfourth dimension.\u201d Simultaneously, his compatriot Vladimir Tatlin (1885\u20131953) originated a new geometric abstract idiom in an innovative three-dimensional form, which he first dubbed \u201cpainterly reliefs\u201d and subsequently \u201ccounter-reliefs\u201d (1915\u201317). These were assemblages of randomly found industrial materials whose geometric form was dictated by their inherent properties, such as wood, metal, or glass. That principle, which Tatlin called \u201cthe culture of materials,\u201d spurred the rise of the Russian avant-garde movement Constructivism (1918\u201321), which explored geometric form in two and three dimensions. The main practitioners of Constructivism included Liubov Popova (1889\u20131924), Aleksandr Rodchenko (1891\u20131956) (Museum of Modern Art, New York), Varvara Stepanova (1894\u20131958), and El Lissitzky (1890\u20131941). It was Lissitzky who became the transmitter of Constructivism to Germany, where its principles were later embodied in the teachings of the Bauhaus. Founded by the architect Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919, it became during the 1920s (and until its dismantling by the Nazis in 1933) the vital proponent of geometric abstraction and experimental modern architecture. As a teaching institution, the Bauhaus encompassed different disciplines: painting, graphic arts, stage design, theater, and architecture. The art faculty was recruited from among the most distinguished painters of the time: Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, Oskar Schlemmer, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Josef Albers, all of whom were devoted to the ideal of the purity of geometric form as the most appropriate expression of the modernist canon.\n\nIn France, during the 1920s, geometric abstraction manifested itself as the underlying principle of the Art Deco style, which propagated broad use of geometric form for ornamental purposes in the decorative and applied arts as well as in architecture. In the 1930s, Paris became the center of a geometric abstraction that arose out of its Synthetic Cubist sources and focused around the group Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (1930), and later Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation (1932). With the outbreak of World War II, the focus of geometric abstraction shifted to New York, where the tradition was continued by the American Abstract Artists group (formed in 1937), including Burgoyne Diller and Ilya Bolotowsky. With the arrival of the Europeans Josef Albers (1933) and Piet Mondrian (1940), and such major events as the exhibition Cubism and Abstract Art (1936), organized by the Museum of Modern Art, and the creation of the Museum of Non-Objective Art (1939, now the Guggenheim), the geometric tradition acquired a new resonance, but it was essentially past its creative phase. Its influences, however, reached younger generations of artists, most directly affecting the Minimalist art of the 1960s, which used pure geometric form, stripped to its austere essentials, as the primary language of expression. Artists such as Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, and Dorothea Rockburne studied the geometric tradition and transformed it into their own artistic vocabulary."}, {"url": "http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/yunkers_adja.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot be responsible for the content of external web sites.\n\n\n\nAll images and text on this Adja Yunkers page are copyright 1999-2015 by John Malyon/Specifica, Inc., unless otherwise noted.

He studied art in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), but from 1917 to 1919 his schooling was interrupted by military service in the Russian army. Yunkers soon left Russia for Europe and traveled extensively for the next two decades, settling for long periods in Cuba, France, and Germany. During much of his early career, Yunkers was active in political as well as artistic movements. At times his political investments even outweighed his commitment to his art, and in 1936 he moved to Spain to fight in its civil war. When the war ended in 1939, he moved to Stockholm and began to focus on art making again. He became associated with the Swedish Surrealists and published three journals devoted to art and politics. These handcrafted publications signaled a strong interest in printmaking, and in the 1940s he made many woodblock prints depicting distorted objects and figural compositions that demonstrate the influence of German Expressionism on his work. In 1947, Yunkers moved to New York and began to teach at the New School for Social Research. After four tumultuous marriages, he married one of his former students from the New School, Dore Ashton, in 1952. Ashton became an art critic for the New York Times in 1955, and through her, Yunkers was introduced to the artists who would become known as the Abstract Expressionists. He began drawing with pastel directly on canvas, resulting in large-scale works that recall Color Field painting in their emphasis on the materiality of color. Expanding on this impulse, Yunkers's later work made extensive use of negative space, collage, and monochrome. The influence of Minimalism in this more reduced aesthetic is clear, and his canvases became more object-like. Both printmaking and bookmaking were central to Yunkers's oeuvre. He founded the Rio Grande Workshop in New Mexico (where he also taught) in 1949, publishing an entirely handmade art magazine called Prints in the Desert. In 1969 he illustrated a limited-edition book by the poet Octavio Paz, a collaboration that sparked both a friendship and a number of additional illustrated books in the years to come. Yunkers also produced two large public works on commission: A Human Condition (1966), a mural for Syracuse University, and a tapestry produced for Stony Brook University (1968), both in New York. Yunkers had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie, Hamburg, Germany. Later that same year, he was part of a group show featuring Eastern European and Russian artists, including Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, and Vasily Kandinsky, held in Hannover, Germany. He was included in an exhibition organized by the Print Council of America entitled American Prints Today. A snapshot of the state of American printmaking at the time of the exhibition.

Achieved through the systematic and precise manipulation of shapes and colours, the effects of Op art can be based either on perspective illusion or on chromatic tension; in painting, the dominant medium of Op art, the surface tension is usually maximized to the point at which an actual pulsation or flickering is perceived by the human eye. In its concern with utterly abstract formal relationships, Op art is indirectly related to such other 20th-century styles as Orphism, Constructivism, Suprematism, and Futurism\u2014particularly the latter because of its emphasis on pictorial movement and dynamism. The painters of this movement differed from earlier artists working in geometric styles, however, in their purposeful manipulation of formal relationships in order to evoke perceptual illusions, ambiguities, and contradictions in the vision of the viewer.\n\nThe principal artists of the Op art movement as it emerged in the late 1950s and \u201960s were Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Larry Poons, and Jeffrey Steele. The movement first attracted international attention with the Op exhibition \u201cThe Responsive Eye\u201d at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1965. Op art painters devised complex and paradoxical optical spaces through the illusory manipulation of such simple repetitive forms as parallel lines, checkerboard patterns, and concentric circles or by creating chromatic tension from the juxtaposition of complementary (chromatically opposite) colours of equal intensity. These spaces create the illusion of movement, preventing the viewer\u2019s eye from resting long enough on any one part of the surface to be able to interpret it literally. \u201cOp art works exist,\u201d according to one writer, \u201cless as objects than as generators of perceptual responses.\u201d\n\nOp art goals were shared by the French Groupe de Recherche d\u2019Art Visuel (\u201cGroup for Research in the Visual Arts\u201d) and by the Venezuelan-born artist Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto. These artists made large-scale sculptures that employed light and motors, as well as sculptural materials, to create the illusion of movement in space that is fundamental to all Op art."}, {"url": "https://www.theartstory.org/movement/op-art/", "page_content": "\"I have never sought to show reality caught at one precise moment, but, on the contrary, to reveal universal change, of which temporality and infinitude are the constituent values. The universe, I believe, is uncertain and settled. The same must be true of my work.\"\n\n\"There was a time when meanings were focused and reality could be fixed; when that sort of belief disappeared, things became uncertain and open to interpretation.\"\n\nSummary of Op Art\n\nArtists have been intrigued by the nature of perception and by optical effects and illusions for many centuries. They have often been a central concern of art, just as much as themes drawn from history or literature. But in the 1950s these preoccupations, allied to new interests in technology and psychology, blossomed into a movement. Op, or Optical, art typically employs abstract patterns composed with a stark contrast of foreground and background - often in black and white for maximum contrast - to produce effects that confuse and excite the eye. Initially, Op shared the field with Kinetic Art - Op artists being drawn to virtual movement, Kinetic artists attracted by the possibility of real motion. Both styles were launched with Le Mouvement, a group exhibition at Galerie Denise Rene in 1955. It attracted a wide international following, and after it was celebrated with a survey exhibition in 1965, The Responsive Eye, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, it caught the public's imagination and led to a craze for Op designs in fashion and the media. To many, it seemed the perfect style for an age defined by the onward march of science, by advances in computing, aerospace, and television. But art critics were never so supportive of it, attacking its effects as gimmicks, and today it remains tainted by those dismissals.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nThe Op art movement was driven by artists who were interested in investigating various perceptual effects. Some did so out of sheer enthusiasm for research and experiment, some with the distant hope that the effects they mastered might find a wide public and hence integrate modern art into society in new ways. Rather like the geometric art from which it had sprung, Op art seemed to supply a style that was highly appropriate to modern society.\n\nAlthough Op can be seen as the successor to geometric abstraction, its stress on illusion and perception suggests that it might also have older ancestors. It may descend from effects that were once popular with Old Masters, such as trompe l'oeil (French: \"deceive the eye\"). Or indeed from anamorphosis, the effect by which images are contorted so that objects are only fully recognizable when viewed from an oblique angle. Or, equally, Op may simply be a child of modern decoration.\n\n(French: \"deceive the eye\"). Or indeed from anamorphosis, the effect by which images are contorted so that objects are only fully recognizable when viewed from an oblique angle. Or, equally, Op may simply be a child of modern decoration. During its years of greatest success in the mid-1960s, the movement was sometimes said to encompass a wide range of artists whose interests in abstraction had little to do with perception. Some, such as Joseph Albers, who were often labeled as Op artists, dismissed it. Yet the fact that the label could seem to apply to so many artists demonstrates how important the nuances of vision have been throughout modern art.\n\nLong after Op art's demise, its reputation continues to hang in the balance. Some critics continue to characterize its designs as \"retinal titillations.\" But others have recently argued that the style represented a kind of abstract Pop art, one which emulated the dazzle of consumer society but which refused, unlike Pop artists like Andy Warhol, to celebrate its icons.\n\nOverview of Op Art\n\nSaying, \u201cthe two creative expressions .. art and science .. form an imaginary construct that is in accord with our sensibility and contemporary knowledge,\u201d Victor Vasarely drew upon his scientific training to create art. The optical effect of his intertwined black and white Zebras (1938) made him the pioneer of Op Art. Beginnings and Development Concepts, Trends, & Related Topics Later Developments and Legacy\n\nArtworks and Artists of Op Art\n\nProgression of Art\n\nArtwork Images 1913 Structural Constellation Artist: Josef Albers In this optical illusion, Albers experiments with the perception of space by depicting how an arrangement of simple lines can create an ambiguous sense of spatial depth. The black rectangular shapes intersect each other from various angles to disorient the viewer's perception of what is in front and what is behind. Even though the forms are not stylistically rendered, the viewer interprets the image as having unstable dimensions. Albers rejected the label \"Op art,\" and his background in the Bauhaus inclined him to be interested in a very rational investigation of the effects of color, yet he never ruled out the usefulness and interest of tricking the eye. Machine-engraved vinylite mounted on wood - The Museum of Modern Art, New York Artwork Images 1964 Blaze Artist: Bridget Riley The zigzag black and white lines in Blaze create the perception of a circular decent. As the brain interprets the image, the alternating pattern appears to shift back and forth. The interlocking lines add depth to the form as it rhythmically curves around the center of the page. The curator Joe Houston has argued that works such as Blaze \"trigger in the viewer an experience equivalent to an atmospheric electric charge; not an illusion, but an \"event.\" Riley herself has said, \"My work has developed on the basis of empirical analyses and syntheses, and I have always believed that perception is the medium through which states of being are directly experienced.\" Screen print on paper - The Institute of Contemporary Prints Artwork Images 1967 Duo- 2 Artist: Victor Vasarely The contrasting warm and cool shades here create the ambiguous illusion of three-dimensional structures. Are they concave, or convex? The illusion is so effective that we are almost led to forget that it is a painted image, and made to think it is a volumetric construction. Although black and white delivered perhaps the most memorable Op images, color also intrigued many Op artists. The scientific study of color had been central to teaching at the Bauhaus, and Vasarely certainly benefited from his education at what was often called the \"Budapest Bauhaus.\" Bauhaus teachers such as Joseph Albers encouraged students to think not of the associations or symbolism of colors, which had so often been important in art, but simply of the effects they had on the eye. Gouache and acrylic on board - Private Collection Artwork Images 1977 Physichromie No. 965 Artist: Carlos Cruz-Diez Carlos Cruz-Diez was one of a remarkable generation of South American artists, often resident in Paris, who had an important impact on Op art. He began to focus on the physical properties of color after viewing the work of Jesus Rafael Soto. He created a technique called \"additive color\" that used evenly spaced colored card strips. Each strip was placed parallel to the next to create the impression of softly modulated tones, which changed according to the position of the viewer. Here Cruz-Diez examined Bauhaus teacher Joannes Itten's theory of the simultaneous perception of different colors through parallel line placement, linear shock, and the fusion of tonalities. The totality of effects creates the illusion of a moving image, exemplifying qualities of Op art and Kinetic art. Mixed media - OAS Art Museum of the Americas, Washington DC Artwork Images 1965 Four Self-Distorting Grids Artist: Fran\u00e7ois Morellet Four Self-Distorting Grids exemplifies the influence of Kinetic art on Op. Movement was crucial to Op art, and while Op artists generally relied on virtual movement - the illusion of movement - some artists used real motion to create effects. In this piece, Morellet experimented with grid forms. He was fond of the way their pre-given character, their common-sense appearance, allowed him to escape traditional approaches to composition in which one part of a design is balanced against another part. This work demonstrates how he also liked to use them, paradoxically, to produce the effects of curves. He would begin by drawing several overlapping lines to create a bowing effect. Here, he puts the idea to work in a motorized sculpture. The four grids shift on an axis to create an abstracted wave of intersecting squares. Aluminum grids, iron poles, and motors - Fundacion Museo de Arte Moderno Jesus Soto, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar Artwork Images 2000 Sphere bleue de Paris Artist: Jesus Rafael Soto Soto, a Venezuelan who came to France in 1950, was another of the many South American artists who made such an important contribution to Op and Kinetic art. The globe-like form in Sphere bleue de Paris appears to defy gravity, suggesting an energetic power-source, a world or universe. It is created by thin strands of blue rubber tubing, evenly spaced, and moved with a gentle wind or slight touch. The tubing creates a segmented sphere that appears to dissolve into thin air as the viewer circles it. Soto began making such works in the mid-1960s, and although this piece was created many years after the Op art movement went into decline, it demonstrates the endurance of many of the movement's personalities and their ideas. An optical illusion is conjured in order to depict a motif that speaks softly and mystically of the possibilities of science. Wood and paint construction with aluminum rods, lamps, and rubber tubing\n\nBeginnings of Op Art\n\nThe term \"Op art\" may have been first used by artist and writer Donald Judd, in a review of an exhibition of \"Optical Paintings\" by Julian Stanczak. But it was made popular by its use in a 1964 Time magazine article, and its origins date back many years. One could see its roots in 19th-century art and color theory, in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's writings on color, and particularly in the Neo-impressionist paintings of Georges Seurat.\n\nHowever, the style we now know as Op emerged from the work of Victor Vasarely, who first explored unusual perceptual effects in some designs from the 1930s. It was given a further boost by the group show Le Mouvement at Galerie Denise Rene in Paris in 1955, and later by a series of international exhibitions exploring what was known for a time as the \"New Tendency.\" Vasarely's work soon attracted followers across the world: Bridget Riley, who, like Vasarely, had worked in advertising, took up the style (soon achieving even more prominence than Vasarely) and many South American artists, mainly residing in Paris, also worked in an Op mode.\n\nThe pinnacle of the movement's success was 1965, when the Museum of Modern Art embraced the style with the exhibition The Responsive Eye, which showcased 123 paintings and sculptures by artists such as Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Frank Stella, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesus Rafael Soto, and Josef Albers. Many museum attendees were intrigued by the collision of art and science, but critics such as Clement Greenberg were vehemently opposed to the movement. The breadth of exhibitions such as The Responsive Eye also cast doubt on the movement, since by including artists such as Frank Stella, whose interests were so different from those of Vasarely, the label seemed almost too broad to be useful or plausible.\n\nOp Art: Concepts, Styles, and Trends\n\nOp artists were typically concerned with the behavior of the eye, and they developed abstract compositions to explore a variety of optical phenomena. After-images, moire effects, dazzling, and all kinds of other effects resulting from the eye's struggle to read an image were of interest to them. The movement never produced a coherent body of ideas, and the range and scope of its artists' interests made the Op art label seem very flexible. Yet the fact that the label could embrace them shows how important vision and its effects have been throughout modern art.\n\nTypically, Op artists used only black and white in order to produce the greatest contrast in their designs, since this contrast causes the greatest confusion for the eye, which struggles to discern which element of the composition is in the foreground and which in the background. But color was also a focus of attention at times, as in Vasarely's Plastic Alphabet series (1960-1980). The ways in which color suggests space, and the ways colors contrast with one another, proved fertile areas for experiment.\n\nLater Developments - After Op Art\n\nAlthough the highly complex perceptual effects created by Op artists were embraced by the general public, many art critics considered the phenomena to be a fleeting and somewhat gimmicky trend. Commercial success may have led to the decline of the movement, in particular after some artists discovered that their work designs were borrowed by American clothing manufacturers. Op art elements were also translated into posters, t-shirts and book illustrations. Audiences who initially embraced the movement later denounced it as nothing more than tricks of the eye. Although the movement lost popularity by 1968, the systematic optical effects continue to be explored in visual art and architecture.\n\nUseful Resources on Op Art\n\nSimilar Art"}, {"url": "https://magazine.artland.com/art-movement-op-art/", "page_content": "Famous Op Art artists and iconic Op Art artworks\n\nVictor Vasarely\n\nVictor Vasarely is considered to be one the most important representatives of optical painting. He took inspiration and orientation from theories of the Bauhaus, Suprematism, and geometric abstraction. He was born in P\u00e9cs, Hungary in 1906 and grew up in Piestany and Budapest, where he became acquainted with the basics of traditional academic painting as well as with the Bauhaus movement. Much of Vasarely\u2019s life and work was about the Op Art style. His paintings aimed at forcing people out of their visual comfort zone with the pleasant tension created by apparently moving images that steer their minds towards doubt and new ideas. He wanted to bring life into everyday life with the play of colors and shapes, immersing himself in the world of optical art experiments.\n\nBridget Riley\n\nBridget Riley is one of the best-known Op Art painters, famous for her striking murals composed of multiple stripes which create optical illusions for the viewer. Her black and white geometric patterns explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye, creating an illusion of movement and colour. Born in 1931 in London, Riley studied at Goldsmith\u2019s College and the Royal Academy of Art. Riley is known in the public consciousness for her iconic black and white geometric works, as well as for her temporary public murals in major institutions such as the Tate gallery in London and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne in Paris. She currently lives and works in both the United Kingdom and France.\n\nRichard Anuskiewicz\n\nRichard Anuskiewicz, Plus Reversed, 1960. Photograph: Museum of Art, University of Austin, Texas\n\nHe was one of the founders and foremost exponents of Op Art during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1964, Life magazine ran a feature on him in which they called him \u201cone of the new wizards of Op Art\u201d. Born in Erie, Pennsylvania, Anuskiewicz went to the Cleveland Institution of Art where he found and became interested in Op Art. He graduated and went to Yale and, interestingly enough, was taught by Josef Albers for some time. Anuszkiewicz is still actively painting today.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Morellet\n\nBorn in 1926 in Cholet, a small town in the Loire Valley, Fran\u00e7ois Morellet was a painter, graphic artist and sculptor. He was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d\u2019Art Visuel (GRAV) along with the Argentines, Julio Le Parc and Francisco Sobrino. The experimental work done by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet was parallel to artists like Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt or Dan Flavin. Morellet continually explored a wide range of practices and incorporated diverse materials into his work such as steel, iron, adhesive tape, wire mesh and wood. He was convinced that painting was the discipline of the past, so he advocated the use of new materials like neon, that eventuallz became the main element of his aesthetic language. Many of his works, that bear inexplicable titles, rely on the interaction of the observer due to electrical systems that turn them on and off.\n\nThe legacy of the Op Art movement\n\nArtists today enhance the scope and range of the Op Art movement and continue to draw on earlier investigations while continuing to expand it into three-dimensional space. Austrian artist Peter Kogler is one of these artists, who operate at the forefront of technology while contributing greatly to the Op Art movement. Over the past 20 years, Kogler has worked towards a radical transformation of the exhibition space, making it an integral part of his work. Moreover, his unique patterns have taken a wide variety of formats including prints, sculpture, furniture, wallpaper, lighting fixtures, collages, and room-sized Op Art influenced labyrinths.\n\nInstallation view of Peter Kogler\u2019s solo exhibition of Galerie Mitterrand.\n\nRelevant sources to learn more\n\nThe Most Famous Art Movements and Styles\n\nThe Drive to Classify Art Movements\n\nArt Movement: Bauhaus\n\nArt Movement: Cubism\n\nArt Movements: Dadaism\n\nArt Movement: Futurism\n\nArt Movement: Impressionism"}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-op-art-182388", "page_content": "Op Art (short for Optical Art) is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s. It is a distinct style of art that creates the illusion of movement. Through the use of precision and mathematics, stark contrast, and abstract shapes, these sharp pieces of artwork have a three-dimensional quality that is not seen in other styles of art.\n\nOp Art Emerges in the 1960s\n\nFlashback to 1964. In the United States, we were still reeling from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, encapsulated in the Civil Rights movement, and being \"invaded\" by British pop/rock music. Many people were also over the notion of achieving the idyllic lifestyles that were so prevalent in the 1950s. It was a perfect time for a new artistic movement to burst on the scene.\n\nIn October of 1964, in an article describing this new style of art, Time Magazine coined the phrase \"Optical Art\" (or \"Op Art\", as it's more commonly known). The term referenced the fact that Op Art is comprised of illusion and often appears to the human eye to be moving or breathing due to its precise, mathematically-based composition.\n\nAfter (and because of) a major 1965 exhibition of Op Art entitled \"The Responsive Eye,\" the public became enraptured with the movement. As a result, one began to see Op Art everywhere: in print and television advertising, as LP album art, and as a fashion motif in clothing and interior design.\n\nAlthough the term was coined and the exhibition held in the mid-1960s, most people who have studied these things agree that Victor Vasarely pioneered the movement with his 1938 painting \"Zebra.\"\n\nM. C. Escher's style has sometimes caused him to be listed as an Op artist as well, though they don't quite fit the definition. Many of his best-known works were created in the 1930s and include amazing perspectives and use of tessellations (shapes in close arrangements). These two certainly helped point the way for others.\n\nIt can also be argued that none of Op Art would have been possible\u2014let alone embraced by the public\u2014without the prior Abstract and Expressionist movements. These led the way by de-emphasizing (or, in many cases, eliminating) representational subject matter.\n\nOp Art Remains Popular\n\nAs an \"official\" movement, Op Art has been given a lifespan of around three years. This doesn't mean, however, that every artist ceased employing Op Art as their style by 1969.\n\nBridget Riley is one noteworthy artist who has moved from achromatic to chromatic pieces but has steadfastly created Op Art from its beginning to the present day. Additionally, anyone who has gone through a post-secondary fine arts program probably has a tale or two of Op-ish projects created during color theory studies.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that, in the digital age, Op Art is sometimes viewed with bemusement. Perhaps you, too, have heard the (rather snide, some would say) comment, \"A child with the proper graphic design software could produce this stuff.\" Quite true, a gifted child with a computer and the proper software at her disposal could certainly create Op Art in the 21st century.\n\nThis certainly wasn't the case in the early 1960s, and the 1938 date of Vasarely's \"Zebra\" speaks for itself in this regard. Op Art represents a great deal of math, planning and technical skill, as none of it came freshly-inked out of a computer peripheral. Original, hand-created Op Art deserves respect, at the very least.\n\nWhat Are the Characteristics of Op Art?\n\nOp Art exists to fool the eye. Op compositions create a sort of visual tension in the viewer's mind that gives works the illusion of movement. For example, concentrate on Bridget Riley's \"Dominance Portfolio, Blue\" (1977) for even a few seconds and it begins to dance and wave in front of your eyes.\n\nRealistically, you know that any Op Art piece is flat, static, and two-dimensional. Your eye, however, begins sending your brain the message that what it's seeing has begun to oscillate, flicker, throb and any other verb one can employ to mean, \"Yikes! This painting is moving!\"\n\nOp Art is not meant to represent reality. Due to its geometrically-based nature, Op Art is, almost without exception, non-representational. Artists do not attempt to depict anything we know in real life. Instead, it is more like abstract art in which composition, movement, and shape dominate.\n\nOp Art is not created by chance. The elements employed in a piece of Op Art are carefully chosen to achieve maximum effect. In order for the illusion to work, each color, line, and shape must contribute to the overall composition. It takes a great deal of forethought to successfully create artwork in the Op Art style.\n\nOp Art relies on two specific techniques. The critical techniques used in Op Art are perspective and careful juxtaposition of color. The color may be chromatic (identifiable hues) or achromatic (black, white, or gray). Even when color is used, they tend to be very bold and can be either complementary or high-contrast.\n\nOp Art typically does not include the blending of colors. The lines and shapes of this style are very well defined. Artists do not use shading when transitioning from one color to the next and quite often two high-contrast colors are placed next to each other. This harsh shift is a key part of what disturbs and tricks your eye into seeing movement where there is none.\n\nOp Art embraces negative space. In Op Art\u2014as in perhaps no other artistic school\u2014positive and negative spaces in a composition are of equal importance. The illusion could not be created without both, so Op artists tend to focus just as much on the negative space as they do the positive."}, {"url": "https://www.artlex.com/art-movements/op-art/", "page_content": "What is Op Art?\n\nOp art is a form of abstract visual art that uses geometric forms to create optical illusions. The term \u201cOp Art\u201d is short for optical art. With the formal movement beginning in the 1960s, op artists explore theories of optics, perception and color theory by creating geometric patterns that create optical illusions and often give the viewer the impression that the artwork is somehow in motion.\n\nNotable Op Artwork\n\nHistory of Op Art\n\nOptical illusions date back to ancient Greece and were used to explore the complexities of human vision and the human mind. Hidden images were a popular form of optical illusion, especially in the 19th century when scientists were particularly interested in the mechanics of visual illusions. Optical illusions later became popular in society as a form of entertainment and were used casually among friends, in books and magazines, and even in stage productions. Eventually, optical illusions made their way into the art world.\n\nThe use of optical illusions in modern art and contemporary art is often called optical art. Optical art was a form of abstract art that was initially popular in New York City and most European countries, later expanding into South America. The term Op Art was officially coined in 1964 in relation to major developments in the op art movement. Time magazine coined Op Art as a form of specifically non-objective art, or abstract art, that used painting illusionism to produce optical illusions. At first, many art critics disliked op art for its graphic, almost commercial aesthetic.\n\nLike any other art movement, the techniques and style central to optical art developed over time and with inspiration from previous modern art movements. Neo-Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism and Dadaism all serve as precursors to the Op Art movement. Each movement had its own unique treatment of color and form that eventually combined to influence optical art.\n\nArtists like Francis Picabia, Victor Vasarely and John McHale had been making optical paintings, what would later be described as op art works, since the 1920s and 1930s. Works like Francis Picabia\u2019s Optophone I from 1921-22 and Victor Vasarely\u2019s painting Zebras from 1938 are examples of op art\u2019s characteristic look: bands of black and white lines that appear to pop out of the painting and into the viewer\u2019s space while simultaneously floating backwards in the picture plane. Creating this ambiguous sense of spatial depth would disorient the viewer\u2019s perception of what is in the foreground and what is in the background.\n\nTrompe-l\u2019\u0153il, the technique of depicting objects as if they existed in three-dimensional space, was also of particularly strong influence despite its historically hyper-realistic depiction of subject matter. Dada and Surrealist artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Salvador Dal\u00ed used trompe-l\u2019\u0153il and optical illusions in their photographs, paintings and even sculptures.\n\nOp art is sometimes referred to as perceptual art or retinal art because it creates a visual experience based on how human vision functions. The illusion of movement and the interaction of colors were key aspects of op art because they could be combined to explore the ability of art to challenge the notion of perception on a physiological level. While other movements were challenging the limits of conceptual perception, or the understanding of multiple concepts within and beyond one work of art, op artists challenged what viewers actually saw in the art.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the success of op art peaked despite the disapproval of critics who saw the movement as trivial. In 1965, the Museum of Modern Art held an exhibition called The Responsive Eye, whose variety of paintings represented op art as an intersection between art and science.\n\nLater Developments in Op Art\n\nWhile op art began as a movement in optical painting, artists such as Hungarian photographer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Molohy-Nagy produced photographs in the same style. Moholy-Nagy also taught photographic op art in the Bauhaus, the German school founded by Walter Gropius, and influenced many photographers to continue in this style. The Bauhaus was an important part of establishing the relationship between op art, psychological research and unified, functional artwork and design.\n\nKinetic art is an artistic movement that is very closely related to op art. The main difference between the two movements is that kinetic art generally uses three-dimensional forms to create illusions, whereas op art creates the illusion of three-dimensionality on a two-dimensional surface. Kinetic artists also present unified works as kinetic expressions based on optical illusions.\n\nThe graphic and color effects of op art eventually made it popular within commercial contexts, such as advertising, which led to a fall in popularity in the art world by 1968. However, artists and architects continued to explore optical effects and the human mind. Because of its almost mathematical placement of lines and shapes, op art also appeals to contemporary artists and viewers. The use of digital media in art production expanded the possibilities of op art to create optical illusions that continue to mesmerize viewers around the world.\n\nOp Art Techniques\n\nOp art often combines distinctly different elements to create a stark contrast between the foreground and background of an artwork. Using black and white lines and abstract patterns to create geometric abstraction is one of the most popular ways that artists created op art. Usually, the black and white lines were arranged in close proximity to each other, often creating an after-image of certain colors that seemed to vibrate or flash in and out. In op art, positive and negative spaces complement each other and are equally important to the creation of the optical and luminous phenomenon.\n\nIn Theory of Colours, German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe contends that the illusion of color appears at the edge where light and dark meet because lightness and darkness are two foundational properties in the creation of color [1]. This is why our retinas perceive there to be color at the intersection of repeated black and white lines and geometric shapes such as black and white grids.\n\nWhile black and white op art was more popular earlier on in the movement, artists such as Bridget Riley, Julian Stanczak and Richard Anuskiewicz eventually began to create colorful op art. Artists often used complementary colors in color-based op art because complementary colors (colors opposite to each other on the color wheel) create vivid, simultaneous contrast. This contrast was used to create depth in a composition and produce a wider range of effects on the eye than the black and white works. Works such as Kezdi-Ga from 1970 by French Hungarian op artist Victor Vasarely use color to create a more intense illusion of three-dimensional shapes and space. The architectural shape of the entire composition seems to protrude from the paper\u2019s surface and toward the viewer.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang. (1810, 1970).

The interview was conducted by Paul Cummings for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.\n\nInterview\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's December 9. Paul Cummings talking to AdjaYunkers. Let me ask you about your first name just out of curiosity because I've seen it spelled differently \u2013 or different names in different places.\n\nADJA YUNKERS: You see, originally when I came over to this country in 1947 they thought I was a Swede because I had come from Sweden. So the Museum of Modern Art, which already had several of my things before I came here, had it in the catalogue, you see, and I discovered it and it took me five years to get rid of that. I am not a Swede. My first name is spelled A-d-j-a. That's the correct spelling. The last name is Y-u-n-k-e-r-s. Many people spell it with a \"G.\"\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: With a \"G,\" yes.\n\nADJA YUNKERS: The German Gunker, you know. But actually my origin is Dutch.\n\nPUAL CUMMINGS: Oh, really!\n\nADJA YUNKERS: The original name is Jonker (J-o-n-k..) It goes way back to the shipbuilders who came to Russia from Holland with Peter the Great, and the name became Russianized because people couldn't write nor pronounce it. So it became Yunkers. That's how it started.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see. You were born in \u2013 what? - Latvia?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I was born on Riga. It was Russia at the time. It became Latvia in 1918. It is an accidental thing that I was born there because my father had a job there. After I was a year old we moved back to St. Petersburg.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What did he do?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: He was an engineer. So that's where I was brought up.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In St. Petersburg?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What was it like growing up there?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Fantastic. People who come back, you know, my mother-in-law was there just recently, and literati like Kunitz and so on who were there, and Jay Smith and George Wilbur, who are my friends, they were raving about it. It's a beautiful city. It's really the Venice of the North to coin a cliche. Wherever you go you always see water, canals and this magnificent, large, overpowering river, the Neva which crosses through St. Petersburg. There are little islands and we lived on an island. We had a wild, large garden.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, marvelous. Did you have brothers and sisters?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, I have a brother and a sister. My father is dead. He died in a labor camp during the Hitler attack on Russia. He grabbed everybody who could just crawl and put them in labor camps in Germany. My father was standing in water, that's what I heard. I hadn't seen him since I was fourteen years old when I left home. This is the whole drama of my life. And I hadn't seen my father mother, sister, or brother up until 1952 or something.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: My goodness! How did you get together?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: The thing is absolutely absurd because its only a biological fact that I have a sister and a brother at this point. There is no means of communication whatsoever. I saw them once. And after ten minutes the roof was falling down with explosion between my brother and me; my mother crying and my sister crying.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What does your brother do?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: My brother is an engineer, too. And although he had gone through all those damned experiences he still is for law and order. He's a fascist. He hates the Jews, he hates the Negros, he hates the Puerto Ricans, you know; so what is there---?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Does he live in this country?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Somewhere in America. It was fantastic because, you see, in 1948 I got a letter from my sister, from Berlin. She was working in a military office as a typist. It was the Quakers who found me. When I received the letter I was in Albuquerque at the University. My name on the envelope was practically invisible because it was all covered with kind of Cabalistic signs and stamps. It had gone throughout the whole world including the Congo, and then back via England to Paris, Paris to Stockholm and forwarded from Stockholm to the New School here. Finally the New School forwarded it to the University. So I opened the letter and there was a photo of a family group and the message in the letter was as if we had seen each other a week ago. You know, it was crazy. Then when I came back to New York after that summer job I had my first Guggenheim- no second Guggenheim. At that time I was already with Dore, and we decided to go to Italy. While we were preparing to go to Europe I received a letter from some strange immigration office in charge of something that I had to guarantee the arrival here of my relatives. So I signed all the papers. Then we left for Italy. That was in 1950. When we returned from Europe, off and on Dore would nudge me and say, \"Aren't you going to see your relatives? It's about time you did.\" All right. One day I decided I would go to see them. I took the train to wherever it was. I arrived in that city and had forgotten their address. It was absolutely Freudian, you know. And it didn't occur to me to telephone to New York and ask Dore to look in the little black book and give me the address. I went to the police, to voting offices and so on; but nobody knew of them. So finally at seven o'clock in the evening I called New York. I had been walking the streets from eleven to seven looking for my brother and sister.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really trying to avoid it though.\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Exactly. It was Freudian, you know. So I telephone New York and got the address and then I telephone my relatives and said I'm coming now. They had waited fro me since lunch. I arrived there and there was this huge table full of delicacies and what have you. And, as I say, I sat down and ten minutes later boom! So I left. I haven't seen them since.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's amazing. Anyway, could we go back and talk about growing up in St. Petersburg and what it was like?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Actually there is very little to say about it because- this may sound funny- you see we had a big house and I lived in one end. I had my rooms, and I had a model. My father never, never came to my quarters. And one bloody night, you know, there was a knock at the door; he opened the door. He said \"oh, pardon me,\" and closed the door. That was it. I was just sitting there drawing. I was fourteen years old. So next morning I was called to my father's study. I stood at attention- yes, Sir; no, Sir; he bawled me out. I was making a brothel out of the house, and what have you. He threw things at me, books and so on. \"Go.\" So I left the room, went to my room, went to my rooms, packed and left.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: When did you start drawing?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, I started drawing when I was seven, you know, trivial things as everybody does. I had an uncle who was the black sheep of the family, he sort of supported me morally. One day I was walking on the streets and came to a house that was laid out with tiles in gold and blue and silver, beautiful blues. I went in. It was the art school of Leningrad. All these girls were standing there in their white coats. So that got me. I enrolled there, my uncle gave me the money for it. I could only slink out of the house in the evenings so I went so I went there in the evenings. I never attended classes. I\u2018d go up to the cafeteria and stay there. In Russia it would be China where we simply drank tea. There I would sit and listen to much older guys talking about love, life, art, God, you know, the usual things. It was bloody serious. That's how I started.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: what kind of other education did you have?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I have no formal education.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You didn't have primary schools?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No. I didn't go to school. You see I wasn't even baptized. Because it was raining, my father refused to go. It's extraordinary, so you know, the whole thing is crazy. I had tutors at home, students who would come. But most of the time they were teaching me how to play chess and would lecture me about revolutions, the social problems. Our house was a revolutionary house because my father was one of the organizers of the first Russian Revolution of 1905. We had all sorts of people at the house. That is my background really politically and otherwise. I have a very varies foundation.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Very active.\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Very active, yes. Then came the Revolution. In 1915 I enrolled in the army. Somebody pointed out that my only qualification was that I was a good horseman. I was in the cavalry. I fought the Germans, or rather ran from them. At this time I thought it was about time to find my parents and become reconciled with them. I didn't find them. They had gone to Riga. It took me, oh, about three months to get to Riga. Nothing worked. The railroads were all broken up. Bands of soldiers were roaming the country. Anarchist groups. After three months when I got to Riga I was shanghaied by the Latvians.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. So I had to instruct men with beards because I still had my uniform on, of course it had no epaulets, so they just forced me. I did it for, oh, I don't know, a month or two.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What did you have to do?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Instruct them, left, right, down, up; they were marching around bare- footed with broomsticks.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible.\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's the first thing a republic does. The police and the army against the internal fiend or enemy.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic.\n\nADJA YUNKJERS: So then one day I succeeded in escaping. I went over the border into Germany. That was the closest country. That's how I happened to get out of Russia. It was a fluke of fate, not for political reasons whatsoever.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: This was what then?\n\nADJA YUNKERS: This was 1919. Then I was kept on the German side by a lieutenant with a monocle who wore a corset. It was lovely, really lovely. I lived wonderfully. Well, he was a very well read and very civilized person. He sort of patronized me until the papers of permit came from Berlin. I arrived in Berlin with no money. I was very hungry. It was a long ride, it took twenty-four hours. The whole thing was disorganized in Germany at that time. The Revolution Sparticist had just ended in Bavaria. There were other putsches in Berlin. And here I was walking around in a Russian uniform. They were literally spitting at me and jostling me. I was going around in circles, I couldn't speak any German. I walked around the whole day. I got hungrier and hungrier. It got to be around ten o'clock at night. I decided it was a matter of utter desperation. I happened to turn into a street which I had later got to know was entirely dedicated to night cafes, cabarets, clubs. One side was for homosexuals and the other side was entirely for lesbians. Everything was organized. The vice was organized. You see now you only have to look at Richard Linder's pictures and there it is. He may hedonize it but of course it's a hangover.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Sure.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: And he knows that. We've often talked about it. So in one block there were sadists; the next block was for masochists; and for this and this and this specialty. And they would never trespass on each other.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Women with these boots with high steel heels and whips. It was a fantastic time. Well anyway, I went there- and, you see, I didn't know- I had never drank before. I sat down and automatically there was a bottle of wine on the table. So I had a drink on an empty stomach. I got dead drunk. After that I don't remember anything. I only vaguely remember that somebody was speaking Russian to me. The next morning I awoke in Hamburg.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, that's literally true. I found in the pocket of my uniform, you know, we had those long coats (which they wear now)\u2014\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes, the maxi coat.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: --split in the back so you could sit in the saddle- I found this piece of paper which said \"Batuchka, you're much too innocent and too young and too good to be in this bloody city and I take the liberty of putting you on a train to Hamburg where you will feel much better I'm sure.\" There was no signature, nothing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, so I awakened in Hamburg at sic o'clock in the morning.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You did a lot of traveling.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I did a lot of traveling, believe me.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you remember who the German officer was that you first met?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, I don't remember his name. He was one of those Prussian Barons. I've often thought of him because he gave me quite a lot. I don't like the Germans, you know. But at the time I didn't know who they were. But no matter what they are, this man was literally exquisite. We played chess, we talked about literature. He taught me a hell of a lot.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How long were you there?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: About a month. That's a long time, you know. The only thing I can say is that I'm grateful to him. He pointed out certain things to be about painting and art. During that day in Berlin I walked around and looked in the windows and saw all those art books. That's where I first saw a book about German Expressionism. At that time I was entirely removed from expressionism because my dealings were with the Contructivists, which was my great experience in Russia.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you know any of those people?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I knew one of them, yes. But above all I knew poets. And some young painters. I knew Andre Bloch who used to be nice to me. I met Maiergosse. And so on and so forth. It's just a simple story.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You've always had an interest in poetry and literature?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes, always. I cannot conceive doing anything in my work that does not relate in one sense or another to poetry. This is visible in my work. There's a certain sensuality, you know, put it that way.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Poetry always seems to be a great part of Russian life.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes! Oh, yes, I mean they are not separable. It would be on the same level, let's say, like- a typical, outstanding example would be Picasso. The same thing. Art begets art. Art thrives in art. I think that many, many things that Picasso did literally originated by poets, by talks, discussions with poets. It so happens that this summer I translated Kahnweiler's memoirs on Picasso From German into English and certain things from French into English. And I found there the most fantastic things. Who knows, you know?...But Kahnweiler I would believe because he would have his conversations with Picasso and then go home and write them down. But since he was German, a romantic, he may have exaggerated or stressed certain points which were beyond Picasso's intended meaning. There is one little episode which sort of sticks out. Kahnweiler calls Picasso and asks him if he may come add see him. There's a pause. Picasso says to him, \"Yes, is it pour le plaisir, or pour le business?\" There's a pause on the other end, and Kahnweiler says, \"Pour le plaisir, Ma\u00eetre.\" Picasso says, \"You're welcome, come.\" That's how he starts each evening. It's beautiful. And they talk about the greatest banalities: about how lonely an artist is, and he had to create his own loneliness and solitude; and it's the only way to be able to create, and how difficult it is to do \"because we're surrounded by watches.\" There's a pause. He says to Kahnweiler, \"Have you ever seen a saint with a watch?\" Visualize it. It's marvelous. I think of Bosch and The Temptation of Saint Anthony with a wrist watch.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's marvelous.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, but the beautiful thing is (which really shocked me) that when I was forced to reminisce and give this talk, I had to go back to things and collect material and to nail down dates\u2014you know going through life so much is like an ash can\u2014I wasn't sure about certain dates so I had to do research to make it accurate. Then I got to thinking of the things I was doing. And here I am now sixty-nine years old. And I'm doing the things I did in 1915-1917, right?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In what way?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I mean like these Minimal things. I mean the simplicity. That's how I started out. I've made a complete circle through all the movements. The only movement I didn't stay longer that ten minutes with was Surrealism. But I went through all the Cubist thing and so on and so forth.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What was your relationship to the Constructivists?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, it was baffling. Look, Malevich, for instance. And the manifestos of Malevich. It was too much for a young guy of fourteen, fifteen years old. The thing was, I was like an unbroken ass. I wasn't corrupt. I had no schooling, no academic background in the artistic sense. I never had done anything in that sense. I had an open mind. And that was very exciting because, you see, these things happened in relation to the things that happened politically in Russia, too.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: They were of great significance. I remember during the Revolution in 1917, 1918 there were posters in the streets on the houses sometimes, manifestos by artists, by Malvich. Big manifestos next to government declarations and the revolutionary parties. It was a fantastic thing. The street cars were painted cubistically outside.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really!\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. And the poets were standing on the corners reading poetry. In no time there would be hundreds of people around listening. All this I say in this talk of mine. And you will have the information much better that I'm putting it in this interview. This is one thing that inhibits me in this situations now because I have to go over the same ground.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. And it's cold.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's repetitious.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I'm curious about the art school that you went to. Was it academic?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No! No! Well, the most modern thing was the Russian Symbolist \u2013 now what in hell is his name? \u2013 you know the museum on Riverside Drive?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes, yes, yes.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Now what is his name? He was a Symbolist and he finally took it all over here and made them build that museum.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I know who you mean but I can't think of his name.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: He was officially my teacher. So was Rienden.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: You know, this figurative painter. A very good painter, too. But, oh, somehow for me even then I couldn't tell you now, they were abstract things; the sublimation of things. And above all according to Malevich, the Suprematists, you know, nothing is to be touched; only feeling is the important thing, you know. Then he had long discussions about white and black and so on. There were white paintings and black paintings, pure black. I remember one painting I saw one day in a exhibit, it was a small painting absolutely black, there were tiny, tiny, barely perceptible scratches in it; and the title was A Negro at Night. I've never forgotten that.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's very interesting. Even that long ago.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. Look, I mean it sounds phony, or maybe funny, to say that it has been done, eh?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Lots of things have been done.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: So I've been through it, you see. There are certain things that I just don't look at anymore because they're banal travesties, banal variations on the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, eh?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Whether they know it or not it seems.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, they know it. They looked it up. I know that they do. I've had long talks with Rauschenberg. I know that they do. He knows everything about it.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Some of those people are very good art historians.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Of course, they know it very well, they're very intelligent people, they're very bright. Jasper Johns, for instance, is an exquisite man.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Let's go back to the chronology a bit. You ended up on the train in Hamburg!\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. Well, look, this is like a story. So there I was on the street at six o'clock. As I said, I didn't speak German. I washed up and I went out on the street. Again I say I was hungry. This is the leitmotif of my life up to the age of thirty-five. I've been always hungry. I starved a lot, in fact one day I decided to finish it and starve myself to death. I was discovered in my room by accident. Somebody came up and brought me back to life.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How old were you when that happened?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Twenty-eight. I've dies several deaths, you know. I once died from opium smoking, and I was brought back to life.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That was when?- in your twenties?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: In Hamburg. Yes, I was in my twenties. I smoked opium. I would smoke opium in the day time and work at night. That was the only time in my life I did work at night.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kind of things did you do then?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, if you want to have a simile, let's say, like Kandinsky, on that level. I had my first show in Hamburg- well, the story goes like this: you see I was there and there was this poster and I saw there- what is his name? Sergei something- a Russian name- I will recall it in a minute- a dancer- and it said \"Kammerspiel\"- I could read, you know. So I went to a policeman and I said, \"Kammerspiel\" and pointed to the poster. He just pointed across the square and there was the Kammerspiel just two steps from the station. It was early in the morning so I sat there on the steps waiting for somebody to come. Around ten o'clock somebody did come, an accountant or bookkeeper. Somehow we managed with his broken French. He gave me money for tram car fare. I found the place where the dancer lived. In the meantime the accountant had telephoned him that I was coming. When I arrived I was received in this baroque living room. He was a dancer. They were playing Bach. There was a pink wall around him. Of course he was much interested in me, so he sent me on to somebody else, to a Russian to a Russian lady who was married to a German professor in the arts and crafts school in Hamburg. I came there and she received me very nicely. She gave me a room, I stayed there. She gave me materials to paint and everything. After a while the atmosphere became too hot and I just left and never came back. So I was walking the streets and sleeping in the parks. It was summer. One of the whore picked me up. She said, \"I see you walking. You're crazy. Come with me.\" So I came with her. And every night I worked there in her room in the brothel. At ten o'clock I would leave and at one o'clock I was permitted to come back. That's where I made my first exhibit \u2013 I mean not in the brothel but I did the work. Then I showed at Maria Kunde Gallery, which was a very good gallery comparable, let's say, to Martha Jackson at the time. And I sold out. Museums and collectors bought. And suddenly all doors opened. I still was in Russian uniform mind you. I had no money to buy. So the first thing I did was get rid of my Cossack uniform.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Out with the uniform!\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: And that's how I started. And then came the business. And I went to Italy where I met Cavallon and other people of The New Realism who were very sweet to me.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What were the first pictures like?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, religious.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Magic religious pictures, Madonnas and saints and Crucifixions and so on. These were all done with ink, watercolor and my fingernails. I had no materials yet.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: They were done on wrapping paper, you know this fat repellant paper that is used for sandwiches that I got from the brothel from all the girls. I just smoothed them out and drew on them.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. That was a very colorful time.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It sounds as if you had lots of fun in those days.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I had, yes. But it was misery, too, because don't forget the whole thing, the so-called Russian soul. And I really was miserable because, notwithstanding all the other pleasures I had, I was really frightfully \u2013 I was looking for God. I was a lost soul. I had seen so much blood, you know, as a young man. It's very hard to get rid of these things, to find yourself. It's very destructive.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So the military part of your life really had an effect on you?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, it hadn't, but The Revolution had an effect upon me. To see people tortured and shot like that point blank. I had three horses that were shot under me. All those things like that. All that reality that goes with war. I was a young man seventeen years old.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Everything happened very quickly.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Very quickly and intensely. So my whole life I lived very fast, and I have lived it, and I still do. You know there's this comparison with ruins, for instance. Now what you have here in architecture I call modern ruins not because they're eating time ten years and then they're thrown out.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: And so I'm a modern man I'm eating time, so I'm the perfect symbol for a ruin.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUIMMINGS: That's a marvelous expression. How long did you stay in Hamburg?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Ohm I stayed in Hamburg and got a son there with a dancer. I met Labandar there, the papa of modern dance choreography, and danced for a while. And I met my first serious love and have a son. Of course now he's somewhere is Germany, had children.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you hear from him at all?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Through his mother, yes. Well, a long time elapsed until I came to Sweden because I was running away from Hitler from Paris. I got a letter from her. She had written to the Museum of Modern Art and the found me.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic. Yes. And then just a few years ago there was a congress in Warsaw and Prague. Dore wanted to go to this congress. We were in Paris, so I put her on the train at Gare du Nord and she went off to Warsaw. I came back and it was raining as usual in Paris. So I took the street directory, the little red book, you know, and I started reading it form A to Z, the names of the streets. Suddenly I discovered that though I had lived for fifteen years in Paris I had never bothered to notice the fantastic poetry in the names of the streets- La Place des Anges, and so on and so forth, and I wrote that down. When I was through doing that I thought, what next? What will I do now? So I took a plane and went to Hamburg. And then she told me stories about my son and herself. Pretty gruesome, it has no bearing on me. Then later she wrote me letters and she said, \"Do you know what happened? There was a traveling show and you were in that traveling show and he saw it and he divorced his wife, left his children ( he was a professor of mathematics with tenure and all that at University of Dresden) and he abandoned all that, and do you know what he is doing? Now he's writing about art and publishing art books.\"\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's a true fact.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, boy! Everywhere you go something happens.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's true, yes. I remember when I came to London for the first time in 1936 from Paris.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how did you get to Paris? \u2013 because I still have you back in the mid- twenties in Hamburg.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I just left there. In 1924I was in Dresden. Never mind the circumstance under which I happened to be there. And I lived in ____ Studio. It was a tower with sixteen windows in the house of the D\u00fcrer Bund which is the D\u00fcrer association to continue the propagation of D\u00fcrer's work. So I had that studio. One of my mistresses came from Berlin and stayed with me. Suddenly I got this great melancholia, and I told her, \"I can't stand it any more. I'm going to leave.\" She said, \"well, where are you going?\" Out in the hall there was a big globe and she said, \"Let's go. And you close your eyes and turn the globe and wherever you point you're going.\" So it was Cuba. Three days later I was on my way to Cuba, and I arrived in Havana. Lots of things happened there. At that time, you see, the first dictator Machado was in power. In 1927, I got involved with these things. With one of my friends, Alejo Carpentier, who was a musician and music critic and so on, we built a nucleus.... when I came there, there was nothing. The children were still running around in their underpants. So we organized\u2014Alejo organized chamber music. I helped to publish the first and only art magazine, one issue. We had the first modern show, lectures. It was a terrific life. By the time we got around to making an Afro-Cuban theatre, the political situation was such that we had to leave. I met some of the min 1928 in Paris. Some had been shot and killed and thrown into the water to the sharks. I went to Mexico, and that's where I met Diego Rivera. So then I came back.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What happened in Mexico?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, I'm just telling you, you see. One of the stories is- I first landed at Vera Cruz and made my way up to Mexico City. I was looking for Diego Rivera. I came to his house- it was one of the first Corbusier houses (you know he lived in Paris for a time before he went back to Mexico). His house was surrounded by huge cactus plants, high trees, fifty feet high, and there was a wonderful fence. I went to the gate. There was not a soul in the whole house. I went from room to room and finally came to a bedroom in which there was a bed half the size of this room. And on that bed is lying a baby by Frida. Next to the bed is a big ten gallon or fifteen gallon hat and a coat, a maxi. Now I knew I was in Mexico. That was the time he was painting the frescos for the ministry, the Casa Publico.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you spend much time in Mexico?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Half a year or something like that. Then I went back to Hamburg. I took care of some private affairs there, I just decided to quit it all and went back to Paris and settled there. But the experience with Diego Rivera and the frescoes and Orozco and all these people was so tremendous.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What was that like?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, it was very wild. I was practically born with a social conscience, you know, and with my whole political background I was very much to the Left. So I had the idea that I would like to paint frescoes. This had never been done in Europe ever, that is political frescoes, and still not even today. Finally, I decided to visit Barbusse. I told him about my experiences and what I would like to do. And Henri (who died some time ago) gave me introductions to some mairies (you know, city halls) outside of Paris. I went to one and they had just redecorated the city hall, the salle des f\u00eates, and with roses, which was in bad taste. The French have no taste at all, you know. So then I went to another mairie, which was in Ivry which is totally a wreck. You know Paris at the time was encircled by what they called Ceinture Rouge (Red Belt). They were all socialists, or anarchists, and so on. Everything was there. So at Ivry I was received by the mayor. I told him who I was and what I had in mind. He said, \"you'll have to come back because I have to consult my colleagues here, I'm not the only one, I have assistant advisors.\" He had everything in his assistants, anarchists, socialists. There were eight or nine people sitting around a green table and the mayor was there. I came with my sketches. And they babbled and babbled and babbled. They got so excited and carried away with legislation. And finally they just looked at each other and said, \"Why not?\" And then the mayor said to me, \"Monsieur, we can't pay you. I said, \"You don't have to pay me. You pay me per week the wages of a house painter as salary.\" For a year I painted frescoes. It was a huge salle des f\u00eates. I painted thirteen large frescoes. The normal size of a wall painting was the size of this wall, and there were thirteen. One big painting was twice as long, so it was a huge thing. I worked for a whole year. And the workers would come, and the mayor would come. The workers would sit down at lunch time and open their lunch boxes and their wine and chocolate and white bread. And argue with me, the hammer wasn't right; the man wasn't holding this and that right. The painting was all very realistic, figurative. Finally the day of the opening came. The frescoes were put up. The mayor came to me and said, \"You know, you'd better leave France.\" So I went to Berlin.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What happened to the murals though?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, you see, he had to cover up one mural- no, two murals. One mural he covered up as unfinished; the linen was torn, and the other mural was a big satire on the bourgeois society. Mr. Keop, the police president who was to open the show, was portrayed there. The Premier of the time was in the mural. And there were some others. Madame de Noailles, the poetess, was in the mural, and then some sociologists and some art historians.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But they were all real people?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, real people, real portraits. I worked hard on them. And in the background there were workers reading Carl Marx and Dreyfus and all that crap. So then I left Paris in 1939 because I smelled the who thing coming. At that time there was nowhere to go except Scandinavia. Luckily I chose Sweden, not Norway.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Are those murals still there do you think?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, you see, in 1946 before leaving Sweden for America with my then wife, a South African lady whom I married in Stockholm, I made a farewell trip around Europe to say goodbye. We took the North Express which goes via Copenhagen to Paris and to Belgium. It was a fantastic trip. And everywhere I went I had special literati friends. They all were jumping on me; \"my God, you are bombing the flag, you are leaving, you are going to these savages you will see.\" I'd say, \"what in hell have you done? Where were you when you were needed?\" And I have them what for, you see...What happened was that among others, T. S. Elliot, who became my very dear friend during the war, came to Stockholm- I had invited him- I had very good connections so they brought him over in a stratosphere just to give a lecture. By that time I had published books and magazines in Sweden.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. You started two magazines there, didn't you?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, I was a publisher, too, for a while.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you get into that?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It was so boring there. I had to have something to do not to die of boredom.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kind of support could one get?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: When I got thee, there were some people with money. Of course it all went out the window. Bankruptcy, you know. I was the first one to introduce American Literature to Scandinavia.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Will you believe that? Henry Miller was one of them.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What did they think of him in those days?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: They refused to publish him so I sold it to Copenhagen. I introduced Ben Hecht; I published myself, and Stapelton, an English writer, and so on. But they would put the books under the shelves and never would show them because they said there is a combine there. There are three big publishing houses. So my books were just not put out for sale.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh yes. You can't break through.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Ben Hecht sort of repaid certain losses. I myself wrote two books. One about Forty Years of Film, and one on the History of the First World War. There are 380 or so photographs in it, or something like that. It was a big thing, I worked a whole year on it. It was actually a picture book with short political text to hang it together, about how the war happened, about the social democrats and the Communist Front, because I was in between you see.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. So there you were again stirring things up. That's incredible. I'm trying to get a little more of the atmosphere of what was going on and the things you were doing.\n\n\n\nADJUA YUNKERS: Well, at that time I always painted. When I came to I Sweden I was rather dejected. I didn't speak Swedish. But after a short while they didn't know that I wasn't a Swede. In fact, I speak eight or nine languages.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You pick them up very easily?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Easily, yes. I speak perfect Swedish and German and so on. So I came to Sweden and suddenly I remembered that some time ago from Paris I had sent to an art Syndicalist group, a publisher, some woodcuts. One of the packages contained the Ten Commandments. And Humanite had printed some of them. The eleventh of course was, you know... And the signature was a robot, a robot. I had never heard from them. So suddenly I remembered this. And I went up there and I was received like a long lost son. They embraced me, kissed me, dined and wined me, and gave me money. So I went out and rented an empty apartment, four or five rooms with a kitchen. I got some wood and a saw and a hammer and nails and made my furniture. And that's how I started.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: The whole eclarte group, you know. It was a very interesting time. I really stirred things up, you know.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kind of reaction was there amongst the people to all this activity you were engaged in?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, they were curious, but they didn't really accept. You see, of there is artistically speaking a chauvinism prevalent on America, which there is, it is most pronounced in Sweden. So I had some difficulties. Even being close friends of practically all the poets, and most of the writers were very good friends of mine, some of them are now in the academy and all that. Members go on crutches, you know.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Very, very important people.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. This was a very good thing for me. You see, on the other hand it's always dark in Sweden. Jokingly I used to say it's seven months winter and five months cold. You know, you get up with electric light and go to bed with electric light and so on. It's always dark. And summer is six weeks or something like that. And bang! It's gone. Everyone bundles himself up. And during the six weeks of summer everything is wild, real wild. The chart of children goes up, you know, conceptions go up and boom stops. The first of September nothing. But it's a marvelous country, I love it, I love Sweden, I mean as nature. And Stockholm again is another one of those Venices; wherever you go, it's water. A beautiful city. I was there this summer to lay some ghosts which were still wandering around. But the ghosts were on holiday so I didn't meet them. I don't think I will ever go back again. It really was a sad experience.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yeas. I won't go to Europe at all anymore. I'm through with it.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMINGS: Oh, really? It's finished?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. It's a sad thing. Why should I go to Europe? There's nothing- no affinities anymore. Except sentimentality. You see, when I went there it was literally like A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. And I would touch houses, I would climb upstairs and look at a doorway where I used to live and all this sort of thing. It was really a sentimental journey. Sad. You see, it's worse then ever.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. Well, sometimes one has to do that though.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. Then I went to Paris and before I joined Dore and the kinds in the south of France I was alone in Paris for about eight days. Of course it was raining. It rained for eight days. And with my hands in my pockets I was wandering through the streets in the rain. Everything has declined somehow. There's not even a cuisine left in France, it's lost. If you want to eat good French food you've got to pay through the nose, fourteen dollars for lunch. It's incredible. I mean fourteen dollars for two people, the cheapest lunch in a good place which I found.... That's what I did for eight days. I was eating and drinking food wines. I went around. The cheapest lunch I ever had was twelve dollars.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic. I haven't been there in years and I rally find no inclination to go.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's so sad because I remember in the 1920's we'd sit in the cafes, in, for instance, the Rotonde, or wherever, all night long with a cup of coffee, and would never be bothered.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No more.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Whew! No, I found to my disgust that all the bad things of America have been taken over because it's profitable. It's not in them; they don't know how; they just take the mechanics of it, and it becomes sort of sloppy, wishy-washy. The only city I might go back to is London. I still like London Very much.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You have made prints for a long time, haven't you?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's what I started to tell you about in Sweden. Suddenly I gave up painting.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Is that where you started the printmaking?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. I happened to be on the seashore somewhere walking around. I found a piece of wood. This is literally true. I looked at this piece of wood, I held it in the palm of my hand, and I found it sort of mysterious. So I took it home and dried it- it was wet- I dried it and covered it with oil paint, on color and put in on paper. And that did it. From then on.... actually I created the whole damn thing in Sweden.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Thursday afternoon for the ladies.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That was pretty bad, you know. So I came with huge things. That made a revolution, you know. That's what sustained me actually, the prints. I sold everything I made, everything. That's how it started. And that how I got to be known in America, through my prints. Most of the museums already had my prints before I came here, so actually, I never had to struggle in America. I came and everything was ready. It was very nice. Three months before I left... Oh! By the way, I must state that it was the New School that brought me over to America.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did that come about?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That came about in a very funny way. You see, I had made up my mind to leave Europe, and it was a logical conclusion. I didn't believe in Europe anymore. Somebody was here with my prints. This somebody\u2014this happened during the war actually\u2014was later drowned by a German submarine; the ship sunk. He showed my prints at the New School. The had a little show. So they sent me some references. I wrote back that I had made up my mind to leave Europe and come to America. So they sent me a contract which gave me the opportunity of getting a visa within twelve hours. You see, according to the immigration office it doesn't matter what passport you have; it's the place where you were born; that's what counts. Then you are in that quota, otherwise I would have had to wait for 165 years. It was a semi-diplomatic visa., so that's how I got here with the help of the New School. It was a help. Also you see there was a point in history in 1939 when I came, the Russo-Finnish War was going on, which didn't exactly make my life comfortable. So my only windows when the war started for America in 1941 were the English Legation and the American Legation. So I would go every day to the English Legation for tea, and then for cocktails to the American Legation. I would get cigarettes and magazines and books in both places. In fact, through the American Legation- I knew the First Secretary and the Second Secretary very well both socially and otherwise and they got books for me from America. Everybody was so starved for literature and papers, so I just passed the books around among my friends and they all read them. For instance, I translated lots of Mayakovsy simply sitting like this with you with the poet, I would recite a poem in Russian and then translate it into Swedish. Then he would read it to me and there would be certain words I would have to explain to him. Then he would find another word that would cover it. Then we'd make a clean typed copy. I did a lot of things like that.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's marvelous. You've always known lots of poets?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. I was very lucky.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you know a lot of them here still?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes, I know quite a number of poets. Kunitz,Wilbur and Lowell. Although for the past few years, three, four, five years, I'm leading a rather withdrawn life socially. I don't see many people. I seldom go to exhibits and openings except when friends are having an opening. Not always even then.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What did you teach at the New School?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKER: Painting. And then graphics, woodcuts.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Was this your first experience teaching?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, no. I had taught to a certain extent in Sweden during the war. There was a sort of free academy. Well, there's a story connected with that: To get that visa, I had to point out how many hours... you see, you cannot get into the country even if you have an engagement; you still have to prove that you have the proper qualifications according to the immigration officials. When I arrived at Baltimore, I wasn't allowed to disembark. They took me to the immigration offices and grilled me for three hours, because two hours were missing, to make it legal. I refused to accede that I maybe had made a mistake and forgotten the two hours. I was so mad Then they said, \"What is this New School? What's that?\" \"The New School for Social Research, is it Communist? It doesn't exist.\" I said, \"Look, you most have some book somewhere all the institutions in America are listed.\" So one of the Italian- Americans disappeared and came back and said, \"Yes, there it is.\" \"Is it communist?\" For three hours.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. Because of these two hours missing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: And they called up the New School. So then I left. They gave me a permit for fourteen days; I could go wherever I wanted but whenever I left New York I had to notify the immigration office in New York. It was in Brooklyn. And in fourteen days I had to send them a brief on \"why I want to be in America.\" But yet I had this engagement. It was absurd. It so happened that I thought of Lessing Rosenwald, the big collector of prints and first editions who had purchased practically everything I had made. I didn't know him. But I telephoned him and we made a date. I went to Philadelphia and saw him. He telephoned someone: \"there's a young man here who's in trouble.\" I saw that man, you know, the same day. I explained the case. He said, \"Don't worry. I'll let you know when to come back.\" So later on I got a letter from him to be in Philadelphia, which is the central immigration office, to see the boss. There I was waiting to see this young man of 35 or 40 who came in with a hop and a rush: \"What seems to be the matter Mr. Yunkers?\" I said, \"Well, you've got in there in front of you, sir.\" Ten days later I got my passport with a stamp on it. Now I was so mad. I was thinking about hose people who don't have these connections who go straight to Ellis Island and rot away there all that time. That was twenty-two years ago. I said, \"Jesus, I've come from the fat into the fire.\"\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. Most Americans don't even know these things exist.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMIGS: Well, they do if they look around.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes, but it's disagreeable I want to say.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You went out to the University of New Mexico?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: yes. Well, you see, my then wife suffered from all sorts of sinus trouble and Asthma and so on. The New York weather was very bad for her. The number of times I had to carry her to the doctor in the middle of the night! And she was dying, so I said, \"this is hell.\" After holding classes here for two months I got very tires and I told her \"I'm leaving, I'm going to New Mexico.\" So I just flew out there with an Englishman...La Farge was there in Santa Fe and parties and parties and parties. Then I came back and said, \"Look, that's the only place. It's like the veldt; It's like South Africa. That's where you belong.\" I knew a painter by the name of Johnson (who is now dead). I wrote him a letter telling him that I would like to come back to New Mexico but \"I can't afford it.\" Eight days letter I got a contract for a summer job in the West. So we went out there. I bought land and started building an adobe house, with a huge living room thirty feet long. All alone, mind you, except for the roof. I had students help me to get things up. I built the whole damn house alone.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's marvelous. How did you like living there?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I love New Mexico. I know about forty states, you know. New Mexico to me was a revelation. My whole life changed.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In what way?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Colors and everything. The whole conception of my life. I had long monologues with the desert. But then I found out that you can't argue with the desert. So I had to come back to New York. Finally due to this leaving New Mexico and staying here in the winter to make some money, our marriage sort of collapsed.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What did you teach out there- printmaking?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No. Painting. I was the man who firs organized the graphics art department. They didn't have one. I brought everything with me. They wanted me to do that, so I did it. I did many things like that, you see. Now I'm going through the same thing with painting at Barnard. I swore I would never teach again after I finished Columbia last spring. But suddenly I fell into a trap again at Barnard College. They have nothing. You see, I have to organize the whole damn thing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You're going to set up a printmaking department?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, a painting department.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: A painting department- oh, really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. They don't have anything yet. Nothing. It's amazing. Miss Barr, you know Barr's daughter, was teaching there. But it's like a Sunday finishing school. So now they want to do something.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic. That's incredible. Speaking of the University of New Mexico and then Cooper Union where you were for a long time---\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, that I did a long time after. I taught at Cooper Union for eight years. In between times I would leave Cooper Union and travel and come back. I've taught all over the place, all over the map, mostly summer school. I didn't know where to go in the summers so I would get a job in Hawaii or Colorado at Boulder, you know.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So you had fun and traveled and worked?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's right.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Have you ever kept track of any of your students?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. I don't have to keep track. They keep track of me. I constantly get letters fro even twenty years back. They're now grown up men with beards and children and several marriages, you know. They write to me about all their things. I have a good relationship with my students mostly. I get lots of letters, nice letters.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's terrific. You've had lots of exhibitions in this country.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, God, yes. Also in Europe. And then suddenly I don't know what happened I just got sort of really depressed by this whole thing and I just cut out everything. I lost all my contacts with Europe and here. This is really true. And for six years nobody knew what I was doing. I was with Emmerich before. And then after six years I had my first show at Rose Fried; that's about a year and a half ago. It was very successful. That's it. Then she went off her rocker, you know the story. In fact now I don't look for any gallery. I'm sick and tired of being married to galleries. So unless somebody comes and makes a good proposition\u2014\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In 1961 you got a grant to Tamarind.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yes. I was the second one at Tamarind after she started.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you like that?\n\n\n\nASJA YUNKERS: I loved it. I had three master printers at my beck and call. I made many, many experiments there which had never been done before in lithography.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS : Oh, really! What kind of things?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, it's very complicated to explain. It would take an hour. For instance, I used material- paint which cannot be used in lithography because it does contain any fat. Like poster color. I would use this poster color and through the poster color filter color and get grays, you know, filter the ink through and get grays that are absolutely impossible to mix or create. The only difficulty was to hold it up in an edition, the same gray so that it wouldn't disappear or get black. There was this one printer, a Czechoslovakian- Horreq was his name- who had started doing this as a boy; he had grown up with it and he was really fantastic. We would start working at six o'clock in the morning and work until twelve or one o'clock at night. We did this for six weeks.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's very exciting.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It was a glorious time. I had a nice apartment, which I didn't use, I just slept there. There was a stove there and a kitchen and a bathroom and all that. In the evenings I would go to the supermarket to shop. It was within walking distance of the Tamarind. I would just smack my steak on the stove. Then I'd go to bed. At six in the morning I'd be walking down the street to the Tamarind. And there he'd be already working.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: She has terrific printers out there I guess.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. They're all over the place now. New York had several from Tamarind. Just recently I met one in Tampa who got his degree at the Tamarind. I got a commission to make reprints for the Feigen Gallery. \"Would you like to go to Tampa?\" he asked. I said, \"what for?\" \"To make three prints\" he said, \"or as many as you can.\" I said, \"When?\" He said, \"Tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Zoom!\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Off I went. I haven't seen them yet, I expect they'll come any day this week for signing. You see you get an idea how fast these things are.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Transportation and everything now makes so much difference, doesn't it?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, God, yes. Also, the decisions you know, from one day to another. A very charming story was about the American federation of art. They had a program- I don't know if they still have- they had institutions all over the country to invite artists to come there for jobs. So someone called me up- I forget his name now- and said, \"Would you like to have a job?\" I said, \"Yes. When? Where?\" He said, \"Well, it's around here somewhere.\" I said, \"No. I will only take a job where there's sunshine and water. The sun must shine.\" So for two years I didn't hear from him. Suddenly a man from Honolulu pops up here at the American Federation of Arts, and there I was off to Honolulu.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you like it out there?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It was all right.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's very lush I understand.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's too lush. It's like a greengrocer. The sky and the rocks and the sea are fantastic, overwhelming. And there I was, really spoiled. They went out of their way to make it pleasant and comfortable and lush. A big tropical house. They offered me a car when I was there. They bought three paintings, and so on and so forth.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you think it's difficult for a creative person to live in that kind of climate?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. I can't imagine... of course I met most of the painters there because it was part of the program. I had to criticize them once every week, thirty or forty people popping up. And I had to lecture and all that sort of thing. And I saw what happens.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What is it I wonder?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's laziness. It's nature itself. You know when you go to South America- we were in Brazil recently and we saw what happens there. You just can't work.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I wonder what it is?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's a certain feeling.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. They'd rather sit down.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. That's right. By the time you have breakfast it's already afternoon.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. It's like Florida it a way, too.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, I can't stand Florida. But really tropical places, you know, that is the undoing... that's how the English lost the Empire. They stopped shaving. They got careless, you know.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That will do it. You did a great series of pastels.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. You see, one of my characteristics is that I hate to plagiarize myself. When I can't do things, when I've sort of absorbed the material and seen what I can do with it; in other words, when I've squeezed everything out of it and then there comes a point when I can do those things in my sleep; from that moment on I just lose any interest whatsoever.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's been accomplished.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's been accomplished and gone. I still get reproached today that I don't make pastels anymore. It's a sort of scandal. I can show you letters from curators and people because the word went through the city that I had just stopped, that I had abandoned the pastels. I haven't made ay pastels since. I made pastels for three years, large ones. They're all gone. I have one large pastel. I said, Dore, look, you'd better chose one and keep it.\"\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What got you interested in doing pastels?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It was an accident. One day the Borgenicht Gallery asked me if they could have a small work. I just looked around and AI saw a few pastel sticks lying around that I used to sketch with but never made a pastel. I thought, well, she wants a little thing so I'm going to make a little thing. So I made a little thing. And it was fascinating what I could do with it. I sent it to her gallery. It lasted on hour; it was gone. So then I developed a technique which nobody, nobody\u2014Degas in that sense is a Sunday painter in comparison\u2014not only in size but in technique. You know, he would draw the musing strokes. Well, I would use three or four sticks in the palm of my hand and use them like oil color technique.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMMINGS: I see.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: And layer on layer, you see. I would fix them in layers on the transparencies. I recently went to Cleveland and saw in a collector's house two of my large pastels. I was flabbergasted. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Who made them? To me this is strange now. I wouldn't know how to do it anymore. I was so carried away, so drunk with it, I was just like a fountain. Then suddenly at a certain point I got so sick and tired of this lushness and all this color, and it coincided with the death of Expressionism somehow on an emotional level. Although I didn't think of it, this lushness made me really seasick. Suddenly I had this longing for herring, black bread, you know, for rigid discipline. And I just gave it up. That was when I left Emmerich. And it was six years. The result is these white paintings. So I abandoned woodcuts, I abandoned graphics. Recently I took them up again. But I don't make them anymore. I make woodcuts but they make silk screens. I don't make them myself. I make collaged and then I just supervise the printing of lithographs and so on. Lithographs, of course, I have to do; I set the stones, you know, at least the plates. But I don't do the printing, the physical labor.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I was reading in something you have written that you said that living in Rome at one point was very important to you.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But you didn't say what it was or how it became important.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, the important thing was the experience I had in Ostia Antica, which is the original, the first Roman harbor that Romans built which was built by seamen and merchants. They had everything there, the senate, the theatres, an entire city, and it lasted fifty years or something like that. Suddenly one morning they awakened and the sea had receded a hundred miles, just receded. And it was a ghost town, they abandoned it. Now still today there are inlaid symbols the size of this carpet where they had their stalls, in the fishermen's there were little fishes, in the shoemaker's there were shoes. Beautiful things that you walk on, and it's absolutely empty. One day I went out there, there is never a soul t here. I went out there with Dore, and Dore somehow wondered off, so I was alone. And all the time I had the feeling that I was being observed, that someone was practically looking over my left shoulder. You know what I'm talking about? So I sat down in one of the fisherman's bars. There were a few frescoes left. I sat down and started drinking. That was it. I cane to such a conclusion. So then I left. Now Rome specifically did things to me on a different level. Ostia Antica was a significant experience. I made my last woodcuts in Rome. I sis a whole series on Ostia Antica. Once day I made a woodcut and it was Ostia Antica. I didn't know it. From then on everything I did related to Ostia Antica, I couldn't get away from it. Then I made thirty large woodcuts. They're all gone, I have one left of the series. So I was through with it. I haven't made any woodcuts since, I just abandoned it. But speaking of Rome, the fountains, the ochre colored walls. Do you know Rome?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: The walls are ochre colored. The sensuality of the city. The ease of their way of living, the whole atmosphere.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Very appealing?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: More than that. If you can see or listen it does things to you. And that actually was the germ for my pastels; which I didn't know at the time. It happened many years later. You see, this always happens to me wherever I go. You know, there's nothing like the eye. I don't sketch, my eyes are my sketchbook. It sinks in and one day I will sit down and the subconscious pops up and there it is. Things start happening.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: you don't make drawings, do you?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Very seldom. Lately for the past couple of years instead of drawings I have been making collages. Dozens of them from, say, one idea; sometimes three, sometimes ten, sometimes more until it hits me. Then that's it. I destroy the rest and just keep that one. Which I then translate into a painting without copying; just translate\u2014\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: The image.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: That's right, yes. And prints. I make prints the same way. You see, this is a collage. It became a print, an embossed lithograph, and it became a large printing 72 inches by 62 inches wide, which is now in the Los Angeles County Museum.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's very interesting, you seem to have themes that go through the work.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: yes. That's another thing because somebody said to me some time ago, \"you've been through so many evolutions you know there is another word for transformations- mutations.\" I said that if you put me in a computer there would be about two billion permutations coming out.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's true.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Wherever you live how can you help absorbing what is around you. So without losing myself I always was sort of under the spell of a specific situation \u2013 climates; you know, I mean emotional, moral, ethical, physical climates. Do that is always the important thing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I'm just curious, we've mentioned poets a number of times. Do you read a great deal?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I read.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kinds of things do you read?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, for the past couple of years I read pornography. I'm pretty well- read. I used to read serious things.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You are interested in politics and things?\u2014\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Very much so. That's the overwhelming interest. I think everything is literature now. I'm concerned with certain realities. Very much so. For instance, we had an evening here where Octavio Passo was reading his poems. There were a number of invited guests who paid ten bucks. We collected quite a lot of money that way. Those who couldn't come sent checks to Dore. It all went to Mexico for the imprisoned students there, that's why we did it. And so it goes. Last year I gave away twenty- four pieces of my work. Every day I get letters, every day. Most artists get them.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. There's always another cause.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. It's give, give, give. It's one of the outstanding things. It reminds me of these Uncle Sam posters during the first world war- \"Where were you?\" I say, \"Look, where were you?\"\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I was there. Do you think there's been any one person along the development of your career that's been a great influence.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS; No. Honestly, I cannot say that there had been. I would like to be able to say that. Except for Malevich and certain poets. Yes, Reiner Maria Ulke, a poet whom I met in Germany; and others. You see, actually they were keys to new experiences; but not actually impressing me, you know, sort of leaving their mark on me. Here nobody. So as a result, you see, when I said that I'm back to where I was before conceptionally is that I'm the one person who is totally non-eclectic. Everything I do is very personal; it comes from nowhere; I don't know where it comes from. It takes a lifetime to be able to formulate our concentration or experiences, you know, to put them down in one denominator. And with that of course the peripheral phenomena that go with it you see.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I read in one place that you had a fire in your studio at one point?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. Before I came to America. I had a fire three months before I left. Everything burned. Ten years of life. A I said, I came to America with nothing except for the few prints that Kleemann had at the Museum. That's all. I had nothing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS:That must have been terrible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I had two fires actually. One in Berlin and one in Stockholm. I'm pursued by fires. So I've evolved this mania. I smell tobacco or fire or ashes miles away. In my studio I have water; but not here. I will go out of the house and walk for several blocks and I'll have to come back to see if the cigarette is extinguished. After that experience,, you know, I didn't feel anything. I didn't feel anything. A year later here I would awaken in a cold sweat screaming. My bed was burned. My wife saved me. That was a fantastic experience.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Incredible.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, I could show you the article in the newspapers. It was six in the morning. It said, \"Fire, Artist's Studio Burns Down.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's horrendous.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Then several years later- we were very poor- Dore and I lived in a room about this size and we had to wash our dishes in the bathtub, you know. And I made huge prints, huge prints, around fifty. There was one woodcut fourteen feet long, it was politics, five large panels, a large center panel.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kind of wood did you use?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Pine. I had to carpenter glue them together. One woodcut is as big as this painting, you know, only square, where this is oblong. There were thirty-six colors in it. And I did it on\u2014you know in doctor's offices they have little white tables that they keep the instruments on? That's the kind of table I worked on. And I used this huge paper; I got it from Boston in rolls. And when there were two or three prints, I had to jump over, I had to stack them on the walls and all sorts of things. And then when the edition was printed and the ceiling fell down on the prints. I was in med with Dore. It was three o'clock in the morning. The prints were lying at the end of the bed sort of stack up, stretched out nice and neat ready for a show. I was supposed to have a show. These huge chunks of plaster fell on them. You can see some of them in the Philadelphia Museum. Zigrosser picked some up. So then I was left after a whole year's work with nothing. So I had to start all over again. Simply for that reason there is no edition there- there are three or four editions I couldn't bring myself to do. My first reaction was to jump out the window. I had had it. But I didn't. I went on working.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: When did you meet Dore?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: She was a student of mine at the New School.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. By accident. Because she was in Kuniyoshi's class and one day suddenly he disappeared and left them flat. So the Dean asked me to take over Kuniyoshi's class. And there was Dore. And she hated me because I spent most of the time drinking beer.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Are there any special things you'd like to talk about or get into here?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, not exactly. But speaking about my work, I think it's trivial really. I don't like to do it. It's become so literary and so forced unless in a discussion, then things come out. I just can't stand it, you know. It embarrasses me. That's actually all. One thing I must say though- people often ask me that. I remember when I came over here somebody was writing a biography about me and asked me, \"What is your history?\" I said, \"I don't have any history. It just started here. Which is literally true. That's it. This country has been very good to me, very good. I've done lots of things which one disagrees with, or are uncomfortable, or disturbing; especially now, you know. In the beginning the only thing that disturbed me was the chauvinism among my colleagues. It was very pronounced.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You mean at places like the New School?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, no. Painters. I'll never forget something I overheard.- I don't want to mention the name, it isn't relevant. I had a show and I happened to be passing by and this individual was standing there with Al Reinhardt and some other people. I overheard him say, \"Isn't it fantastic to have a European among us?\" It took me about ten years.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you ever get involved with The Club?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Oh, yeas, I used to visit them. But, you see, look, to me that was like playing in sandboxes. I just gave it up. It was a bore, an endless bore. I understand perfectly well why these things had to happen. It's good that it happened, that it was there. But not for me. I didn't need it, you see, because I had my identity. In the 1940s and 1950s they were looking for identity.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, you're very right. They had no support whatsoever.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No. So that was good. But I mean to me they wee speaking about things and attitudes that were common to me, that I experienced already when I was seventeen or twenty years old. I'll never forget when the club was on Eighth Street, a great sculptor was walking up and down the room with Motherwell and they were discussing the attitude to certain movements. This sculptor was walking back and forth with his hands behind his back in a professorial manner and he said, \" Now I must ask you what is your attitude to Matisse?\" What can you do, you know?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But that was their way of communicating.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I know, I know, I know. But to me it was infantile. For them the club was very healthful. Gradually I got to know them all. The best of them became my friends, and good friends. And that's the only communication I have here, these few people whom I can talk to. We don't even have to talk because we are on the same wavelength and there's no need for talking. Another thing that disturbed me was- well, these are kind of negligible things- their refusal to talk politics. First of all, they were frightened to touch politics, or any attitude. That was one thing that surprised me. Then the other thing was that whenever they were together the conversation was about their mistresses, their wives, their kinds, their taxes, their villas; you know, all this nonsense. Never about art.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's interesting. I've done-I don't know- dozens of these tapes now and so many of them said, \"You know, we'd all get together and we'd go to the Cedar Bar and we'd talk about art.\"\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: At the Cedar Bar, yes. But they didn't talk about art.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No. It was about politics.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: They'd talk about personal resentments and so no. But that is not talking about art, you know, sitting together and picking out an idea and analyzing and getting down to the bottom, as I was sued to doing in Europe.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I wonder why that hasn't really happened here.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It still hasn't. The only man you can talk to about these things to is Motherwell. He's interested in analytical and aesthetic points.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I wonder why that hasn't developed with Americans.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I don't know, but it has to do partly with the whole conception of society. Quite bluntly, lots of things are just covered up with ashes and can never come up because of materialism. And then there's another thing, specifically in New York, I can't speak for the rest of the country, but I can speak for New York. It has no memory.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes. Everyday it's a new--\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It's not only that. But memory means history. Right?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No memory. No possibility of having a tradition.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Lots of people seem to be afraid of having a memory.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: It isn't so much being afraid as that it is safer. It's safer not to have it. Because it may become very unpleasant, you know, if you nail something down then you have to have an attitude and you have to take a step that may be very uncomfortable. So it's better to let it go. Except for the younger painters now, the younger artists, there's a whole young generation. This to me is sheer delight.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What about them?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I mean I think this is a fantastic new America growing up. A real America.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Which people do you mean?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I mean the young generation. All these people, the rambunctious young people. The people who make noises. The people who are disturbing everything, doubting everything. It goes beyond the state of conception. Now this is the fascinating thing, the good thing. Whereas The Club and all that was a sort of a sly finding out about a possible combination between good life, materialism and aesthetics. You know, they never go together.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. They wanted a happy medium.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: They wanted to have the whole thing, to have the cake and eat it, too. But I say that being an artist is not a metier. I mean it's not a career in that sense. You don't make a career, you are; it's a way of life. And you pay I advance.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's like my friend who is in the music world says you have to pay your dues.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Yes. If you pay in advance you know. You see I was brought up in a world, in an art world where nothing could be of less importance than the material side of life. The only thing was we could do what we wanted to do was making out. And we all hungered. People here don't know what it means to be hungry. Real hunger. Not that it's desirable, but you see that only proves one thing: that it was a bloody serious thing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's true. Occasionally I see young students who come out of Pratt or Copper or places like that and they show you a painting and they say it's five thousand dollars. It's wild.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: I know. It's a sort of cold war status that we live in at present in the arts. It's a cold war. Somehow it has become so atrophied and also so exaggerated that each movement, Pop, and kinetics, and so on and so forth each one tries to prove exactly one thing only. And so you have these absolute strict divisions and there's professionalism among the good ones involved that is serious. But it is not serious in the sense of the end. It is a seriousness concerned only with the immediate results. By twenty-five these guys must be millionaires. Some of them are. You know it.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes. That's true,\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Then it becomes a little doubtful, this whole damn thing.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes, how true. You wonder if they are making art or automobiles.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: You see, this is one reason why I lost all interest, I mean personal interest in these things. Because it bore me. It bores the shit out of me. It's so trivial.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Okay.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Well, as I say, I'll send you that thing. And I'm going to correct and go through it to correct names and things like that. And if you have time maybe you can correct the grammar because my grammar isn't good, you see, because I never learned it. I just learned English by reading books and going to the movies.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you like movies?\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Very much so. So that's how I learned English.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Okay.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: Are you satisfied?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: All right?\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Unless there's something else you'd like to talk about.\n\n\n\nADJA YUNKERS: No, offhand I don't think of anything. We could sit here and one thing leads to another and it's endless.\n\n\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes, that's right. Okay.\n\nEND OF INTERVIEW\n\nLast updated...

Example Op Art Work Movement In Squares (1961).\n\nBy Bridget Riley, one of Britain's\n\nleading abstract painters.\n\nHow Op-Art Works Op art exploits the functional relationship between the eye's retina (the organ that \"sees\" patterns) and the brain (the organ that interprets patterns). Certain patterns cause confusion between these two organs, resulting in the perception of irrational optical effects. These effects fall into two basic categories: first, movement caused by certain specific black and white geometric patterns, such as those in Bridget Riley's earlier works, or Getulio Alviani's aluminium surfaces, which can confuse the eye even to the point of inducing physical dizziness. (Note: Op art's association with the effects of movement is why it is regarded as a division of Kinetic art.) Second, after-images which appear after viewing pictures with certain colours, or colour-combinations. The interaction of differing colours in the painting - simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, and reverse contrast - may cause additional retinal effects. For example, in Richard Anuszkiewicz's \"temple\" paintings, the arrangement of two highly contrasting colours makes it appears as if the architectural shape is encroaching on the viewer's space. Despite its strange, often nausea-inducing effects, Op-Art is perfectly in line with traditional canons of fine art. All traditional painting is based upon the \"illusion\" of depth and perspective: Op-Art merely broadens its inherently illusionary nature by interfering with the rules governing optical perception. History The origins of Op Art go back to pre-war painting theories, including the constructivist ideas of the 1920s Bauhaus design school in Germany, which stressed the importance of the overall formal design, in creating a specific visual effect. When the Bauhaus closed down in 1933, many of its lecturers (notably Josef Albers) moved to America and taught in Chicago and at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Josef Albers duly produced his famous \"Homage to the Square\" series of paintings which had Op-Art tendencies. Meantime, from the early 1930s, the Hungarian-born painter and graphic artist Victor Vasarely was experimenting with various visual tricks such as trompe-l'oeil and others, from certain types of poster art: see his Op-Art picture Zebras (1938). Later, he turned to painting, creating the geometric abstract pictures for which he is famous. During the 1950s, the Op-Art style also appeared in John McHale's black and white Dazzle panels at the \"This Is Tomorrow\" exhibition in 1956. Bridget Riley began to develop her distinctive style of black-and-white optical art around 1960. Modern interest in Op Art dates from \"The Responsive Eye\" exhibition, curated by William C. Seitz, which was held in 1965 at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). A wide range of works were exhibited including those by the well-known Victor Vasarely and the contemporary Bridget Riley. Immensely popular, the show highlighted the illusion of movement and the interaction of colour relationships, neither of which found great favour from the critics. Although the Op Art style became highly fashionable during the second half of the 1960s, it declined rapidly thereafter as a serious art form, despite periodic minor revivals. Notable exhibitions in recent times have included: \"L'oeil Moteur, art optique et cinetique 1960-1975 (Musee D'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Strasbourg, France, 2005); \"Op Art\" (Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, Germany, 2007); \"The Optical Edge\" (The Pratt Institute of Art, New York, 2007); \"Optic Nerve: Perceptual Art of the 1960s\" (Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, Ohio, 2007). Works by famous Op-artists can be seen in several of the best art museums in Europe and America. Famous Op Artists\n\n\n\nThe senior exponent, and pioneer of Op art effects even as early as the 1930s, is Victor Vasarely, Hungarian in origin, but working in France since 1930. He has taken a radically sceptical view of traditional ideas about art and artists: in the light of modern scientific advances and modern techniques, he claims that the value of art should lie not in the rarity of an individual work, but in the rarity and originality of its meaning - which should be reproducible. He began as a graphic artist; much of his work is in (easily reproducible) black and white, though he is capable of brilliant colour. His best work is expressed in geometric, even mechanistic terms, but integrated into a balance and counterpoint that is organic and intuitive. He claims that his work contains \"an architectural, abstract art form, a sort of universal folklore\". His mission is of \"a new city - geometrical, sunny and full of colours\", resplendent with an art \"kinetic, multi-dimensional and communal. Abstract, of course, and closer to the sciences\". Vasarely's work can sometimes dazzle the eye, but he does not aim to disturb the spectator's equilibrium. The effect of the work of British artist Bridget Riley can be to produce such vertigo that the eye has to look away. Though carefully programmed, her patterns are intuitive and not strictly derived from scientific or mathematical calculations, and their geometrical structure is often disguised by the illusory effects (as Vasarely's structure never is). Riley refuses to distinguish between the physiological and psychological responses of the eye. Peter Sedgley (born 1930), a Briton living mainly in Germany, became known about 1965 for his experiments with one of the recurrent images of late twentieth-century painting, the \"target\" of concentric rings of colour. The effect was intensified by changing lights of red, yellow and blue, electrically programmed. Later he developed \"videorotors\", stippled with brilliant fluorescent colour, rotating and still further animated by the play of ultraviolet and stroboscopic light upon them. His latest work has explored relationships between light and sound, with screens on which the noise and movement of spectators or passers-by are rejected in coloured light. Other artists associated with Op-Art include: Yaacov Agam, Josef Albers, Richard Allen, Getulio Alviani, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Tony DeLap, Gunter Fruhtrunk, Julio Le Parc, John McHale, Youri Messen-Jaschin, Reginald H. Neal, Bridget Riley, Jesus Rafael Soto, Julian Stanczak, G\u00fcnther Uecker, Ludwig Wilding, and Marian Zazeela."}, {"url": "https://art-facts.com/famous-op-art-artists/", "page_content": "Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSave\n\nOp art is short for \u201cOptical art,\u201d an art movement that was derived from a wide variety of other art movements. Many Op Artists were influenced by the world of Cubist artists, Dada artists, and even Post-Impressionist artists.\n\nThe main feature of this particular art movement is the use of optical illusions to create a sense of movement for the viewer. It\u2019s a form of abstract art that results in a variety of effects, including, for example, flashing, swelling, or even vibrating.\n\nThe name of the movement was coined in 1964 by Time Magazine following an exhibition by Polish-American artist Julian Stanczak (1928-2017). This was called \u201cOptical Paintings at the Martha Jackson Gallery.\u201d\n\nThe movement itself can be traced back to the 1950s with an exhibition at the Denise Ren\u00e9 gallery in Paris called \u201cLe Mouvement.\u201d Multiple abstract works featuring optical illusions, often produced in black and white for maximum effect, were displayed here.\n\nSo who are the most famous Op art artists? In this article, you\u2019ll find out!\n\n1. Victor Vasarely\n\nVictor Vasarely (1906-1997) is considered to be the founding father of the Op art movement. He was born Gy\u0151z\u0151 V\u00e1s\u00e1rhelyi in 1906 in P\u00e9cs, a city that was then part of Austria-Hungary.\n\nThe Hungarian artist eventually moved to Paris in the year 1930 after abandoning a career in medicine to focus on his art. He first worked as a graphic artist before developing his own style, producing numerous works of art featuring optical illusions.\n\nThe first exhibition that can be called an Op art event was called \u201cLe Mouvement\u201d in 1955 and featured his \u201cYellow Manifesto.\u201d The first-ever true Op art artwork that can be truly defined as such was called \u201cLe Zebra.\u201d This pioneering work was created by him in 1937.\n\nVictor Vasarely / Wiki Commons\n\n2. Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto\n\nJes\u00fas Rafael Soto (1923-2005) can be described as both one of the most prolific and most renowned Op art artists in history. He was born in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar in Venezuela and started by creating posters for local cinemas in his hometown during his teenage years.\n\nAfter receiving a scholarship to study art in 1942, he continued to pursue his dream and eventually settled in Paris during the 1950s. He became one of the pioneers of Op art after starting in Post-Impressionism and Cubism.\n\nToday, his works are on public display in the largest modern art museums in the world, including Tate (London), Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), Galleria Nazionale d\u2019Arte Moderna (Roma), and MoMA (New York City). He also has a museum dedicated to his works in his hometown of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar.\n\nJes\u00fas Rafael Soto / Wiki Commons\n\n3. Bridget Riley\n\nBridget Riley (Born in 1931) is an English painter who has developed her unique style of Op art paintings. She created pointillist-style works for advertising agencies in the late 1950s but moved away from this in 1960.\n\nHer main inspiration during this period was Post-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat (1859-1891). Especially a work called \u201cBridge at Courbevoie\u201d (1886-1887), a work she copied in 1959 and which still hangs in her studio, which had a great impact on her throughout her career.\n\nToday, some of her most impressive works are huge murals that decorate various art museums in the world, including the Tate and the National Gallery in London and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne in Paris. She lives and works in London, Cornwall, and the Vaucluse in the southeast of France.\n\nBridget Riley / Wiki Commons\n\n4. Richard Anuszkiewicz\n\nRichard Anuszkiewicz (1930-2020) was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, in a family of Polish immigrants.

Social media, adverts, television, our phones \u2013 these technological devices have developed our visual literacy skills, meaning we are now capable of swift image comprehension.\n\nHowever, the playful Op Artists still challenge us. Their optical illusions, proving troublesome to comprehend, instil within us the desire to solve the dizzying puzzle their work presents. For their hallucinatory, disorientating and thought-provoking works, those who shaped (or were inspired by) the Op Art movement deserve recognition.\n\nMovement in Squares 1961 Bridget Riley (b.1931) Arts Council Collection, Southbank Centre Arts Council Collection, Southbank Centre\n\nOp Art, meaning 'Optical Art', gathered momentum as a movement in the 1960s. An explosion of bright, psychedelic colour, geometry and stimulating pattern, Op Art offers abstract compositions that engage the viewer by creating the impression of movement, whether this is through flashing, vibrating or swelling illusions.\n\nLeading figures in the movement include Bridget Riley, Victor Vasarely and Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto. However, their experiments with colour and geometry have inspired the work of many other artists. Here's an exploration of the work of these key figures, and a look at those who were inspired by similar principles and techniques.\n\nBridget Riley\n\nBridget Riley (b.1931), arguably the most well-known Op Artist, was truly experimental, exploring the way in which she viewed the world through her work.\n\nBridget Riley 1963 Ida Kar (1908\u20131974) National Portrait Gallery, London National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nFall offers the viewer a true optical illusion \u2013 the longer we look at the piece, the more distorted our vision becomes. Cascading illustrative lines ripple down the piece, in a curving and swirling dance of black emulsion.\n\nFall 1963 Bridget Riley (b.1931) Tate Tate\n\nIn the late 1960s, Riley began to experiment with colour. Having previously found comfort in the strict binaries between black and white, she was cautious with colour, something she felt offered less stability. However, she eventually embraced this instability, creating the illusion of movement through an exploration of form, space and colour.\n\nCataract 3 1967 Bridget Riley (b.1931) British Council Collection British Council Collection\n\nVictor Vasarely\n\nHungarian-French artist Victor Vasarely (1908\u20131997) is considered a paternal figure in the history of Op Art. He originally began studying Medicine at university but abandoned this in 1927 in order to learn the techniques of traditional academic painting. In 1928 he enrolled in a private art school to concentrate on applied art and typographical design.\n\nAbstract Victor Vasarely (1908\u20131997) Harlow Art Trust Harlow Art Trust\n\nInterested in graphic design, and the ways in which art could communicate messages, Vasarely started to experiment with abstraction, reducing his work to simple textures and patterns.\n\nIaca 1955\u20131957 Victor Vasarely (1908\u20131997) The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery, University of Leeds The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery, University of Leeds\n\nIaca incorporates opposing circular shapes with horizontal and vertical lines, creating the impression that these shapes are patiently rotating, as if hung from the ceiling on a mobile and spinning in a cross-breeze. His piece makes use of visual kinetics, the study which relies on the viewer perceiving a piece as if it were moving.\n\nJim Lambie\n\nCurling layers of spray-painted chrome encroach on a central panel of polished stainless steel.

By using oil on linen as a medium, Diacrosse contrasts material fluidity with the strict geometry of folds and gathers, formulating a diamond and star in a sea of pink.\n\nJes\u00fas Rafael Soto\n\nThe practice of Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto (1923\u20132005), the Venezuelan-born French artist, is characterised by illusion. Fascinated with the idea of sensory vibrations, he developed his work from small-scale paintings to larger installations, which the audience could pass through and interact with.\n\nPortrait of Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto, Milano\n\nBlurring the boundary between artwork and audience, Soto's viewers are no longer passively watching but are each potential collaborators. His work, therefore, surpassed Op Art, formulating a new, participatory style of such art, which did not just figuratively draw the viewer in and encourage them to question what they were experiencing, but physically permitted them to enter the space of the work and manipulate the illusionary setting themselves.\n\nDouble Progression in Green and White\n\nAngela Bulloch\n\nAngela Bulloch (b.1966) is best known for her fluorescent light sculptures, such as Aluminium 4, which explore the digital identity of the pixel. However, Canadian-born Bulloch also fabricated a sculptural series which adopted the illusionary tendencies of the Op Artists.\n\nPacific Rim Around & Sideways Up\n\nExploring pattern and perspective in three dimensions, her Heavy Metal Stack series is composed of powder-coated steel structures which reach over six feet in height. Commanding the viewer's attention, the sculptures seemingly occupy both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional simultaneously. This juxtaposition makes Bulloch's sculptures incredibly intriguing.\n\nDamien Hirst\n\nContemporary British artist Damien Hirst (b.1965) is famed for his provocative works, which often explore life and death. He grew up in Leeds and completed his studies in Fine Art at Goldsmiths in London.\n\nApotryptophanae (3 inch spot) 1994 Damien Hirst (b.1965) British Council Collection British Council Collection\n\nIn Apotryptophanae, a rainbow of coloured dots spans an expansive white canvas, leaving the eye desperately searching for meaning in the pattern. Known as one of Hirst's 'Pharmaceutical Paintings', the work is composed of a measured grid of multi-coloured circles. These colours were selected for their reference to medical colour codes, revealing a connection with Hirst's fascination with death and illness.\n\nWithin graphic design, images are constructed from thousands of dots closely printed next to one another, and the mind automatically 'solves' the puzzle by formulating an image from these. An impossible task in this case, however, as these circles are in fact simply and colourfully random.\n\nIt is possible to experience the distorting and playful effects of Op Art yourself at Tate Liverpool's 'Op Art in Focus' exhibition. Open until 17th January 2021, this group show features the work of Riley, Vasarely and Lambie, among others. In an explosion of pattern, you'll be greeted by rainbows of colour, vibrating and oscillating across the space. The highlight is perhaps Lambie's disorientating installation, which tricks the eye into believing the floor is melting, swirling and bending beneath your feet.\n\nMolly Evans, freelance writer"}]}
