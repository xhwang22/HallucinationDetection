{"Nate Saint attended Wheaton College in Illinois.": [{"url": "https://wheaton-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AWA/pages/3827794252/Nate+Saint", "page_content": "Nate Saint was born August 30, 1923, the son of Lawrence and Katherine Saint and the 7th of 8 children (7 boys and 1 girl). Lawrence was an accomplished artist, a designer of stained glass. He directed and oversaw the stained glass work at the Washington Cathedral. He was well known for his work. Katherine was a Wellesley graduate, the daughter of an inventor and manufacturer. The two had met at a gospel mission which they volunteered at.\n\nNate grew up in a home that was unstructured, except for the sabbath. Meals were eaten on shifts and the children were often free to do as they wished. The family exhibited a free-spirited adventurousness. They were ingenious and willing to try new things. Katherine ran the household with little direction or input from Lawrence. When the children wanted to sleep outside in the warmer weather, so she had a carpenter come and build bunk beds on the roof of the back porch. One brother commented later how you weren't livin' if you hadn't been woken up by the start of ran on an early summer morning.\n\nOne of Nate's childhood prayers was that God would \"show us theright way.\" Nate was quite creative, obviously a family trait. He was a \"born\" writer and also played the organ. As a child, probably imitating his grandfather, Nate would make schematic drawings of airplanes and automobiles with unique features and distinctive qualities.\n\nIn 1936, when Nate was 13 he made his public profession of faith. He had attended Percy Crawford's Pinebrook camp in the Pocono Mountains. Later that year he would gave a talk to a youth meeting that attested to his strong, developing faith. His faith was so strong that he eventually chose church attendance over his certain ability to make the basketball team, when a conflict arose.\n\nWhen Nate was 18, he took his first flying lesson and by that time he was employed by the Flying Dutchman Air Service. His brother Sam was at that time an American Airlines pilot. Sam helped Nate get an apprenticeship at La Guardia Airport as a mechanic for American.\n\nNate's work for the airlines gave him a draft deferment. However, when he was nineteen he renounced his draft-free status to list himself as \"1-A, without appeal.\" This made his entrance into the war a certainty. His employers and family saw it as a bad decision, but Nate saw it as an opportunity. He hoped to receive $25,000 worth of free flight training, compliments of Uncle Sam. Upon his physical, Nate was given a qualified acceptance into the Army after doctors learned of an earlier leg injury. Nate's service experience influenced him greatly and was a formative period for him.\n\nAfter the war in the Spring of 1946, Nate couldn't begin school, originally looking to go to Westmont. He had been encouraged to do some missions work as a pilot in Peru with Wycliffe and Christian Airmans Missionary Fellowship, the early name for Missionary Aviation Fellowship. However, he wanted to get some schooling in first. But an emergency request came from CAMF of a crashed plane in Mexico, \"Could Nate help?\" So, Nate went and over numerous weeks repaired the plane for service.\n\nAfter the important experience in Mexico, Nate finally got to school. He had decided to enroll at Wheaton College and began his studies in January 1947. He would only stay for a year. While a student he worked with Sunday Schools among children on Chicago's South Side.Nate continued to do work for MAF as a student, which soon brought his true desires and responsibilities to the fore. MAF was in desperate need of a pilot and mechanic. Nate was their man.\n\nNate and Marj were married on Valentine's Day, 1948. After a honeymoon and some church visits on deputation, the Saints were in Ecuador. Helping establish a mission airbase in Shell Mera, Ecuador took much of Nate's time and energy, but work progressed well. Near the end of 1948 tragedy struck as the plane Nate was piloting crashed from a violent wind gust. Critically wounded, Saint recovered fully to resume his duties. His experiences caused great concern and effort at improving safety conditions on MAF aircraft.\n\nSaint died January 8, 1956 in the jungles of Ecuador as he attempted to share the Gospel of Christ with the Waodani people."}, {"url": "https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/march/wheaton-college-missionary-plaque-jim-elliot-waorani.html", "page_content": "The college plans to update the inscription to \u201creflect the full dignity\u201d of the Waorani tribe.\n\n|\n\nImage: Courtesy of Wheaton College\n\nEdman Chapel\n\nMore than 65 years after two of its alumni were killed in what became the most famous example of missionary martyrdom in the 20th century, Wheaton College wants to tell a better story to honor their work.\n\nWheaton president Philip Ryken announced this week that a plaque honoring alumni Jim Elliot and Ed McCully along with Nate Saint, Roger Youderian, and Pete Fleming has been taken down from the campus chapel while a task force meets to suggest new phrasing to remove the word \u201csavage.\u201d\n\nElliot and McCully graduated from Wheaton in 1949. The five men were killed in January 1956 after making peaceful contact with the isolated and hostile indigenous group in Ecuador. The following year, their classmates donated the plaque, which includes relief images of Elliot and McCully.\n\nIn describing the tribe, then called \u201cAucas\u201d (\u201csavage\u201d in the lowland Quichua language), the plaque reads, \u201cFor generations all strangers were killed by these savage indians.\u201d Contemporary accounts of the mission now refer to the tribe by the name they call themselves, Waorani.\n\nIn his emailed statement, Ryken said the term \u201csavage\u201d is a pejorative term that \u201chas been used historically to dehumanize and mistreat indigenous peoples around the world. Any descriptions on our campus of people or people groups should reflect the full dignity of human beings made in the image of God.\u201d\n\nRyken and other members of Wheaton leadership have received about a dozen comments about the plaque this school year from students and members of the campus community, said Joseph Moore, Wheaton\u2019s director of marketing communications. He said the president released the statement because the plaque has been temporarily removed, and leadership wanted the campus community to \u201cknow about its review, rewording, and return.\u201d\n\nThe change comes at a time when Gen Z Christians are rethinking the church\u2019s historical approach to international missions. Last year, a Barna study found that 38 percent of adults under 35 agreed with the statement, \u201cin the past, missions work has been unethical,\u201d compared with 23 percent of older adults.\n\nThe rewording of the Wheaton plaque also reflects how the narrative around the Ecuador missionaries has evolved. Elisabeth Elliot\u2019s Through Gates of Splendor\u2014written in just eight weeks and submitted right before the first anniversary of her husband\u2019s death\u2014became the \u201cgo-to evangelical account\u201d of what happened, said Lucy S. R. Austen, author of a forthcoming biography of Elisabeth Elliot.\n\nIn subsequent writings, though, Elisabeth sought to dispel the idea of the Waorani as wild savages and Americans as the great saviors, particularly in her third book The Savage My Kinsman. She continued to minister and live among the tribe for years after the killings.\n\n\u201cBut in evangelical America we have tended to keep right on telling and retelling the same little sliver of time, in the same streamlined version of events, with the same triumphal gloss that Elliot laid down in 1956, and the same almost exclusive focus on the five men themselves,\u201d Austen said.\n\nShe hopes as Americans revisit the story of the slain missionaries, they will re-examine their attitudes toward it and what we focus on when we remember and retell such accounts.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that white Americans tended to have a faulty understanding of non-Western cultures when the plaque was given, and that now that we know better, changing the plaque would be a great chance to do better,\u201d said Austen.\n\nIn recent years, several evangelical institutions have taken the opportunity to \u201cdo better\u201d in the ways they remember their missionary past.\n\nIn 2016, Whitman College, named in memory of slain missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, dropped the mascot \u201cFighting Missionaries.\u201d The Whitmans wanted to bring the gospel to the tribes living in the Oregon Valley, but their good intentions were mired by their sense of cultural superiority.\n\nMembers of the Cayuse tribe killed the Whitmans in November 1847, more than 11 years after the Whitmans first arrived and in the midst of a measles outbreak brought by white settlers that killed far more natives than white people.\n\n\u201cI do not think a mascot \u2026 should precipitate the difficult conversations around challenging ideas. A mascot is meant to be something around which supporters of a college, and particularly athletic teams, rally,\u201d Whitman College president Kathleen Murray said at the time.\n\nAnd the Haystack Monument, a marker on the Williams College campus commemorating five students who hid in a haystack during a violent storm and dedicated their lives to foreign missions, has received extra scrutiny in recent years, though it remains in its place on campus.\n\nWheaton has grappled with missionary violence in the past, too. For its first 73 years, the school\u2019s mascot was the Crusaders, a name it dropped in 2000. In announcing the change, then-president Duane Liftin said, \u201cI came to realize that those [Crusades] were not very happy episodes in Christianity. They are not something we want to glorify.\" The school is now known as the Wheaton Thunder.\n\nCross-cultural missionaries have always had to navigate the complexities of their role. Even in previous generations, Christians see examples of how leaders did so with cultural sensitivity and humility, said Lloyd Kim, coordinator for Mission to the World. He points to 19th century missionary Hudson Taylor\u2014who dressed in Chinese clothing, grew out his hair like Chinese men, and required the missionaries with his China Inland Mission to do the same\u2014as an example of humility in evangelism.\n\nAs international missions becomes more culturally diverse, one of the most significant changes is that mission agencies are letting national partners lead. Western missionaries, instead, come in as guests. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to dispel the attitude that says, \u2018We are the heroes coming to save you.\u2019 We are coming in as learners,\u201d Kim said."}, {"url": "https://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/exhibits/Ecuador1956/02.2%20Saint%20.htm", "page_content": "Name: Nathanael Saint.

They forget that they too are expending their lives \u2026 and when the bubble has burst, they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\u201d \u2013 Nate Saint\n\nHis Early Life and Times\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923 near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The seventh of eight children, he was raised in a devout Christian home.\n\nLike many young men in the first half of the 20th century, he was fascinated with airplanes. In 1930, at the age of seven, one of his older brothers gave him a ride on a plane. Three years and some thrilling flights later, his brother let him take the controls on a flight. From that time on, he was fascinated, not only with airplanes; he became fascinated with flying.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 19, Nate enlisted in the U.S. Army where he expected to become a pilot during World War II. Unfortunately, due to a lingering infection, the Army would not allow him to fly. Nate turned that into an opportunity to become an aviation mechanic. He learned valuable lessons in that position that he would use later.\n\nHis Unexpected Life in Aviation\n\nFollowing Nate\u2019s three years in the military, he obtained a commercial pilot\u2019s license and enrolled at Wheaton College. During that time, his father made him aware of the newly established Christian Airmen\u2019s Missionary Fellowship (CAMF) which eventually became the Mission Aviation Fellowship.\n\nThe MAF began transporting missionaries into hard-to-reach places in the jungles of Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. While at Wheaton, Nate committed his life to serving the Lord as a missionary and missions pilot. He so with the understanding that the work would be dangerous. In one year alone, 51 people died in missionary plane crashes in the jungle. In 1948, Nate and his wife traveled to Ecuador to open an MAF base at Shell Mara.\n\nHis Eventful Life in Ecuador\n\nMissions work in Ecuador did not start well for the avid missionary pilot. In December of his first year, the plane he was piloting crashed after a powerful downforce of wind drove it into the ground. Nate suffered a broken back and other injuries that kept him in a body cast for six months.\n\nThe bulk of Nate\u2019s work was transporting missionaries to villages that would otherwise have taken many days to reach traveling on foot. Once they were in place, he delivered food and supplies for their sustenance and work. Often supplies included medicines and medical equipment they would use to treat illnesses in the tribes to which they ministered.\n\nNate solved one of the early problems in jungle missionary aviation while serving the Lord in Ecuador. Pilots would drop supplies in predetermined locations, but some supplies were destroyed when the hit the ground, and more ended up in the treetops of the jungle canopy. Nate devised a method of safely and efficiently lowering supplies using a bucket and a rope while circling overhead. Not only were the supplies delivered, but the missionaries were able to send messages and other items up to the plane using the device.\n\nNate described his life in Ecuador this way:\n\n\u201cIt is our task to lift these missionaries up off those rigorous, life-consuming, and morale-breaking jungle trails\u2014lift them up to where five minutes in a plane equals twenty-four hours on foot. The reason for all this is not a matter of bringing comfort to the missionaries. They don\u2019t go to the steaming, tropical jungles looking for comfort in the first place. It\u2019s a matter of gaining precious time, of redeeming days and weeks, months and even years that can be spent in giving the Word of Life to primitive people.\u201d[1]\n\nHis Eventual Loss in Ecuador\n\nNate and four other missionaries had developed a burden to reach the Aucas, a reclusive tribe of native Indians known to kill others found in their territory. The Ecuadorian government had been considering sending troops in to subdue the natives.\n\nNonetheless, Nate, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youdarian began an effort to break through to the tribe. They started by making flights over the village, dropping gifts from pots and pans to trinkets. Having received what they considered a warm response, they determined that it was time to meet the Aucas in person.\n\nOn January 8, 1956, the five landed the plane on a strip of side alongside a river near the village. They were to make scheduled radio calls to their families back at the airfield compound, but no transmissions were ever made. The Aucas had massacred Nate and the others and left their bodies in the river and along the beach.\n\nThe story made major headlines, including an entire photo spread in Life magazine.\n\nHis Eternal Legacy\n\nJesus said that \u201ceven the gates of Hell shall not prevail\u201d against the Kingdom of God and His Church. Indeed, the spears of the Aucas could not. Instead of retreating in fear and defeat, the effort to reach the Aucas continued, including the personal ministry of Nate\u2019s son Steve and sister Ruth and Jim Elliot\u2019s wife Elisabeth, each of whom eventually lived with and ministered to the Aucas.\n\nTheir continued work has created an eternal legacy as many of the Aucas natives have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior over the years, including six of the men who participated in the raid and killed Nate and his fellow missionaries.\n\nThe Indians told their families that they were puzzled at why the men did not fight but willingly gave up their lives. Their amazement opened the door for the women to tell them that the men were there to tell them about Jesus Christ who \u201cfreely allowed his own death\u201d to ransom them from sin and its inevitable price.\n\nRachel Saint spent the rest of her natural life with Wycliffe Bible Translators among the Aucas and is buried in Ecuador.\n\nKimo, the pastor of the tribe, requested the honor of baptizing Steve and Kathy, Nate\u2019s children, to demonstrate their reconciliation through Christ. The pastor had been a member of the killing party.\n\nGikita, the leader of the attack, died a believer at the age of 80. He said that he was \u201ceager to go to Heaven and live peacefully with the five men who came to tell them about Creator God.\u201d[2]\n\nAs Nate Saint said, \u201cWhen life\u2019s flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present to the Lord.\u201d\n\n[1] Jungle Pilot: The Life and Witness of Nate Saint, Russell T.

In a heartfelt act of remembrance, the Wheaton College Class of 1949 gave this plaque to the College in 1957 to honor their fallen classmates and their colleagues. In the 64 years since the College received this gift, we have continued to grow in our understanding of how to show God\u2019s love and respect to others.

With this in mind, the Senior Administrative Cabinet will appoint a task force to review the wording of the plaque and to make a specific recommendation by May 1 for its careful rewording and replacement, subject to a final decision by the Senior Administrative Cabinet, in consultation with the Board of Trustees. Members of the task force will include a faculty historian, a faculty missiologist, a representative from the Wheaton College Alumni Association Board of Directors, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student. The reworded plaque will carry forward the memory at Wheaton College of brave missionaries and their sacrificial witness, while at the same time respecting the Waodani people with whom they shared the gospel of the love of Christ. It will resume its place in the lobby of Edman Chapel sometime this summer.\n\nUPDATE: This article was updated to include comment from Jim Elliot\u2019s granddaughter, Valerie, and the Elisabeth Elliot Foundation.\n\nRelated: \u2018Can\u2019t Make It Up\u2019: Bill Hemmer Predicts Cancel Culture Coming For \u2018Bible Characters\u2019 Next"}, {"url": "https://illinoisfamily.org/education/wokeness-at-wheaton/", "page_content": "Wokeness at Wheaton College\n\nReading Time: 6 minutes\n\nThe esteemed evangelical Christian Wheaton College is really woking up. The administration has removed a plaque honoring Wheaton alumni and missionaries Jim Elliot and Ed McCully because it described as \u201csavage\u201d the indigenous Ecuadorian tribe that brutally and without cause speared Elliot, McCully, and three other missionaries to death in 1956. The plaque, which was donated 64 years ago by Wheaton classmates of Elliot and McCully, read:\n\nFor generations all strangers were killed by these savage Indians. After many days of patient preparation and devout prayer, the missionaries made the first friendly contact known to history with the Aucas.(\u201cAuca\u201d is the Quechua word for \u201csavage\u201d and was the name used at the time by indigenous people to refer to the Waorani tribe.)\n\nWheaton College president Philip Ryken, who appears to be either unable or unwilling to stem the efforts of Wheaton\u2019s \u201csocial justice\u201d faculty warriors to awoken Wheaton, said this about the decision:\n\nRecently, students, faculty, and staff have expressed concern about language on the plaque that is now recognized as offensive. \u2026The word \u201csavage\u201d is regarded as pejorative and has been used historically to dehumanize and mistreat Indigenous peoples around the world. \u2026 Any descriptions on our campus of people or people groups should reflect the full dignity of human beings made in the image of God.\u201d\n\nI guess no more calling people sinners with deceitful and desperately sick hearts on the Wheaton campus.\n\nWhen President Ryken defends Wheaton\u2019s decision by claiming the word \u201csavage\u201d is now considered a \u201cpejorative,\u201d he makes two errors. First, \u201csavage\u201d always was considered a pejorative. When in the history of the church, or America, or Ecuador did anyone consider the descriptor \u201csavage\u201d non-pejorative? It is not, however, an epithet like the \u201cn\u201d word.\n\nSecond, he errs by acquiescing to the woke mob who seek to dishonestly use Christianity as a weapon to silence all condemnation of sin. In so doing, he has inadvertently caved to relativism. Does President Ryken believe that Christians should refrain from using any and all terms that the world now views as \u201coffensive\u201d?\n\nAccording to Wheaton spokesman Joseph Moore, this decision was made following the griping of a mere \u201cdozen students and staff.\u201d It would be interesting to know which staff members agitated for this change. Parents who may be considering spending a boatload of money to send their children to the increasingly woke Wheaton and donors who oppose the woke movement might find such information helpful.\n\nThe word \u201csavage\u201d means \u201cnot civilized\u201d or \u201cferocious, violent, or brutal.\u201d The tribe called the Waorani or \u201cAuca\u201d that brutally killed Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Nate Saint, Roger Youderian, and Pete Fleming was at that time, indeed, savage.\n\nWhile the complicated story of what happened to the Waorani people since the savage murders of five missionaries is little known by many Christians who know the story of Jim Elliot and Nate Saint, the fact that the Waorani were a savage people in the 1950s and earlier is not disputed.\n\nRetired Wheaton College associate professor of history and PCUSA-ordained minister Kathryn T. Long has written a well-reviewed book about the complex history of the Waorani people since the murders of the five missionaries. She makes clear that they were a violent (i.e., savage) people. In a review of her book, Professor John G. Turner writes,\n\nMore than 60 percent of Wao deaths during this period were violent ones, [Long] estimates, making the Waorani one of the most violent cultures on earth.\n\nA 2008 paper co-authored by eight scholars including Long, describes the Waorani tribe:\n\nThe Waorani may have the highest rate of homicide of any society known to anthropology. \u2026 The Waorani (Huaorani, Waodani, Auca) of Ecuador, are known to be even more warlike than the Yanomamo. \u2026 Their reputation for ferocity was earned by violence against each other as well as outsiders.\n\nEven one of the Waorani who killed the missionaries acknowledges the former savagery of the tribe:\n\nWe lived angry, hating and killing, \u2018ononque\u2019 (for no reason) until they brought us God\u2019s markings. Now, those of us who walk God\u2019s trail live happily and in peace.\n\nThe now-cancelled Wheaton plaque was clearly referring to a moment in history when the Waorani were savage, which they inarguably were. But the woke, like all doctrinaire propagandists, insist on manipulating history to advance their ideology.\n\nThe Roys Report interviewed a current Wheaton student on the plaque controversy who expressed some peculiar unbiblical notions about how Christians may talk about sin:\n\n\u201cWheaton\u2019s doing a better job of trying to be mindful of the language that they\u2019re using and how it harms people, especially indigenous people. \u2026 I don\u2019t think reducing them to their violent tendencies is humanizing because they\u2019re still created in God\u2019s image. It\u2019s also holding them to a Christian standard when they\u2019re not Christians. They\u2019re still people and they\u2019re living life that is not the same as ours. Holding them to our standards wouldn\u2019t necessarily be fair.\u201d\n\nWhat would this student think of Jonathan Edwards referring to \u201cwicked unbelieving Israelites\u201d? Was he using language that harms people? Was he reducing them to their wicked tendencies and dehumanizing them?\n\nMay Christians call false prophets \u201cravenous wolves\u201d as Jesus did?\n\nShould Christians today abstain from criticizing the \u201ctrans\u201d-cult\u2014including \u201cdrag queens\u201d who read stories to and twerk in front of toddlers\u2014because they\u2019re not Christians and, therefore, we ought not hold them to \u201cour standards\u201d?\n\nAre standards regarding savage acts \u201cours,\u201d or are they absolute, objective, transcendent standards applicable to all?\n\nWhat about past slaveholders or contemporary neo-Nazis? If, when referring to their wicked beliefs and acts, Christians don\u2019t include a comprehensive list of their good qualities, are those believers guilty of dehumanizing reductionism?\n\nIn Revelation, those who are not saved are called \u201cdogs.\u201d Peter describes false teachers\u2014of which we have many in the church today\u2014as \u201cirrational animals \u2026 born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant. \u2026 They are blots and blemishes. \u2026 Accursed children!\u201d Paul calls the Galatians, \u201cfoolish Galatians.\u201d John the Baptist called the multitudes a \u201cbrood of vipers.\u201d Amos called women fat \u201ccows\u201d and warned that God would take them away by harpoons or fishhooks. Paul wrote this to Titus: \u201cAs one of their own prophets has said, \u2018Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.\u2019 This testimony is true.\u201d In other words, Paul called Cretans liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.\n\nWere John, Peter, Paul, Amos, and John the Baptist insufficiently mindful of their use of harmful dehumanizing language? Are they unfairly holding non-believers to \u201cour standards\u201d?\n\nPaul wrote,\n\nOr do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you.\n\nIn other words, he both held unbelievers to God\u2019s standards and described believers by their past sinful acts. They were sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, homosexuals, thieves, greedy, drunkards, and swindlers.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press,\n\nCurrent student Caitlyn Kasper praised the decision to remove the plaque. \u201cPlaques like that have caused pain to people and are almost a symbol of white superiority in their very presences and in how they make people of color feel unwelcome at Wheaton.\u201d\n\nDoes such a plaque cause pain to people? Do people untutored in the doctrine of wokeness espoused in public schools via Critical Race Theory feel pain when seeing this historically accurate plaque? Or is it just the indoctrinated who claim to feel faux-pain?\n\nIs there something intrinsically wrong about feeling pain when confronted by one\u2019s own sin or encountering testimonies of past sinful acts committed by humans?\n\nWas the plaque really \u201calmost\u201d a symbol of white superiority? And if this plaque was \u201calmost\u201d a symbol of white superiority, was it such a symbol or not?\n\nThose who have connections to Wheaton College know that this is merely another step in its ongoing Great Awokening. Wheaton has been churning out social justice warriors since at least Obama\u2019s presidential tenure. As the mother of two Wheaton graduates and mother-in-law of two, I say that with no pleasure.\n\nI first wrote about Wheaton\u2019s cultural capitulation in 2010 when the social justice manifesto of the Department of Education was discovered, a \u201cconceptual framework\u201d rife with the woke rhetoric polluting government schools everywhere today.\n\nThe comments from these two current Wheaton students point to the larger problems at Wheaton and raise important questions. How is it that Wheaton students are so biblically ignorant and so woke? Is Wheaton continuing in its abolitionist history of boldly confronting and opposing sin at any cost\u2014especially those serious sins that currently find favor among the well-heeled and powerful? If so, why do we hear so little coming out of Wheaton College from either the administration, faculty, or students about the grievous harm and injustice being done to children by the homosexuality community and \u201ctrans\u201d cult? Could it be that Wheaton is tutoring students in the ways of soft-peddling biblical views of sin while scratching itching ears?\n\nListen to this article read by Laurie:\n\nPlease support the work and ministry of IFI.\n\n\n\nYour tax-deductible donation is greatly appreciated!"}, {"url": "https://archives.wheaton.edu/repositories/4/resources/466", "page_content": "Philip James Elliot was born October 8, 1927, in Portland, OR, to Fred and Clara L. Elliot, one of three brothers in a family which included Robert, Herbert, and a sister, Jane. His father was an itinerant non-sectarian evangelist in the Puget Sound area and his mother conducted a chiropractic practice. Their home was frequently visited by missionaries who were an important influence on the family. By the time he was about eight years old, Jim was aware of his salvation by Christ.\n\n\n\nHe attended Benson Polytechnic High School, 1941-1945, majoring in architectural drawing and participating in sports with the goal of building his body for the rigors of missionary life. He also began preaching during these years. In his senior year, he was elected vice president of his class.\n\n\n\nJim chose to attend Wheaton College because of his brother Bob's recommendation; he enrolled in the fall of 1945 with the goal of total commitment to God and the active pursuit of the disciplines involved. He was granted a scholarship and worked part-time to support his studies. Elliot joined the wrestling team at Wheaton and made varsity in his freshman year. He began speaking to youth groups in the Wheaton area, and in his junior year began a journal as another means of spiritual discipline. In the summer of that year, 1947, he stayed six weeks in Mexico with the missionary family of his friend, Ron Harris. There he learned Spanish and felt his own call directed toward mission work in Latin America.\n\n\n\nIn 1948, Elliot and some of his friends narrowly escaped death in a car-train accident on the tracks in Wheaton. That year he was president of Foreign Mission Fellowship on campus and part of a gospel team for the Fellowship during the summer. Elliot chose Greek as his major, and graduated with highest honors in 1949. He lived with relatives in Glen Ellyn during his College years and attended Lombard Gospel Chapel.\n\n\n\nFor a year following graduation, Elliot returned to the family home in Portland to concentrate on Bible study. He worked at odd jobs and learned to preach on street corners, in jails, and at Plymouth Brethren assemblies. His future wife and former Wheaton College student, Elisabeth Howard, paid a visit to the Elliots on her return from summer missionary work in Canada. In June of 1950, Elliot spent several weeks in Norman, OK, at the Summer Institute of Linguistics, sponsored by Wycliffe Bible Translators. There he worked with a former missionary to the Quichua Indians of Ecuador and first heard of the remote and much-feared Waorani tribe in that country. [The name commonly used for the tribe at the time was \"Auca\" and this was the name by which they were called in almost all the literature of the time period.] His response was immediate and, after a ten-day period of prayer for guidance, Elliot wrote to Dr. Wilfred Tidmarsh in Ecuador offering to come to that field. A recently abandoned station, Shandia, established for work with the Quichua Indians, was in need of staff.\n\n\n\nElliot stayed on in Oklahoma City to work with Bible study groups on the university campus; he applied for a passport on Dr. Tidmarsh's urging to come as soon as possible. In September of 1950, Ed Mc Cully, another friend and Wheaton College student, wrote him indicating that he wanted to leave school and join a mission activity. The decision to go to Ecuador was postponed a year while Tidmarsh returned to England because they were unable to arrive in Ecuador before his necessary departure. During this period, Elliot preached, studied, and worked with youth in Huntington, IN, and Chester, IL, where Ed Mc Cully and Bill Cathers joined him in working on a radio broadcast series, The March of Truth. Pete Fleming of Seattle, WA, also indicated an interest in going to Ecuador with Elliot. A visit to Portland from Tidmarsh confirmed the decision to work in Shandia and passport, visa, and draft board arrangements were made. Elisabeth Howard had also decided to do mission work in Ecuador, but she and Jim went as independent missionaries to separate assignments.\n\n\n\nPreparations to leave for Ecuador occupied the second half of 1951; included was an itinerary through the East speaking to acquaint Plymouth Brethren there with the work and to raise support from those groups. Elliot and Fleming sailed to Ecuador on the Santa Juana on February 4, 1952, and Jim made his first journal entry on February 27 in Quito. Elisabeth Howard arrived in Quito in April, 1952, to study language, tropical diseases, and medical work.\n\n\n\nIn June, the first aerial search of the Oriente territory where the Shandia station and the Quichua and Waorani tribes were located was made from the Mission Aviation Fellowship station at Shell Mera. Waoranis had recently killed five persons in that area. Shell Mera had been abandoned by Shell Oil Company as too dangerous a location because of the Waoranis' hostility and the killing of Shell personnel. Elliot and Fleming moved to Shandia in September 1952.\n\n\n\nIn February 1953, both Elliot and Elisabeth Howard came into Quito from their separate stations and agreed to marry. A flood had destroyed part of the Shandia station and the need to rebuild confirmed their decision. They were married on October 8, 1953, Jim's 26th birthday, in a civil ceremony in Quito. Their first home was a tent set up at a river junction called Puyupungu. There they set up a school for a family of Indian children. A new location for the airstrip at Shandia was selected, and a home completed. Elliots' daughter, Valerie, was born February 27, 1955, and in that month the Flemings, Elliots, and Mc Cullys were together in Shandia for a conference for the Indians.\n\n\n\nWith the assistance of MAF pilot, Nathanael \"Nate\" Saint, Elliot and Mc Cully located the first Waorani huts in the jungle near Arajuno in September that year. The Waoranis had recently killed a mother and two children in this area. This sighting firmed determination of the men to attempt contact, and weekly \"drops\" of gifts to the Waoranis from the plane were begun in October. As plans developed, Roger Youderian, a missionary working in Jivaria, was asked to join the men. Pete Fleming was the fifth man of the group hoping to make contact with the tribe.\n\n\n\nUsing a battery-operated speaker, the men made thirteen trips over the area, broadcasting words of friendship in the Waorani language and dropping such gifts as buttons, a kettle, a machete, and tinted photographs of each man. The Waoranis responded by sending back a parrot and feathered head-dresses in the drop bucket. Encouraged by these responses, the men decided to find a suitable landing strip for the plane. They selected a sandy beach, which they named \"Palm Beach\", on the Curaray River and made a successful landing on January 2, 1956. After four trips to bring in a radio and other supplies, they built a tree shelter and began shouting Waorani phrases into the jungle. Four days later, two Waorani women and a young Waorani man came out of the jungle. They appeared friendly, and \"George\" was given a brief ride in the airplane. The following day was spent quietly and without contacts.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, January 8, after songs, prayers, and a service, the men radioed their wives at 12:30 p.m. that contacts were expected by mid-afternoon and they would radio again at 4:30 p.m. When there was no radio message at that hour, a search and rescue operation began. Flight over the area showed a damaged plane, and a ground search party left for the area. Planes and a helicopter from the Ecuadorian Air Force and the U. S. Army, Air Force, and Navy flew in for aerial search. The ground and air groups met on January 13 at Curaray Beach.\n\n\n\nJim Elliot's body was found downstream with three others. They had been killed by wooden lances and machetes, and the plane's fabric was ripped off and body damaged. Nate Saint's watch had stopped at 3:12 p.m. Because of the danger of another Waorani attack, the burial service lasted only three minutes. The Army party came out by canoe or helicopter over a two-day period, spending one day trekking through Waorani territory.\n\n\n\nThe deaths of the five men--Jim Elliot, Ed Mc Cully, Pete Fleming, Nate Saint, and Roger Youderian-were reported world-wide, and they were regarded by many as twentieth-century martyrs. Elisabeth Elliot returned to Shandia and resumed the work of her husband. She subsequently wrote three books about the mission work and its consequences: Through Gates of Splendor, a biography of her husband, Shadow of The Almighty, and The Savage My Kinsman. She also edited The Journals of Jim Elliot. Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint went to live with the Waorani group in 1959. One of the Waorani tribe members later explained to the missionaries that \"George\" had told them that the white men planned to eat them, and that they would not otherwise have killed the men."}, {"url": "https://pjmedia.com/culture/marktapscott/2021/03/23/woke-wheaton-college-to-reword-plaque-honor-missionaries-speared-to-death-in-ecuadorian-jungle-n1434366", "page_content": "Christian missionaries Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Nate Saint (a missionary pilot), Roger Youderian, and Pete Fleming were speared to death for no reason except that\u2019s what the Huaorani tribe \u2014 aka the \u201cAuca\u201d \u2014 in the Ecuadorian region of the Amazonian jungle had done for centuries to outsiders.\n\nThe missionaries had spent months cultivating an opening to the tribe that had no known prior contact with the outside world other than Spanish conquistadors and, more recently, sporadically with a few Shell Oil explorers, some of whom they also attacked.\n\nThe missionaries had exchanged gifts in face-to-face contacts with members of the Huaorani that were encouraging to the North American men who hoped to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the tribe.\n\nBut then, without warning, on Jan. 8, 1956, members of the tribe speared all five men to death and dumped their bodies into a nearby river. Four of the five bodies were subsequently recovered by a heavily armed military contingent.\n\nUltimately, Elizabeth Elliot and others continued the missionary work started by her husband and were rewarded with the conversion of many members of the tribe. She eventually wrote two books about the life and death of her husband. An award-winning movie \u2014 \u201cEnd of the Spear\u201d \u2014 was made in 2005 that focused on the mission through the eyes of Saint, the missionary pilot.\n\nAnd that brings us to Wheaton College, the once-esteemed evangelical campus in Illinois that includes among its most famous graduates, the great evangelist Billy Graham. Wheaton historically has been informally linked with the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC).\n\nWheaton\u2019s class of 1949, of which Elliot and McCully were members, gifted the school with a plaque in 1957 dedicated to the five martyred missionaries. On the plaque, which was for many years displayed in the college\u2019s chapel, were these words: \u201cFor generations, all strangers were killed by these savage Indians. After many days of patient preparation and devout prayer, the missionaries made the first friendly contact known to history with the Aucas.\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t find that plaque today because it recently fell victim to the false god of Woke-ism, the cancer of political correctness that puts the unforgiving demands of identity politics above a factual tribute to the missionary spirit and courage of five brave men.\n\nThe reason, according to a recent email from Wheaton College President Philip Ryken to the campus community, is the plaque\u2019s use of one word, \u201csavages,\u201d which allegedly rendered it \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because, Ryken claimed, that insidious word \u201cis regarded as pejorative and has been used to dehumanize and mistreat indigenous peoples around the world.\u201d Wheaton students and faculty members had complained about the plaque. As a result, the school\u2019s senior administrative cabinet will appoint a task force to review the plaque\u2019s wording and make a rephrasing recommendation by May 1.\n\nA more obedient expression of conformity to Woke orthodoxy than Ryken\u2019s will be hard to find these days. That it is uttered by the president of a college allegedly devoted to Christian education is a measure of how far the Woke cancer has penetrated the American evangelical community.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at Ryken\u2019s Woke claim a little deeper. The fact is members of the Auca speared the five men to death. No trial, no opportunity to talk things through. No rule of law under which conflict can be negotiated and settled.\n\nNow ask yourself, how is a murder in 1956 using a spear any different from one committed in the American West in 1875 by an outlaw using a six-gun? There is no trial, no opportunity to talk things out to a peaceful resolution, no rule of law under which conflict can be negotiated and settled.\n\nAs the theme song from an old Western put it, \u201cthe only law Liberty Valance understood was the point of a gun [spear].\u201d The reality is the word \u201csavages\u201d can be applied equally to the actions of the Auca who killed the missionaries and to the gun-slinger; both acted outside of law, outside of civilized society, savagely.\n\nSo the word has nothing to do with demeaning or dehumanizing anybody, except, as applied by Cancel Culture, the victims of savage, uncivilized violence, whether delivered with a spear or a \u201chog leg\u201d six-shooter.\n\nWoke-ism, sparked by Critical Race Theory that ascribes all sin to inherently evil Caucasians, who as a class enjoy \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d and use it to oppress \u201cpeople of color\u201d like the Huaorani, thus misappropriates the term \u201csavages\u201d to weaponize it against advocates of anti-savagery, aka \u201ccivilization.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to deny the Auca feared themselves to be threatened by the Ecuadorian military and representatives of Shell Oil, which wanted to explore the tribe\u2019s historical lands for the Black Gold.\n\nBut the five missionaries had nothing to do with either the Ecuadorian military or Shell Oil, except in the fevered minds of the Woke who stereotype all three groups under the damning rubric of \u201cOppressors.\u201d\n\nAnd once missionary work is dismissed as a tool of oppression, the church will cease entirely from sending out missionaries to fulfill Christ\u2019s command to take the Gospel to the whole world. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want to oppress anybody by sharing the Gospel with them!\n\nFor more on the amazing story of the five martyred missionaries, check out this video produced some years ago by Steve Saint, son of the murdered missionary pilot, especially as he explains how he could not merely forgive the man who speared his father, but even love him:\n\nMark Tapscott is an award-winning investigative journalist who covers Congress for The Epoch Times, and is founder and editor of HillFaith, an apologetics ministry sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with congressional aides on Capitol Hill."}, {"url": "https://archives.wheaton.edu/repositories/4/resources/55", "page_content": "[NOTE: In the Arrangment description, the notation \"folder 2-5\" means box 2, folder 5.]\n\n\n\nThe collection is arranged in chronological order, with documents relating to Hatch's early life at the beginning, and those pertaining to his death near the end. In the MAF file folders, the letters have been left in the order Hatch kept them. The folder titles for the entire collection, except for the Love Letters and Condolences series, were Hatch's.\n\n\n\nThe diaries (folders 1-4 and 1-5) cover his years of service in the U. S. Army Air Forces in Nebraska, California, and Arizona (1943-1945), as well as the first of his three years at Wheaton College (1945-1948). In them, he made brief notes of his daily activities, and noted important events, such as the day Japan surrendered, ending World War II, and the day he first met his future wife. While in the Army, he made comments on his Christian activities, and on the difference between his way of life as a Christian, and that of most of the other men he served with. During his first year at Wheaton College, he discussed his involvement with the Student Foreign Mission Fellowship and other campus activities, as well as his classes.\n\n\n\nBefore their marriage, Hatch and Penny (Doris G. Meeker Hatcher) wrote letters to each other while they were apart during Easter and summer vacations, 1946; Penny went home to Erie, Pennsylvania, for Easter and then spent the summer at an aunt's home in Toledo, Ohio, while Hatch stayed in Wheaton. These are in folders 1-7, 1-8, and 1-9, and in them they discussed their love for each other, the part-time jobs they both had, and the activities of mutual friends from Wheaton College.\n\n\n\nThe MAF Files (folders 2-1 through 2-8, and folders 3-1 and 3-2) document the Hatchers' first years with Mission Aviation Fellowship (1945-1953), which was first called Christian Airmen's Missionary Fellowship. The correspondence begins in 1945, while Hatch was still in the U. S. Army Air Forces, and continued on through his time at Wheaton College, their deputation and preparation for going to the mission field in Mexico, and the first few years of their service there, in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Wycliffe's Jungle Training Camp, and Ixtapa, Chiapas. The correspondence to and from MAF headquarters in the U.S. (with J. Grady Parrott, Charles Mellis, Jim Truxton, and Betty Greene) and with other missionaries on the field (including Jim Lomheim and Nate Saint, his friend from Wheaton College days, then serving with MAF in Ecuador before he was martyred there in 1956), reveals in great detail the early days of MAF procedures and policies; how the organization communicated its work to the Mexican government, to obtain permanent resident status for MAF workers, radio permits, and permission to fly and build airstrips in Mexico; as well as details about the care, maintenance, and choice of airplanes for use on the field. There is a great deal of discussion about flying Wycliffe Bible Translators to and from their Jungle Camp, where they received training for living in the field. Hatch also discussed the difficulties of itineration during the family's furloughs. Most of this correspondence is duplicated in Collection 136, the records of Mission Aviation Fellowship, but the arrangement here is more convenient, as the letters to and from E. W. Hatcher are often in the same folder, whereas in collection 136, the files are separated by author.\n\n\n\nThe MAF Files series also include Hatch's notebook (folder 2-1), containing notes he used for talks he gave about the work of MAF and for sermons (in both Spanish and English), notes on MAF staff meetings, financial records, and miscellanea; and a folder containing notes on missionary aviation stories (folder 2-2), probably used in deputation talks. These include newsletters from other missionaries in southern Mexico, including Mariana Slocum, Florence Gerdel, John Beekman, and Phil Baer. There are more missionary stories in a folder of Itineration Materials (folder 3-6), and in a folder of Scrapbook Materials (folder 3-7).\n\n\n\nThe collection also contains a folder of clippings (folder 3-5) telling of some of the opposition of the Roman Catholic Church to Protestant mission work in Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe folder of Mexican Papers (folder 3-4) contains legal papers, in Spanish, concerning the resident status of each member of the Hatcher family in Mexico.\n\n\n\nExcept during their furloughs and brief periods on the mission field when another teacher was available, the Hatcher children (Rodney Allan, Joy Lynn, Jonathan Louis, Arthur Meeker, David Nathaniel, and James Edward) were schooled at home until they were old enough for high school, when they were sent to the Ben Lippen School in Asheville, North Carolina. The childrens' school records from the various public schools they attended while in the U. S. on furlough are in folder 3-8. While they attended Ben Lippen, the children wrote to their family back in Mexico at least once a week, and those letters, along with their family's replies to them, are in folders 3-9 through 3-11, and folders 4-1 through 4-4. [In 2006, at her request, Joy Lynn's letters and school records were removed from the collection and returned to her.] The children reminisced about their childhood on the mission field and they wrote articulately of their life at Ben Lippen; then when Rod on to college, he wrote about life there too. Rod went to Wheaton College for one year, then transferred to Prairie Bible Institute in Alberta, Canada. In his letters to the children, Hatch discussed his activities in some detail, including the family's move from Ixtapa to Mexico City when responsibility for MAF work in Honduras was added to his duties as Mexico Field Director in 1966.\n\n\n\nThe final section of the papers deals with Hatch's death. There are hundreds of cards, telegrams, and letters of condolence in folders 4-5, 5-1 through 5-4, and 6-1 through 6-5. Fellow MAF pilots, missionary acquaintances from Mexico, Honduras, Ecuador, Venezuela, and other countries, and friends and relatives from all over the U. S. wrote to Penny and the children, expressing their own grief and offering comfort in the Hatchers' bereavement, often reminiscing about how they had come to know the Hatchers and about their work with them over the years. A number of the letters came from other widows, who shared their own experiences in coping with the loss of a husband. An audio tape of Hatch's memorial service in Calvary Church in Placentia, California, is also part of the collection. Those who spoke at the service talked about how they knew Hatch and they particularly discussed some of the struggles he had been going through with his work at MAF headquarters since returning from the field.\n\n\n\nAdditional material about E. W. Hatcher can be found in BGC Archives Collection 136, the records of Mission Aviation Fellowship (some of which is restricted), which will give more detail on his career up to 1971. The records of the Presbyterian Church, U. S., Mexico Mission, which are at the Historical Foundation of the Presbyterian and Reformed Churches, in Montreat, North Carolina (RG 1), include correspondence about negotiations for MAF to set up air service for the PCUS mission, in which Hatch was involved."}, {"url": "https://religionnews.com/2021/05/24/wheaton-college-rewords-plaque-calling-indigenous-people-in-mission-field-savage/", "page_content": "CHICAGO (RNS) \u2014 Wheaton College is rewording a plaque on its campus that referred to Indigenous people as \u201csavage Indians.\u201d\n\nThe plaque honors missionaries Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Nate Saint, RogerYouderian and Pete Fleming who were killed in 1956 while attempting to share their Christian faith with the Waorani people in Ecuador.\n\nRELATED: Missionaries gain access to Amazon\u2019s Indigenous peoples, despite pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was donated to the school in 1957 by Wheaton\u2019s class of 1949 in remembrance of their classmates, Elliot and McCully.

But on Jan. 8, 1956, they were killed by a group of Waorani warriors.\n\nThe original plaque, which is in the lobby of Wheaton\u2019s Edman Chapel, says of the Waorani, \u201cFor generations, all strangers were killed by these savage Indians.\u201d\n\nThat language is now seen as offensive by the school\u2019s students, faculty and staff, according to a previous statement by the college.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the word \u2018savage\u2019 is now recognized as being inherently pejorative and having been often used historically to dehumanize and mistreat native peoples around the world,\u201d it said.\n\nBut the school, located in a suburb west of Chicago, still wanted to carry on the memory of the missionaries and to \u201cuphold the reverential spirit\u201d in which former students had donated the plaque.\n\nThis spring, Wheaton\u2019s senior administrative cabinet appointed a task force to review the wording of the plaque and make specific recommendations for its rewording and replacement. The new wording was subject to a final decision by the cabinet, in consultation with the board of trustees.\n\nThe plaque will now read in part:\n\n\u201cGod called them to the rainforest of Ecuador and the Waorani, a people who had never heard the gospel message.

Missionary supply pilot Nate Saint whistled as he loaded his plane and helped the young boy and his mother aboard. Within minutes after his perfect take-off, however, Nate knew they were in trouble. A strong gust of wind roared over the mountains and slammed into his plane, forcing it downward. Nate did his best to control the plane, but it plunged, crashing into the field below.\n\nNate slowly awakened to the bright light and white walls of an Ecuadoran hospital. His passengers were not seriously hurt, but Nate had a broken back and badly sprained ankle. He would spend the next month in the hospital and five months after that in a body cast.\n\nCan you imagine wanting to fly again after that? The accident did not stop Nate. He could not wait to get back in his plane. He knew being a jungle pilot was dangerous: (fifty-one people died in jungle plane crashes within six months after his accident.) Even still, Nate was sure God had called him to do this work.\n\nSleeping on a Flat Roof\n\nNate Saint grew up near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a very curious child, much like his grandfather, who was a very successful inventor. As a result, Nate's mother felt it was important to let her children try out new ideas.\n\nOne day, Nate's older brothers asked their mother if they could sleep on the roof of their house. She agreed and had a carpenter build cots and a fence on the flat part of the roof. The Saints spent many nights sleeping under the open sky of their new rooftop bedroom.\n\nTen Year Old Pilot? Well, Almost...\n\nNate Saint was only seven years old in 1930, when his older brother, Sam, a pilot, took him on his first airplane ride. At ten, Sam even allowed Nate to help fly the plane on a short flight. And guess what? Nate decided that day that he wanted to be a pilot when he grew up, just like his big brother.\n\nA Horrible Infection\n\nWhen Nate was 14 years old, he became very ill. The doctor noticed a small, red cut on his leg from sledding the week before. The doctor said an infection had spread from the cut to the bone in Nate's leg. Because there was no cure for infections back then, the doctor prescribed plenty of rest and hoped Nate's body would be strong enough to fight off the infection. Otherwise, he could die.\n\nNate's leg ached so badly, he could not get out of bed for weeks. He spent a lot of time praying, reading his Bible and thinking of inventions. The infection eventually went away, but it would return later and change Nate's life.\n\nWings for Nate\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Nate Saint joined the Army. The world was at war, and he hoped to become a fighter pilot. But just one day before he was to begin pilot's training, he began to feel sick. He noticed that the old scar on his leg had turned red. The infection had come back after five years. Can you believe that? Nate couldn't.\n\nThe army told Nate he was no longer fit to be a fighter pilot. He was very sad, but he didn't stay sad long. Instead, he used his time learning to fix airplanes. He would look for another way to learn to fly.\n\nServing God from the Sky\n\nAfter leaving the armed forces, Nate got his commercial pilot's license, hoping to become an airline pilot like his brother Sam. However, one day a missionary called Nate and asked him to come to Mexico to fix a plane that had crashed in the jungle. Nate went, fixed the badly damaged plane and decided to become a missionary pilot instead.\n\nAs a missionary supply pilot, Nate spent a lot of time delivering food and medical supplies to missionary families. He also flew the missionaries to villages that would have taken them many days to walk to in the thick jungle. In addition, he invented several safety devices to help make jungle flights safer.\n\nNate often had to drop supplies out of the plane while he was flying over a village, because there was no place to land the plane. The goods would often get stuck in the treetops or end up broken on the ground. So Nate invented a way to lower supplies in a bucket attached to his plane by a rope. The bucket would hang completely still as Nate circled overhead, allowing the missionaries to remove their supplies.\n\nNate's Final Flight\n\nOne day while flying over the jungle, Nate noticed a village that he had not seen before. It belonged to a Stone Age Indian tribe known then as the Aucas (Ow-cuz), known now as the Waodani (Wah-oh-dah-nee). The Aucas had killed every outsider they'd found in their territory. Nate and four other missionaries began planning a way to tell the Aucas about Jesus.\n\nFor several months, Nate flew over the village, dropping gifts to the Aucas to show friendliness. After much prayer, he and the others decided to land on a beach near the Auca village. They built a tree house to sleep in until they could see if the Indians were friendly. The Aucas were not friendly, though. They attacked the missionaries, killing them all. U.S. Army officials later went to the beach, found the bodies of the five missionaries and quickly buried them. The Waodani have since become a friendly tribe. Many are now Christians.\n\nNate Saint may not have been fit to be a fighter pilot, but he was more than able to fly for God. Because of his death at the hands of the Auca Indians, many others have been inspired to give their lives to be used by God, too. His sister, Rachel Saint, lived with the Waodani for 40 years until she died in 1994. Nate's son, Steve Saint, became a pilot just like his dad. He and others continue the work among the Waodani today.\n\nMake It Real! Questions to make you dig a little deeper and think a little harder.\n\nAfter the Aucas killed the first five missionaries, how do you think the other missionaries had enough courage to go and live among the Aucas? Have you ever done anything for God that you were scared to do? What inventions do you think have been the most useful for helping to spread the Gospel around the world? Why? Why do you think the Aucas were so ferocious at first and refused the offer of friendship extended to them by the missionaries?\n\nSuggested reading:\n\nNate Saint: On a Wing and a Prayer by Janet & Geoff Benge (Christian Heroes Then and Now series, YWAM Pub.)The Fate of the Yellow Woodbee by Dave & Neta Jackson (Trailblazer Books, Bethany House)Jungle Pilot by Russell T.

He was accompanied by four others: Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, and Roger Youderain. All five were killed while attempting to evangelize the Huaorani people through efforts known as Operation Auca.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923. When he was seven he took his first plane ride with his brother Sam, who would eventually become a commercial pilot for American Airlines. While in the airplane he discovered a love of flying.\n\n\u200d\n\nHis family was somewhat unusual. His brothers made a sleeping patio on the roof of their home, and his dad built a roller coaster in the backyard.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen he joined the army he was stationed in Las Vegas NV, but was transferred to several other locations over the years. A leg injury from a sledding accident caused him some problems while he was in the army. About a year before he was discharged, he almost died while climbing a mountain in Yosemite National Park. After that incident he learned to live life to the fullest.[1]\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen Nate was asked by a friend to fix a plane somewhere in Mexico, he finally agreed. After he repaired the plane, he discovered a need for his skill in the field of mission-work and also a new awareness of the value of missions. After going to Wheaton College, Nate married Marjorie Farris (commonly called Marj) in 1948 and eventually moved to Shell Mera, Ecuador. Here, Nate built his family a house which would also serve as a guesthouse and a radio center with the other missionaries.[2]\n\nLife in Ecuador, Meeting the Huaroni\n\nIn September 1955, Nate was joined by his teammates, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Pete Fleming, and Roger Youderian. Saint finally found a Huaorani settlement while searching by air. To reach the tribe, Saint and the team lowered gifts to the Huaorani in a bucket tied to the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani were widely feared by other Ecuadorians, because they combined a desire to be left alone with a willingness to use force. They attacked and killed any intruders without provocation. Nevertheless, the tribe was excited on receiving the gifts and gave some gifts back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the missionaries decided to try to meet the Huaorani on the ground; and, on January 3, 1956, using the beach as a landing strip, they set up camp four miles from the Huaorani settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Nate Saint Died\n\nTheir initial contact was encouraging; however, on Sunday, January 8, 1956, the entire team was killed on the beach (known as \"Palm Beach\") when armed Huaorani met and speared them.[3] Nate Saint was the first of the five missionaries to be speared to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaint and the other four men became famous worldwide as a result. Life magazine published a 10-page photo essay on the story, which was also covered in Reader's Digest and many other publications. Today, a small school for missionary children in Shell, Ecuador, bears Nate Saint's name. After 51 years, the school has closed in 2017 due to falling enrollment.\n\n\n\n\n\nRachel Saint, Nate's sister, continued the mission efforts to the Huaorani, which eventually came to fruition.

Rachel Saint lived with the Huaroni two years after he died. She served as a missionary to Peru before later joining Nate in Ecuador. Nate had six brothers and one sister. Nate\u2019s father, Lawrence Saint, was a famous stain-glass artist, who worked on the Washington National Cathedral. His father was also a painter, specializing in landscape painting and silhouette cutting. As a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nSources\n\nThis information is provided under the Wikipedia Creative Common License."}, {"url": "https://answersingenesis.org/kids/bible/world-missions/nate-saint/", "page_content": "by Avery Foley\n\non September 12, 2017\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923 to a Christian family dedicated to serving the Lord and living for him. Nate was a curious boy who loved airplanes and wanted to be a pilot, like his older brother. When he was 19 Nate signed up for the US Army to serve in World War II and learn to fly airplanes. But when a previous infection in his leg flared up, he was not allowed to fly. However, in his three years in the Army, he did learn a lot about airplanes and how to fix them.\n\nAfter he left the Army, a missionary asked Nate to come to Mexico to fix a badly damaged airplane. Nate went and decided to serve Christ by being a missionary pilot. He married his girlfriend, Marjorie, and headed for the South American country of Ecuador to open a new Missionary Aviation Fellowship station. Nate\u2019s job was to fly missionaries into remote jungle villages and bring them supplies. This was a very dangerous job. But when a crash left Nate with a broken back and badly sprained ankle, he recovered and got right back to flying.\n\nThe supplies that Nate dropped off would often get caught in trees or broken as they fell from the airplane. So Nate invented a bucket drop system. By flying in tight circles a bucket containing supplies could be lowered from the airplane and the bucket would remain still so the missionaries could easily unload it. He also invented a dual injection engine to make flying safer. His inventions are still being used today.\n\nNate and four of his friends had a burden to reach a remote people group called the Aucas. These people were very dangerous, known for killing anyone who dared come into their territory. Using Nate\u2019s bucket system, the missionaries spent three months sending gifts to the Aucas in an expression of friendliness. The Aucas started sending gifts back. The missionaries decided to land the plane on a sand bar and make contact with the Aucas. This would be Nate\u2019s last flight. He and his friends were all killed by the Aucas\u2019 spears.\n\nNate died serving the Lord and taking the gospel where it had never been taken before. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Nate\u2019s sister, Rachel, along with Elisabeth Elliot, whose husband had also been killed by the Aucas, went back to the Aucas and shared the gospel with them. Because of the love they showed the tribal people, many believed in Jesus and were saved\u2014including some of the very people who had killed Nate and his friends.\n\nThis is the reconstructed frame of Nate Saint's plane used in missionary work in Ecuador. It is currently on display at Mission Aviation Fellowship headquarters.\n\nNate\u2019s son, Steve, joined his Aunt Rachel each summer in the jungle among the tribe that killed his dad. But because he understands the love and grace of God, Steve is friends with the very men who killed his dad and who are now his brothers in Christ. Steve and his sister were even baptized by several Auca believers in the river beside the place where their father died. Steve still lives among these people.\n\nNate\u2019s death was not a waste. God used his and his friends\u2019 deaths to help the gospel grow among the Aucas\u2014the people they loved.\n\nFun Facts about Nate Saint\n\nNate had six brothers and one sister.\n\nNate\u2019s grandfather was a successful inventor, just like Nate.\n\nAs a kid, Nate built an 8-foot sailboat and took apart a car engine just to put it back together again.\n\nLearn More"}, {"url": "https://missionsbox.org/missionary-bio/nate-saint/", "page_content": "\u201cPeople who do not know the Lord ask why in the world we waste our lives as missionaries. They forget that they too are expending their lives \u2026 and when the bubble has burst, they will have nothing of eternal significance to show for the years they have wasted.\u201d \u2013 Nate Saint\n\nHis Early Life and Times\n\nNate Saint was born in 1923 near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The seventh of eight children, he was raised in a devout Christian home.\n\nLike many young men in the first half of the 20th century, he was fascinated with airplanes. In 1930, at the age of seven, one of his older brothers gave him a ride on a plane. Three years and some thrilling flights later, his brother let him take the controls on a flight. From that time on, he was fascinated, not only with airplanes; he became fascinated with flying.\n\nIn 1942, at the age of 19, Nate enlisted in the U.S. Army where he expected to become a pilot during World War II. Unfortunately, due to a lingering infection, the Army would not allow him to fly. Nate turned that into an opportunity to become an aviation mechanic. He learned valuable lessons in that position that he would use later.\n\nHis Unexpected Life in Aviation\n\nFollowing Nate\u2019s three years in the military, he obtained a commercial pilot\u2019s license and enrolled at Wheaton College. During that time, his father made him aware of the newly established Christian Airmen\u2019s Missionary Fellowship (CAMF) which eventually became the Mission Aviation Fellowship.\n\nThe MAF began transporting missionaries into hard-to-reach places in the jungles of Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador. While at Wheaton, Nate committed his life to serving the Lord as a missionary and missions pilot. He so with the understanding that the work would be dangerous. In one year alone, 51 people died in missionary plane crashes in the jungle. In 1948, Nate and his wife traveled to Ecuador to open an MAF base at Shell Mara.\n\nHis Eventful Life in Ecuador\n\nMissions work in Ecuador did not start well for the avid missionary pilot. In December of his first year, the plane he was piloting crashed after a powerful downforce of wind drove it into the ground. Nate suffered a broken back and other injuries that kept him in a body cast for six months.\n\nThe bulk of Nate\u2019s work was transporting missionaries to villages that would otherwise have taken many days to reach traveling on foot. Once they were in place, he delivered food and supplies for their sustenance and work. Often supplies included medicines and medical equipment they would use to treat illnesses in the tribes to which they ministered.\n\nNate solved one of the early problems in jungle missionary aviation while serving the Lord in Ecuador. Pilots would drop supplies in predetermined locations, but some supplies were destroyed when the hit the ground, and more ended up in the treetops of the jungle canopy. Nate devised a method of safely and efficiently lowering supplies using a bucket and a rope while circling overhead. Not only were the supplies delivered, but the missionaries were able to send messages and other items up to the plane using the device.\n\nNate described his life in Ecuador this way:\n\n\u201cIt is our task to lift these missionaries up off those rigorous, life-consuming, and morale-breaking jungle trails\u2014lift them up to where five minutes in a plane equals twenty-four hours on foot. The reason for all this is not a matter of bringing comfort to the missionaries. They don\u2019t go to the steaming, tropical jungles looking for comfort in the first place. It\u2019s a matter of gaining precious time, of redeeming days and weeks, months and even years that can be spent in giving the Word of Life to primitive people.\u201d[1]\n\nHis Eventual Loss in Ecuador\n\nNate and four other missionaries had developed a burden to reach the Aucas, a reclusive tribe of native Indians known to kill others found in their territory. The Ecuadorian government had been considering sending troops in to subdue the natives.\n\nNonetheless, Nate, Jim Elliot, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youdarian began an effort to break through to the tribe. They started by making flights over the village, dropping gifts from pots and pans to trinkets. Having received what they considered a warm response, they determined that it was time to meet the Aucas in person.\n\nOn January 8, 1956, the five landed the plane on a strip of side alongside a river near the village. They were to make scheduled radio calls to their families back at the airfield compound, but no transmissions were ever made. The Aucas had massacred Nate and the others and left their bodies in the river and along the beach.\n\nThe story made major headlines, including an entire photo spread in Life magazine.\n\nHis Eternal Legacy\n\nJesus said that \u201ceven the gates of Hell shall not prevail\u201d against the Kingdom of God and His Church. Indeed, the spears of the Aucas could not. Instead of retreating in fear and defeat, the effort to reach the Aucas continued, including the personal ministry of Nate\u2019s son Steve and sister Ruth and Jim Elliot\u2019s wife Elisabeth, each of whom eventually lived with and ministered to the Aucas.\n\nTheir continued work has created an eternal legacy as many of the Aucas natives have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior over the years, including six of the men who participated in the raid and killed Nate and his fellow missionaries.\n\nThe Indians told their families that they were puzzled at why the men did not fight but willingly gave up their lives. Their amazement opened the door for the women to tell them that the men were there to tell them about Jesus Christ who \u201cfreely allowed his own death\u201d to ransom them from sin and its inevitable price.\n\nRachel Saint spent the rest of her natural life with Wycliffe Bible Translators among the Aucas and is buried in Ecuador.\n\nKimo, the pastor of the tribe, requested the honor of baptizing Steve and Kathy, Nate\u2019s children, to demonstrate their reconciliation through Christ. The pastor had been a member of the killing party.\n\nGikita, the leader of the attack, died a believer at the age of 80. He said that he was \u201ceager to go to Heaven and live peacefully with the five men who came to tell them about Creator God.\u201d[2]\n\nAs Nate Saint said, \u201cWhen life\u2019s flight is over, and we unload our cargo at the other end, the fellow who got rid of unnecessary weight will have the most valuable cargo to present to the Lord.\u201d\n\n[1] Jungle Pilot: The Life and Witness of Nate Saint, Russell T.

When Saint began looking as a high school senior for a Christian engineering college that had a soccer team, he found LeTourneau fit those requirements.\n\n\u201cLeTourneau was a really a good experience for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was where my faith became mine.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to LeTourneau, the first thing that struck me was that you have all these students from all these different states, different countries, and a lot of different church traditions and denominations,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized here are all these students who loved the Lord like I do, and they are from different backgrounds. That was one of three things that helped my faith.\n\nThe second was the faculty.\n\n\u201cThe teachers that I had, they really brought Christianity into the classroom and into life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of them have actual experience in their field before they came to LeTourneau. They were telling stories about what happened in business or on the mission field, or wherever, and they were relating that to their devotions and to class itself. That was kind of the second leg of a three-legged stool.\n\n\u201cThe third was the other students\u2014 friends\u2014that I made here.\n\n\u201cHebrews talks about spurring each other on to love and good works, and that\u2019s really what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends I made here pulled me along and challenged me to think about my faith and what Christ did for us on the cross.\n\n\u201cI have to say that those four years at LeTourneau were some of the most formative and most growing I did spiritually in a relatively short period of time.\u201d\n\nWhen Saint graduated with his mechanical technology degree in 1978, he began his career as a design engineer at Cessna Aircraft Company. After three years, inflation skyrocketed, interest rates went through the roof, and people stopped buying airplanes.\n\nSaint returned to his home state of Pennsylvania and approached the baby products company Graco, where his father had worked for many years\u2014inventing the Swyngomatic baby swing\u2014 and where Nate had worked as a janitor when he was a kid and built prototypes during summer breaks in college. They hired Nate to work in their product development department.\n\n\u201cI knew that industry from the standpoint of a laborer, but I didn\u2019t think I would end up long-term in that field,\u201d he said.\n\nBut God had other plans. By 2001, Nate Saint\u2014inventor of the \u2018Pack \u2018n Play\u2019\u2014was vice president of product development.\n\nWhen the company changed ownership, he started a new company as president and CEO of Iron Mountain LLC, specializing in design, engineering and market analysis of children\u2019s products. He said one of Graco\u2019s most popular products is the 4Ever\u2122 4-in-1 Convertible Car Seat\u2014developed for them by Iron Mountain.\n\nSaint appreciates LeTourneau\u2019s heritage of building and hands-on education.\n\n\u201cI like that aspect of LeTourneau,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our industry, we only hire engineers with good hands-on tool skills and experience...We want engineers who can come up with an idea and go into a shop and put enough of a model together to show marketing that this idea will work. That\u2019s important to us.\u201d\n\nSaint also said his professors taught him good work habits.\n\n\u201cOne of the professors really drove home that when you go into a lab, or into a workplace, or into a shop, that you leave it in better condition than you found it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou pick up after yourself. You sweep up after yourself. You clean up. That seems like a little, small thing, but that\u2019s actually really important.

As part of the Yellow Jacket Flying Club, Klempay earned his pilot\u2019s license and grew his interest in the technical and practical aspects of aerospace while surrounded by a community of like-minded students.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite things about aerospace at Tech is the pilot community,\u201d said Klempay. \u201cIn the flying club, everyone is constantly pushing each other to get better. When we debrief after a flight, we go into it with the mindset of becoming safer, better pilots.\u201d\n\nKlempay identified Associate Professors Joseph Saleh and Brian German as two mentors who were instrumental in shaping his academic experience at Tech.\n\n\u201cThey know how to take any topic and turn it into the most interesting thing in the world,\u201d said Klempay. \u201cI think that everyone should take their classes.\u201d\n\nKlempay credits his family and close friends in aerospace engineering with his success at Tech and acceptance into the 20 Twenties program, and he believes that the program will help him as his career plan continues to unfold.\n\nFor the next step of his career, Klempay is on track to start his 55-week Air Force pilot training at Sheppard Air Force Base later this month and will train in the T-6 Texan and T-38 Talon aircrafts. After pilot training, he aspires to go to test pilot school and potentially apply to be an astronaut for NASA or work at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\n\u201cIn college, it can be easy to lose sight of yourend goal and get caught up in the stressful moments,\u201d said Klempay. \"Now that I\u2019m stationed at Sheppard waiting for my training to start, I can look up in the sky every day to see the planes and aerospace engineering I studied at Georgia Tech in action. I can hardly believe that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be in a few short months.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/390933295", "page_content":
