Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international community. His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for his contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India\u2019s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam\u2019s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)\u2014an Indian military research institute\u2014and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam\u2019s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India\u2014died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.\n\nKalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d Among those successes was Agni, India\u2019s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.\n\nBritannica Quiz Explore India Quiz\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.\n\nIn 2002 India\u2019s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India\u2019s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country\u2019s first woman president.\n\nUpon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.\n\nKalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country\u2019s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997)."}, {"url": "https://learn.culturalindia.net/a-p-j-abdul-kalam.html", "page_content": "Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, better known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was an Indian scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India\n\n11th President of India (July 25, 2002 \u2013 July 25, 2007)\n\nDate of Birth: October 15, 1931\n\nPlace of Birth: Rameswaram, Ramnad District, Madras Presidency, British India\n\nParents: Jainulabdeen (Father) and Ashiamma (Mother)\n\nSpouse: Remained Unmarried\n\nEducation: St. Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli; Madras Institute of Technology\n\nProfession: Professor, Author, Scientist\n\nDied: July 27, 2015\n\nPlace of Death: Shillong, Meghalaya, India\n\nAwards: Bharat Ratna (1997), Padma Vibhushan (1990), Padma Bhushan (1981)\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, better known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was an illustrious scientist turned statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.

P. J.

Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, studied physics at the St. Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, and aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai.\n\nBefore his term as President, he worked as an Aerospace engineer with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam is popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He played a pivotal organisational, technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\n\nKalam was elected the President of India in 2002, defeating Lakshmi Sahgal, was nominated by Bharatiya Janata Party and supported by opposition Indian National Congress, the major political parties of India. He is currently a visiting professor at Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Indian Institute of Management Indore, honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, a professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University (Chennai), JSS University (Mysuru) and an adjunct/visiting faculty at many other academic and research institutions across India.\n\nKalam advocated plans to develop India into a developed nation by 2020 in his book India 2020. He has received several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian honour. Kalam is known for his motivational speeches and interaction with the student community in India. He launched his mission for the youth of the nation in 2011 called the What Can I Give Movement with a central theme to defeat corruption in India.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in a Tamil Muslim family to Jainulabudeen, a boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram District, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family\u2019s income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to financially contribute to his father\u2019s income. In his school years, he had average grades, but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics. He was just a simple man with a great fierceful heart in his childhood. After completing his school education at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He then moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with the lack of progress and threatened revoking his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. He worked tirelessly on his project and met the deadline, impressing the Dean who later said, \u201cI [Dean] was putting you [Kalam] under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline\u201d. He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam: Career as a scientist\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam\u2019s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticized for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist.\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent\u201d. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \u201cKalam-Raju Tablet\u201d.\n\nPresidency:\n\nKalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K.

P. J. Abdul Kalam\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 \u2013 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\n\nKalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the \"People's President\", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.\n\nWhile delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.\n\nHis father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.\n\nMarakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.\n\nCareer as a scientist\n\nThis was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers\u2014Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.

Becoming a fighter pilot was once his dearest dream, which was not fulfilled as he couldn\u2019t reach the final merit of IAF. After completing his higher education, Kalam joined the DRDO (Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation) as a scientist and late in the early 1960s, worked with the INCOSPAR (Indian National Committee for Space Research) under Vikram Sarabhai, a renowned space scientist.\n\nCourtesy: Hindustan Times\n\nEven though he got immense opportunities to design hovercrafts and small helicopters, he was never convinced and always aimed for something bigger and there was no failure in this world that could stop him. Later, Abdul Kalam started independently working on expandable rocket projects at DRDO. Things took a magnificent turn when he received transfer orders to the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) where he started as a project director of SLV-III, India\u2019s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle, which deployed the Rohini satellite into orbit the earth in July 1980.\n\n\u201cDream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep.\u201d\n\nHis dedication led to the development of 4 missile projects namely Prithvi, Trishul, Akash and Nag.

Later in 1992, Kalam was appointed as the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister and promoted to Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India in 1999.\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s education has immensely added to his valuable role in conducting the Pokhran-II, a series of 5 nuclear test explosions in 1998. His status as a national hero made India to be recognised as a full-fledged nuclear state. This is not the end, in the same year, Kalam proposed a countrywide plan called \u2018Technology Vision 2020\u2019 to develop nuclear empowerment, and improve agricultural productivity and various technological innovations, to name a few.\n\nDo You Know: Named after him, Abdul Kalam Scholarship is an initiative undertaken by various state governments and educational organisations for Indian students who belong to a minority group and are planning to pursue higher education.

Be Prepared For Life: It isn\u2019t always necessary that your life will exactly be like you want it to be, instead let your life take its course and go with the flow. Do not forget, everything that happens happens for a reason. APJ Abdul Kalam\u2019s education always taught us to never allow our failure to take over our lives but rather always have a \u2018Plan B\u2019 approach.\n\n2. Leadership: A good leader acknowledges the contribution, shoulders the responsibility and never blames for failures and gives credit for success. Taking undue credit for something you haven\u2019t done or achieved does not make you better and may influence bad qualities in your juniors.\n\n3. A Vision of your Own: One of the most influential factors that greatly accelerates civilization is people having a vision about everything they do, what matters to them the most, how well can they reap their rewards and giving them a definition in their lives.\n\n4.

Kalam is known for his motivational speeches and interaction with the student community in India. He launched his mission for the youth of the nation in 2011 called the What Can I Give Movement with a central theme to defeat corruption in India.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in a Tamil Muslim family to Jainulabudeen, a boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram District, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family\u2019s income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to financially contribute to his father\u2019s income. In his school years, he had average grades, but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics. He was just a simple man with a great fierceful heart in his childhood. After completing his school education at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He then moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with the lack of progress and threatened revoking his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. He worked tirelessly on his project and met the deadline, impressing the Dean who later said, \u201cI [Dean] was putting you [Kalam] under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline\u201d. He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam: Career as a scientist\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam\u2019s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticized for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist.\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent\u201d. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \u201cKalam-Raju Tablet\u201d.\n\nPresidency:\n\nKalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People\u2019s President.\n\nDeath:\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \u201cCreating a Livable Planet Earth\u201d at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST."}, {"url": "https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/a-p-j-abdul-kalam/m0gy3f", "page_content": "Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
