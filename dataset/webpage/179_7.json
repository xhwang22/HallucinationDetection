{"In 1896, Sewall was chosen as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, running with William Jennings Bryan.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1896", "page_content": "The nominations\n\nThe presidential campaign of 1896 was one of the most exciting in American history. The central issue was the country\u2019s money supply. An economic depression had begun in 1893, and public opinion\u2014and even the Democratic Party\u2014was split between those who favoured the gold standard and those who favoured free silver, a type of currency inflation, to help alleviate the depression. Most Republicans, as well as Democratic supporters of Pres. Grover Cleveland, were in favour of the gold standard. Southern and western Democrats and Populists (also known as the People\u2019s Party)\u2014many of them farmers who were suffering financially\u2014vied for free silver, which ultimately helped bring those two parties together.\n\nBritannica Quiz All-American History Quiz\n\nIn June at the Republican national convention in St. Louis, Missouri, former Ohio congressman and governor William McKinley, who was popular in his party for his moderate views on gold and silver, easily won the Republican presidential nomination. Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey was chosen as his running mate after Thomas Reed, who had vied for the presidential ticket, rejected the vice presidential nomination.\n\nAt their convention in Chicago the following month, the Democrats chose magnetic orator and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan. Although he was only 36 years of age, Bryan\u2019s famous \u201cCross of Gold\u201d speech (July 8), given in closing debate on the party platform and in favour of including a plank endorsing free silver, so electrified the convention that he was nominated for president, winning on the fifth ballot. His solution for the depressed economy was an \u201ceasy money\u201d policy based on the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio to gold of 16 to 1. On that platform he also received the nominations of the Populist and National Silver parties. Arthur Sewall, an executive from Maine, was chosen as the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential candidate. The Populists, trying to preserve their party as separate from the Democrats, nominated Thomas E. Watson as their vice presidential candidate."}, {"url": "https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h804.html", "page_content": "Election of 1896: Republican McKinley defeats Democrat Bryan\n\nThe Republicans The Republican nominating convention met in St. Louis in 1896. Marcus Hanna, the prominent Cleveland businessman and political operator, had lined up more than enough votes to assure the selection of William McKinley, the governor of Ohio and driving force behind the earlier McKinley Tariff. Thirty-four of the delegates walked out of the convention, refusing to accept the party's dedication to high protective tariffs and the gold standard. These Silver Republicans would later support the Democratic nominee. McKinley, despite having supported limited coinage of silver earlier in his career, adopted the party line. Garret Augustus Hobart of New Jersey, another friend of Hanna, was selected as the vice-presidential candidate. Despite the Silver Republicans' defection, the party's prospects were rosy. The country continued to be mired in the depression that followed the Panic of 1893 and it was expected that the voters would blame Cleveland and the Democrats. The Democrats The Democrats convened in Chicago to select their candidate. President Cleveland and his followers, the so-called Gold Democrats, were in the minority. The platform committee was split and ended up preparing two differing party statements, one favoring the free silver issue and the other opposing it. This temporary indecision set the stage for William Jennings Bryan, the 36-year-old two-term Congressman from Nebraska. His speech on the platform dilemma electrified the convention and led to both his nomination and the triumph of the free silver forces. Clearly one of the most famous political addresses in American history, the \"cross of gold speech\" cast the advocates of the gold standard as the crucifiers of Christ and the silver supporters as the true Christians. Bryan's nomination was no surprise. He and his managers had been working for months to line up the necessary delegates and Bryan had labored long and hard over his speech. Arthur Sewall, a wealthy shipbuilder from Maine, was selected for the vice-presidential slot in a vain effort to court New England votes. The Populists The Populist Party reached a critical juncture in 1896. Considerable sentiment existed for \"fusion\" with the Democrats, stemming from a fear of splitting the silver vote. However, Bryan and the Democrats showed little interest in other issues and some Populists worried, with ample reason, that a merger would dilute their identity and lead to the party's decline. In the end, the demand for silver was sufficient to bring the Populist nomination to Bryan, but the party asserted its independence by giving the vice-presidential nod to Thomas E. Watson of Georgia. The Campaign McKinley conducted a \"front porch campaign\" in which he remained at home in Canton, Ohio and trainloads of supporters (perhaps as many as 750,000) were brought in to hear him deliver short speeches tailored for his audiences. The lack of energy in such a campaign seems strange to modern observers, but several factors were at work:\n\nTradition held that presidential candidates should not actively seek votes by widespread campaigning, a spectacle thought to be beneath the dignity of the office; McKinley's opponent, more than any other presidential aspirant, broke that tradition.\n\nMrs. McKinley was seriously ill and her husband was deeply devoted to her; he refused to consider long campaign trips that would separate him from his wife.\n\nMcKinley was clearly an inferior public speaker compared to the polished and dramatic Bryan; Mark Hanna and other advisors thought it unwise to do anything that might accentuate the difference between the two candidates.\n\nElection of 1896\n\nCandidates Party Electoral\n\nVote Popular\n\nVote William McKinley (OH)\n\nGarret A.

His campaign train stopped at towns and hamlets and the candidate delighted his largely rural listeners with his flamboyant oratory. In the early fall of 1896, many observers believed Bryan was the frontrunner. This assessment was probably based more on the Bryan crowds' fervor than anything else. The excitement created by the Democratic campaign was used to advantage by Hanna, who managed to leverage the fear of a free-silver victory into hefty contributions from Republican businessmen. Somewhere between three and seven million dollars were raised, compared to about $300,000 by the Democrats. McKinley's victory was convincing. Massive Republican advertising and the faltering economy worked heavily against the Democrats. Further, Bryan's revivalistic style, so much loved by the farmers of the West and South, actually alienated many immigrant voters who would have ordinarily been Democratic supporters. Bryan failed to carry any Northern industrial state and lost such farm states as North Dakota , Minnesota and Iowa. In short, Bryan's message was too narrow.*Thomas Watson was nominated by the Populist Party as Bryan's running mate. He drew a number of votes away from the regular nominee of the Democratic party, Arthur Sewall."}, {"url": "http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party\n\nGrover Cleveland's Administration\n\nThe Democrats entered their convention deeply divided. The severe depression had made their sitting president, Grover Cleveland, wildly unpopular (the biography link here is to the White House history pages). Cleveland, the first Democratic president since the Civil War, had served two terms (1885-1889 and 1893-1897). In the early years he was popular as a reformer who opposed the corruption of big-spending Republicans in the capital, but the economic shock of 1893 eclipsed this issue.\n\n\n\nA fiscal conservative, Cleveland sealed his fate among free silver advocates in the South and West when, in the face of economic hardship, he called a special session of Congress to further tighten the money supply. \"Pitchfork\" Ben Tillman won his nickname when he threatened to \"poke old Grover with a pitchfork.\"\n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention at Chicago\n\n7-11 July 1896\n\nArriving in Chicago, Eastern Democrats who opposed free silver were stunned by the strength of that cause. William C. Whitney, a millionaire, a close friend of Grover Cleveland, and his former Secretary of the Navy, rushed to the convention to organize the pro-gold forces, but found that delegates who shared his sentiments were in the minority. Cleveland's Secretary of the Treasury, John G. Carlisle, remained in Washington and denounced the silverites from there. To some Americans' shock and others' joy, emerging candidates for the nomination were all Southern and Western free silver men.\n\n\n\nThe hopefuls included Richard Bland of Kentucky, a stalwart pro-silver voice in the House of Representatives from 1873 to 1894; Horace Boies, former governor of Illinois, also strongly pro-silver; and young William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska. The convention debated the currency question before moving to the nominations. With a dramatic address that became famous as the \"Cross of Gold\" speech, Bryan prompted an hour of cheering and demonstrations, followed by the convention's adoption of a free silver plank by 628 votes to 301.\n\n\n\nNew York Senator David B. Hill, a loyal Cleveland man, moved that the convention express its support for the current Democratic administration. The motion failed miserably, and free-silver men wildly celebrated their victory. In addition, the convention passed an indignant resolution protesting Cleveland's intervention to squelch Chicago's Pullman strike. Republicans dubbed this the \"anarchy plank,\" linking it to the Civil War doctrine of states' rights and to fears of labor unrest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Cross of Gold\" speech is often credited with winning Bryan the nomination, in part because the convention's actions seemed impulsive to Easterners unaware of sentiment in other regions. It was also unheard of for a convention to nominate a man in his presence; presidential hopefuls were supposed to wait modestly at home for the results. Bryan and his friends had, however, worked hard in advance, and several delegations came to Chicago already pledged to his support.\n\n\n\nGold Democrats faced a difficult choice. Some, like David Hill, sat quietly through the campaign, awaiting another year when they hoped economic conservatives would regain control of the party. Hill, when asked about his party affiliations, allegedly said he was \"still a Democrat--very still.\"\n\n\n\nOthers walked out, especially those who had lost their state and local power to free-silver men, and had little more to lose. Neither faction worked for Bryan, and some publicly instructed Democrats to vote for McKinley. Bryan and the Silver Democrats ran their campaign without the support of some of the party's key contributors and leaders, including a hostile administration in Washington.\n\n\n\nBryan's Democratic Running Mate\n\nDemocrats further complicated the campaign by nominating Arthur Sewall of Maine for the Vice-Presidency. Sewall, a Maine shipbuilding owner, seemed a good choice to attract Eastern votes and balance the Nebraskan presidential nominee. After the convention, however, Democrats discovered to their chagrin that Sewall had a poor reputation as an employer. His anti-labor record and great wealth made him anathema to the Populist convention, which endorsed Bryan but rejected Sewall, choosing Tom Watson of Georgia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Chicago Platform\"\n\nGold Democrats and Republicans used this term contemptously, to emphasize that the radical proposals adopted in 1896 did not represent the \"real,\" traditional views of the Democratic party. Silver Democrats and fusion Populists celebrated the \"Chicago platform\" as a new departure that promised aid to those hit hard by the depression and more equal distribution of wealth. The most controversial planks were free silver and the proposed federal income tax.\n\n\n\nCampaign Strategy Bryan's campaign manager was Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas; he proved ruthless in his dealings with the Populists, but not so effective in besting the Republicans. The silver Democrats were poor in comparison to McKinley's forces. Toward the end of the campaign they unsuccessfully sought $350,000 from William Randolph Hearst and silver mine operators; even this amount paled in comparison with the hundreds of thousands raised by Republican Mark Hanna. In the end, silver Democrats failed to cover their debts. Bryan was the first presidential candidate to go on nationwide speaking tours. Focusing much of his energy on the hotly contested Midwestern states, Bryan criss-crossed the U.S. by railroad, speaking from the back of his train at all hours of day and night. Bryan's imposing voice and height made a deep impression on many who thronged to hear him. In many parts of the South and West Bryan supporters welcomed him with parades, speeches, and wild demonstrations of support.\n\n\n\nOther Americans criticized Bryan as self-aggrandizing and loud, criticizing his innovative campaign tactics as much as his ideas. Republicans like Theodore Roosevelt took note, however, and by the early 1900s the idea of \"barnstorming\" by railroad became widely practiced by candidates in all parties.\n\n\n\nBryan consistently hammered on the theme of \"the American people versus the special interests,\" targetting Wall Street bankers and the trusts and monopolies they financed. Even when speaking in New York, he refused to apologize for the Chicago plank that called for a progressive income tax, despite intense criticism from the Republicans.\n\n\n\nIn the South, Bryan supporters emphasized states' rights and white supremacy; John Altgeld and other advocates of labor also pointed to the plank that defended states' rights, but for different reasons, stemming from Grover Cleveland's intervention to suppress the Pullman strike of 1894.\n\n\n\nToward the end of the campaign, some businessmen began warning workers that a Bryan victory would mean the end of their employment--businesses would be forced to shut down after election day. Republican leaders scoffed at Bryan's charge that this was \"coercion\"--a veiled or not-so-veiled threat against employees who might vote Democratic. Silver Democrats' belief that such threats were widespread, combined with a perception that McKinley won by taking enormous sums from \"trusts,\" lent special bitterness to their defeat. It also raised new issues about politics and corporate power that the country would begin to debate as the new century dawned.\n\n\n\nHOW THE NOMINATION WAS RECEIVED.\n\nOmaha, Neb., July 10--All Nebraska is excited tonight over Bryan's nomination, and informal celebrations, with bands playing, horns tooting and excited Democrats yelling in a most enthusiastic manner, are common throughout Nebraska. The excitement is most intense in Omaha, though no formal steps have yet been taken toward a proper celebration. It came as too much of a surprise.\n\n--Denver News, 11 July 1896\n\n\n\nA gifted friend of mine said on the first day of the convention that it was a battle between Rothschilds and Bland, and that if Bland were beaten Rothschilds would win. When the nomination was made he leaned over my shoulder and said the Rothschilds are beaten.\n\n--John Russell Young in St. Louis Globe-Dispatch, 12 July 1896\n\n\n\n\n\nTAIL STRONGER THAN HEAD.\n\nMillionaire Arthur Sewall of Maine Placed at the Rear of the Ticket.\n\nThe Last Mad Cry of the Moon Worshipers Has Died Away Among the Rafters of the Coliseum.\n\nFROM EVERY POINT COMES NEWS OF BOLTING DEMOCRATS.\n\n--Los Angeles Times, 12 July 1896\n\n\n\nThe middle-of-the-road Populists have played their party into the hands of the McKinley syndicate. But Mr. Bryan is not defeated. His manly conduct in refusing to throw aside his running mate will commend him to the people. He has shown himself to be a man of honor. He is in very truth, another Lincoln.\n\n--Tacoma Daily News in Public Opinion, 6 August 1896\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 1896\n\nTerre Haute, Indiana\n\n\n\nMy dear Mr. Bryan,\n\nWith millions of others of your countrymen I congratulate you most heartily upon being the People's standard bearer in the great uprising of the masses against the classes.

In the arduous campaign before you the millions will rally to your standard and you will lead them to a glorious victory. The people love and trust you--they believe in you as you believe in them, and under your administration the rule of the money power will be broken and the gold barons of Europe will no longer run the American government.\n\nWill all good wishes\n\nbelieve me always\n\nYour faithfully\n\nEugene V.

In vain did Mr. Bryan attempt to restore order, but it was many minutes before anything like quiet was obtained. Then the crowd began to surge again, and the police to fight those in front. Women fainted and several persons were taken from the crowd, overcome by the crush.\n\n--Rocky Mountain News, 25 September 1896\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1896", "page_content": "Election Notes: Democratic electoral votes were cast for two Vice Presidential candidates: Arthur Sewall (149) and Thomas Watson (27).

He practiced law in Jacksonville (1883\u201387) before moving to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1890.

The climax of Bryan\u2019s career was undoubtedly the 1896 presidential campaign.

You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\n\nHis solution for the depressed economy after the panic of 1893 was an \u201ceasy money\u201d policy based on the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio to gold of 16 to 1. On that platform he also received the nominations of the Populist and National Silver parties. In the ensuing campaign, he traveled more than 18,000 miles (29,000 km) through 27 states and attracted a large and enthusiastic following, but the well-financed Republican machine won 271 electoral votes for William McKinley to Bryan\u2019s 176. Bryan lost to McKinley again in 1900 and to William Howard Taft in 1908.\n\nIn recognition of his role in securing the Democratic nomination for Woodrow Wilson in 1912, Bryan was appointed secretary of state the following year.

Bryan convinced 31 nations to agree in principle to his proposal of new treaties that would provide a \u201ccooling-off\u201d period of one year during which a question in dispute could be studied by an international commission. In the meantime, World War I broke out. An avowed pacifist, Bryan finally resigned over Wilson\u2019s second note to Germany (June 8, 1915) protesting the sinking of the Lusitania. Nonetheless, he urged loyal support of the war when it was finally declared.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

A firm believer in a literal interpretation of the Bible, Bryan went to Dayton, Tennessee, to assist in the prosecution of a schoolteacher accused of teaching Darwinism, or the theory of the evolutionary origin of man, rather than the doctrine of divine creation. With Clarence Darrow as chief defense counsel, the trial attracted worldwide attention as a dramatic duel between fundamentalism and modernism. John T.

The convention endorsed him over strenuous protests from \"middle-of-the-road\" Populists, who remained strong enough to force the nomination of a separate vice-presidential candidate, Tom Watson. The resulting confusion contributed to the continuing decline of Populist fortunes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prohibitionist Party had peaked in strength in 1888; its convention also divided over whether to address the money question or to present a \"narrow-gauge\" platform focused solely on the prohibition of liquor.\n\n\n\nThe Silver Party, tiny and overwhelmingly Western, endorsed the Silver Democratic candidates but drafted and passed their own platform.\n\n\n\nThe Socialist Labor Party nominated candidates, though Socialism had not yet achieved the strength it would after 1900. Many future Socialists, such as Eugene V. Debs, called themselves Populists in 1896 and supported William Jennings Bryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/2001697077/", "page_content": "More about Copyright and other Restrictions\n\nFor guidance about compiling full citations consult Citing Primary Sources.\n\nRights Advisory : See Rights and Restrictions Information Page\n\n: Reproduction Number : LC-USZC2-6263 (color film copy slide) LC-USZ62-21960 (b&w film copy neg.)\n\n: Call Number : BIOG FILE - Bryan, William Jennings, 1860-1925--Campaign [item] [P&P]\n\n: Access Advisory: ---\n\nObtaining Copies\n\nIf an image is displaying, you can download it yourself. (Some images display only as thumbnails outside the Library of Congress because of rights considerations, but you have access to larger size images on site.)\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through Library of Congress Duplication Services.\n\nIf a digital image is displaying: The qualities of the digital image partially depend on whether it was made from the original or an intermediate such as a copy negative or transparency. If the Reproduction Number field above includes a reproduction number that starts with LC-DIG..., then there is a digital image that was made directly from the original and is of sufficient resolution for most publication purposes. If there is information listed in the Reproduction Number field above: You can use the reproduction number to purchase a copy from Duplication Services. It will be made from the source listed in the parentheses after the number. If only black-and-white (\"b&w\") sources are listed and you desire a copy showing color or tint (assuming the original has any), you can generally purchase a quality copy of the original in color by citing the Call Number listed above and including the catalog record (\"About This Item\") with your request.

In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.\n\nIs the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.) Yes, the item is digitized. Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.

If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference librarian. (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see online where they are presented as positive images.)\n\nPlease use the digital image in preference to requesting the original.
