{"Mois\u00e9s Kaufman was born in Caracas, Venezuela.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moises-Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, (born November 21, 1963, Caracas, Venezuela), Venezuelan-born playwright and director who is best known for perceptive and moving plays often rooted in issues of sexuality. He was cofounder in 1991 of Tectonic Theater Project, a company dedicated to examining the structure and language of theatre as well as addressing contemporary social issues.\n\nKaufman was born in Venezuela to Orthodox Jewish parents and was of Ukrainian and Romanian descent. He attended a yeshiva (Jewish religious school) as a child and was exposed to broader culture on family trips to New York City. A Caracas theatre festival he attended as a young teenager brought him exposure to the avant-garde plays of such artists as Peter Brook, Tadeusz Kantor, Pina Bausch, and Jerzy Grotowski, whom he cited as his early influences. While attending Metropolitan University in Caracas (B.A. in business administration, 1985), Kaufman joined a touring experimental theatre group as an actor. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he studied theatre directing at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, meanwhile directing a variety of plays. It was at NYU that he honed his ideas about the purpose and most-effective means of presenting theatrical performances. Four years later Kaufman, together with his partner, Jeffrey LaHoste, established Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman\u2019s writing debut, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde (performed 1997\u201398, published 1997), illustrated his concerns as a writer-director. He was especially interested in what he termed \u201cwatershed historical moments,\u201d events that reveal the foundations of society\u2019s beliefs. A powerful and moving play that used actual trial testimony, Gross Indecency won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding Off-Broadway play. Kaufman and his troupe then began work on The Laramie Project (performed 2000, published 2001, television movie 2002), interviewing numerous residents of the small Wyoming city in which gay college student Matthew Shepard had been brutally murdered. The play had particular resonance with Kaufman, who was gay, and it proved popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman directed a one-man show, Doug Wright\u2019s I Am My Own Wife: Studies for a Play About Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (performed 2003\u201304), the story of a gay transvestite who survived life in Nazi Germany and Soviet East Berlin. It was critically acclaimed and resulted in a Tony Award nomination for Kaufman. In the next several years Kaufman directed a variety of plays, including Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. He also directed his own play 33 Variations (first performed 2007), starring Jane Fonda as a musicologist obsessed with Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations, and received another Tony nomination. In 2009 Kaufman and other Tectonic members arranged for 150 simultaneous readings in theatres across the globe of a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later. He also directed Rajiv Joseph\u2019s Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (performed 2011), starring Robin Williams as the title character; a 2012\u201313 revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz\u2019s The Heiress, a play based on Henry James\u2019s novel Washington Square; and a revival of Torch Song (2018\u201319), which was written by Harvey Fierstein. In 2016 Kaufman received the National Medal of Arts."}, {"url": "https://stageagent.com/writers/3201/moises-kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman is a playwright, director, and founder of the Tectonic Theater Project based in New York City.\n\nKaufman was born in Caracas, Venequela on November 21, 1963.

The medal recognizes outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States. Kaufman is in good company; among this year's other recipients are film director Mel Brooks, author Sandra Cisneros, actor Morgan Freeman, composer Philip Glass, and actress-singer Audra McDonald. (See the full list here.) Kaufman has had a long and varied career, and some facts about his life and work may surprise even devoted fans. Read on for 10 things you should know about Moises Kaufman.\n\nHe is the son of a Holocaust survivor.\n\nKaufman's father, Jose, was a Romanian Jew who survived the Holocaust. As a boy, Jose earned money by making and selling the yellow Stars of David that the Nazi regime forced Jews to wear. \"He spent most of the war alternately hiding in a small room and selling Stars of David,\" Moises Kaufman recalled in the book A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer, edited by Eve Ensler. After World War II was over, Jose made his way to Caracas, Venezuela. There he worked in a grocery store and eventually bought one, and he married Dora Akerman, a Venezuelan-born woman of Ukrainian descent. Moises was born in Caracas in 1963. His parents brought him up in the Orthodox branch of Judaism, and he attended a yeshiva -- a Jewish religious school -- which made Moises quite the outsider in the heavily Catholic nation, as did his realization at age 11 that he was gay. Moises moved to New York City in 1987 to pursue his theatrical career, in which many of his projects have dealt with outsiders, and some have touched directly on the Holocaust. In 2015 he directed a revival of Bent, Martin Sherman's play about gay men in a concentration camp, at Los Angeles's Mark Taper Forum.\n\nThe Laramie Project was a massive undertaking.\n\nFor The Laramie Project, which deals with the brutal murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard and the reactions of the townspeople in Laramie, Wyo., Kaufman and his colleagues at the Tectonic Theater Project compiled 400 hours of interviews from over 200 people. Kaufman was in New York City when he heard about the attack on Shepard in October 1998. \"I started getting phone calls -- 'Did you hear what happened?' -- and then I read it in the newspaper and I saw it on television,\" he recalled to The Advocate in 2008. \"People have spoken about how we as gay people feel attacked, injured, constantly in our culture. And that image of that boy tied to the fence spoke to so many of us about our pain and about our sense of how we fit into the landscape of this country. The impact of seeing what this was doing to the country--that's when I decided to go to Laramie and do The Laramie Project.\" The Laramie Project premiered in 2000, has been performed widely, and was adapted into an HBO movie, directed by Kaufman, in 2002. And 10 years after Shepard's death Kaufman and his Tectonic collaborators returned to Laramie to compile a sequel, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, which premiered in 2009.\n\n[rebelmouse-image

It received numerous critics' awards and a GLAAD Media Award. It has been produced in dozens of cities in the U.S. and abroad, but a planned production in Moscow was abruptly canceled in 2015. The production was to be funded in part by the U.S. State Department, but the Russian government stepped in and said the Moscow theater company that was to stage it could not accept foreign funds. The real reason for the cancellation, Kaufman believes, was that this depiction of the great gay author and wit ran afoul of Russia's \"gay propaganda\" law, which bans any positive discussion of LGBT people or issues in forums accessible to minors. The play did receive a a star-studded benefit reading in New York City in the fall of 2015 to support the Tectonic Theater Project and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n\nPictured: Kaufman (left) and Ben Foster clown around at the premiere of the HBO film of The Laramie Project.\n\nThe Laramie Project has run into trouble a few places too.\n\nThe Laramie Project's gay subject matter has led high school administrators to cancel performances of the play in places as varied as Spokane, Wash.;Ottumwa, Iowa; and Burbank, Calif. The students in Burbank eventually were able to stage their production, although not at their high school -- it went on at the Los Angeles suburb's Colony Theatre, which donated the space, and with help from Tectonic. But the play also has had well-received, school-supported productions in many places in the U.S., including Xavier High School, a Roman Catholic institution in New York City.\n\nHis play 33 Variations gave Jane Fonda her first Broadway role in 46 years.\n\nKaufman wrote and directed 33 Variations, about a music scholar studying one of Beethoven's most enigmatic works, and when it premiered on Broadway in 2009, Jane Fonda played the lead role. This was Fonda's first Broadway appearance since 1963, and she received positive reviews. \"Whatever discomfort the actress may feel melds into her portrayal of Dr. Katherine Brandt, whose naturally assertive nature is humbled by the progressive, atrophying illness known as Lou Gehrig's disease,\" Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, adding, \"For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\"\n\nHe discovered a different side of Robin Williams during Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.\n\nFonda isn't the only major movie star who has appeared in a Kaufman play. In 2011, Robin Williams starred in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a meditation on the Iraq war written and directed by Kaufman. Williams portrayed a tiger who is killed in the first scene and then haunts the rest of the characters for the remainder of the play. Williams initially started rehearsals with what Kaufman called \"the 10 a.m. stand-up.\" \"He would start talking about whatever crossed his mind and would riff on it for the next 20 or 30 minutes, keeping all of us -- actors, designers, stage management -- roaring with laughter,\" Kaufman wrote in Salon in 2014, after Williams's suicide. \"Like everyone, I was dazzled by the speed of his brain and the quickness of his wit, but I also noticed something else: an actor's natural trepidation about tackling a demanding role. As he developed his character ... the 10 a.m. monologues became shorter and shorter. He was feeling more at home in the rehearsal room, finding his groove in the role. Until, finally, the monologues were gone.\" Williams also developed \"a real camaraderie\" with his castmates -- and he occasionally showed signs of depression, the playwright noted. \"For me, it isn't his brilliant sense of humor, or his wit, or his chameleon abilities that I'll miss,\" Kaufman concluded. \"I'll miss the guy who came to rehearsal every day with humility and kindness, who sat around at lunch and shot the breeze. I'll miss the man who loved what he did every day. And who loved this community. I will miss my friend.\"\n\nHe's even directed operas, including one based on Puss in Boots.\n\nKaufman has proved his versatility time and again. In 2010 he took on the direction of Spanish composer Xavier Montsalvatge's chamber opera adaptation of the popular fairy tale. The production incorporated both puppets and human actors. Staging a show aimed at children was intimidating and also rewarding, Kaufman told the New York Daily News. \"I've never been more scared in my life, because children don't lie,\" he said. On the other hand, he noted, \"There's nothing better than hearing children laugh.\"\n\nHis most recent project is a reimagining of Bizet's Carmen.\n\nNothing if not adventurous, Kaufman and cowriter Eduardo Machado adapted Georges Bizet's 19th-century opera into Carmen: An Afro-Cuban Jazz Musical, set in 1958, changing the locale from Spain to Cuba, and making the sensuous factory worker Carmen a black woman who supports Fidel Castro's revolution. Composer Arturo O'Farrill adapted Bizet's melodies into jazzy tunes with lyrics by Kaufman and others. The play had its world premiere, directed by Kaufman, in February of this year at the Olney Theatre Center in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite all his success, Kaufman describes himself as shy and socially awkward.\n\n\"I'm incredibly shy, I am socially awkward, and I don't have many other interests other than my work,\" he told Los Angeles's Jewish Journal in 2011. \"When I'm in the rehearsal room, I'm my best self. I've always known how to live in my work. I am not so good at living my life.\"\n\nBut he has managed to have a long-term relationship. He is married to Jeffrey LaHoste, with whom he founded the Tectonic Theater Project.\n\nKaufman and LaHoste founded Tectonic in 1991, with the goal of \"developing innovative works that explore theatrical language and form, fostering an artistic dialogue with audiences on the social, political, and human issues that affect us all,\" according to the New York-based company's website. Kaufman is its artistic director, and LaHoste, a writer and producer, is a member of the board of directors. LaHoste has produced many of Kaufman's plays and several other projects, such as Kirby Dick's 2009 documentary film Outrage, about closeted politicians who support anti-LGBT legislation. He is also the author of author of Elysian Fields, a television series in development that was chosen as a participating project in the Producers' Guild of America's Diversity Workshop. Kaufman and LaHoste have been together for more than 20 years, and they were married in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/moises-kaufman.html", "page_content": "About\n\nFounder of the Tectonic Theater Project who wrote the plays The Laramie Project and Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela and moved to New York City in 1987.\n\nTrivia\n\nHe received a Tony Award nomination for Best Direction of a Play for his 2004 production of I Am My Own Wife.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe is openly gay and considers himself the sum of all of his cultures.\n\nAssociated With\n\nHe directed episodes of The L Word, starring Mia Kirshner."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44949.Mois_s_Kaufman", "page_content": "Mois\u00e9s Kaufman\n\nBorn\n\nNovember 21, 1963\n\nGenre\n\nMois\u00e9s Kaufman (born November 21, 1963) is a playwright, director and founder of Tectonic Theater Project.
