We are \u201cindebted to its architects\u201d. However, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d shortly after ratification, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. It instituted no bill of rights, no major process of post-conflict reconciliation, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in housing and education. Its largest failure is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political isntitutions\u201d.The GFA should not be discarded, but needs reviewing and \u201ccorrective decisions\u201d to \u201cimplement what was intended in 1998\u201d.\n\nThe power-sharing system established by the 2006 St Andrew's Agreement, in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership, has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community. This has produced centrifugal tendencies in Northern Irish politics, benefiting Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP at the expense of the political centre, and failing to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence. Publishing this research should \u201cinform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cushnahan doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s \u201cany possibility in the near future of an all-Ireland settlement.\u201d So, in the meantime, we have to try and make Stormont work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t unite Northern Ireland, how the hell can we unite Ireland?\" A question which will inevitably be asked again in this series and as the political fallout from Brexit continues to animate these islands."}, {"url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/home", "page_content": "Welcome message from the Chair of the Conference of Delegation Chairs\n\nDear Members, partners and friends,\n\n\n\nThe EU is a global benchmark as regards its values and guiding principles and we stand united to defend a peaceful, fair, inclusive and rules-based world order.\n\n\n\nAs elected representatives, Members of the European Parliament are committed to making the voice of EU citizens heard internationally, in keeping with our values and strategic interests.\n\n\n\nIt is through the work of the delegations that we pursue dialogue with our partners from third countries, to seek shared prosperity and peace for our citizens, in particular by strengthening democracy and human rights.\n\n\n\nI am fully convinced of the important role of parliamentary diplomacy in helping the European Union to shape its external policies and pursue its objectives.\n\n\n\nTogether with the CDC Secretariat, we will be working on the pages of this site in order to make them an increasingly useful source of information about our activities, our mission, and our meetings in Brussels, Strasbourg and elsewhere.

Recommends the following to the Council:\n\nReform of the UN system, including reform of the Security Council\n\n(a) to actively support the UN Secretary-General\u2019s (UNSG) three pillar reform agenda with the aim of making the UN system truly coordinated, efficient, effective, integrated, transparent and accountable; to support the streamlining of the peace and security structure, which needs to become more efficient, focused, properly funded, and operational with power divided in a more balanced way and with more effective diversity in terms of regional representation in all its bodies;\n\n(b) to support reduced bureaucracy, simplified procedures and decentralised decision-making, with greater transparency and accountability on the missions and work of UN staff, especially with regard to their operations in the field;\n\n(c) to support the UNSG\u2019s efforts in making a substantial change in order to align the UN development system with the priorities of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), and make it fit for the purpose of better supporting their implementation;\n\n(d) to call on UN Member States to empower both the UNSG and Deputy SG and their respective authorities in the process of streamlining the UN management system, in order to promote greater efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, and value for money of the UN and its agencies;\n\n(e) to remind all UN Member States of their obligation to maintain their financial efforts to support all UN agencies and meet their commitments on development aid spending, while increasing effectiveness and efficiency, and holding governments to account for the implementation of the global SDGs;\n\n(f) to actively support the UNSG\u2019s efforts in the implementation of the UN Strategy on Gender Parity as an essential tool to ensure the equal representation of women in the UN system; to appoint more women and particularly women belonging to minority groups to senior management posts at UN HQ level and to adopt gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting; to call on the EU and the UN to appoint more female police officers and soldiers to missions and operations; to push for intersectional gender advisors for individual missions and operations and specific action plans, which design how UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 2242 are being implemented at the level of each mission and operation;

Instructs its President to forward this recommendation to the Council, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, the European External Action Service, the Commission and, for information, the United Nations General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations."}, {"url": "https://www.europarl.europa.eu/delegations/en/about/introduction", "page_content": "Understanding the European Parliament's delegations\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament's delegations are official groups of MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) that maintain and deepen relations with the parliaments of non-EU countries, with regions and with organisations.\n\n\n\nIn this way, delegations serve as Parliament's primary link to other legislatures, at home and abroad.\n\n\n\nWorking in cooperation with Parliament's committees and with MEPs supporting democracy and human rights beyond the EU's borders, delegations lend force to the positions the European Parliament adopts.\n\n\n\nBy exercising parliamentary diplomacy through regular discussions, delegations also promote the EU in general and encourage their partners to uphold the EU's values and interests.\n\n\n\nInterparliamentary meetings\n\n\n\nDelegations organise interparliamentary meetings with elected representatives from outside the EU. This gives our partners the chance to discuss issues face to face.\n\n\n\nThese meetings are generally held once or twice a year and last for a few hours or days.\n\n\n\nThey take place in alternating venues: for one meeting, MEPs will travel to another parliament outside the EU; and for the next, the EU delegation will host its guests in the European Parliament.\n\n\n\nWhen MEPs travel outside the EU for these meetings, they also try to meet with people away from the host parliament and visit EU-funded projects.\n\n\n\nDiscussions in Brussels and Strasbourg\n\n\n\nDelegations also hold meetings in Brussels and Strasbourg, alone or with other delegations or committees.\n\n\n\nThese brief meetings allow delegations to plan their interparliamentary encounters and to discuss the situation in their partners' countries.\n\n\n\nDelegations often invite outside guests to make presentations and exchange views with MEPs. Many speakers work for other EU institutions - most often the Commission or the European External Action Service - or for embassies or universities.\n\n\n\nThe delegations also sometimes invite guests whose voices might otherwise not be heard: members of the political opposition in a given country or representatives of civil society, for example.\n\n\n\nThe 45 standing delegations\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament currently has 45 'standing' - in other words, permanent - delegations.\n\n\n\nThis number was established by a decision 'on the number of interparliamentary delegations, delegations to joint parliamentary committees and delegations to parliamentary cooperation committees and to multilateral parliamentary assemblies'.\n\n\n\nThis decision, adopted in April 2019, listed the delegations that would operate during the ninth parliamentary term (2019-2024) and grouped them together by region.\n\n\n\nFrom one parliamentary term to another, the distribution of delegations may differ significantly. For example, in the seventh parliamentary term (2009-2014), a single delegation worked with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. Since mid-2014, four separate delegations have covered these countries.\n\n\n\nAt any time, Parliament may also decide to send official groups of MEPs to non-EU countries in response to political developments, or to take part in conferences or other events.\n\n\n\nComposition\n\n\n\nAll the delegations have the same structure: they have one chair and two vice-chairs, who are elected by the delegation's members.\n\n\n\nAll delegation members are nominated by Parliament's political groups, with the composition of each delegation reflecting Parliament's overall political balance.\n\n\n\nEvery single MEP is a member of a standing delegation. Some belong to more than one.\n\n\n\nThe largest delegations are usually those that participate in parliamentary assemblies, where several parliaments convene.\n\n\n\nFor example, there are 78 MEPs in the European Parliament's delegation to the semi-annual forum that brings together all the parliaments of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States.\n\n\n\nSuch a large delegation is unusual, however. Most of Parliament's delegations comprise 20 members or fewer. The smallest have just 8 members.\n\n\n\nRules\n\n\n\nThe delegations must follow strict rules that are laid out in a number of documents and decisions.\n\n\n\nTwo rules in Parliament's official Rules of Procedure focus on delegations. In addition, many of the rules for committees also apply to delegations.\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament's most recent decision on the number of delegations also spelled out some procedures. The ways in which committees and delegations should coordinate their work, including when travelling, are set out in detail.\n\n\n\nThe most extensive rules for delegations are contained in an official document called the 'Implementing provisions governing the work of delegations and missions outside the European Union'.\n\n\n\nThis text lays out the general aim of Parliament's delegations: 'maintaining and enhancing contacts with parliaments of States that are traditionally partners of the European Union and [...] promoting [...] the values on which the European Union is founded.'\n\n\n\nThe provisions also describe how Parliament's delegations should uphold Parliament's positions and standards.\n\n\n\nOther articles explain which MEPs can join a delegation's activities outside the EU. In order to keep costs down, the number of participants is strictly controlled, with all travel requiring prior authorisation.\n\n\n\nRelations with committees\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament has three full committees and two subcommittees focusing on activities outside the EU ('external action'). These committees maintain close relations with the delegations.\n\n\n\nCommittees and delegations keep one another informed of their meetings and discussions, and invite each other's members to join their proceedings and assignments, including when they travel outside the EU.\n\n\n\nOf the committees, the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) plays the most critical role for the delegations. This committee coordinates and provides political oversight for the work of the delegations - not only for standing delegations, but also for all MEPs travelling on official Parliament business to countries outside the EU.\n\n\n\nThe Committee for International Trade (INTA) liaises with all delegations when the agenda touches on international economic and trade issues. The delegation focusing on the CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement has particularly close links with INTA.\n\n\n\nFinally, the Committee on Development (DEVE) coordinates delegations that address development issues. The delegation to the ACP Group of States is one of many delegations that work with DEVE.\n\n\n\nBefore a delegation meets with elected representatives from outside the EU, committees suggest political topics that the delegation could or should address. After the meeting, the chair of the delegation reports back to AFET.\n\n\n\nFocusing on democracy and human rights\n\n\n\nMany delegations also involve the European Parliament's Democracy and Elections Coordination Group (DEG) in their work. This body, headed by the chairs of the AFET and DEVE committees, oversees Parliament's efforts to strengthen democracy and human rights outside the EU.\n\n\n\nOne of the group's principal activities is organising election observation missions.\n\n\n\nBetween 10 and 12 times a year, MEPs travel to non-EU countries to observe voting processes. Their experience as elected representatives lends political credibility to their assessments.\n\n\n\nOther projects overseen by the DEG aim to help parliaments in non-EU countries grow stronger and achieve their full potential.\n\n\n\n'Friendship' and other unofficial groups\n\n\n\nMEPs occasionally form unofficial groups to discuss relations with non-EU countries.\n\n\n\nThese 'friendship groups', sometimes sponsored by lobbyists or foreign governments, are not official European Parliament organisations.\n\n\n\nIf these groups travel abroad, they have no official status, and the local EU offices therefore do not provide them with the assistance they offer to standing delegations. These groups do not coordinate with the committees and cannot speak on behalf of Parliament.\n\n\n\nMEPs who participate in these groups must be transparent about their status and avoid interfering with the work of Parliament's official bodies."}]}
