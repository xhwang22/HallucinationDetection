In the history of Tibetan Buddhism, various schools have formed different systems of learning and practicing, and have brought up a large number of knowledgeable Buddhists.\n\nAt around 5:30 pm, the Panchen Lama appeared and was welcomed by monks carrying censers in hands to the second floor facing a square full of people.\n\nAfter a chanting of sutras, he walked to his seat for the debate, the last one for him to get the highest degree after arduous learning for nearly 26 years.\n\nThe 11th Panchen Lama, with the secular name Gyaincain Norbu, was born in February 1990 in Lhari county, the city of Nagchu in northern Tibet.\n\nHe was approved by the central government as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama and was enthroned in 1995.\n\nFollowing the traditional sutras learning system of Tibetan Buddhism, the Panchen Lama began studying the Five Major Treatises in 1996 and passed two related examinations in 2002 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe debate on Tuesday was carried out in two rounds, each lasting about an hour. The Panchen Lama must either debate for or against a particular topic with three learned and respected gurus.\n\nDuring the debate, the Panchen Lama maintained his composure and spoke with a flow of eloquence, showing his sound logical thinking and proficiency in Buddhist classics.\n\n\"The procedure today was just like my examination for the Kachen degree years ago, and it strictly followed traditional rules and rituals,\" said Duoduo, a Kachen degree holder at Tashilhunpo Monastery and assistant to the sutras teacher of the Panchen Lama.\n\n\"The occasion is really special and a complete success,\" he said.\n\nAfter two hours of debate, the Panchen Lama was presented with a \"manzha,\" a kind of tribute Buddhist offering, and hadas, or silk scarves used by Tibetans to express respect and greeting, indicating that he passed the exam and attained the highest degree.\n\n\"The living Buddha (Panchen Lama) is intelligent and compassionate,\" said Salung Phunla, 78, a guru and the first director of the monastery's management committee.\n\n\"I hope that he will continue to study and practice Buddhist classics, inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and love for Buddhism of the Panchen Lamas, and make greater contribution to world peace and the well-being of all,\" Salung Phunla added.\n\nOver the past years, the 11th Panchen Lama has given head-touching blesses to over a million believers, and ardently participated in public welfare activities.\n\nHe is a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body.\n\nHe is also vice president of the Buddhist Association of China and president of the association's Tibet branch."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/cs/202104/t20210426_800244876.html", "page_content": "With a history of at least 600 years, Tibetan opera has been dubbed \u201cthe living fossil of traditional Tibetan culture.\u201d Having been inscribed on both the national intangible cultural heritage list of China and UNESCO\u2019s intangible cultural heritage list, the ancient opera has gained many modern devotees.\n\nOwing to local people\u2019s passion for the opera and government support in its preservation, this ancient cultural treasure continues to shine in modern times.\n\n\n\n\n\nNyima Tsering is a leading performer and promoter of Tibetan opera in Tashi Choten Village, Nedong County. He has been engaged in passing on the ancient cultural practice for more than 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegendary Evolvement\n\nTibetan opera, called Aje Lhamo (fairy sisters) in Tibetan language, boasts a history of more than 600 years, about 400 years longer than another well-known Chinese cultural treasure, the Peking opera.\n\nIn the 14th century, Drupthob Thangtong Gyalpo, a high-ranking monk and iron bridge builder, decided to build iron bridges across many key rivers in Tibet to improve local transportation.\n\nHe trekked all over Tibet to raise donations to fund the bridge projects. While on his travels he noticed that Tibetans all loved the local opera.\n\nTo collect more donations, he recruited seven beauties from Tibet\u2019s Qonggyai County to perform at his fundraising events. The girls were all good at traditional Tibetan style singing and dancing.\n\nThanks to the contribution of the seven girls, donations were easily raised wherever they put on a performance, and all the donations were used for bridge building, metal smelting, and labor costs.\n\nWith the proliferation of iron bridge construction, Thangtong Gyalpo and his performance troupe became famous, and officials across the region came to him for bridge orders. Tibetan opera is believed to have originated in this way, and thus Thangtong Gyalpo is considered the father of this art form.\n\nThangtong Gyalpo was a talented architect, metallurgist, and artist. During his reported 125-year life span, he constructed 58 iron-chain bridges in Tibet.\n\nToday, to honor him, a salute to his statue precedes each Tibetan opera performance, which usually concludes with the presentation of the hada (a traditional white ceremonial scarf representing purity and honesty) by the performers to audience members.\n\nDuring the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama in the 17th century, Tibetan opera was separated from religious rituals and became an independent dramatic form.\n\nGenerally, there are eight types of storylines about Tibetan opera practiced in different areas. They can be about Tibetan history, Buddhism, and ancient legends of heroes.\n\nAs an important Chinese cultural heritage, Tibetan opera is often performed at important national events, such as the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nA yellow mask used in the old-style Tibetan opera performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Unique Art Form\n\nTraditionally, the Tibetan opera theater was an open circular space sheltered by a canopy, with the stage defined by a magical circle and central altar.\n\nApart from the major events mentioned above, Tibetan opera is traditionally performed on many local occasions, such as Tibetan New Year, the Shoton Festival, horse races, harvest celebrations, or religious rituals.\n\nToday Tibetan opera does not necessarily require a fixed stage for performance. An open ground in the middle of a village, a clearing in a forest, inside a big tent or under a big canvas, can all be suitable to stage the art form. The opera also doesn\u2019t require stage settings or a curtain during the performance.\n\nA distinctive feature of Tibetan opera lies in the fact that it is performed with masks from the beginning to the end. The duration of performances varies from less than two hours to as long as seven days. Tibetan opera can generally be divided into the old school and the new school. The four most popular blue-mask sects, namely the opera troupes of Jormolung, Jongba, Shangpa, and Jangar, belong to the new school. The old school mainly refers to the white-mask sects, plus those of the yellow mask.\n\nTibetan opera is usually composed of three main parts, the prelude, the main body, and the conclusion. First, a narrator makes an opening statement to indicate that the performance has begun; second, all performers work closely to perform a story with songs and dances; third, the narrator makes a closing speech.\n\nTibetan opera incorporates more than 20 different singing tunes, as each tune represents a different gender, age, emotion, plot, and character.\n\nThe various dancing gestures include climbing, sailing, flying, sailing in the sea, horse riding, fighting evil, and paying homage to the Buddha.\n\nThere are usually 16 actors in a traditional Tibetan opera, made up of seven hunters, seven fairies, and two kings. It is believed that the 16 different figures originated from Chogyal Norsang, one of the eight traditional Tibetan opera storylines.\n\n\n\n\n\nTibetan opera has been very popular among local people in Tibet since its appearance. In the picture, Tibetan people throng around a performance venue, marveling at the riveting opera play.\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Development\n\nDespite the availability of multiple entertainment options in modern times, rural people in Lhokha are still fond of the ancient opera.\n\nTashi Choten Village in Nedong County of Lhokha City, Tibet Autonomous Region, is famous for its unique Tibetan opera, known as the Yarlung Tashi Sholpa, and the village is famed as the Opera Village. The Tashi Sholpa Tibetan opera is distinguished by actors wearing yellow masks.\n\nNyima Tsering is a leading performer and promoter of the opera form in Tashi Choten. He has been working hard to pass on the ancient cultural practice for more than 30 years.\n\nThe 49-year-old is the 11th generation of his family clan engaged in Tashi Sholpa Tibetan opera. Thanks to his efforts, he was accredited as a national-level inheritor of this intangible heritage in 2006.\n\n\u201cI have learned different singing tunes of different characters of the opera since I was a boy. I learned this from an old woman while we were herding together on the mountain,\u201d said Tsering.\n\n\u201cAt the age of 16, I was accepted by the opera troupe in our village, because I was very good at remembering all different types of opera scripts,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of performing with 16 actors like other opera schools, the Tashi Sholpa opera requires 14 performers. Five perform in the prelude, and the other nine people join the rest of the play from the main section to the conclusion. Tsering directs the opera and performs the role of the king.\n\n\u201cThe development and promotion of the opera, and the Tibet culture as a whole, is a great example of the benefits of the country\u2019s reform and opening-up policy, which was introduced in the late 1970s,\u201d said Tsering.\n\nAccording to him, there were only 16 opera actors in his village before 1968, and the opera troupe stopped performing for almost two decades afterward.\n\nFrom 1987, a new opera troupe was set up to revive the art form, and it has continued to grow through the efforts of Tsering during the last few decades. Now the village has 30 professional opera actors, including 16 males and 14 females. Aged between 22 and 51, they are all farmers from the village.\n\nThrough most of the last three decades, his village opera troupe had been playing only the yellow-masked opera of Chogyal Norsang.\n\nIn 2017, the opera troupe adopted for the first time another Tibetan opera school, the blue-masked opera, and since have successfully played Drowa Sangmo, another one of the eight traditional Tibetan opera storylines.\n\nIn 2020, they added the blue-masked Tibetan traditional opera Pema Wopar to their repertoire. The two newly added storylines are played by 16 actors. An important change is that the length of each performance has been shortened as modern audiences have increasingly shorter attention spans.\n\nAs per tradition, the opera in Tsering\u2019s village is performed during the New Year festival, harvest celebration rituals, various official events, and the annual Shoton Festival of Lhasa.\n\nTo assist with the continuation of opera preservation, the government began providing financial support, giving the troupe an annual subsidy of between RMB 40,000 and RMB 200,000, starting from 2011. According to Tsering, his county now has more than 150 opera actors in six opera troupes. Apart from his troupe, the other five all belong to the blue-mask school.\n\nAnother stimulus for the resurgence of the ancient opera in Tsering\u2019s village is tourism. The village has set up a performance team for tourists.\n\n\u201cOur village has become a tourist attraction now. Tourists come to our village because they love watching opera and traditional Tibetan dances and songs,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to the tourism industry, now each of our opera actors receives a monthly salary for their involvement, said Tsering, adding that many villagers have begun to operate family inns to accommodate tourists.\n\nTsering plans to bring Tibetan opera to more villages in Tibet. He also hopes that more people, especially the youth, will grow to love this ancient art form. He has been invited to teach opera in his village\u2019s primary school.\n\n\u201cI hope Tibetan opera will be practiced in more villages of Tibet, and the ancient cultural practice will continue to be a shining star in the modern world of art performance,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/religion/2017-04-20/2502.html", "page_content": "Tibetan Buddhism, also known as Lamaism, is a form of Mahayana Buddhism that developed in Tibet and spread to neighboring countries of the Himalayas.

Buddhism spread into Tibet in the 7th century, and gradually infiltrates Tibet's history, politics, economics, culture, exchanges and habits and customs to become the most extensively worshipped religion of Tibetans.\n\nSomeone think the Tibetan Buddhism is not an independent Buddhism system. They identify it as a mixture of the traditional Buddhism and the Bon religion. But in fact, it is a false perspective. Tibetan Buddhism contains the monks debating culture that is not existed in other religions. And the Buddhist figures in Tibetan Buddhism system are totally different in the appearances which may be a little frightening.\n\nThere are two definitions to explain Tibetan Buddhism. One refers to the Buddhism system which is formed in Tibetan regions and then has been spread over and influenced some neighbor districts such as Mongolia, Sikkim, Bhutan, etc. The other one refers to the Buddhism recorded and spread by Tibetan language, can be understood as the \u201cBuddhism in Tibetan language\u201d.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/religion/2015-12/10/content_100001712.html", "page_content": "Tibet commemorated the 20th anniversary of the enthronement of the 11th Panchen Lama[Photo/China Tibet Online]\n\nTibet on Tuesday commemorated the 20th anniversary of the enthronement of the 11th Panchen Lama Bainqen Erdini Qoigyijabu, a spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nZhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the Panchen Lama's residence in the city of Xigaze, basked in glory Tuesday morning as more than 1,500 Tibetan Buddhists and local people attended a ceremony that went on for more than three hours.\n\nThe Panchen Lama arrived in the monastery, 270 kilometers from the regional capital Lhasa, at 10 a.m. with attendant monks holding a yellow parasol over for him and blowing trumpets.\n\nThe Panchen Lama is the highest ranking lama after the Dalai in the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, the most influential of the four main schools.\n\nThe Panchen Lama recalled some of his experiences and thanked the government and senior monks for their help and care.\n\nHe called for Tibetan Buddhists to act with compassion and promote Buddhism that adapts to the times.\n\nGifts were presented by representatives from lamaseries, ranging from symbolic items like Buddha figurines, sutras and the holy pagoda to silk and satin.\n\nThe ceremony featured a heated debate between two high monks, a traditional royal dance by 7 young monks and a sutra chanting praying for peace and prosperity.\n\n\"The ceremony is not only a celebration of the Gelug school and the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, but also for the whole of Tibetan Buddhism,\" said Palden Donyo, a senior monk of the Sakya school.\n\nOfficials from the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, State Administration for Religious Affairs and the Tibet regional government took part in the ceremony.\n\nSita, vice minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, praised the Panchen Lama's achievements and hoped he would carry on the legacy of his predecessors and actively engage in incorporating Tibetan Buddhism into socialist society under the Buddhist principles of equality and compassion among all beings.\n\nGyaincain Norbu, born on February 13, 1990 in Lhari county, Nagqu prefecture in northern Tibet, was enthroned as the 11th Panchen Lama on Dec. 8, 1995 after a traditional lot-drawing ceremony in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.\n\nThe Panchen Lama currently serves as vice president of the Buddhist Association of China and a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, the country's top political advisory body.\n\nLIVING BUDDHA RESPECTED BY ALL\n\nTibetan Buddhism holds that the soul of a senior lama, or rinpoche (living Buddha), is reincarnated in the body of a child upon his death.\n\nThe 11th Panchen Lama was approved by the central government in November 1995 as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, who died in 1989, after the three candidates drew lots in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.\n\nIn minds of Tibetans, a blessing from the Panchen Lama can bring good fortune.

Spring is coming in Lasha. (Xinhua/Zhang Rufeng)\n\nTibet, a remote land in the midst of the Himalayan Mountains, has long been shrouded in mystery and myth.\n\nThe myth brew illusions that have been skillfully peddled for political purposes around the world by the Dalai Lama, the biggest serf owner in old Tibet, who has thus instilled lies into people's concepts, especially Westerners' concepts about Tibet.\n\nNow let's have a look at what a true Tibet is really like in the eyes of foreign scholars and experts who have conducted in-depth studies and extensive field researches about this mysterious land.\n\nLuxembourg scholar Albert Ettinger said that the picture painted by the Dalai Lama about Tibet for the rest of the world is twisted by lies.\n\n\"People in Western countries learn about Tibet dominantly from the media. However, large amounts of fiction about Tibet published in those countries have nothing to do with the reality of Tibet...They haven't made any factual research at all,\" said Ettinger, who had two books published in German -- \"Free Tibet? \" and \"Fight for Tibet\" -- in 2014 and 2015 respectively after six years of intensive study.\n\n\"For instance, the Dalai Lama said old Tibet was not perfect, it had problems but generally it was a good society,\" Ettinger said. \"I always laugh at that.\"\n\nMany facts mirror and confirm that old Tibet, a society of serfdom, was a poor ignorant feudal society ridden with problems such as violence, insults, sexual discrimination, he said.\n\nIn addition, \"the repression of Tibet's language and culture\" claimed by Dalai Lama is also a lie, Ettinger said. \"It can be seen nowadays that though pupils in Tibet's schools learn Chinese characters, Tibetan is still widely used among them as well.\"\n\nEchoing Ettinger's opinions, German sinologist and ethnologist Ingo Nentwig said that, when it comes to Tibet, \"what you hear about may be false, what you see is true.\"\n\nThe image of the traditional Tibetan society, which is far from reality, is widespread \"mainly due to the propaganda of Tibet separatists and gullible, ignorant journalists who are willing to redistribute this nonsense,\" Nentwig said.\n\nThe expert said the truth is the old Tibet was \"a society dominated by poverty, misery and violence, ruled by a degenerated system of political tyranny, an institutionalized embodiment of systematic injustice and inequality, in other words, a 'hell on Earth.'\"\n\nAnd for the German scholar, the so-called \"cultural genocide\" in Tibet is just nonsense.\n\n\"It is a fact that the Han ethnic group is the largest among the 56 ethnic groups in China. It's normal for China's modernization to have more or less some Han cultural elements. But the encounter of a variety of cultures actually benefits and inspires cultures of ethnic minorities,\" Nentwig said.\n\nA file photo shows Nyima Tsering reading books in his room at Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Aug. 16, 2015.

Tibetans now have perfect conditions to enjoy a full-blown spiritual life with their own language. This is indeed a great development,\" Nentwig said.\n\n\"For any culture, preservation for its own sake without renewal could only lead to its decay. For Tibetan culture, the encounter and exchange with cultures of all Chinese ethnic groups, including that of Han Chinese, just enables it to survive and prosper in the long term,\" Nentwig said.\n\nBelgian Tibetologist Andre Lacroix praised Tibet's development over the past decades, saying the region's living standards have improved a lot with \"indisputably huge\" progress being made.\n\n\"It (the Qinghai-Tibet railway launched in 2006) is an extraordinary project and it's really impressive. I think it's a win-win project, with which Tibet further develops and improves its economy, strengthens external exchanges and elevates living standards. The railway line has opened up areas isolated for centuries and helped promote responsible tourism as well.\"\n\n\"I think Tibetan culture is much less threatened than many other minority cultures in the world, because there are still some research institutes working on it,\" Lacroix said, refuting claims that the government was damaging Tibet's indigenous cultures.\n\n\"The Tibetan language is mandatory in primary schools.

The monastic nobility headed by the Dalai Lama controlled all land on behalf of the \"gods\". They monopolized the common wealth by exacting tribute and labor services from peasants and herders. This system was somewhat akin to how the medieval Catholic Church exploited peasants in feudal Europe.\n\nTibetan peasants and herders had little personal freedom. Without the permission of the priests, or lamas, they could not do anything. They were considered appendages to the monastery. The peasantry lived in dire poverty while enormous wealth accumulated in the monasteries and in the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa.\n\nIn 1956 the Dalai Lama, fearing that \"the Chinese central government would soon move on Lhasa,\" issued an appeal for gold and jewels to construct another throne for himself. This, he argued, would help rid Tibet of \"bad omens\". One hundred and twenty tons were collected. When the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he was preceded by more than 60 tons of treasure.\n\nWhat makes the \"colorful\" Dalai Lama more \"legendary\" is nothing more than his close links with the CIA.\n\nHis \"government\" set up in exile in India, at least until the 1970s, received $US1.7 million a year from the CIA.\n\nThe money was to pay for guerilla operations against the Chinese PLA, notwithstanding the Dalai Lama's public stance in support of non-violence, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nThe Dalai Lama himself was on the CIA's payroll from the late 1950s until 1974, reportedly receiving $US180,000 a year.\n\nBut apparently the guerrilla army never did more than engage in border skirmishing. As early as 1964, in fact, its effectiveness and efficiency were called into question by the CIA, which nevertheless stuck with the plan. Funds to pay this army were funnelled through the Dalai Lama and his organization, which received US$1.7 million a year, later reduced to $1.2 million. (Of this, the Dalai Lama himself was paid $186,000 a year.\n\nOne former CIA agent named Ralph McGehee, admittedly a professional thorn in the side of his former employer, alleged that the CIA has been a prime funder of the Dalai Lama's media profile as a symbol of \"meditative peace and Buddhist mindfulness.\"\n\nHowever, the romantic notions about the \"peaceful\" and \"harmonious\" Shangri-la the Dalai Lama has all along preached and boasted of should be tested against reality.\n\nWhen suddenly the words \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" entered the vocabulary of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile in India's Dharamsala, some Western media, so intoxicated, might have cheered for it.\n\nBut Dharamsala is by no means a Shangri-la, as where Dalai Lama's commitment to \"democracy\" seems weak.\n\nAn Office of Tibet document claims \"soon after His Holiness the Dalai Lama's arrival in India, he re-established the Tibetan Government in exile, based on modern democratic principles\". Yet it took more than 30 years for an Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies to be directly elected from among the 130,000 exiles. Of 46 assembly members, only 30 are elected. The other 16 are appointed by religious authorities or directly by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's proposals now amount to calling for negotiations with Beijing to allow him and his exiled government to resume administrative power in an \"autonomous\", albeit larger, Tibet.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's call for international pressure on Beijing seeks only to achieve this.\n\nThe political monk has since turned to the \"underground battle\", stealthily sowing discord between Tibetans and the Han Chinese and inciting ethnic hatred, while trotting globally and lobbying for international support.\n\nThe Tibetan people deserve due respect. But the Dalai clique and his \"government-in-exile\" can only be judged from their actions and, their willingness to tell the truth."}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/news/tibet/2022-04-08/7038.html", "page_content": "Thirteen monks were awarded the degree of Geshe Lharampa -- equivalent to a doctoral degree in modern education -- on Saturday in southwest China\u2019s Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThe awarding ceremony was held in the Jokhang Temple in downtown Lhasa, the regional capital.

Throughout history, it has always been regarded a sacred profession. TTM theories on Thangka scrolls, a traditional way of disseminating medical knowledge. In 1989, the Tibetan Traditional Medicine College was established in Lhasa. Though small in scale, the college focuses on systematically conserving and developing the ancient medical practice of TTM, marking a transition from individual master-disciple teaching to wider college education.\n\nAn Extensive and Profound Theory\n\nThe Tibetan Traditional Medicine College is the only public college specializing in TTM research and practice in China; its founding ushered in a new \u201cacademic\u201d era for the profession. As early as the 17th century, the Fifth Dalai Lama, giving priority to TTM, ordered the setting up of several medical schools \u2013 Drepung Monastery and the Potala Palace were among the institutions to have in-house colleges of this kind. His disciple Sangye Gyatso established a school in Chokpori Hill in 1969, which gave it a popular nickname, \u201cThe Hill of the Medicine God.\u201d The Fifth Dalai Lama and his disciples wrote books to disseminate TTM theories, thereby advancing the science to a higher level.\n\nThe Tibetan Traditional Medicine College aims to train students with modern equipment while revering the tradition. On entering the school, visitors will see the statue of Yuthok Yonten Gonpo (708-833), founder of TTM theory. He wrote Four Medical Tantras, which laid the foundation of this medical system.\n\nProfessor Mima, vice president of the Tibetan Traditional Medicine College, believes that it is its rich content that has allowed TTM to be learned and practiced for millennia. Thus far, Professor Mima said, TTM remains one of China\u2019s most complete and influential medical heritage, boasting a unique theoretical foundation, a complete scientific system and long-term clinical accumulation. TTM is based on the \u201cthree essence\u201d theory \u2013 breath, heat, and saliva/mucus \u2013 accompanying tree-like pictures illustrating the circulation of the three essences, and an advanced embryo theory that was put forward far earlier than modern medicine.\n\nMima is of the first generation of TTM undergraduates since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. Continuous study honed his skills and gave him an understanding of the profoundness of this ancient medicine. For example, he said, TTM illustrates internal organs and acupuncture points of the body in the form of Thangka, a traditional painting known for its complicated composition and bright colors. The weekly changes of an embryo are equally accurately presented and tally with modern medicine despite appearing hundreds of years earlier. \u201cIt is incredible. We don\u2019t know how our ancestors did it.\u201d\n\nThis is just part of the phenomena that remain under debate for contemporary researchers. And the development of the medicine has raised new questions. \u201cThere are so many things worth researching,\u201d said Mima. He holds firmly that this air of mystery is the reason TTM continues to attract students. \u201cStudents find that exploration in this subject is never-ending. And the things they have learned are very useful. These two factors generate interest in continuing to study TTM.\u201d\n\nNew Generation of an Ancient Profession\n\nTo date, 1,146 students are studying at the Tibetan Traditional Medicine College. The majority come from farmers\u2019 and herdsmen\u2019s families across Tibet. In their hometowns, medicine is commonly regarded a sacred profession and a much sought-after career path for children in the eyes of their parents.\n\nAfter five years of studying, graduates will go on to serve in cities and rural areas. \u201cI can say proudly that our graduates are the mainstay of the medical and health care provision of Tibet,\u201d said Mima.\n\nFor students and their families, a place at the Tibetan Traditional Medicine College is a precious opportunity. Throughout the campus, students can be seen clutching the thick volume of Four Medical Tantras and solemnly reciting it, even after class. This classical medicine literature, called \u201can unparalleled classic,\u201d is appreciated as the canon for all TTM practitioners. Every student must be able to recite it in time for acute scrutiny and testing each semester.\n\nGo Nationwide and Worldwide\n\n\u201cPreviously, our students were all Tibetans, without exception,\u201d said Mima, \u201cbut this had a negative effect on the promotion of the profession.\u201d In 2012, the college for the first time offered a marketing major, which took up an enrollment of Han people from all over the country. Mima believes that as well as expanding the majors on offer at the college, the move encouraged the meeting of minds among students. Even more importantly, it assembled a pool of talents for TTM to go countrywide and even worldwide. Mima called it \u201ca visionary action.\u201d\n\nStudents enrolled in the marketing course will spend the first two years studying basic TTM knowledge and Tibetan history and culture, and the following two years on marketing theory at Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the eastern province of Jiangxi. They will then head back to Tibet for the final year, which comprises an internship at a TTM hospital or pharmaceutical company. Mima believes that the mode combines theory and practice well, and will foster inter-disciplinary graduates.\n\nThe year 2014 saw the second session of the marketing major at the college. The 29 students were initially not familiar with TTM. \u201cAt the beginning, I assumed the major was about selling drugs,\u201d Ma Zhe admitted. He is from Heze in the eastern province of Shandong. But one year of studying equipped him with sound knowledge of the theories and ethics of TTM, somatology, the history of TTM pharmacy, and the history and culture of Tibet. Ma and his classmates were aware of the importance of understanding Tibetan history and culture in carrying forward TTM. \u201cHow can you propel the development of Tibetan medicine and pharmacy without knowing the historical and cultural background of the region?\u201d said He Qingxiu from Yibin, Sichuan Province. She is very proud of being part of the efforts to promote TTM, \u201cWe study this major to spread TTM,\u201d she said.\n\nIts high success rate in curing ailments has won TTM a good reputation in the students\u2019 hometowns by word of mouth. \u201cWe have completed rounds of successful marketing among relatives and friends,\u201d students quipped.\n\nProfessor Mima congratulates a new group of graduates.\n\nLiterature Conservation\n\nIn 2014, the Tibetan Traditional Medicine College compiled and published a series called Photocopies of Rare Books on China\u2019s Traditional Tibetan Medicine and Pharmacy, one of the largest undertakings in TTM literature protection since 1949. The college has initiated a 10-year project that aims to set up a world-level research center. It is expected to have the most complete body of TTM literature and the best research staff in Tibetan medicine as well as astronomy and calendar."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/ctenglish/2018/cs/202104/t20210426_800244878.html", "page_content": "In the western suburbs of Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province right at the foot of the Fengling Mountain lies the exquisite Labrang Monastery. A world renowned institution of higher learning for Tibetan Buddhism, it is one of six major monasteries of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn Qinghai Province, the waters of the Longwu River that flow through the province\u2019s southern part renew and nourish a mystical region called \u201cRebkong\u201d in Tibetan language. This artistically fertile land which is well known for thangka art is also the homeland of various beautiful ethnic cultures. The vibrant ambiance of Rebkong can be felt throughout the design and adornment of resplendent temples, study rooms containing multitudes of spiritual books, brightly lit thangka art studios, and abundant love by the local people for ethnic culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Donggi Conag Lake has the appearance of a blue mirror, reflecting beautiful displays of clouds and sunshine.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabrang Monastery\n\nThe name \u201cLabrang\u201d means \u201cmansion of the living Buddha master.\u201d It was built in 1709, the 48th year of the reign of Emperor Kangxi during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). More than just a singular temple building, it is a sprawling complex of buildings matched only by the Potala Palace of Lhasa. All together the monastery contains over 90 buildings with nearly 10,000 rooms, including six colleges, 16 Buddha halls, 18 Nangchen (living quarters of the living Buddhas), living quarters for monks, platforms for teaching Buddhist sutra, a sutra printing house, pagodas, and over 24,000 Buddha statues. At the peak of its glory, over 4,000 monks resided here, and it was the political, religious, and cultural center of the region sharing borders with the neighboring provinces of Qinghai and Sichuan.\n\nThe longest corridor of prayer wheels in the world is located here, having over 2,000 prayer wheels that extend a distance of 3.5 kilometers around the entire monastery. To complete a whole round of spinning each prayer wheel takes at least one hour, making it a sight to behold. Prayer wheels here are different from those metal prayer wheels seen in other places, being that they are made of wood and painted in various bright colors. The weather-beaten prayer wheels match the sincere faces of the devoted believers that spin them, leaving a deep impression on the observer.\n\nLabrang Monastery is also an institution of higher learning for Tibetan Buddhism in the northwestern region of China. It is composed of six colleges: Mejung Tosam Ling, Lower Tantric College, Upper Tantric College, Medical College, Kalachakra College, and Hevajra College. We visited three of these colleges. According to the Akar (an epithet for monks), our tour guide, anyone can apply to study at the monastery with no prerequisite classes required. As long as the family of the student applying to study there approves of their decision, the student is welcome. After 15 years of studying, students can graduate from the monastery after taking part in a final examination which consists of different kinds of debates over the interpretation of sutra.\n\nLocated in the center of the monastery is the Mejung Tosam Ling, the first and largest of the six colleges for the study of sutra and debate. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty named it \u201cHuijue Temple\u201d and gave it a wooden plaque with those characters inscribed on it. The architectural style of this building is a fusion of ancient Chinese imperial architecture and traditional Tibetan architecture. Its roof is covered with various decorations such as refined golden steel tiles, copper goats, Dharma wheels, banners, and treasured vases. The main hall is 100 meters wide and 75 meters deep, supported by 117 pillars, and can accommodate 3,000 people at the same time. It has no windows, relying on hundreds of butter lamps for illumination. Each pillar is covered with an ornate column sleeve, and elaborately embroidered images of Buddha are hung between the pillars. Large frescos line both sides of the main hall, depicting Dharma protectors and 500 paintings of the Buddha. In the main sutra chanting hall are placed enshrined statues of Emperor Taizong (598-649) of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Tibetan prince Songtsen Gampo (617-650), and the founder of the monastery the First Jamyang Zhepa. On the top of this hall is a showroom displaying various magnificent priceless cultural relics.\n\nShouxi Temple is the largest prayer hall at the Labrang, comprising of six stories and reaching 20 meters high. The top of the temple is designed with a palace square kiosk, has overhanging eaves at the four corners, and is decorated with various kinds of ornaments that include refined golden cylinders with lions, dragons, treasured vases, Dharma wheels, and so on. The golden Buddha statue inside the temple that stands 10 meters high was originally designed by a Nepali craftsman. Another treasure collected in the Shouxi Temple is Ganzhujing (Ganzhu Scriptures) written with unique golden and silver ink.\n\nWithin the depository, Buddhist sutra and texts are placed on a long rows of shelves which reach as high as the ceiling. Classic books are kept on the shelves wrapped in satin cloth, including the Tibetan Tripitaka which contains more than 200 volumes. This depository collects over 65,000 scrolls and 7,000 other engraved wood blocks. The vast diversity of Tibetan written materials here is one of the Labrang\u2019s major features, and it has had a significant impact on the Lama monasteries throughout China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labrang Monastery is a large institution of higher learning for Tibetan Buddhism. In this open plaza, monks often hold debates on the interpretation of sutras, a very important part of their education.\n\n\n\n\n\nStunning Views of the Donggei Cuona Lake\n\nAfter a busy day of touring temples, we arrived at the county seat of Darlag, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province in the evening. We were first greeted by the joyous melodies from the Zhumu Square where local residents often gather to enjoy evening activities including dancing. Another enjoyable activity is watching the sunset over the wetlands from the hill in the Gesar Linka Scenic Area behind the square. I drove the car along the small road up to the top of the hillside. But unfortunately the cloud was so thick that we were unable to experience the sunset. The net-like water distribution system here that is usually visible was almost obscured due to the recent rains that made the water overflow the divisions in the fields. Nevertheless, from the hill we enjoyed a panoramic view of the whole Darlag county town.\n\nDonggei Cuona Lake is located in the Madoi County basin in northwest Golog at an elevation of 4,082 meters. It covers an area of 232.2 square kilometers with a maximum water depth of 48 meters. It is an inland saltwater lake that is similar to but not as big as Qinghai Lake. The surface of the lake seems to be always shimmering in the light. There are rolling mountains on one side of the lake and flat grassland on the other side. Looking down at the lake from a high vantage point is stunning. Though no doubt the black-headed gulls flying overhead would have the best views; after all, they are indigenous to the region and must have chosen to live near this lake for its beauty.\n\n\n\n\n\nA flock of black-headed gulls play on the Donggi Conag Lake.\n\n\n\n\n\nSacred and Holy Rebkong Thangka Art\n\nMoving on, we came across a Tibetan restaurant called Muthak Manor in an ordinary alley in Tongren County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai. When we looked at the Longwu River from the restaurant\u2019s observation deck, we could see that it has an inseparable relationship with the well-known \u201cRebkong Art.\u201d The little known Longwu River flowing through the remote mountain valleys of southern Qinghai refreshes and nourishes this magical land called Rebkong by the locals.\n\nThe Rebkong art that originated here is an important part of Chinese Tibetan Buddhist art and a genre that has an extensive range of influence. There is a large concentration of artists here who are engaged in creating folk Buddhist paintings and sculptures and have exquisite painting skills, which is rarely seen in other Tibetan areas. Because of its uniqueness, this area is known as the \u201chometown of Tibetan painters.\u201d Thangka painting has become the main source of livelihood for local residents.\n\nWe walked along the Longwu River, reaching Wutunxia Temple. When this temple was first built, it belonged to a small temple of the Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism. Later, it was called \u201cMagong Niangwa,\u201d which means \u201cancient mother temple.\u201d In the mid-17th century, a temple called Toumao Monastery was built and revered by the people in the upper and lower Wutunsi villages. The site of the temple was hit by a landslide, leading to the merge of Toumao and Magong Niangwa and the merged one was called Wutunxia Temple. The temple\u2019s winding prayer wheel corridor and pagodas are all painted with exquisite patterns. The design features superb color coordination and is resplendently decorated.\n\nAs we entered a nearby village, the front door of each dwelling were decked out in artwork. When we approached a Tibetan house, three painters were at work drawing thangkas that were vivid and exquisite. The host said that it takes two people painting for three months to complete a usual thangka \u2014 amazing pieces of artwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nA thangka artist is focused on the details of his work.\n\nMaking a traditional thangka painting requires adherence to strict requirements and complicated procedures. They must be carried out in strict accordance to the rituals written in the Buddhist scriptures and rules of the experienced masters, including a series of procedures ranging from pre-painting rituals, canvas making, drafting the composition, making the colors and dyes, contouring and drawing, inlaying gold and silver, mounting frames, to making seams. Painting a thangka may take anywhere from half a year to 10 years to complete.\n\nTraditionally, the pigments used to make thangka art are all precious minerals such as gold, silver, pearls, agates, coral, turquoise, malachite, and cinnabar along with plants like saffron, rhubarb, and blue indigo, thus reflecting the sacredness of the art. As a result of using raw materials, it ensures that the colors of thangka paintings will remain bright and fresh even with the passing of hundreds of years.\n\nThe beauty that has been appreciated at Gannan, Golog and Huangnan is the kind that remains etched into the beholder\u2019s memories forever."}], "The Third Dalai Lama is credited with unifying the political and spiritual authority of Tibet.": [{"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/tourism/2017-10/11/content_747947.htm", "page_content": "A Mystical Metropolis on the Snowy Plateau\n\nLHASA, the 1,400-year-old capital of Tibet Autonomous Region located in its southeast, is among the world\u2019s highest-altitude cities. The region\u2019s political, economic, cultural, and religious center, Lhasa, which in the Tibetan language means Sacred City, is the starting point for tours of Tibet, and has become even more popular since the modernization of its infrastructure. But these advances in no way encroach upon Lhasa\u2019s sun-bathed, snow-capped mountains and grasslands, pristine air, ancient beliefs, and serene lifestyle. Whether in the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, Norbulingka or Barkhor Street, Lhasa offers ample sources of sustenance for the soul.\n\nSongtsen Gampo and Princess Wencheng\n\nClans and tribes, large and small, appeared on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau around the first century AD. After years of war, they merged and united to form a tribal alliance. In the year 632, Songtsen Gampo built a fortress in the wilderness, cleared river routes, and constructed monasteries, so laying the foundations for Lhasa, and established the powerful Tubo Kingdom.\n\nBarkhor Street preserves the traditional features and lifestyle of the ancient city.\n\nTo consolidate his rule, Songtsen Gampo sought an alliance with Tang Dynasty Emperor Gaozu of the Central Plains area. This he achieved through his marriage to Princess Wencheng, the emperor\u2019s daughter. Soon after he built the Potala Palace in Lhasa, on Mount Maburi. During the later decline of the Tubo Kingdom the palace was destroyed in successive years of war and natural disasters. Today\u2019s Potala Palace was rebuilt on the original site.\n\nThe Jokhang Temple was constructed around the same time as the old Potala Palace. It is said that Sakyamuni the Buddha opposed idolatry and the building of temples and statues, but eventually assented to statues of him at three different ages, and personally painted pictures in this respect. Among the statues of Buddha, the gilded bronze one of the 12-year-old Sakyamuni created in India is considered the finest. Princess Wencheng brought it with her to Tibet from the Central Plains area of China, and placed it in Jokhang Temple. The statue is priceless, not only by virtue of its historical value and as a cultural relic, but because Buddhists believe that beholding this image is equivalent to seeing the Buddha in his original incarnation 2,500 years ago.\n\nThere exist many historical accounts and folk legends about Princess Wencheng\u2019s journey to Tibet and what she accomplished there. They show that the princess was indeed committed to exchanges and communications between the Tubo Kingdom and the Tang Dynasty, and that she was integral to the development of the friendship between the two. This cultured and knowledgeable princess exerted tremendous influence on Tibet\u2019s openness. This is apparent in her recommendation to Songtsen Gampo that the children of Tubo nobles be sent to the Tang capital to study and acquire the Han\u2019s advanced knowledge and culture.\n\nStage photo of the large-scale epic drama Princess Wencheng.\n\nPrincess Wencheng not only introduced to Tibet Tang milling and pottery techniques, medicine, agriculture, and textiles, but also Buddhist scriptures, and books on medicine, history and agriculture, among others. She thus helped to advance Tibet\u2019s economy and culture, and her memory is consequently loved and respected by the Tibetan people in the many temples dedicated to her.\n\nLhasa and Buddhism Lhasa is a city of temples.\n\nLocal residents and pilgrims walk the streets of Lhasa, spinning its many prayer wheels. Their devotions evoke a feeling of deep humility. Pilgrims from afar making their sacred journey to the holy city of Lhasa prostrate themselves every few steps of the way as the ultimate expression of their devoutness. Worshipping at Jokhang Temple is their lifelong wish.\n\nIn the 13th century, the central government of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) incorporated Tibet into its unified territory, and gradually strengthened the region\u2019s local authority. In the mid-17th century, Qing Emperor Shunzhi officially conferred on Lobsang Gyamco the title of the 5th Dalai Lama, so establishing a theocratic feudal serfdom with Lhasa as its capital, and strengthening the Dalai Lama\u2019s Gelug Sect. Lhasa has since remained the capital of Tibet.\n\nIn 1645, the 5th Dalai Lama rebuilt the Potala\u2019s White Palace and made it his living quarters and place of work. After completion of the pagoda containing the 13th Dalai Lama\u2019s remains in 1936, the Potala Palace was expanded to its present scale. The 5th Dalai Lama also expanded the Jokhang Temple, an important monastery under the jurisdiction of the local government of Tibet, and site of its administrative offices. The Golden Urn, from which lots are customarily drawn to select the living Buddha, is housed in Jokhang Temple, where the ceremony to choose the current 11th Panchen Lama Gyaincain Norbu in 1995 is held.\n\nThere are now more than 200 temples in the city of Lhasa. Since 1980, the state has invested heavily in the maintenance of 97 ancient edifices in the city, including Jokhang Temple and the Potala Palace.\n\nA \u201cHeavenly Road\u201d on the Plateau\n\nLhasa is on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau \u2013 the world\u2019s highest. Owing to its remote location and consequently difficult logistics, local residents were until recent times firmly entrenched in the region\u2019s autarkic manorial economy. In 1949 Tibet had just one one-km-long surfaced road. American travel writer Paul Theroux wrote in his book Sailing Through China: \u201cThe Kunlun Mountains preclude any railway to Lhasa.\u201d\n\nNight scene of the Potala Palace.\n\nIn the 1950s, the central government nevertheless decided to build a railway to Lhasa. In 1956, the Ministry of Railways carried out a comprehensive survey of Tibet to work out the planning and design for this task. After decades of research and debates, in June 2001, the railway connecting Golmud in Qinghai to Lhasa started construction. Its main obstacles were permafrost, a cold and anoxic environment, and fragile ecology. Having overcome all three, in July 2006 the railway started operation.\n\nThe Qinghai-Tibet Railway, with a total length of 1,956 kilometers, is the first railway to Lhasa and the world\u2019s highest, which is why it is known as the \u201cHeavenly Road.\u201d The railway goes through the Hoh Xil, Sanjiangyuan, Qiangtang and other national nature reserves. To protect the plateau\u2019s blue skies, clear lakes, and wildlife, the State Environmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Land and Resources, and Ministry of Railways formed a joint expert group on preserving the ecological environment.\n\nAfter in-depth research, the team formulated specific environmental protection measures. To protect the living environment of wildlife such as the Tibetan antelope, the railway established 33 wildlife channels, and to preserve wetlands it constructed the first man-made wetland in the alpine region. In efforts to protect the landscape, achieve zero emissions, and improve the ecological environment along the railway, it also built a green corridor that stretches for hundreds of kilometers. These unique environmental designs, construction and operation concepts render the Qinghai-Tibet Railway China\u2019s first \u201cgreen railway.\u201d\n\nThere are other choices of transport to Tibet in addition to the railway, notably by road. China National Geography magazine called the Sichuan-Tibet Highway one of the best sightseeing routes in China. It provides a breathtakingly beautiful, ever-changing landscape from the Chengdu Plain to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the chance to experience four seasons in one day. People walk, ride and drive along this road.\n\nLhasa Today\n\nConvenient transportation has provided the conditions necessary for Lhasa\u2019s development.\n\nHistorical records show that Lhasa\u2019s urban area in 1950 covered less than three square kilometers, and had only 30,000 residents. The city had neither water-supply lines nor sewers, and none of the roads was surfaced. Groups of girls fetched water in wooden pails from the foot of Chakpori Mountain and the Lhasa River every morning.\n\nVisitors watch a ceremony at Drepung Monastery in Lhasa.\n\nAt the end of 2012, Lhasa invested about RMB 1.5 billion in preserving the old city. After six months of construction, the circumambulation paths around the Jokhang Temple had been widened, and vendors on Barkou Street no longer traded outdoors. The backward municipal infrastructure was modified, and streets and lanes in the old city were made neat and orderly.\n\nUrban planning continues to enlarge the city of Lhasa. Its 60-sq-km area is 20 times larger than it was decades ago. The city region straddles the Lhasa River, making it Lhasa\u2019s second administrative district. There are 100 or so inns and restaurants along the riverside, whose banks are also venues for drama performances such as that paying tribute to Princess Wencheng. Having debuted in August 2013, the play is now synonymous with the city.\n\nToday, with the Potala Palace at its core, row upon row of high-rise buildings dotted with gardens have formed a modern city. Its flourishing hotels, banks, shopping malls, and designer shops make one forget Lhasa\u2019s remote location on a snow plateau. The popularity of mobile phones and Internet also connects the city with the world outside.\n\nWalking along the bustling Barkhor Street, and seeing devout believers in the Potala Palace square, one will be touched by the sincerity of the people\u2019s faith. Spinning prayer wheels, listening to the sounds of the city from a teahouse on a sunny afternoon, or strolling along the Lhasa River make it impossible not to fall in love with Lhasa."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/culture/2017-07/31/content_744393.htm", "page_content": "Celebrating the Yogurt Festival\n\nACCORDING to the Tibetan calendar, the Shoton Festival is traditionally celebrated from the end of the sixth month to the beginning of the seventh month in areas inhabited by people of Tibetan ethnicity, such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Following the Tibetan New Year, the Shoton Festival is one of the most important festivals for Tibetans. In the Tibetan language, \u201cShoton\u201d means \u201cyogurt banquet\u201d; therefore, the festival is also known as the Yogurt Festival. During the celebration, people can watch Tibetan Opera and worship giant Buddha images painted on Thangka scrolls. As such, the festival is also called the \u201cFestival of Tibetan Opera\u201d and the \u201cSunning of the Buddha.\u201d\n\nTibetan Opera is a performance art which combines drama, dance, music, and rhyming lines. Performers dance and sing to extend their propitious wishes to the audience.\n\nThe traditional Shoton Festival celebrations start with the ceremony of the Sunning of the Buddha and feature activities such as Tibetan Opera performances, horse shows, and yak racing. The celebrations are normally held in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. During the festival, Norbulingka and its surrounding woods resemble a newly built city with colorful tents, bustling streets, and busy markets. Everyone sings and dances passionately, with the accompanying music played on Tibetan musical instruments. These are the most vibrant days for local Tibetan people.\n\nThe Shoton Festival was officially added to China\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2006.\n\nOrigin and Development\n\nThe Shoton Festival originated in the middle of the 11th century as a purely religious activity.\n\nIt is said that a major taboo of Buddhism is to kill living beings. However, as the weather begins to grow warm in the summer, the trees and grass start to grow and hibernating insects wake up. As such, it\u2019s difficult to avoid killing these small creatures when the monks walk outside the monastery. Therefore, the Gelug, one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, stipulated that monks must stay in monasteries for studying and worship from the fourth to sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, and are only allowed to go outside at the end of the sixth month. On the day the ban is lifted, the monks go out and travel down the mountains. People make yogurt and hold banquets for the visiting monks, during which they can also appreciate Tibetan Opera performances. This marks the origin of the Shoton Festival.\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival.\n\nBy the second half of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, the theocratic system had been strengthened in Tibet, as the Qing imperial government formally granted the fifth generation of Dalai, then leader of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the title \u201cDalai Lama,\u201d and gave the fifth generation of Panchen the title \u201cPanchen Erdeni.\u201d In 1642, the Gelug sect wielded the power and the fifth Dalai Lama became leader of the then theocratic Tibet. The Drepung Monastery where he lived became the political, religious, and cultural center of Tibet. On the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, thousands of Buddhists swarmed into the monastery to offer yogurt to the Dalai Lama and monks, asking for blessings of longevity, good harvest, and to not go to hell after they die. The nearby troupes also put on performances such as Tibetan Opera and a yak show. As time went by, more activities have been held, making Shoton a grand festival.\n\nAccording to historical records, the fifth Dalai Lama would personally watch the Tibetan Opera on the day of the festival. That same day, another spiritual leader dubbed the \u201ciron rod\u201d lama would take office. The \u201ciron rod\u201d lama was responsible for making sure every monk observed the rules and prohibitions and managed the monks in the monastery and Dratsang (a school in the monastery for monks to study Buddhist doctrine). His title was derived from the fact that he often brought an iron rod with him when inspecting the monastery.\n\nThe inclusion of the Tibetan Opera in the Shoton Festival signifies the religious event gradually evolved into cultural and entertainment activities. However, the celebration was still confined inside the monastery, with the Drepung Monastery as the center. Therefore, the festival was also called Drepung Shoton Festival.\n\nAfter the white palace of the Potala Palace were finally built, the fifth Dalai Lama moved there from the Drepung Monastery. The following generations of Dalai Lama all settled in the Potala Palace, where they lived and carried out religious activities, making the palace a sacred place for lamas and Buddhists to pay homage. When celebrating the Shoton Festival, the joint performance of Tibetan Opera was first carried out in the Drepung Monastery, and then in the Potala Palace for the Dalai Lama.\n\nA giant Thangka is carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside, where it is finally unfolded and displayed.\n\nThe seventh Dalai Lama suffered from many illnesses in his later years. The physicians advised him to live in Norbulingka and have a bath there with running water to preserve his health. Following this advice, he stayed in Norbulingka every summer until he passed away. By the period of the eighth Dalai Lama, the construction of Kelzang Podrang Palace was completed in Norbulingka and has gradually become the de facto summer palace for Dalai Lamas. Therefore, the main venue for celebrating the Shoton Festival was transferred to Norbulingka and ordinary people have been allowed to enter to watch Tibetan Opera performances. In this way, the Shoton Festival has gradually become a festival for everyone.\n\nSince 1959, when the democratic reform was conducted in Tibet, the Shoton Festival celebrations have been further enriched. During the festival, residents near Lhasa City gather together to go to Norbulingka, bringing barley wines and their luggage. In addition to local Tibetan Opera troupes, other troupes from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan all come to Lhasa to exchange experiences, with an aim to improve their performance skills. Moreover, many song and dance troupes come to put on their performances, making the event even more exciting. Businessmen also seize the opportunity to promote their goods, while still meeting the needs of visitors. The government departments and public institutions in Tibet also organize large-scale song and dance performances, as well as academic symposiums during the Shoton Festival.\n\nSunning of the Buddha\n\nThe Sunning of the Buddha, also known as the Buddha-basking Ceremony, is the most eye-catching prelude to the Shoton Festival. Every year on the last day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, Buddhists display the giant Thangka of Great Buddha on the hillside of the Drepung Monastery for tourists and devout believers to worship.\n\nThe Drepung Monastery was built in 1416 by Tsong Khapa\u2019s fourth disciple Jamyang Choskyi. Tsong Khapa is the founder of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Now, the 250,000-square-meter monastery is the biggest Buddhist temple in Tibet, with a 4,500-square-meter architectural complex of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, Buddhas of Three Periods Hall, Four Dratsangs, and Gaden Podrang Hall. All these buildings are surrounded by white exterior walls which look like large piles of rice from a distance, and thus the monastery was named \u201cDrepung,\u201d meaning \u201cpiles of rice\u201d in the Tibetan language.\n\nOriginating from the period of the fifth Dalai Lama, the Buddha-basking Ceremony in the Drepung Monastery usually starts before daybreak when disciples and visitors converge from all directions onto the solemn and respectful square of the Tsochin Assembly Hall, waiting patiently for the sacred ceremony.\n\nAt dawn, guided by Buddhists holding ritual instrument in hands, the giant Thangka in the monastery will be carried by scores of lamas all the way to the big platform built along the hillside to finally unfold and display. Crowds of people immediately make way for the Great Buddha, soon converging and then joining the long queue walking forward. The participation in the transportation of the Thangka with Buddha Sakyamuni\u2019s image is such an honor, that even people far away will throw different colors of Khada, a brightly colored scarf, and mascots to show their homage and blessing.\n\nIn the first ray of sunshine, as the blaring horn and scripture reciting goes on, a huge figure of Sakyamuni embroidered in color is gradually unfolded on the cliffs, approximately six or seven stories high, showcasing a solemn and peaceful countenance of the Great Buddha. Then, followers will begin to worship and present Khada, and pray for safety, happiness, and fortune.\n\nThe ceremony lasts for the whole morning and at around 2 pm, the giant Thangka will be cautiously rolled up and escorted back to the Drepung Monastery, to wait for next year\u2019s Shoton Festival.\n\n\u2013 Gala in Norbulingka Most activities of the Shoton Festival are celebrated in Norbulingka in the western suburb of Lhasa. In the Tibetan language, \u201cNorbulingka\u201d means \u201ctreasure garden.\u201d Norbulingka Park used to be the Summer Palace of Dalai Lama. At each year\u2019s Shoton Festival, people will get together with family members in Norbulingka, set up colorful tents and carpets, and bring beverages and delicacies to enjoy the blissful time. Under the straight white poplars, on the green grassland, along the river bank, Tibetan people with flamboyant costumes sitting in groups of three or five can be seen everywhere, singing, dancing, drinking, or playing chess. Tibetan Opera shows are performed on the second day of the Shoton Festival, at which point Opera troupes will continually sing every morning from 11 am until night falls. Besides the traditional Buddha display, the Shoton Festival is now more enjoyable with art shows, horse races, hiking conventions around the Namtso Lake, and a \u201cShoton Star\u201d singer contest; in addition, business negotiations, merchandise exhibitions, tourism and entertainment are all included. \u2013 Thangka Thangka is a scroll painting with Tibetan Buddha images on silk, often kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, with a further silk cover on the front. Tibetan history, politics, culture, and social life can all be depicted on this scroll in a religious and ethnic style. Thangka, passed down from generation to generation, are all made from precious materials such as gold, silver, pearl, agate, coral, turquoise, malachite, and cinnabar; and are painted with herbal dyes made from saffron, Chinese rhubarb, and indigo. The natural materials ensure that bright colors don\u2019t fade after hundreds of years. The process to make a Thangka is often complicated and adheres to a series of strict standards, including the painting prelude, canvas making, picture composition, coloring and dyeing, drawing the outline, dyeing the gold and silver colors, highlighting eyes on the countenance, and stitching brocade; and then the Thangka must be blessed by eminent monks. The whole process will take at least half a year, while some complicated ones need more than 10 years. \u2013 Tibetan Opera The Tibetan Opera usually has three main parts: a prelude, an episodic show, and an ending ceremony. In the prelude dance, characters perform paying homage to deities, praying, blessing, and give a brief introduction to the plot; the episodic show presents the audience with different stories in various performance forms, from singing and dancing to rhyming lines and monologue; while in the ending ceremony, as drums and cymbals play, all performers will dance and sing and at the same time, extend their propitious wishes to the audience."}, {"url": "http://en.youth.cn/Inter_Channel/Top_News/201207/t20120702_2246463.htm", "page_content": "Not a \"spiritual leader,\" but a political figure clad in kasaya.\n\nPerhaps, the followers and supporters of the 14th Dalai Lama have seldom questioned the role of the political monk in essence in Tibetan history, nor realized what it would mean for the Tibetan people if the Dalai Lama and his clique returned to power.\n\nThe memory should unfold from 1959, in the year the Dalai Lama fled China and went into exile in India, where he set up a state apparatus called \"Tibetan government-in-exile\" run by aristocratic, nepotistic monks that collected taxes, jailed and tortured dissenters and engaged in all the usual political intrigues.\n\nWas this a myth? The monastic nobility headed by the Dalai Lama controlled all land on behalf of the \"gods\". They monopolized the common wealth by exacting tribute and labor services from peasants and herders. This system was somewhat akin to how the medieval Catholic Church exploited peasants in feudal Europe.\n\nTibetan peasants and herders had little personal freedom. Without the permission of the priests, or lamas, they could not do anything. They were considered appendages to the monastery. The peasantry lived in dire poverty while enormous wealth accumulated in the monasteries and in the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa.\n\nIn 1956 the Dalai Lama, fearing that \"the Chinese central government would soon move on Lhasa,\" issued an appeal for gold and jewels to construct another throne for himself. This, he argued, would help rid Tibet of \"bad omens\". One hundred and twenty tons were collected. When the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, he was preceded by more than 60 tons of treasure.\n\nWhat makes the \"colorful\" Dalai Lama more \"legendary\" is nothing more than his close links with the CIA.\n\nHis \"government\" set up in exile in India, at least until the 1970s, received $US1.7 million a year from the CIA.\n\nThe money was to pay for guerilla operations against the Chinese PLA, notwithstanding the Dalai Lama's public stance in support of non-violence, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\nThe Dalai Lama himself was on the CIA's payroll from the late 1950s until 1974, reportedly receiving $US180,000 a year.\n\nBut apparently the guerrilla army never did more than engage in border skirmishing. As early as 1964, in fact, its effectiveness and efficiency were called into question by the CIA, which nevertheless stuck with the plan. Funds to pay this army were funnelled through the Dalai Lama and his organization, which received US$1.7 million a year, later reduced to $1.2 million. (Of this, the Dalai Lama himself was paid $186,000 a year.\n\nOne former CIA agent named Ralph McGehee, admittedly a professional thorn in the side of his former employer, alleged that the CIA has been a prime funder of the Dalai Lama's media profile as a symbol of \"meditative peace and Buddhist mindfulness.\"\n\nHowever, the romantic notions about the \"peaceful\" and \"harmonious\" Shangri-la the Dalai Lama has all along preached and boasted of should be tested against reality.\n\nWhen suddenly the words \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" entered the vocabulary of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile in India's Dharamsala, some Western media, so intoxicated, might have cheered for it.\n\nBut Dharamsala is by no means a Shangri-la, as where Dalai Lama's commitment to \"democracy\" seems weak.\n\nAn Office of Tibet document claims \"soon after His Holiness the Dalai Lama's arrival in India, he re-established the Tibetan Government in exile, based on modern democratic principles\". Yet it took more than 30 years for an Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies to be directly elected from among the 130,000 exiles. Of 46 assembly members, only 30 are elected. The other 16 are appointed by religious authorities or directly by the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's proposals now amount to calling for negotiations with Beijing to allow him and his exiled government to resume administrative power in an \"autonomous\", albeit larger, Tibet.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's call for international pressure on Beijing seeks only to achieve this.\n\nThe political monk has since turned to the \"underground battle\", stealthily sowing discord between Tibetans and the Han Chinese and inciting ethnic hatred, while trotting globally and lobbying for international support.\n\nThe Tibetan people deserve due respect. But the Dalai clique and his \"government-in-exile\" can only be judged from their actions and, their willingness to tell the truth."}, {"url": "http://en.youth.cn/news/china/200811/t20081111_820574.htm", "page_content": "China said Monday that no concessions would be made on issues concerning the national sovereignty following talks between central government officials and private envoys of the Dalai Lama. \"The unification of the motherland, territorial integrity and the national dignity are the greatest interests of the Chinese people. We will never make a concession,\" Zhu Weiqun, executive vice minister of the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, told reporters.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's private representatives, Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, were in China from October 31 to November 5, during which period Zhu, UFWD Vice Minister Sita and Executive Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Pelma Trilek held talks with them.\n\nDu Qinglin, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also met with them.\n\nThis is the ninth round of talks between Chinese central government officials and the Dalai Lama's private envoys since 2002 and the third round of talks this year.\n\nZhu admitted contacts and talks \"failed to make progress\". He said the Dalai Lama side should \"shoulder full responsibility for that\".\n\nAsked to comment on the reports in which the Dalai Lama said he would not follow a so-called \"middle way\" if the talks failed, Zhu said the claim of \"middle way\" aimed at outright Tibetan independence and thus unacceptable to the central government.\n\nThe Dalai Lama put forward the idea of \"middle way\" in the 1980s.\n\nZhu said the Dalai Lama explained the approach many times, including in the \"five-point peace plan\" in 1987, the \"seven-point new suggestions\" in 1988 and a \"Memorandum\" tabled to the central government by his private representatives during the recent talks.\n\nZhu said those remarks and documents showed that the Dalai Lama's \"middle way\" had five basic features. \"The first is that the Dalai Lama does not acknowledge that Tibet is part of China since ancient times.\"\n\n\"The Dalai Lama said on many occasions that when the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered Tibet, Tibet was an independent country and now Tibet is still an independent country, which was illegally occupied,\" Zhu said.\n\nHe said it is known to all people with some historical knowledge that the Chinese central authorities have exerted undisputable and effective administration over Tibet since the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).\n\n\"By denying China's sovereignty over Tibet, the Dalai Lama is seeking a legal basis for his activities of 'Tibet independence', 'semi-independence and 'independence in a disguised form',\" Zhu said.\n\n'Secondly, the Dalai Lama is scheming for a 'Greater Tibet', which has never existed,\" he said.\n\nZhu said the so-called \"Greater Tibet\" included not only the whole Tibet Autonomous Region, but also a large territory of Qinghai Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gannan in Gansu Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze and Aba in Sichuan Province, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Deqen in Yunnan Province and some other areas.\n\n\"In total, it covers one fourth of China's entire territory,\" Zhu said.\n\nZhu said Tibetan areas outside Tibet had never been under the administration of Tibet's local government. When Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951, the jurisdiction of the local Tibet government did not exceed the current area of the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nZhu said the attempt at a \"Greater Tibet\" also harbors malicious intentions.\n\n\"China is a country in which various ethnic groups live together. If ethnic groups in China all ask for an autonomous region in which only people of their own groups could live, the whole country would be cast into chaos,\" he said.\n\nZhu said the third feature of the \"middle way\" was to overthrow the current social and political system in the Tibet Autonomous Region under the pretense of \"high degree of autonomy\".\n\nThe official said the Dalai Lama and key supporters had said on many occasions that a \"high degree of autonomy\" meant that except for diplomatic and military affairs, all political, economic, cultural, educational and religious affairs should be subject to the administration of Tibetans.\n\nIn that case, feudal serfdom would be re-established over one-fourth of the Chinese territory, he said.\n\nZhu said the fourth feature was that it asked the central government to withdraw the PLA from \"Greater Tibet\" area.\n\n\"Everybody knows that the army is a basic guarantee of territorial integrity, national security and social stability,\" Zhu said. \"I believe not a single nation would agree to withdraw its own army from its own territory.\"\n\nZhu said the fifth feature of the \"middle way\" is the exclusion of other ethnic groups from the area of \"Greater Tibet\".\n\nZhu said the Dalai Lama's \"five-point peace plan\" stated clearly that the migration of other ethnic groups to Tibet must be curbed and the Han migrants must leave Tibet.\n\nThat means, once the Dalai Lama retained power in Tibet, racial discrimination, segregation and purges would be inevitable, Zhu said.\n\nThe official urged the Dalai Lama to \"do some good things for the country and the people including the Tibetans\". He reiterated that the door for the Dalai Lama's return to a patriotic stance had always been open and would remain open.\n\n\"But the door for 'Tibet independence', 'half independence' and 'independence in a disguised form' had never been open, nor would it be open in the future,\" he said."}, {"url": "http://chinaplus.cri.cn/news/politics/11/20171021/42346.html", "page_content": "A senior Communist Party of China (CPC) official reaffirmed Saturday China's opposition to Dalai Lama's visits to foreign countries.\n\nZhang Yijiong, executive vice minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), speaks at a press conference held by the press center of the 19th CPC National Congress in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 21, 2017.

On May 23, 1951, the central government of the People's Republic of China, then still in its infancy, signed an agreement with the local government of Tibet on the peaceful liberation of the region, helping the people of Tibet break free from the fetters of imperialist invaders for good.\n\nA subsequent democratic reform in the late 1950s abolished theocracy and feudal serfdom in Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama, clinging jealously to the system of serfdom and slavery that dominated old Tibet, fled China in the wake of a failed coup to resist the reform.\n\nThese great changes, as noted in the late American journalist Israel Epstein's 1983 book Tibet Transformed, \"were profoundly emancipatory, physically and mentally, for the overwhelming majority of Tibetans.\"\n\nWith strong support from the central government and the rest of China, and boosted by the great endeavors of people of all ethnic groups in the region, Tibet is catching up with other parts of the country in terms of socioeconomic development.\n\nA new modern socialist Tibet that is united, prosperous, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful is taking shape, underpinned by sustained stability and rapid development.\n\nCONNECTIVITY: ROADS, INTERNET AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nHaving lived in China for most of the past 24 years and having first traveled to Tibet in 2001, Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group, had feared his return to the region would be a journey back in time to the Tibet of old, to a region left behind by the rest of the country.\n\n\"Tibet was so poor when I came here the first time,\" Rein said, recalling long bumpy journeys along winding dirt roads that left him clutching for a barf bag.\n\nBefore his return to Tibet, Rein planned for the worst and told his team they would probably not be able to reach him due to a lack of access to phone or Internet.\n\nYet Rein was in for a pleasant surprise. Today, fast highways connect the capital city of Lhasa to other smaller cities throughout the region, while cell phone towers dot the landscape providing incredible Internet speeds.\n\nRein was shocked by the changes in Tibet's transport sector over the last 20 years, even if they paled in comparison to those witnessed by Epstein as he took a grinding 12-day trip by jeep and truck convoy from Chengdu in Sichuan Province to Lhasa in 1955.\n\n\"Even that seemed wonderfully speedy then,\" Epstein wrote, recalling his first visit to Tibet in his book. \"For thousands of years in the past, the only transport had been by yak or mule caravan -- six months being considered good time for the trip.\"\n\nSince 1951, Tibet has gradually built a comprehensive transport network composed of highways, railways and air routes.\n\nAccording to a white paper issued by China's State Council Information Office in May, 118,800 km of highways have been built, providing access to all administrative villages in the region. Ninety-four percent of towns and 76 percent of administrative villages now have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads.\n\nBuilding and fixing roads in Tibet can be very costly, and many of the roads are underused due to the low population density in more remote parts of the region, according to Dong Gengyun, a Beijing official who has been sent to Lhasa on a three-year assignment to support Tibet's development.\n\n\"But we have to do it, because we're not here for sightseeing, but to help develop the local economy and improve people's livelihoods,\" Dong said.\n\nDavid Blair, vice president and senior economist at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, regards infrastructure spending as critical because it allows people to run businesses. In Tibet, he saw people setting up B&Bs and even innovation centers.\n\n\"In many remote areas of the United States, you cannot get high-speed Internet either by wireless or wired network, and there's no incentive to provide it,\" Blair said, amazed by the \"great 4G connectivity in a little village in the middle of Tibet.\"\n\nOPPORTUNITY: TEENS, PILGRIMS AND ENTREPRENEURS\n\nThere was not a single school in the modern sense of the word in old Tibet. The illiteracy rate exceeded 95 percent, to say nothing of the complete lack of understanding of modern science and technology.\n\nFounded in 1956 with only 20 to 30 students, Lhasa Middle School in the downtown area of the city is the first modern and standard middle school in the history of Tibet.\n\nAt present, the school has some 3,000 students, with Tibetan students accounting for about 62 percent, said Tang Yong, the school's principal, adding that most of the students aspire to one day attend college.\n\nFrom 1951 to 2020, the central government invested 224 billion yuan (about 35 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet's education. Now, the region has established a modern educational system which includes preschool, primary and middle schools, vocational and technical schools, institutions of higher learning, and special education institutions.\n\nAccording to Gong Xiaotang, Party secretary of the Lhasa No. 2 Secondary Vocational School, Tibet has taken the lead in China in providing students with 15 years of publicly funded compulsory education.\n\nStudents at the vocational school have a wide variety of courses to choose from, including cooking, traditional Tibetan clothing and medicine production, thangka painting, and other disciplines. The school is also teaching hotel management, accounting, advertisement design and drone operation.\n\n\"I was impressed by the kids. They were learning a skill that was going to make them money, and they seem to understand that at a very young age,\" Blair said. \"And I was amazingly impressed by how much these kids knew, how hardworking they were, and how dedicated they are to building their own futures.\"\n\nThe American economist was also struck by a maker's center in Lunang, Nyingchi City, where primary students are taught to use computers and 3D printers.\n\n\"They're creating a spirit of dynamism in the young kids, and that's going to pay off,\" Blair said, noting that the youngsters will grow up dreaming of being innovators, building businesses and taking advantage of economic opportunities.\n\nBarkhor Street, which circles the Jokhang Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site and part of the historic ensemble of the Potala Palace, is the most famous pilgrim circuit in Lhasa and is always packed with pilgrims from across the region. The faithful complete the circuit clockwise, spinning their prayer wheels in the same direction.\n\nThere are more than 1,700 sites for Tibetan Buddhist activities with 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet, while traditional religious activities are carried out regularly in accordance with the law.\n\nEvery year, large sums of money are spent by the government on the renovation and maintenance of the Potala Palace to ensure that the pilgrims have a safe environment where they can practice their religion, according to Jorden, director of the administrative office of the Potala Palace.\n\n\"We saw many people still retain their religious ideals, while at the same time, they don't want to be poor because of that,\" Blair said.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by Rein, who found that the religious beliefs of Tibetan locals have proven no obstacle to bringing about economic prosperity. \"I don't think there's a disconnection or conflict between the two.\"\n\nIn 2020, the per capita disposable income of people in Tibet was double the figure from 2010. The average per capita disposable income of rural residents enjoyed double-digit growth over the past 18 years, while that of urban residents in 2020 reached 41,156 yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10 percent.\n\nRein believed the most impressive part of the trip was seeing the rise of the middle class in Tibet, as a growing number of locals bid farewell to poverty. \"When you have a vibrant middle class, you have a vibrant, sustainable and successful society,\" he said.\n\nThe Tibet Yougecang Enterprise, a Tibetan incense producer with fewer than 60 employees, has received a 50-million-yuan line of credit from the Agricultural Bank of China, according to Dawa, the enterprise's deputy general manager.\n\nHaving seen the implementation of Beijing's policy supporting small businesses and encouraging mass entrepreneurship in Tibet, Rein and Blair were optimistic about the future development of the region as well as the Chinese economy.\n\nHowever, finding a viable business model remains the greatest challenge for Tibet, so that the region can ultimately wean itself off support from the rest of the country, Blair noted.\n\nREALITY: A FAREWELL TO LIES AND SLANDER\n\nWhile Epstein wrote of a rekindled enthusiasm and passion for life among ordinary Tibetans since the democratic reform, Rein and Blair observed a Tibet far removed from its portrayal in Western media.\n\nRein and Blair saw for themselves the bilingual signs and software used by doctors to write out diagnoses for patients at the Tibetan Medicine Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as students learning Tibetan language in a classroom in Lhasa Middle School.\n\n\"It was very clear that the government is doing a pretty good job at protecting Tibetan culture and Tibetan language,\" Rein said, adding that he was upset with the baseless accusations made by former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his successor Antony Blinken.\n\n\"I don't like the false narrative that Blinken is perpetuating after Pompeo, which a lot of U.S. media are talking about simply because China wants to create a unified, patriotic country,\" Rein said.\n\nThe term also bothered Blair, who mentioned that such grave accusations should not be made so lightly. \"I don't think there's anything like that going on, so we should take that term off the table,\" he said.\n\nThe population of Tibet has increased from 1.23 million in 1959 to 3.5 million in 2019, with ethnic Tibetan people accounting for over 90 percent of the region's total. The average life expectancy in Tibet reached a record high of 71.1 in 2020, double the figure from 1951.\n\nChina attaches great importance to the protection and development of traditional Tibetan culture, with the study and use of the Tibetan language protected by law. The region now has 16 periodicals and 12 newspapers in the Tibetan language, and has published more than 40 million copies of 7,185 Tibetan-language books. In addition, the language is widely used in the sectors of health, postal services, communications, transport, finance, and science and technology.\n\nThe disconnect between the region's flourishing cultural scene and its depiction in Western circles was described by Albert Ettinger, a Tibet researcher from Luxembourg, in his 2015 book Battleground Tibet as \"stories from wonderland.\" These tall tales seek to conflate unprecedented population growth with \"genocide\" and a cultural renaissance with \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nRein and Blair also found that younger Tibetans seem to be the most optimistic of all the different segments of society, thanks to the great advancements made in the quality of life of locals.\n\nAs the first two foreigners to visit the Zam Hydropower Station along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the largest plant of its kind in Tibet, they were glad to see the balance struck between development and environmental protection.\n\nThe hydropower plant currently provides 30 percent to 35 percent of Tibet's energy needs, saving some 400,000 tonnes of diesel oil every year, according to Liu Feng, who is in charge of its operation. In addition, hundreds of millions of yuan has been spent to ensure fish can safely bypass the facility and swim back upstream.\n\n\"If people's livelihoods are to be improved, the region needs to have sufficient electricity,\" Liu said. \"People should not demonize the utilization of hydroelectric energy.\"\n\nSince 1978 when China started its reform and opening-up push, the Communist Party of China Central Committee has held seven national meetings on Tibet, making major decisions and plans for the region.\n\nChina began to provide pairing-up support for Tibet in 1994, with central government departments, other provinces and equivalent administrative units along with centrally administered state-owned enterprises offering paired assistance through 6,330 projects, representing a total investment of 52.7 billion yuan by 2020. A total of 9,682 outstanding officials were selected and dispatched to assist the region during the period.\n\nAccording to Rein, these policies show that the whole country has been trying to progress and work together to build a strong China.\n\n\"You don't see, say in the United States, where a wealthy state like California is sending some of their tax money to poor states like West Virginia,\" he said. \"And that's why they are falling further and further behind under the income level.\"\n\nIn comparison, China, Rein noted, \"doesn't want to leave any provinces behind.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Editor\uff1aMXJ"}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/report/2015-11/10/content_707988.htm", "page_content": "Tibetan Buddhism in Its Prime\n\nBy staff reporter LI YUAN\n\nWITH a history spanning 1,400 years, Tibetan Buddhism has a profound influence on Tibet\u2019s politics, economy, culture, and society. It has undergone robust and orderly development in the 50 years since the establishment of Tibet Autonomous Region, manifest in the religious freedom enjoyed by local people, and it has contributed positively to various undertakings of the region.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is the seventh Drukhang Living Buddha and also a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-chairman of the CPPCC Tibet Committee, and president of the Buddhist Association of China Tibet branch. It\u2019s no wonder that Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub calls himself the busiest Living Buddha in the country. Whenever I tried to contact him for an interview he was always out of town \u2013 giving lectures, participating in poverty relief or student aid programs, or on charity drives to dispatch free medicines to those in need. I eventually caught up with him in Beijing, where he was attending a meeting.\n\nLamas and locals attend the \u201csunning\u201d ceremony of the giant portrait of Padma Sambhava on June 10, 2014 at the Churpu Monastery in Doilungdeqen County, Lhasa.\n\nHealthy Development of Religious Affairs\n\nDrukhang Living Buddha of the Gelug Sect is the most revered Living Buddha on the northern Tibetan Plateau, and dates back 380 years. Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub was identified as the seventh Living Buddha in 1958, the first reincarnation of a Living Buddha after the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Involving close attention from the central government, his enthronement was the most extravagant of any Drukhang Living Buddha so far.\n\nThe reincarnation of Living Buddhas and the related rules and practices are an integral part of the continuation of Tibetan Buddhism, and are fully respected by the government. The latest statistics show that there are now 358 Living Buddhas in Tibet, 60 of whom are newly selected and enthroned by way of the reincarnation system.\n\nAs a prominent religious figure, Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub has witnessed and been part of the vigorous development of Tibetan Buddhism in China. \u201cUnder the theocratic rule in feudal times faith was held to ransom by politics and its sanctity was impaired. Under the socialist system, Tibet Autonomous Region separates religion from polity, thus allowing believers to freely practice and preach Buddhism.\u201d\n\nAccording to Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, there are 1,787 religious venues of various kinds and 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet. Over the past years the regional government implemented a slew of measures to improve the wellbeing of local religious communities, including funding for modern utilities at temples. So far more than 70 percent of local temples have paved access roads, running water, electricity, telecommunications networks, and TV and radio broadcast facilities. Fitness facilities totaling a value of RMB 1.2 million have been allocated to 20 monasteries. The regional government also promulgated a decree for insurance coverage for local monks and nuns, and appropriated RMB 13 million for this purpose. This move extended medical insurance and pension coverage to 93.3 percent and 66.8 percent of Tibetan clergy respectively, while the basic allowance for subsistence has reached everyone eligible. The local government provides free regular health checks to monks and nuns and keeps health records for them.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s remark that \u201cgovernance of the border area is critical to the governance of the state, and stability in Tibet is critical to the governance of frontiers\u201d encapsulates the significance of Tibet. With this understanding, Tibet Autonomous Region has been probing a system of better management of its religious establishments.\n\nSince late 2011 the regional government has established management committees at local monasteries, whose members include both competitive officials and accomplished members of these institutions. Such committees look after education, administration, and services for religious personnel. In this way such affairs as applications for leave, religious activities, and finance are well regulated and handled. The committees also organize teaching sessions for their members on the state\u2019s religious policies, rights and benefits of religious practitioners, and current affairs of interest.\n\nIn the view of Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, the innovation of monastery administration lies in shifting its focus from management to services. \u201cTake monastic discipline as the teacher. No discipline, no laws.\u201d With these measures the monks and nuns can be better committed to their practices, loving their country, and defending their faith. So they are of great benefit,\u201d the Living Buddha said.\n\nThe Chinese government has sponsored preservation programs for a multitude of Tibetan Buddhist sites, including the renovation of the Potala Palace, which was lauded by UNESCO officials as a \u201cmiracle in the history of preserving ancient architecture.\u201d Since 2008 China has invested RMB 570 million in the repair and maintenance of the Jokhang, Ramoche, Sera, and Zhaibung monasteries. Buddhist classics are recompiled and republished, including Chinese Tripitaka Kangyur, the General Catalogue of Tibetan Tripitaka in Chinese and Tibetan, and Sublime Interpretation of the Seven Treatises of Hetuvidya. A good number of Kalpa-sutras, or rules of ceremonies, biographies, and studies of Tibetan Buddhism by research institutions, scholars and senior lamas have also been printed.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is impressed with this progress: \u201cThese precious aspects of cultural heritage belong to Tibet, but also to the entire Chinese nation and all humankind. We religious figures are heartened by the fact that the state is sparing no efforts in preserving them.\u201d\n\nLamas of the Ningma Sect engage in a sutra debate session, a traditional method of study in Tibetan Buddhism\n\nEducation System Enhanced\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub is president of the Buddhist Academy of Tibet, located next to the Rato Monastery in Nyetang Township of Quxu County, Lhasa. The academy is the first comprehensive higher education institution of Tibetan Buddhism in the autonomous region, and its faculty and students come from all five major sects of the religion. Inspired by the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China, it combines modern and traditional pedagogy, operating three divisions respectively responding to the Esoteric Sect, Exoteric Sect and Living Buddhas, and offering courses in three categories \u2013 legal affairs, public affairs, and Buddhism. Its 13 lecturers are all senior priests from across Tibet.\n\nSo far the academy has concluded two sessions of the religious title studies program and seven sessions of the program for monks and nuns from remote frontier areas. The students, numbering nearly 1,000, have hailed from the full range of sects and divisions of Buddhism.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub accredits the vitality of his academy to the central government\u2019s patronage of Tibetan Buddhism. \u201cThe education system of Tibetan Buddhism is improving steadily in terms of curriculum and teaching methods, cultivating outstanding monks and nuns who are dedicated to their country and religion. An innovative academic system that integrates modern schools with traditional seminaries has been established, inaugurating and completing the academic title system for Tibetan Buddhism.\u201d The Living Buddha said that the experience of Tibet Autonomous Region has corroborated the significance of all-round, high-caliber talents to the management of temples and their future development.\n\nThe sixth Razheng Living Buddha, Lodro Gyaco Trinley Lhunzhub, was one of the first graduates of the Buddhist Academy of Tibet. He proudly recalled that his paper on the environmental theories of Tibetan Buddhism won first prize at Tibet\u2019s first writing contest on the doctrines and disciplines of Tibetan Buddhism. He observed in his thesis: \u201cThe lust of humankind induces disharmony in the relations between people and people, people and animals, and people and nature in general, resulting in various catastrophes. Deeds of goodness will restore harmony in the ecosystem, and more damage to the environment will result in more disasters.\u201d\n\nAccording to Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub, his students show broad interests and concerns. \u201cBesides Buddhism, the most discussed topics include contributions by eminent monks to national unity, self-improvement by members of different sects to catch up with the times, evolving Buddhist theories in the synchronization of the times, Buddhism\u2019s influence on world peace, and practicability of environmental ideas in Buddhist doctrines.\u201d\n\nIn recent years the regional government has promulgated statutes to support the Buddhist Academy of Tibet and to regulate the title awarding work at the academy. The Buddhist Academy of Tibet and the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China in Beijing are two leading incubators of high-ranking Tibetan Buddhist priests in China. Below them are the sutra-learning classes organized by 60-plus monasteries of different sects in Tibet, which offer traditional religious courses and evaluate and confer academic degrees on their students.\n\nSince 2005 the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China has held annual examinations for the Dorampa degree. Meanwhile, examinations for the Geshe Lharampa degree are held in Jokhang, Ganden, Sera, and Zhaibung monasteries. So far 84 monks have obtained the Geshe Lharampa degree, and 46 achieved the Dorampa degree.\n\nTo widen access to higher education for local lamas, the Buddhist Academy of Tibet opened a branch at the Shabten Monastery in Nagqu in 2011. In July 2015 the first batch of students finished a four-year course. The academy has also sponsored several sessions for lamas in remote areas, unprecedented in the history of Tibetan Buddhism education.\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub (left) awards a lama who has passed his academic exams with Buddhist title certification.\n\nSocial Integration Fosters Vitality\n\nToday Tibetan Buddhism is no longer confined to Chinese regions inhabited by Tibetan people. It is known and practiced globally. Drukhang Tubdain Kaizhub commutes between China\u2019s inland and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and travels extensively abroad. In these exchanges he is frequently asked about the adaptation of Tibetan Buddhism to social progress in the new era, and his answer is, \u201cThe essence of Buddhism is great mercy. It requires no harm to any life, and believes that all sins will be self-punished. The mission of Buddhism is to salvage humankind from worldly sins and sufferings. These are all relevant in today\u2019s society, so the cardinals of Buddhism see no need for any change.\u201d\n\nDrukhang Tubdain Kaizhub believes that Tibetan Buddhism must acclimatize to socialist society, and has all the conditions to do so. \u201cThe fate of a religion is interwoven with that of the nation. Healthy development of the religion and full commitment by its followers is only possible in a strong, prosperous, and stable country. Due to the purport of Buddhism and under the condition of the current social system, laws, and policies, Tibetan Buddhism now can well adapt to the socialist society,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Living Buddha warned that Tibetan Buddhism must be wary of infiltration by secessionism and draw a clear line between religion and superstition. He also stressed unity within Tibetan Buddhism: \u201cThe various sects have different approaches to reaching enlightenment, but share the same tenets and goals. So we are all one family.\u201d He said that history testifies that the best time for Buddhism is the period when different religious sects live in peace, which is in the interests of the nation and the people."}, {"url": "https://en.tibet3.com/culture/2016-10-27/1553.html", "page_content": "A citizen walks past the square of the Potala Palace in Lasha, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, March 10, 2016. Spring is coming in Lasha. (Xinhua/Zhang Rufeng)\n\nTibet, a remote land in the midst of the Himalayan Mountains, has long been shrouded in mystery and myth.\n\nThe myth brew illusions that have been skillfully peddled for political purposes around the world by the Dalai Lama, the biggest serf owner in old Tibet, who has thus instilled lies into people's concepts, especially Westerners' concepts about Tibet.\n\nNow let's have a look at what a true Tibet is really like in the eyes of foreign scholars and experts who have conducted in-depth studies and extensive field researches about this mysterious land.\n\nLuxembourg scholar Albert Ettinger said that the picture painted by the Dalai Lama about Tibet for the rest of the world is twisted by lies.\n\n\"People in Western countries learn about Tibet dominantly from the media. However, large amounts of fiction about Tibet published in those countries have nothing to do with the reality of Tibet...They haven't made any factual research at all,\" said Ettinger, who had two books published in German -- \"Free Tibet? \" and \"Fight for Tibet\" -- in 2014 and 2015 respectively after six years of intensive study.\n\n\"For instance, the Dalai Lama said old Tibet was not perfect, it had problems but generally it was a good society,\" Ettinger said. \"I always laugh at that.\"\n\nMany facts mirror and confirm that old Tibet, a society of serfdom, was a poor ignorant feudal society ridden with problems such as violence, insults, sexual discrimination, he said.\n\nIn addition, \"the repression of Tibet's language and culture\" claimed by Dalai Lama is also a lie, Ettinger said. \"It can be seen nowadays that though pupils in Tibet's schools learn Chinese characters, Tibetan is still widely used among them as well.\"\n\nEchoing Ettinger's opinions, German sinologist and ethnologist Ingo Nentwig said that, when it comes to Tibet, \"what you hear about may be false, what you see is true.\"\n\nThe image of the traditional Tibetan society, which is far from reality, is widespread \"mainly due to the propaganda of Tibet separatists and gullible, ignorant journalists who are willing to redistribute this nonsense,\" Nentwig said.\n\nThe expert said the truth is the old Tibet was \"a society dominated by poverty, misery and violence, ruled by a degenerated system of political tyranny, an institutionalized embodiment of systematic injustice and inequality, in other words, a 'hell on Earth.'\"\n\nAnd for the German scholar, the so-called \"cultural genocide\" in Tibet is just nonsense.\n\n\"It is a fact that the Han ethnic group is the largest among the 56 ethnic groups in China. It's normal for China's modernization to have more or less some Han cultural elements. But the encounter of a variety of cultures actually benefits and inspires cultures of ethnic minorities,\" Nentwig said.\n\nA file photo shows Nyima Tsering reading books in his room at Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Aug. 16, 2015.

After graduating from the High-level Tibetan Buddhism College in Beijing, Nyima Tsering did the reception work at Jokhang Temple administration committee and introduced temple information to tourists from home and abroad as a tour guide. (Xinhua/Chogo)\n\nIn 2008, Tibetan Tripitaka, a massive collection of 232 volumes of classic Buddhist scriptures, was published in Tibetan characters by the China Tibetology Press after more than 20 years of collation by experts.\n\nNentwig cited it as a good example of China's efforts to protect and promote the ancient Tibetan culture.\n\nHe noted that prior to the 1950s, Tibet had few books except religious classics, but now there are a variety of Tibetan publications of philosophical classics, Western literature and modern scientific literature.\n\n\"Culture is not only religion. Tibetans now have perfect conditions to enjoy a full-blown spiritual life with their own language. This is indeed a great development,\" Nentwig said.\n\n\"For any culture, preservation for its own sake without renewal could only lead to its decay. For Tibetan culture, the encounter and exchange with cultures of all Chinese ethnic groups, including that of Han Chinese, just enables it to survive and prosper in the long term,\" Nentwig said.\n\nBelgian Tibetologist Andre Lacroix praised Tibet's development over the past decades, saying the region's living standards have improved a lot with \"indisputably huge\" progress being made.\n\n\"It (the Qinghai-Tibet railway launched in 2006) is an extraordinary project and it's really impressive. I think it's a win-win project, with which Tibet further develops and improves its economy, strengthens external exchanges and elevates living standards. The railway line has opened up areas isolated for centuries and helped promote responsible tourism as well.\"\n\n\"I think Tibetan culture is much less threatened than many other minority cultures in the world, because there are still some research institutes working on it,\" Lacroix said, refuting claims that the government was damaging Tibet's indigenous cultures.\n\n\"The Tibetan language is mandatory in primary schools. I believe there is a real willingness by the Chinese government to protect Tibetan culture,\" said the expert."}, {"url": "http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/culture/2014-02/27/content_599683.htm", "page_content": "DEEP in the snowy mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, legend recalls, is a blessed valley in the shape of an eight-petal lotus. Spectacular snowcapped mountains, steep gorges and alpine meadows sprinkled with wildflowers are found here. It is Shangri-La in Yunnan Province\u2019s Di-qing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.\n\nDiqing, or Deqen, sits in the transitional zone between the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Its ancient history, distinctive landforms, mysterious religions and diverse ethnic groups lend a great appeal to this faraway land.\n\nThe Gedeng Neolithic Site in Weixi County attests to human habitation as early as 7,000 years ago. And inscribed slates unearthed in the region reveal a thriving civilization dating back 2,400 years.\n\nLocated on the ancient Tea-Horse Trail, also known as the Southern Silk Road, Diqing is an intersection of exchanges between China\u2019s east and west, north and south. In addition to Tibetans, who account for one third of the local population, it is home to 25 other ethnic communities, including the Lisu, Naxi and Bai. They all live in concord with each other, while retaining their respective cultures, which have converged and co-developed over the past generations.\n\nThe Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery, Dondrup Ling Monastery and the Dongba pictographs are among the most iconic manifestations of Diqing\u2019s diverse and mysterious folk traditions, which add brilliance to the region\u2019s scenic panorama.\n\nDiqing remained unknown to the outside world until 1933, when English writer James Hilton wrote Lost Horizon, which describes an isolated but pleasurable valley called Shangri-La whose residents of different ethnic backgrounds enjoyed peace and longevity. The novel was made into a film in 1937, and the theme song \u201cBeautiful Shangri-La\u201d then spread across the world.\n\nThe book was thought to present Shangri-La as an imaginary place. The exact location could not be identified, though a number of countries around the world have claimed it is on their territory. Now 60 years of research provide sufficient evidence that Diqing is none other than Shangri-La.\n\nThe English \u201cShangri-La\u201d sounds like it originates in the Tibetan dialect spoken in Zhongdian, capital of Diqing. In the Tibetan language, the word means \u201cmoon in one\u2019s heart.\u201d Moreover, the folklore and natural environment depicted in the novel bear a strong resemblance to Zhongdian. In 2001, the region officially changed its name to Shangri-La.\n\nDiqing boasts a wide diversity of landforms \u2013 mountains, lakes, glaciers, karsts, meadows \u2013 and climate zones, owing to its peculiar geographic location, complex geological structures and sharp altitudinal differences. What\u2019s more, the region is rich in biodiversity. Almost all plants that usually grow in the tropical, temperate and frigid zones of the northern hemisphere can be found here. The region is thus treasured as a botanical gene bank.\n\nThe Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery\n\nShangri-La is about 200 km from Lijiang, an ancient city inhabited by the Naxi people. Heading north from Lijiang, the scenery changes dramatically with the increasing altitude. The sight of wildflowers bathed in glorious sunshine and cows and sheep grazing on the meadows lightens the heart.\n\nNo visitor to Shangri-La should miss the Ganden Songtsen Ling Monastery, known as the soul of Diqing.\n\nBuilt in 1679, at the order of the fifth Dalai Lama following an augury, it is the largest Tibetan Buddhist shrine in Yunnan Province. Rising along a hillside, this majestic complex, with its towering roofs of gilded brass tiles gleaming in the sun, along with vermilion walls, white windows and black curtains standing out against a clear blue sky, evokes a heavenly aura. This design wins it the renown of \u201cminor Potala Palace.\u201d\n\nGanden Songtsen Ling was significant for the seventh Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso. Before the sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyasto (1683-1708) passed away, he predicted, \u201cThe white crane will not stay afar. Someday, it will return from Litang.\u201d It turned out that his soulboy was indeed found to be born in Litang, now a county in Sichuan Province."}, {"url": "http://en.youth.cn/Inter_Channel/Top_News/201112/t20111206_1798855.htm", "page_content": "The recent self-immolations of monks and nuns in Tibetan-inhabited areas of southwest China's Sichuan province are linked to overseas plots, a Chinese Tibetologist wrote in a signed article.\n\nThe self-immolations took place at four Tibetan Buddhism temples, and most of them occurred at the Kirti Monastery in the province's Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture.\n\n\"We have learned what is behind these events,\" Zhang Yun, a researcher with the China Tibetology Research Center, wrote in an article published by the Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe living Buddha of the Kirti Monastery, who fled in 1959 and has since lived in Dharamsala, India, has long exerted influence over the monastery, Zhang wrote. The living Buddha used to serve as a private secretary to the 14th Dalai Lama and religious head of the \"Tibetan government-in-exile.\"\n\nAfter the deadly rioting in Lhasa on March 14, 2008, monks who fled the monastery established a \"coordination team\" to mastermind and organize operations.\n\nScandals have surfaced claiming some people bought the bodies involved in the self-immolations, he wrote in the article.\n\n\"People are repulsed and angered by the masterminds, supporters and eulogists of the self-immolations, as they feel sad and sorry for the loss of young lives,\" Zhang wrote.\n\nBuddhism asks its adherents to have charity in their hearts and a fundamental discipline of not killing any living thing. \"Tibetan Buddhism has held a fine tradition for this,\" he wrote.\n\nHowever, the cruel behavior of some monks during the Lhasa riots and the recent self-immolations tarnished the image of Tibetan Buddhism in the minds of ordinary people in regards to its no killing precept, Zhang said.\n\nIn his article, Zhang wrote that many heart-wrenching scenes emerged from the self-immolation incidents in Sichuan's Tibetan areas: young monks set themselves aflame after being pushed to do so by senior monks; police officers and medical staff rushed to save lives, but the monks tried to disrupt their efforts; the parents of the injured parties begged for the release of their children while the monks were left as victims of their own devices.\n\n\"These self-immolations not only brought into question whether these monasteries had obeyed the fundamental precepts of Buddhism, but also whether they occupy the bottom moral rung of being human,\" he wrote.\n\nSelf-immolation, abetting such activities, looting and buying bodies -- all these acts have prompted people to question the nature of these monasteries, he said.\n\n\"If the senior monks couldn't teach young monks to be benevolent, and the young monks couldn't abide by the precepts, how can they practice the responsibility of saving mankind? How could any parent trust them with their children?\" Zhang wrote.\n\nAccording to Western media reports, young monks and nuns shouted \"Free Tibet\" and \"Tibet independence\" before setting themselves ablaze. These actions show that not only were these self-immolation attempts politically-motivated but also that these people were ignorant of history, Zhang wrote.\n\nPeople with even a modicum of common sense should know that Sichuan is not part of Tibet, he wrote, adding that even in the Simla Convention, an illegal document drafted by the British government in 1913 and 1914 in an attempt to achieve \"Tibetan independence\", which the central authorities refused to sign, the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Sichuan were included in the territory of the Republic of China.\n\nAttempts to realize the \"independence of Tibet\" during past imperialistic invasions have all failed, and nowadays it goes against the progress of history to advocate for \"Tibet independence,\" Zhang wrote.\n\nInstigating separatism is against the will of the people as well as the fine anti-imperialistic and patriotic traditions carried on by the Tibetan people throughout modern history, he wrote.\n\nAfter the Opium Wars broke out in 1840, people of the Tibetan and Qiang ethnic groups in Sichuan marched to the front lines in the southeast coastal areas to fight British invaders under the instructions of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn February 1842, nearly 2,000 Tibetan and Qiang soldiers used their own horses and equipment to fight against foreign invaders.\n\nTibetan people also made great efforts in assisting the Red Army during the Long March which lasted from 1934-1935."}]}
