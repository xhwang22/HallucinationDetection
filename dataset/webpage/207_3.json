Suter was the first player off the 1980 Olympic team to die when he had a fatal heart attack at the Capitol Ice Arena in Middleton, Wisconsin, in 2014. The arena was eventually named after him. Suter's brother, Gary Suter, played in the NHL from 1985 to 2002 and Bob's son, Ryan Suter, has played in the NHL since 2004.\n\nPhil Verchota, Left Wing Born: Dec. 28, 1956 (Duluth, Minnesota) High school: Duluth East High School (Duluth, Minnesota) College: University of Minnesota\n\nCareer Highlights: Phil Verchota NHL career: None Career highlights: Two-time NCAA champion (1976, 1979)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Phil Verchota Phil Verchota was a football and hockey star at Duluth East High School. He was good enough that he had scholarship offers from the University of Minnesota in both sports. The aspiring defensive tackle decided to ditch football and won a pair of national championships playing for Herb Brooks with the Gophers before making the 1980 Olympic team and winning the gold medal. He returned as the U.S. captain at the 1984 Olympics. Verchota retired from hockey after the 1984 Olympics and went into banking, where he eventually became president of First American Bank in Willmar, Minnesota.\n\nMark Wells, Center Born: Sept. 18, 1957 (St. Clair Shores, Michigan) High school: Lake Shores High School (St. Clair Shores, Michigan) College: Bowling Green State University\n\nCareer Highlights: Mark Wells NHL career: None Career highlights: Two-time All-CCHA (1977, 1979)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Mark Wells Mark Wells was one of two players from Bowling Green to make the 1980 Olympic team, alongside star defenseman Ken Morrow. He played two seasons of minor league hockey after winning the gold medal but never played in the NHL. Following his hockey career, Wells went to work in the restaurant industry. He suffered a catastrophic injury unloading crates that fractured his spine. After surgery, he wasn't able to work again. Wells was forced to sell his gold medal to a collector in 2010 for $40,000 to pay for living expenses. It was immediately turned around and sold for $310,000 at an auction.\n\nJim Craig, Goaltender Born: May 31, 1957 (Easton, Massachusetts) High school: Oliver Ames High School (Easton, Massachusetts) College: Boston University\n\nCareer Highlights: Jim Craig NHL career: Atlanta Flames (1979-80), Boston Bruins (1980-81), Minnesota North Stars (1983-84) Career highlights: NCAA champion (1978), NCAA All-American (1979)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Jim Craig After Mike Eruzione, goaltender Jim Craig is perhaps the most well-known player from the 1980 Olympic team. His heroic performance in the semifinals and finals went down as one of the best performances by a goalie in Olympic history. Craig played three seasons in the NHL and was charged with \"driving to endanger\" after a crash on a rural Massachusetts highway left one woman dead and another critically injured in 1982. He was eventually found not guilty after waiving his right to a jury trial and going directly before a judge.\n\nMike Eruzione, Left Wing Born: Oct. 25, 1954 (Winthrop, Massachusetts) High school: Winthrop High School (Winthrop, Massachusetts) College: Boston University\n\nCareer Highlights: Mike Eruzione NHL career: None Career highlights: IHL Rookie of the Year (1978), IHL Turner Cup champion (1978)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Mike Eruzione The most famous player on the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, team captain Mike Eruzione was once described by Ringer podcast host Bill Simmons as \"America's houseguest.\" It was an apt description of the Massachusetts native and former Boston University star who scored the game-winning goal against the Soviet Union. Eruzione played one season in the IHL and one season in the AHL before the Olympics, but went undrafted by the NHL and never played professionally after the gold medal. What has Eruzione done since 1980? Mostly he's made a career out of being Mike Eruzione.\n\nCraig Patrick, Assistant General Manager/Assistant Coach Born: May 20, 1946 (Detroit, Michigan) Career highlights: Olympic gold medal (1980), Olympic silver medal (2002)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Craig Patrick Craig Patrick played eight seasons in the NHL and was still competing for the U.S. into his mid-30s before retiring in 1979, when he moved into administration and coaching. He was the assistant general manager for U.S. hockey and the assistant coach for the 1980 Olympic team. Patrick was the youngest general manager in New York Rangers history before becoming the general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1989, winning two Stanley Cup championships with the team. In a crazy twist, Patrick is one of seven family members who have won Stanley Cups as players, coaches or administrators.\n\nWalter Bush, General Manager Born: Sept. 25, 1929 (Minneapolis, Minnesota) Died: Sept. 22, 2016, 86 years old (Minneapolis, Minnesota) Career highlights: U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame (1980), Hockey Hall of Fame (2000), IIHF Hall of Fame (2009)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Walter Bush Walter Bush was a builder. He helped build the Central Hockey League, was key in bringing the NHL to Minnesota with the Minnesota North Stars, and was the president of U.S. Hockey for two decades, bringing Herb Brooks in to coach the 1980 U.S. Olympic team. He also was instrumental in adding women's hockey to the U.S. roster of Olympic sports. Bush died in 2016, at 86 years old.\n\nAl Michaels, Broadcaster Born: Nov. 12, 1944 (Brooklyn, New York) Career highlights: Five-time Sports Emmy Award winner - Outstanding Sports Personality, three-time NSMA National Sportscaster of the Year, Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Television Academy Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame Pete Rozelle Radio & Television Award (2013), Baseball Hall of Fame Ford C. Frick Award (2021)\n\nWhat Happened Next: Al Michaels Al Michaels is one of the most famous sports broadcasters of all time and called his seventh Super Bowl in 2022. None of that sentence happens without the 1980 Olympics. Michaels was the voice of the iconic broadcasting moment when the Americans beat the Soviet Union in the semifinals.\"Do you believe in miracles?! Yes!\" We've been lucky to have those velvety pipes in our lives ever since.\n\nHerb Brooks, Head Coach Born: Aug. 3, 1937 (Saint Paul, Minnesota) Died: Aug. 11, 2003, 66 years old (Forest Lake, Minnesota) Career highlights: Olympic gold medalist (1980), Olympic silver medalist (2002), three-time NCAA national champion (1974, 1976, 1979)"}, {"url": "https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/october-2000/the-future-of-feminist-history", "page_content": "Editor's Note: This essay was presented as part of a panel entitled \"The Future of Feminist History\" at the breakfast meeting of the Committee on Women Historians of the AHA on January 8, 2000. The panel was organized by Carla Hesse and also included talks by Jennifer Morgan and Mrinalini Sinha. This text has been edited but appears very largely as it was given.\n\nI want to thank all of you for coming out at 7:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning of a busy conference. When I see the group gathered here today, I understand why feminist history has accomplished all that it has. And this is because, after we feminists do our share of interviewing and being interviewed, speaking, commenting and debating, schmoozing, hobnobbing, and finding time to see old friends (not to mention sometimes getting up with small children), we wake up at the crack of dawn to talk about the future of feminist history. Confronted by such dedication, I am tempted to propose one possible future for feminist history: let the women sleep in! Next year, let's let the men get up at dawn to discuss gender and history. But they won't and don't, and we will and do\u2014and that is our strength and also our cross.\n\nLet me turn, then, to my task, which is to discuss the future of feminist history. But surely this is an impossible\u2014and almost antifeminist\u2014charge. For the topic seems to invite the kind of magisterial summarizing and confident prediction that women's history\u2014with its attention to the unexpected and contingent, the marginal and suppressed\u2014was virtually developed against. But as I reflected further on this challenge, I began to find it an extraordinarily useful one, for it forced me to think outside my usual range of topics and against the historian's particularist grain. After all, there is a value in magisterial pronouncements and sweeping generalizations, if only because they can serve as stimuli to debate. So, instead of making the true but unhelpful point that the future of feminist history is likely to be messy, unfathomable, contentious and yet productive, let me take advantage of this chance to be magisterial and predictive, and put forward my own singular but considered views. And in this vein, I am drawn to make three main points about our field: one celebratory, one anxious, and one programmatic.\n\nA Transformative Presence\n\nFirst and most fundamentally, I want to acknowledge and celebrate the degree to which feminist history has come to be\u2014and, I believe, will continue to be\u2014a powerful and transformative presence in the academy. Whatever our individual criticisms of various approaches and fields\u2014and there is no more critical and self-critical bunch\u2014I think all of us would agree that feminism has utterly transformed historical writing. If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly \"natural,\" we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission\u2014on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender. Moreover, despite our own endless arguments over which of these approaches and tasks is the more significant, the important point is that we have been true to both. And rightly so, for this argument\u2014the argument between \"women's history\" and \"gender history\"\u2014is an argument in which one side continually produces the case for the opposite stance, an argument neither side should ever win. Women's history isn't a stage that we move through as we struggle toward gender history, for gender history itself sends us endlessly back to women. And both inquiries have transformed our historical work and understanding.\n\nThus, works on women have consistently de-essentialized and historicized groups and issues too often trapped in discourses of degeneracy and difference. From Luise White's determination to see Nairobi's prostitutes as entrepreneurs and not victims, to Margot Badran's recovery of a critical feminist voice in Egyptian nationalism, to Nancy Hunt's creative analysis of the ways in which varied cultural practices around maternity in the Belgian Congo shaped colonial relations and populations more broadly, feminist historians have recovered and asserted the significance of women's voices and choices in the past\u2014an effort that cannot possibly be dismissed as \"compensatory history.\" And the payoffs from the turn to gender history have been equally great. Most of the great narratives of modern history\u2014the narratives of industrialization, of class formation, of the construction of welfare states, of the making of nations and empires, of the emergence of democratic politics and the practices of total war\u2014are now seen to have been framed by, based upon, productive of, and narrated through changes in relations between the sexes. This revisionist impulse has gone very far in some fields\u2014there is, for example, no more flourishing subfield in British history today than that devoted to working out the interconnections between the construction of gender identities and the operations of empire\u2014but we find it in almost every field. Think, for example, of Afsaneh Najmabadi's lovely recent study of the ways in which a national panic over the abduction and selling of girls helped to authorize and legitimate the project of Iranian nation-building, of Kristin Hoganson's reading of the Spanish-American war as a project of cultural masculinization, or of Partha Chatterjee's and Mrinalini Sinha's rival accounts of the gendered bases of British imperialism and Indian nationalism.\n\nInstitutional Achievements\n\nNor need our celebration of the impact of feminism on the academy be measured by the flow of books and articles alone. There are also institutional achievements. Not only do most departments now feel that they must teach women's history and (sometimes) even hire specialist women's historians, but also\u2014and this is a quantum leap\u2014they can increasingly imagine hiring someone who works on women or gender not as a \"women's historian\" but rather, say, as a colonial Americanist. Equally important, department members who are responsible for other areas\u2014whether medieval Europe or modern Japan\u2014increasingly feel driven to incorporate material on women into their teaching. Women's and gender history, in other words, may not have achieved its grandest ambition\u2014the ambition to rewrite all of history from the standpoint of gender\u2014but it has accomplished something that I feel to be even more important: it has established itself as one of a relatively small number of approaches and perspectives that are accepted both as legitimate subfields in their own right and as essential components of all national fields. Nor is this position seriously under threat, for both the intellectual imperatives and the emotional and political passions that underpin it are alive and well. Our search to find \"where the women were,\" and to reinterpret the world from their standpoint, will sustain and enrich our profession for a long time to come.\n\nIs all, then, sweetness and light? Here, I want to stop and spend a few minutes voicing an anxiety about two trends within feminist history that I find both exciting and disquieting. I speak, on the one hand, of the increasing attention paid to questions of identity in the study of the formation of individuals and collectivities, and, second, of the turn to what we might call an epistemological approach to the study of relations of power.\n\nContesting Identities\n\nOf course, there are good reasons for both of these moves. The study of women led us ineluctably to the discovery of differences and antagonisms between women, to an awareness of the fact that women often saw other affiliations as more meaningful than those of sex. From this study of division arose, inevitably, the study of contestation among identities, and of the processes through which particular affiliations come to be privileged or powerfully felt. Likewise, the study of gender as a cultural and symbolic system led us inevitably to what Mary Poovey and others have called historical epistemology\u2014that is, to the attempt to understand the production of all those fundamental assumptions and categories that underwrite and sustain particular cultural formations. And if these moves were logical, so too have they had their benefits. The turn to identity, for example, has forced a critical reexamination of\u2014and a moral attention to\u2014a history that feminism has sometimes been slow to acknowledge. Rather than assuming the power of the identity of \"woman,\" we spend more time these days acknowledging and studying women's investment in other cultural practices or markers of difference\u2014in ethnic and racial identities, in relational or family roles, in religious faith and observance. Thus, for example, Susan Grayzel's recent study of women's identities in Britain and France during World War I explores not only the emergence of a feminist pacifism but equally the ways in which many women sought to craft a gendered rhetoric of patriotism and to align the cause of feminism with the cause of war. Likewise, works by feminist historians show us what can be gained by integrating the insights of cultural analysis into studies of social relations: one has only to think of Leora Auslander's brilliant account of the ways in which aesthetic tastes and styles, gender and labor relations, and political forms coalesced and reinforced one another in 18th- and 19th-century France. And one could proliferate such examples.\n\nHistory without Politics?\n\nAnd yet, in spite of the manifest excellence of such work, the turn to identity in the context of a parallel turn toward what we might call a neo-Foucauldian or discursive theory of power has left me somewhat uneasy\u2014or, rather, with the nagging feeling that something has been left out. What might that be? Let me take an example from my own field of British history. At the last annual meeting of the North American Conference on British Studies, there were 25 panels devoted to the modern period. Of these, 11 (or nearly a half) either employed gender as a central analytic concept or were explicitly on men, women, or the family. By contrast, 8 of these 25 panels (or about a third of the total) were on imperial questions. There was, however, an overlap of six between these two groups: six panels, in other words, were on gender and empire. These were, very largely, on identity\u2014on \"imperial masculinity\" or on women's self-understandings and expression in different imperial contexts. They were, I hasten to add, often fascinating presentations: through an enterprising investigation of new sources, they revealed much about their subjects' mental worlds. But this focus on identity and subjectivity seemed to have come at some cost (if only in terms of alternatives foresworn), for what struck me at the time was that, among all these papers on sailors and settlers, missionaries and migrants, I was scarcely able to find one directly concerned with the political processes or social relations of empire\u2014with conquest and governance, population policy, and labor control\u2014all of which, I might add, have everything to do with gender. If a nonhistorian were to have come to this conference, then, she might conclude that the British Empire was nothing more than a great staging ground for the elaboration of \"Britishness,\" in which groups of rather self-absorbed British men and women could experiment with different identities without doing much harm to anyone\u2014a bizarre vision, profoundly one-sided, and oddly reminiscent of an old imperial history also intensely focused on the self-justifications and self-understandings of the colonizing power.\n\nWhy, I wondered, did the conference look this way? Why had politics dropped out? There are, of course, many possible answers to this question, some of which would simply stress shifts in intellectual fashion and the lure of new sources, but one part of any answer must surely focus on the difficulties of studying politics in the context of our preoccupation with systemic cultural analysis. The problem is that the insights that have proven so productive for cultural analysis\u2014insights about the multivalent, collaborative, and web-like nature of power\u2014tend to be less useful for the study of narrower political processes. For, once we assume power is everywhere, it usually turns out to be nowhere very much; if it is analytically directionless, it scarcely needs to be taken into account. Our acceptance, in other words, of the truth that power is everywhere and that the weak, like the strong, play the game of power, has led us away from grasping the other truth that the players are not equal, that even multivalent systems can have internal movements preponderantly in one direction or another, that there are degrees of power, that a middle ground exists between an assumption of total agency and an assumption of total fixity\u2014and that it is on this crucial middle ground that most interesting questions are found and much interesting history happens.\n\nWhat Is to Be Done?\n\nWhat is to be done? I think the problem itself dictates the solution. Let me then argue\u2014and this is my third point\u2014that feminist historians need to bring politics back in, and by this I mean politics less in the broad sense of systemic relations of power than in the narrower sense of that set of negotiations and institutions through which rights and goods are claimed, distributed, and contested. Bringing politics back in will give some much-needed precision to some of the work on identity\u2014allowing us to see, for example, the conditions under which particular racialized or gendered identities can be captured by political movements and mobilized for particular ends. The narrow study of politics also reawakens us to the truth that questions about the degree and form of power are crucial and consequential historical questions, that there is a big difference between the sticks and stones that break our bones and the words that hurt but don't quite kill us. The study of politics, in other words, forces us constantly, and almost against our will, to shift the unit of analysis away from the system and toward the component parts, and to ask questions about processes and outcomes as well as about meanings. Partial such an approach may well be, but it strikes me as a necessary corrective at a moment when systemic analysis and \"thick description,\" rather than causal analysis and the study of change has so much the intellectual upper hand.\n\nBut I want to argue for bringing politics back in for two other reasons as well. We should pay attention to politics, I think, because political history has been one of the last intellectual strongholds of antifeminism, and is only now undergoing a real revision. Thus, in British history, a field in which virtually every worthwhile topic has been done many times over, crucial topics relating to women and politics and gendered studies of politics are still relatively underdeveloped. There is, for example, no book-length study of women's activism in the League of Nations, even though this is where many social reformers cut their teeth; only one recent scholarly work (by Kim Reynolds) on the activities of the political wife, even though political hostesses were crucial power brokers in the era before the emergence of mass parties; and until quite recently relatively little work on the reasons for the long-standing (if now overcome) gender gap in British politics, whereby women disproportionately favor conservatism. Only in the last few years, in work by Alison Light on the affinity between appeasement and domesticity, by Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska and Fiona Grigg on the gendered appeal of conservative penal and economic policies, and by Martin Pugh and David Jarvis on the party's women's organizations, do we get the beginnings of such a gendered history of conservatism. Subjects like these are not trivial, for they help us to understand how some of the core political changes of our time\u2014changes that affected the lives and life chances of millions\u2014happened. These processes, too, were gendered, and they need our attention.\n\nBut there is one final reason I want to argue for attention to politics, and that is because it will help us with our own institutional work and practice. As we trace the historical significance of the partial reform, of the awkward coalition, of the indifferent outcome chosen to preclude the worse, we learn some lessons that may actually help us in the world in which we find ourselves. For\u2014and this brings me back to my first point\u2014as feminist history has swollen into a big and successful wave, it has lifted a lot of individual historian boats. Feminist historians are now on the committees and Council of the American Historical Association, they are deans and university presidents, heads of major granting agencies, tenured professors and department chairs. This group is making or helping to make the decisions about hiring, promotion, and publishing that will affect our profession through the next generation. I don't wish to belittle in any way the struggles of the first generations of feminist historians, who often pursued their visions from marginal positions and against difficult odds, but for a younger generation\u2014my generation\u2014I think it is important to acknowledge that the world has changed. It is no good, anymore, pretending that we are brave outsiders valiantly challenging patriarchal institutions: that is, the institutions may still be patriarchal, but we are right in the middle of them. When we make such claims or play such a role, then, we look\u2014to our graduate students, to younger faculty, to adjuncts sweating it out in poorly paid holding tanks\u2014not merely ridiculous but irresponsible, indulging in some fantasy of romantic opposition at their expense. For, I would argue, there is no power more despotic than the power that hides its face, that operates personally and erratically, that despises process, that will not acknowledge its own place in the hierarchy, that takes refuge\u2014to cite a feminist classic\u2014in the \"tyranny of structurelessness.\" Theories that stress the fluidity and multivalence of power fit too comfortably with such practice to make our attraction to them entirely innocent. My last point, then, is to ask that as we, as feminist historians, take on ever more important roles in the academy, we understand our place in fixed and directional hierarchies of power, and use our position well. This means, among other things, that we think about whether we can place our graduate students before we ask them to carry out our own intellectual agendas; that we diversify our curriculum without operating our own thought police; that we are gracious to those colleagues who don't quite understand what we do but want to be on our side; and, finally, that we not act like hurt parents when a younger generation decides\u2014as it assuredly will\u2014that we got it all wrong, and comes along to chastise and correct us."}, {"url": "https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v35/n15/susan-pedersen/triumph-of-the-poshocracy", "page_content": "After the \u2018turnip winter\u2019 of 1916-17 and with no sign of war abating, my husband\u2019s grandfather, the oldest child of an impoverished widow in the central German town of Kassel, ran away to join the navy. He was hungry, and though underage and not really military material imagined sailors probably got enough to eat. This was a good guess, and while he had a chancy time of it \u2013 surviving the loss of his ship, the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow and more than a year\u2019s internment in a Merseyside POW camp \u2013 he never starved. His sister back in Kassel got rickets, the result of severe malnutrition.\n\nBehind this story and so many like it was the wartime British naval blockade of Germany. And behind the policy, Lord Robert Cecil, the maverick son of the late Victorian Conservative prime minister Lord Salisbury, and minister for blockade in Lloyd George\u2019s wartime government. The aim of the blockade was to damage Germany\u2019s war effort but not Britain\u2019s relations with neutral states, and it appears to have been fairly successful, for by the winter of 1916-17 there were not only shortages of necessary mat\u00e9riel but also starvation across Central and Eastern Europe \u2013 an experience that sapped public support for the war and helped fuel the revolutions of 1917-18.\n\nDid the experience of running the blockade predispose Cecil to his next great cause: the effort to construct a \u2018guarantee of peace\u2019 through the League of Nations? Through 1918 and 1919, Cecil teamed up with American counterparts to draft the League Covenant. At the heart of the doctrine of collective security lay the principle that the individual \u2018rogue state\u2019 would be brought to reason through collective action by the rest, especially through the \u2018economic weapon\u2019 of sanctions. International censure and hardship, it was assumed, would drive people to force their governments into line.\n\nThe blockade was still in effect during those discussions. Although it had in a sense done its work \u2013 Germany had asked for an armistice, a fragile democracy had emerged \u2013 it would not be fully lifted until the Treaty of Versailles was signed. But as the months dragged on, and news of hunger and unrest throughout Central Europe spread, objections grew louder to a \u2018weapon\u2019 that did its work by starving women and children. The blockade didn\u2019t so much end the war as shift its target \u2013 and \u2018for my part,\u2019 one Liberal MP stated, \u2018I prefer the weapon which means men facing men with arms in their hands.\u2019 When a diehard Conservative peer, the Duke of Northumberland, made the point that it was \u2018those who are always most fervent in the cause of humanity\u2019 who seemed especially eager to support this \u2018particularly abhorrent\u2019 weapon, he clearly had Cecil and the internationalists in his sights.\n\nCecil would have had an answer ready. He was not a hypocrite, and his support for economic sanctions, and indeed for the League project as a whole, was of a piece with his political faith. The public should take responsibility for foreign policy, he would have retorted: that was the whole point. If an \u2018old diplomacy\u2019 of secret treaties and the balance of power had caused the war, only a \u2018new diplomacy\u2019 of open agreements accountable to democratic publics could make power change its ways. The blockade, doing its work on the young and old alike, was one way to teach that pitiless lesson.\n\nThat she was responsible for the good conduct of the nation would probably have struck my husband\u2019s great-grandmother, bent over her washtub, as absurd. But it did not seem absurd to the millions of ordinary citizens of all nationalities who supported the League project in those tumultuous years. In virtually every member state, and in some that were not members, societies sprang up to educate citizens about the League and enlist them behind it. The societies had distinct characteristics and were only loosely affiliated; but together they incarnated what Hume called the \u2018party of humankind against vice or disorder\u2019, an alliance of the cosmopolitan and civic-minded determined to keep national hatreds at bay. And of those national societies, none was more important than the British League of Nations Union.\n\nHelen McCarthy\u2019s book is the first full study of the LNU to be published in more than thirty years. It is an important work of recovery. Almost forgotten today, the LNU was one of the largest and most vibrant voluntary associations of the interwar years. With around 400,000 individual members organised in some 3000 local branches at its height in 1931, it rivalled both the major political parties and the churches in its size and reach. Millions of Britons joined LNU branches at some point in their lives; virtually all of them would have heard speeches or radio broadcasts by Cecil, the Oxford classicist Gilbert Murray, the suffragist and internationalist Kathleen Courtney, or some other LNU luminary. Then there\u2019s the LNU\u2019s most famous effort, the \u2018Peace Ballot\u2019 of 1935, in which 38 per cent of adult citizens took part and which \u2013 so the LNU argued \u2013 demonstrated the public\u2019s overwhelming support for the League\u2019s ideals. Although a United Nations Association emerged after the LNU\u2019s demise in the late 1930s, it never gained such a following.\n\nDid the LNU\u2019s strength mean statesmen conducted foreign policy differently, as Cecil hoped? Were prospects for lasting peace improved by the LNU\u2019s dogged efforts? These are not really McCarthy\u2019s questions. This isn\u2019t so much a book about the League of Nations or indeed about foreign policy: its approach owes more to Tocqueville than to E.H. Carr. McCarthy\u2019s real subject is interwar British democracy, and the LNU is a way to examine its changing practices and norms. Who signed up to be internationalism\u2019s foot soldiers? What kind of culture sustained this popular movement? Trawling through the detritus of branch minutes, pamphlets, memoirs and LNU publications, McCarthy offers some answers.\n\nHer findings won\u2019t surprise anyone familiar with the new social history of those years, or even the middlebrow fiction. The LNU became a genuine popular movement, drawing passionate support from all classes; it also deliberately recruited its leadership from across party lines. Inevitably, however, the organisation took root among those whom Michael Frayn would later call \u2018the Herbivores\u2019: the \u2018do-gooders; the readers of the News Chronicle, the Guardian and the Observer; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the BBC\u2019. Free Church congregations were more likely to join than Anglican ones, Protestants more likely to join than Catholics, and while a small majority of branch members were Conservatives, the organisation\u2019s leadership was dominated by independent-minded intellectuals who were liberals in their ideology if no longer always in their party affiliation. Civic-minded women played a major role but so too did married couples, the LNU acting as a harbinger of a new culture of leisure and sociability in those years.\n\nThe \u2018quiet citizens\u2019 (as McCarthy calls them) threw themselves into the work of supporting \u2018peace\u2019, but it\u2019s how they went about it that\u2019s most revealing. The LNU took the principle of democratic accountability seriously, but it also assumed that \u2018ordinary people\u2019 needed to be instructed in their new role. Education \u2013 some would say propaganda \u2013 was always the first task: branches mounted thousands of lectures and distributed millions of pamphlets, and much work was put into developing innovative classroom materials to teach schoolchildren a narrative of international co-operation. Some 1500 schools-based LNU branches sprang up, with enthusiastic young supporters attending special summer schools or visiting Geneva to observe League bodies at work.\n\nYet the message those schoolchildren received was strangely apolitical. Co-operation was the watchword, to such an extent that matters of real political disagreement were avoided altogether. The organisation refused to \u2018take sides\u2019 on such issues as the General Strike and the Spanish Civil War. It was also adamantly non-partisan, insisting that citizens of all political faiths, from the convinced socialist to the true-blue imperialist, belonged in its ranks. Indeed, the empire, at its height in those years, was seen as entirely compatible with internationalism, being portrayed in LNU literature not as the source of Britain\u2019s global power, much less as a catalyst for international resentments or colonial rebellion, but as a model of harmonious development and interracial co-operation that other empires would do well to follow, or even as the prototype for the League itself.\n\nMcCarthy shows that the LNU\u2019s inclusive rhetoric did little to challenge and much to reinforce the social and intellectual hierarchies of the time. Every Conservative and every Labour voter, every mistress and every maid should support the League cause \u2013 so the LNU said. Yet the organisation\u2019s belief in the \u2018possibility of social consensus under conditions of social inequality\u2019, its easy assumption that the mistresses would be on the platform and the maids in the audience, inevitably appealed more to those who were satisfied with the status quo than those who were not. Trade unionists accustomed to a more plain-speaking (and masculine) politics found the LNU mealy-mouthed and patronising; the maids weighed the pleasures of LNU lectures and opted for the cinema. The organisation\u2019s determination to recruit from all political parties, too, may have done more to obscure than to bridge real ideological divides. Too quick to be satisfied with formal professions of faith, the LNU was slow to acknowledge the conditions and caveats party leaders put on their support. Only when the Chamberlain government made clear that its foreign policy was no longer based on the Covenant \u2013 since the League, as Chamberlain put it in February 1938, was now \u2018unable to provide collective security for anybody\u2019 \u2013 did the LNU realise it had to take sides. But once it took on the Conservative government, the illusion that it was above party crumbled and with it much of its middlebrow support. Although formal membership remained at almost 200,000 in 1939, the circulation of Headway, the LNU\u2019s organ, plummeted from 100,000 in the early 1930s to 8000 in 1939 \u2013 a good indicator of the scale of the catastrophe. With battle lines hardening, the Herbivores fled.\n\nThe League of Nations Union in McCarthy\u2019s account was not only a vehicle for mobilising people behind the liberal internationalist cause but also one of the many civic institutions that defined the peculiar political culture of interwar Britain. Activist but deeply anxious about civic or partisan strife, this culture prioritised social harmony, even if that meant differences were swept under the carpet. Indeed, just how determined the \u2018party of humankind\u2019 was to rule social conflict out of bounds is made clear in a second recent study, of the massive mobilisation of volunteers during the 1926 General Strike.\n\nThat strike has always had an odd place in British history. Though it was the largest 20th-century industrial action, neither at the time nor subsequently have people known quite what to make of it. Called by the General Council of the TUC in support of the miners\u2019 struggle to avoid draconian wage cuts in a poorly run industry being weaned off government subsidy, the strike was an astonishingly successful demonstration of working-class resolve. Between 1.5 and 3 million of a unionised workforce of around 6 million walked out on 4 May, bringing virtually all hauling, loading, lifting, drilling, driving, stoking and even typesetting to a standstill. If the goal was to secure specific economic concessions, however, the strike was an ignominious failure. With neither the miners nor the mine-owners interested in compromise, the Conservative government determined not to negotiate, the TUC itself very reluctant to escalate matters, and, crucially, tens of thousands of volunteers falling over themselves to take over the strikers\u2019 work, the General Council simply called the action off on the ninth day. Many strikers returned to face harsher conditions or victimisation, but the miners, living up to their unrivalled reputation for courage and cussedness, stayed out for seven months \u2013 a bitter and scarring experience eerily replayed nearly six decades later.\n\nOddly, however, the General Strike isn\u2019t remembered this way. That is, unlike (say) Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s decision to form the National Government in 1931, or even Callaghan\u2019s handling of the Winter of Discontent in 1979, the strike is not remembered as one of the labour movement\u2019s great failures. Instead, it is usually recalled (if at all) as a crisis that failed to happen, or even as the moment when Britain faced the prospect of revolution and turned aside. The fact that the strike was conducted virtually without violence and, as Beatrice Webb put it in her diary, opened \u2018with a football match between the police and the strikers\u2019 and ended \u2018with densely packed reconciliation services at all the chapels and churches of Great Britain\u2019, was taken not only by almost the whole of the press but even by Webb as evidence of \u2018what a sane people the British are\u2019. The \u2018British workman\u2019 could never be turned into a \u2018Russian Red\u2019, or the \u2018British businessman and country gentleman into an Italian Fascist\u2019. British culture was immunised against the Continental viruses of open class antagonism and political extremism.\n\nRachelle Hope Saltzman\u2019s study of the activities and attitudes of the hundreds of thousands of strike volunteers allows us to look more carefully into that celebratory narrative. Saltzman seems an unlikely chronicler of the events: she is American (as I am); she conducted her research for this book in the bitter aftermath of another miners\u2019 strike in the mid-1980s, returning to it several decades later; and, most unusually, she is a folklorist, not a historian, drawn to this episode mostly for its playful, world-turned-upside-down character. The book, as a result, has its limitations: there is no real account of the causes and course of the strike itself or of the shadowy government organisation that enrolled the volunteers, and some historiographical judgments (the claim, for example, that \u2018with the exception of the Civil War and the Industrial Revolution, the 1926 General Strike may well be the most written about and reimagined event in British history\u2019) are naive or just plain wrong. But for all that, the book succeeds in drawing on memoirs, newspaper articles and a great many marvellous interviews to capture the motivations and experiences of the many thousands of men and women who volunteered to keep basic services running.\n\nThe strike emerges not as a great national festival but as a ritual enactment of the politics of class. Although there were working-class volunteers, the great majority of those who signed up to drive lorries, deliver supplies or run canteens were not. They were not all the Oxford men of popular legend, of course (although the ancient universities did decant their students en masse), but they did not, let us say, aspire to hold the post of delivery man on a permanent basis. They took on these tasks in the belief they were defending \u2018the country\u2019 against the forces of chaos: as the son of two volunteers explained, it never occurred to his parents that they were \u2018strike-breakers\u2019. They saw what they did as \u2018a return to \u2026 wartime service\u2019. Volunteers insisted that they were not anti-Labour but rather \u2018for their country\u2019. As one Girton alumna put it, while they were sorry for the miners, they thought the strike had to be defeated, \u2018as it was based on the rule of force rather than law\u2019.\n\nServants of the law they might have been, but if Saltzman\u2019s sources are to be believed those undergraduates and bank managers had a whale of a time, and their status as \u2018volunteers\u2019 gave them a high degree of licence. Careening a mile or two off the scheduled bus route to deliver a pretty girl to her front door was treated not as a sacking offence but as a sign of chivalry or high spirits; society mothers were said to have seized a chance to introduce their daughters to eligible young men. Driving trains and bedding down in impromptu barracks after a celebratory beer could be great fun, and the accompanying chorus of praise must have been pleasant too. When this \u2018lark for the sake of the country\u2019 was over, the volunteers went back to their books or banks in a haze of self-congratulation, surely agreeing with the newspaper that proclaimed: \u2018Truly, we are an amazing people.\u2019\n\nThere is at once something admirable and terrible about the mindset revealed in this episode. On the one hand, volunteers showed a level of energy, pluck and concern for the common good that seems remarkable today: that they would spring to the defence of their country went without saying. Yet what they were defending was, after all, the idea that the \u2018economic weapon\u2019 of the General Strike, unlike the \u2018economic weapon\u2019 of sanctions, was beyond the pale, and that the fate of a million miners could not \u2013 if \u2018the constitution\u2019 were to survive \u2013 be a matter for state action. \u2018Constitutional government is fighting for its life,\u2019 Neville Chamberlain, by no means one of the hardest of the government\u2019s \u2018hard men\u2019 (that would be Churchill), wrote in the middle of the strike, and many Britons \u2013 including not a few trade union leaders \u2013 agreed with him. But if one didn\u2019t take quite such an apocalyptic view, or perhaps even thought that managing the coal industry was the government\u2019s job, the volunteers\u2019 readiness to have a week\u2019s fun driving trains had a nasty undertone. Christopher Isherwood, remembering the episode in Lions and Shadows two decades later, thought it revealed not the splendid sanity and patriotism of the British but how deeply entrenched the class system was. For \u2018the Poshocracy had won, as it always did win, in a thoroughly gentlemanly manner,\u2019 and so completely that it could now \u2018pretend that nothing more serious had taken place than, so to speak, a jolly sham fight with pats of butter\u2019. See how easily we can do without you, the volunteers seemed to tell the strikers. It turns out that we \u2013 not you \u2013 are essential to the country, and don\u2019t you forget it.\n\nNothing is more revealing of the power of this ideology than the fact that Saltzman, probably unconsciously and against her avowed political affiliations, herself succumbs to it. Her prose incorporates the opposition between the trade unions and \u2018the public\u2019, the working class and the \u2018country\u2019, that Conservatism promulgated at the time. She tells us, for example, that workers in more than two hundred unions struck to support a million miners, but then adds that even so \u2018the general public\u2019s hostility to being inconvenienced outweighed much of the sympathy they might have felt for the miners\u2019 plight\u2019 \u2013 a formulation that excludes the strikers, not to mention a million miners, from the \u2018general public\u2019. Labour\u2019s claims, we learn, had \u2018little resonance for anyone other than the working classes and the intellectual left\u2019, an odd dismissal given that the majority of the population was working class. Sentences like this take for granted precisely that class hegemony that demands explanation.\n\nStudies of interwar political culture have proliferated in recent years, as historians have argued that the sources of Britain\u2019s atypical stability and \u2018constitutionalism\u2019 are to be found there. McCarthy and Saltzman echo those arguments, but their recovery of the activism and commitment of ordinary citizens is welcome and new. British politicians didn\u2019t lay such stress on conciliation between the wars simply because its weary citizenry had retreated from politics to tend their herbaceous borders: they did so because the better-off portion of the population, accustomed to considering itself \u2018the nation\u2019, was willing to drive trains or deliver supplies to defend that status quo. But if both books portray mobilisation in defence of \u2018peace\u2019, the peace the LNU sought was in the first instance international and not domestic. It\u2019s thus worth asking whether McCarthy\u2019s argument about the fixation on social harmony and its likely effect on social differences would hold in the international realm as well. Did the LNU\u2019s inclusive internationalist rhetoric increase transnational understanding or justify Britain\u2019s global hegemony? Were those hundreds of thousands of British citizens truly a force for reconciliation?\n\nMcCarthy doesn\u2019t ask this question: had she done so, she might have been driven towards something uncomfortable. For the complacency and aversion to political conflict that were the LNU\u2019s besetting sins also affected its foreign policies, quite possibly with damaging effects. The LNU tended to assume that Britain was the League\u2019s strongest supporter because it was the most selflessly internationalist power: what it couldn\u2019t quite acknowledge was that Britain could play that role because the League was very largely a British creation, formed in the wake of a war the British Empire had won (insofar as any state won) and to enforce settlements the British had crafted. But other states were well aware of, and resented, that bias. While the British tended to think of the League\u2019s mandates system as a means of raising colonial administration to the level of international \u2018best practice\u2019 (which they assumed was British practice), the French saw it as a British scheme aimed at forcing the French to govern their territories to suit British ends, and the Germans as nothing more than an excuse for annexation. Perhaps a more forthright acknowledgment of British interests \u2013 as, in the domestic realm, a more forthright acknowledgment of class interest \u2013 would have provided a more realistic basis for \u2018conciliation\u2019, but such thinking ran against the \u2018selflessness\u2019 that was believed to be the only honourable basis for voice. Just as Saltzman\u2019s volunteers insisted they represented \u2018the country\u2019 and not their class, so McCarthy\u2019s League supporters were certain they defended \u2018civilisation\u2019 or \u2018humanity\u2019 and not their nation, and did not ask why British interests and \u2018humanity\u2019s\u2019 interests seemed so often to coincide. \u2018Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat,\u2019 Proudhon once wrote \u2013 an untrue statement, but one that internationalists would do well to ponder."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230204522_3", "page_content": "William Gienapp, \u2018The Myth of Class in Jacksonian America\u2019, Journal of Policy History, vol. 6, no. 2 (1994), pp. 232\u20139, 277\u201381.\n\nSusan R.

Lee also boasts a career record of 84-12 through three seasons in Happy Valley.\n\n149 pounds: Zain Retherford\n\nAffectionately dubbed \"The Zain Train,\" Zain Retherford was a force for Penn State all four years he was in the lineup.\n\nThe Benton, Pennsylvania, native, captured three NCAA titles at 149 pounds and holds the program record for most consecutive wins with 93.
