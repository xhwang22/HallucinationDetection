{"Eleanor Arnason's work often focuses on themes of gender, ecology, and Native American culture.": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186315.Ring_of_Swords", "page_content": "Ring of Swords is a classic feminist science fiction novel from 1994. In terms of gender and sexuality, it shows its ages in ways you would expect, but it still holds up as an intriguing first contact novel.Humanity has made contact with only one other sentient people, the Hwarhath, but they have been locked into war for fifty years. Now, the humans and Hwarhath are finally sitting down to negotiate a peace, but they know so little about each other.Anna Perez is a biologist studying the native sea creatures of the planet where the humans and Hwarhath have decided to have their talks. She\u2019s more interested in her work than the talks \u2014 she thinks that one of the species may be sentient, although none of her colleagues believe her. However, she is drawn into the process when she befriends a human who\u2019s working for the Hwarhath. Nicholas Sanders was an intelligence operative captured by the Hwarhath during the war, and he has chosen to ally himself with them, largely because of his romantic relationship with a Hwarhath general. The human military regards him as a traitor to his species, and they want to use Anna to spy on him.Before I delve into the plotting and characterization, I want to go ahead and talk about the way Ring of Swords deals with gender and sexuality. Part of the difficulty the humans and Hwarhath have understanding each other is that the Hwarhath have very rigid gender roles. It\u2019s a matriarchal society where the women run the home, and the men are sent outside of it to become soldiers. Since the species unified under a single government, they as a society didn\u2019t know what to do with their men when there wasn\u2019t a war to fight. Thus, when humans were discovered, they were rejoiced as an enemy for the Hwarhath men to combat.In Hwarhath society, men and women largely live separately and sexual acts or attraction between men and women is deeply taboo. Instead, same-sex relations are the norm. The find human society\u2019s focus on heterosexuality deeply disturbing and many of the humans are likewise disturbed by the aliens\u2019 homosexuality. This is one of the ways in which Ring of Swords shows its age. The attitudes around same-sex attraction have changed a lot since Arnason wrote the novel, and thus the attitudes presented by these futuristic humans seem outdated. I\u2019m not saying that homophobia doesn\u2019t exist anymore! But things have changed so much, so it doesn\u2019t make sense that the human diplomatic core would act like homosexuality was that taboo.Another issue with the treatment of gender and sexuality in Ring of Swords is that it\u2019s incredibly binary. Everyone is either cis men or cis women, and there\u2019s no recognition of non-binary or trans people. This is something I\u2019ve encountered with a lot of older feminist sci-fi, so it wasn\u2019t exactly surprising. The novel also deals with sexuality as almost a purely homo/hetero binary and contains no reference to the possibility of multiple gender attraction. There is one reference to Hwarhath who prefer not to have sex with either men or women, which could be taken to mean that asexuality is recognized among them (I took it to mean such, although I don\u2019t know what Arnason\u2019s intentions were exactly). It\u2019s mentioned that this isn\u2019t seen as an issue, although I still think it would suck to be an ace Hwarhath.As I mentioned before, a lot of this is what I expect from 90\u2019s feminism (although the potential inclusion of ace people was a surprise). I don\u2019t expect a book written in the 90\u2019s to have 2018 feminism, and I\u2019m sure it was more revolutionary when it was published. Heck, it probably helped pave the way for the more inclusive feminist sci-fi we have now.The only other cultural criticism I have of Ring of Swords is that it was very Western-centric in how it presented human norms. What it presented as normal for humans was actually normal for the West. I feel like it flattened a lot of the diversity present in family structure and gender roles throughout humanity. For instance, a noted difference between the Hwarhath and humans was that Hwarhath lived in large communities of extended families and that humans lived in nuclear families. And, uh, that\u2019s presenting a brief slice of a small segment of the population as something universal? I\u2019m a lot less willing to excuse this sort of Western-centric bias than I am the portrayal of gender and sexuality\u2026 although bisexual and trans people did have some recognition in the 90\u2019s, so \u201ca product of its time\u201d doesn\u2019t fully work in that regard either.Although these elements don\u2019t really hold up to a modern-day feminist scrutiny, I still enjoyed analyzing them. Also, I generally like books about aliens! Aliens are fun. And I do like first contact stories where two groups of people struggle to understand and communicate with each other, so in that way, Ring of Swords was right up my alley.Ring of Swords is a slower paced story and not super actiony. It\u2019s more thoughtful and character focused. Third person sections focusing on Anna make up the majority, although it also includes some first-person diary entries from Nicolas. I enjoyed Anna as a protagonist. Other reviewers have called her cold, and maybe she is on the surface. But underneath she\u2019s full of a burning curiosity to understand the world around her and to reach out and make connections across species.If you\u2019re in want of an anthropological science fiction novel, you should give Ring of Swords a go.Review from The Illustrated Page.\n\nJennifer Collins December 16, 2019 There were moments when I was utterly in love with this book--with the concept, the characters, and the story itself--but there were other points when I have to admit I just couldn't get engaged. I think what it comes down to is that, although Arnason's writing and story are impressive, I desperately wanted more depth to the characters and a bit more intricacy to the story. It all sometimes felt a little too simple, the characters a little too flat, for me to feel like I could sink into the story and feel it. In the end, I'm glad to have read it, but I'm not sure whether or not I'll read more of Aranason's work, as it really left me wanting more by the end (but not in a good way).\n\nJesse L October 9, 2017 Total surprise here - loved this book! Stumbled across it on some good scifi recs and was really pleasantly surprised. Culture, politics, language, sexuality, gender all come into play in this book - the writing was great and flowed so well I rarely put it down and read it over the course of a few days. Her characters were very interesting, and the cultural differences between the hwarhath and the humans were very thought provoking for sure. Definite recommend if you're into cultural commentary in scifi. The plot is somehow dry (in a good way) and fast paced and intriguing all at once.\n\nTom September 23, 2020 Just about OK. I'm sure the homosexual aliens would have been more exciting when it was released in 1993, but that concept just feels like a nice note in the anthropological exploration of some aliens that is 75% of the book.\n\nThe other 25% is some interesting political back and forth, but between characters that are a bit flat and unexciting, so I never found myself particularly caring what happened to them.\n\nDefinitely better than most generic sci-fi, but doesn't really compare against the really good stuff. Too much anthropology and not enough interesting characters or plot.\n\nTxisko February 23, 2023 Le\u00eddo hasta la p\u00e1gina 245 de 395.\n\nAburrido, sin ning\u00fan tipo de gancho, con mal ritmo que a veces se vuelve sopor\u00edfero.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la relaci\u00f3n entre Nicholas y el peluche (del todo forzada) se carga la suspensi\u00f3n de incredulidad. \u00bfEn serio se puede creer alguien que, por pura casualidad (entre todos los capturados y los dirigentes), justo ese par de individuos den pie a tal relaci\u00f3n? Resulta mucho m\u00e1s probable que no surja nada (o a lo m\u00e1s un respeto mutuo similar a \"Enemigo m\u00edo\") a que se cree algo como lo que se describe.\n\nStig Edvartsen July 16, 2017 Surprised this book is not more well known.\n\n\n\nIt's a smart and thoughtful book about morals, ethics, rules of engagement in war, sexuality and how we as a society deal with violence. Rounded characters, good dialogue and an unpredictable story makes this a page-turner. It is hampered somewhat by a surprisingly passive protagonist, but that could possibly have been done on purpose to illustrate thought vs action.\n\n\n\n\n\nSalvador Echavarria August 3, 2017 Interesante ver el choque culturar de las dos especies, donde los roles de lo masculino y lo femenino toman gran importancia. Una civilizaci\u00f3n regida por valores y eticas distintas que a los humanos, pero quiza no por ello mejores, o quiza si. Sin duda leer sobre una especie practicante de la homosexualidad y que aborrece la heterosexualidad humana resultara interesante. Mi unica pega es que me resulto un poco lento el comienzo, pero de ah\u00ed en fuera todo muy bien.\n\nKat March 29, 2020 3.5 stars, it's a touch clunky but in the very 80s/90s SF way that I just find quite endearing.\n\n\n\nThis probably doesn't warrant a spoiler tag but I couldn't help comparing the rigid gender divisions of the society of the furry aliens to the rigid gender divisions of the society of the furry aliens in C.J. Cherryh's Chanur series. I liked Cherryh's cat people and their society a lot more but this is definitely the better book.

Word Count: 274\n\nWhat happens when human beings venture light years into space to explore a planet inhabited by a technologically primitive race? Will they advance, retard, or preserve the indigenous cultures? Will their own habits and values be altered by their anthropological inquiries? These and similar questions are raised by Eleanor Arnason\u2019s first effort in the field of science fiction, A WOMAN OF THE IRON PEOPLE.\n\nExiled by her people for violating the customary separation of men and women, Nia, the title character, is self-reliant, compassionate, and utterly believable. Most reader will be caught up in her story right from the outset.\n\nEqually believable is the cultural continuity and variety of Nia\u2019s people and the surrounding tribes. These \u201caliens\u201d are radically different from us\u2014for example, in their gender relationships and in the fact that they are fur-covered\u2014yet also profoundly similar in their basic needs and passions. Arnason succeeds wonderfully in making Nia\u2019s world come alive.\n\nThe book\u2019s humans are also well characterized, particularly Lixia, an anthropologist who narrates the bulk of the story. Unfortunately, the social organization and history of these futuristic human beings remain sketchy and unconvincing.\n\nThe book has two other weaknesses. First, it concludes with so many loose ends that one can sniff a sequel just over the horizon. (Arnason\u2019s earlier books were in the fantasy genre, where sequels are the rule.) In addition, the book\u2019s dust jacket illustration is annoyingly \u201csexploitive\u201d and completely unrelated to the novel.\n\nThe realism and richness of Nia and her world more than make up for these shortcomings. A WOMAN OF THE IRON PEOPLE is thoroughly entertaining and provocative."}, {"url": "https://blog.pmpress.org/authors-artists-comrades/eleanor-arnason/", "page_content": "Eleanor Arnason\n\nEver since her first story was published in the revolutionary New Worlds in 1972, Eleanor Arnason has been acknowledged as the heir to the feminist legacy of Russ and Le Guin.

Since then, she has published six novels, three short story collections, a couple of chapbooks and some poetry. Her novel A Woman of the Iron People won the James Tiptree Jr. and the Mythopoeic Society Awards; her novel Ring of Swords won a Minnesota Book Award; and her short story \u201cDapple\u201d won the Spectrum Award. A collection of her Icelandic fantasies came out in 2014. She has since written four more stories about Icelandic ghosts, trolls, elves and ordinary people. This is one. \u201cThe Graveyard\u201d is Arnason\u2019s first appearance in Uncanny, a beautifully crafted tale that weaves together folklore and history.\n\nUncanny Magazine: I love the structure of this story\u2014we are reading the account of a narrator who is hearing about the ghosts from a curator, who in turn has heard the story from Atli. Why did you choose this structure?\n\nEleanor Arnason: The story begins with an actual conversation I had with the curator of a historical site in Iceland. She told me about a farmer who didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but had to deal with them. But there was no end to her story. The curator didn\u2019t tell me what happened to the farmer. So, I rewrote her narrative and added an ending. The layering\u2014the narrator who is told the story by the curator, who is in turn told the story by the farmer\u2014came out of the actual situation.\n\nUncanny Magazine: What was the easiest part of writing this story? What was the most challenging thing?\n\nEleanor Arnason: The easiest part was the beginning, since I had a real (I think) incident. The hard part was finding an ending. I wanted to keep the uncertainty. Were the ghosts real? Did the characters end by believing in ghosts? And I wanted to keep the story pragmatic: the farmer had a problem. How was he going to solve it? What\u2019s more important than believing in the ghosts is finding a way to get rid of them.\n\nUncanny Magazine: \u201cThe Graveyard\u201d has a lovely anthropological feel to it, centering on a cultural conflict and weaving together Icelandic folklore and history, which are recurring topics in your work. What other topics or themes do you find yourself drawn to repeatedly?\n\nEleanor Arnason: A lot of my fiction is about social stereotypes and characters who don\u2019t fit into the roles they are assigned by society. I come out of the Second Wave of Feminism, which hit SF in the late 1960s and was very strong through the 1970s. (Theodore Sturgeon said all the good new writers in the 1970s were women, except for James Tiptree Jr.) So I do a lot with gender roles. My characters want to be something they can\u2019t be in their society, because of their gender. Sometimes they succeed in being the people they want to be. Sometimes they don\u2019t manage. But I give them tolerable lives. There is enough suffering in the world.\n\nMy Icelandic stories are different. Not about gender, for the most part. They are about people who get in difficult situations which are often supernatural and struggle to get out of the situations and get on with their lives. Maybe the commonality with the gender stories is the struggle to have one\u2019s own life. Atli has to find a way to calm down the ghosts and to get the Icelandic-American businessman to stop bothering the graveyard. There is nothing epic about this: he\u2019s not like Frodo. He just wants to get on with his life.\n\nMany of my Icelandic stories are about history: the land is built on the past, as my curator says. A lot of my Icelandic characters are trying to come to terms with the past and the folklore of their country: ghosts, trolls, elves. I am not a fan of Icelandic elves, who seem like rich people, indifferent to the suffering of the poor. But I sometimes write about them. I like trolls, which I see as ordinary people, though very large and rock-like, who struggle to get by. Ghosts are past all effort. Though they can complain.\n\nWriting the above I thought of the famous lines by Karl Marx in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: \u201cMen make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s what my fiction is about: trying to make a decent life in spite the rules of one\u2019s society and the weight of the past.\n\nUncanny Magazine: Do you believe in ghosts?\n\nEleanor Arnason: No, but neither did the farmer. I am not invested in not believing in ghosts. If I meet one, I will believe in it.\n\nUncanny Magazine: You\u2019ve been writing short stories since the 1970s, and have published dozens of short stories and three collections. What draws you to short fiction? Which writers or stories do you consider to be your strongest influences?\n\nEleanor Arnason: I think my natural length is the short story. I especially like long short stories, novelettes. But I write a fair number of classic-length short stories. I\u2019m a slow writer and writing a novel takes forever. So I like the shortness of short fiction, and the fact that\u2014written well\u2014it can have a density and tightness that\u2019s hard to get in a novel. It\u2019s hard to write a flawless novel, though Jane Austen managed in Pride and Prejudice. But you can write a close to flawless short story.\n\nI think Ursula K. Le Guin is an obvious influence on my work. Possibly Jane Austen as well. I have read Austen\u2019s novels over and over. I love her wit and clear-sightedness and extreme skill as a writer. Very obviously medieval Icelandic literature has influenced me, especially the Icelandic family sagas, not only in my Icelandic stories. My brother says he can see the influence of the sagas in everything I write. (I grant that Austen and the sagas are an odd combination. But it\u2019s what I grew up with.)\n\nUncanny Magazine: What are you working on next?\n\nEleanor Arnason: I have just finished another couple of Icelandic stories. Then I will take a break from Iceland. I have a story about a journalist who gets an assignment to interview the ghost of Hugo Chavez, the former president of Venezuela, to find out if he was involved in the 2020 American election. (Some of Trump\u2019s allies say Chavez helped steal the election. Chavez has been dead since 2013, as people keep pointing out.) I\u2019m still tinkering with that one. I think it will be difficult to sell. And I have started a story about Yu the Great, who founded the first Chinese imperial dynasty, assuming he actually existed. What I like about him is he\u2019s credited with taming the floods on the Yellow River. Imperial China was founded by an engineer! Of course, he was a supernatural engineer, helped by a yellow dragon and a gigantic black turtle. He was also, according to the Chinese stories, an exemplary person and devoted to the common people. Not all my stories work out. These last two may or may not.\n\nUncanny Magazine: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!\n\n\u00a9 2021 Uncanny Magazine"}, {"url": "https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/arnason_eleanor", "page_content": "Arnason, Eleanor\n\nEntry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.\n\n(1942- ) US author who began to publish sf with \"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" for New Worlds 6: The Science Fiction Quarterly (anth 1973; vt New Worlds #5 1974) edited by Michael Moorcock and Charles Platt. She has since published stories and poems with some regularity; a selection has appeared as Ordinary People (coll 2005). Her first novel, The Sword Smith (1978), is a Fantasy notable for the spare elegance of its narrative, which focuses with modest intensity upon its young protagonist's slow grasp of life's meaning; Daughter of the Bear King (1987) is also fantasy. Arnason's first sf novel, To the Resurrection Station (1986), which is suffused with Gothic imagery, brings a wide range of characters together in contexts which wittily embody Feminist readings of the world. With A Woman of the Iron People (1991; vt 2vols as In the Light of Sigma Draconis 1992 and Changing Women 1992), which won a James Tiptree Jr Award, Arnason came suddenly to wider notice. The long tale is set on a complicated stage: on the planet of Sigma Draconis II, inhabited by an Alien race seemingly in thrall \u2013 as is frequently the case in 1980s sf \u2013 to the imperatives of a sexually coercive biology (see Sex), a party of Terrans is attempting to come to some understanding of this species. The plot, in true Planetary Romance fashion, takes two humans and two aliens on a trek through the various domains and landscapes of the world, and lessons not unlike those taught in The Sword Smith \u2013 though far more complexly put \u2013 are imparted with regard to sexual dimorphism, the nature of violence and the intrinsic value of individual persons; and evidence is presented that Homo sapiens may have learned some wisdom from the Disasters which, prior to the novel's timespan, had almost destroyed Earth.\n\nSimilar dilemmas are examined, even more sharply, in the first story in the Hwarhath sequence, Ring of Swords (1993), where an interstellar war between humans and the Alien hwarhath, is at the point of being resolved in mutual understanding, or exploding calamitously. The chaotic ruthlessness of humanity, and the rigid gender separation of the hwarhath, are scrupulously exposed and judged in scenes of very considerable intellectual force; and the outcome \u2013 as perceived by some of the most complexly conceived characters in modern sf \u2013 is hopeful. Beginning with \"The Hound of Merin\" (in Xanadu, anth 1993 ed Jane Yolen and Martin H Greenberg), Arnason continued the sequence through an array of linked stories, all told from the hwarhath point of view; they have been assembled as Hwarhath Stories: Transgressive Tales by Aliens (coll of linked stories 2016), and complexly represent, especially in novellas like \"Dapple: A Hwarhath Historical Romance\" (September 1999 Asimov's) and \"The Potter of Bones\" (September 2000 Asimov's), an Anthropological perspective on Homo sapiens (in particular) that has over the years proved increasingly intense, evoking a number of comparisons with her older contemporary, Ursula K Le Guin. Such comparisons usefully point to what might be called the methodical brilliance of both authors, whenever a culture is to be examined, and its folk given their space to speak to us. More exuberantly, Big Mama Stories (coll 2013) applies Arnason's characteristic approach to a series of Tall Tales [see The Encyclopedia of Fantasy under links below] set in intergalactic space; Hidden Folk: Icelandic Fantasies (coll 2014), on the other hand, is unified by its focus on the folklore of Iceland.

In 1978, she published her first novel, the coming-of-age saga The Sword Smith, and readily established herself as a proficient stylist. Arnason followed The Sword Smith with To the Resurrection Station, which concerns romantic entanglements on a space colony. Belinda Smith, the tale's heroine, is a young woman capable of prompting bizarre physical changes in herself and others within range of her powers. Belinda is studying at a colony college when she is abruptly withdrawn from school and informed that a marriage has been arranged between herself and a native. Furthermore, Belinda is informed that she is herself half-native, half-Earthling. Complications ensue when Claude, the native to whom Belinda has been pledged in matrimony, falls in love with Belinda's college roommate, Marianne, who is, in turn, secretly married. After a series of adventures, Belinda and Claude, together with a helpful robot, arrive on Earth only to discover that most humans have been eliminated following a war with genetically engineered rats. More escapades ensue before Belinda, Claude, and the robot manage to escape from Earth and head into space.\n\nArnason next published Daughter of the Bear King, the story of Esperance Olson, a middle-aged Minneapolis homemaker who is electrocuted by her washing machine and consequently finds herself in an alternate world where she possesses magic powers, including the ability to transform herself into a bear. Olson is told by inhabitants of this other world that she actually hails from it too, and that, as daughter of the Bear King, she holds the ability to rid this other world of such creatures as dragons, cockroaches, and snail-chicken hybrids, all of whom threaten to overrun the world in plague-like numbers. Olson somehow manages a return to Minneapolis, only to be pursued by countless gruesome creatures that exert an unpleasant influence on the doings within her community. A reviewer for the Washington Post Book World proclaimed Daughter of the Bear King \"quite simply the most enjoyable fantasy novel I have ever read.\"\n\nA Woman of the Iron People, Arnason's next novel, was described by reviewer Richard Grant, writing in the Washington Post Book World, as \"good old-fashioned science fiction of a certain type,\" which he dubbed \"speculative anthropology.\" This tale, which was also published in two volumes as In the Light of Sigma Draconis and Changing Women, concerns a clash of cultures that commences after a team of eight Earthlings arrives on a faraway planet to study life there. The natives on this planet, although intelligent, are technologically inferior to the Earthlings. Their culture is a relatively primitive one in which natives abstain from sexual activity except during a brief mating period. At other times the native women and children devote themselves to handcrafts and live separate from the males. Complications develop when one of the human observers, Lixia, becomes drawn to Nia, a renegade female native whose conduct sometimes bears greater similarities to males then it does to her own gender. Grant, in his Washington Post Book World appraisal, deemed A Woman of the Iron People \"lively, stimulating, intelligent, subtle and even witty.\"\n\nIn 1993, Arnason produced Ring of Swords, in which she again pursued the notion of clashing cultures. In this novel Earthlings travel to a distant planet and commence peace negotiations with the world's warmongering males, the hwarhaths. Nicolas, the Earthling translator, has forsaken his species and become the homosexual lover of a hwarhath general. Meanwhile, the human biologist Anna Perez has been imprisoned by her fellow Earthlings, who accuse her of espionage. When Anna is rescued by a daring band of hwarhaths, she realizes a significant opportunity for conducting further studies into the native culture. Among her discoveries is that the hwarhaths are actually grateful that the Earthlings have arrived and thus become opponents in a highly anticipated conflict. John Stadek, in his review of Rings of Swords for the Washington Post Book World, affirmed that Arnason \"has a knack for inventing very human aliens.\" He added that he \"enjoyed every page\" of Arnason's novel.\n\nArnason's short-story collection, Ordinary People, contains six stories, a poem, and the transcript of a speech given by the author. The title suggests that while Arnason's alien characters may look strange, they are really just common, everyday people trying to make their living. In one story, structured like a traditional fairy tale, five daughters take their portion of their mother's heritage and seek their way in the world with it. The catch is that the mother's heritage is language, and one daughter is given nouns, another verbs, and so on. In the end, the prepositions, which might seem like the least useful group, turn out to be the greatest treasure. Arnason also revisits the setting of Ring of Swords in a story that tells of two lovers breaking the taboo of heterosexual love. Reviewing the book for Tangent Short Fiction Review, Lois Tilton voiced some disappointment that there was no new work in it, but added: \"What it does provide is a new look at the range of her fiction, and more good reason than ever to wish for more new stories.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAnalog Science Fiction/Science Fact, June, 1987, Tom Easton, review of To the Resurrection Station, pp. 183-184.\n\nLambda Book Report, September-October, 1993, Susanna J.

The cover in the sidebar is for the former (the uglier cover of the two, and one that has no recognizable connection with the story); the other information is for both books combined. It's really a single novel, however, and I recommend reading it in that form. If you've happened across the mass market edition, plan on reading it back-to-back.\n\nThe co-winner of the first Tiptree award and also the (rather surprising) winner of a Mythopoeic award, A Woman of the Iron People is an anthropological first-contact novel. It's told primarily in the first person by the human researcher Lixia, who is one of eight specialists sent down onto an inhabited planet by a human exploration mission. The natives are humanoid but furred and are at (roughly) a bronze-age level of technology, divided into groups of villages that specialize in a particular technology. We meet a native named Nia, a blacksmith from the iron people, in the first chapter of the book, and Lixia then meets her in the second chapter and eventually forms a close friendship with her. She and Lixia are the focuses around which the story forms.\n\nThis is first contact as slow and deliberate anthropological exploration by humans who are deeply concerned about negatively influencing the native inhabitants. We slowly realize that the world from which Lixia comes is nearly as foreign to us as the world that she's exploring: there's been some type of ecological collapse and apparently a partial governmental collapse as well, capitalism is thoroughly discredited, and one of the factions on the ship seems to be partly Maoist (although a version of Maoism that leans towards the better characteristics of the philosophy). Lixia herself was apparently previously embedded in a group that sounds like back-to-nature primitives. And when we meet a second anthropologist, he's from a culture in California that appears to combine a close relationship with nature with some aspects of California surfer, hippie, and drug cultures. While the anthropologists are understanding the native culture, the reader is piecing together a picture of what happened to Earth.\n\nThe most likely comparison here is to Le Guin, and Arnason has a similar slow pace and detailed examination of local culture as The Dispossessed or The Left Hand of Darkness . Anthropology and careful observation is strongly foregrounded. Lixia collects stories, music, and cultural observations and is always happy for people to explain customs or tell mythical or legendary stories. Her gatherings of story are mostly presented in the book as she finds them, which leads to a slow pace, a lot of conversation, and quite a few mythological digressions. The mythology is somewhat interesting; the songs and poetry much less so, at least for me, and I found most of them painful.\n\nThe native species is somewhat human-like in its social structures, but with a radically different experience of gender and a considerably sharper sexual dimorphism than humans. When they go through puberty, living in the company of others becomes actively uncomfortable for nearly all males and they, with only a few exceptions, leave their home villages to find and then hold territory against other males, living alone. The civilization is therefore strongly female-centric, since only females and children live in the villages. Both males and females have small crafts, and there's an elaborate gift-giving culture, but larger industry is an exclusively female occupation due to male isolationism. Tied into and supporting that cultural organization is a defined yearly period of sexual heat, during which women from the village walk out into the wild lands claimed by men and mate with the first man they find, exchanging gifts and then returning after the week or two of sexual activity.\n\nMost of this is laid out in the first chapter, told from Nia's perspective, but additional complexity and depth are added over the course of the book. Different native cultures handle the biological limitations differently and form different roles for men and women. And Nia herself makes an unusual break with tradition between the first chapter and the point at which Lixia first meets her. One of the slow progressions throughout the book is a possible weakening of the strict gender boundaries of Nia's people.\n\nAll this is occasionally interesting, but it does not constitute a plot, and for me that's the primary weakness of A Woman of the Iron People . There is an overarching problem (learning the natives and then deciding what sort of contact humans should have with them) that is slowly explored over the course of the book, and there are some intermediate goals to give the book structure, but it's mostly a meander across an alien civilization as seen through the eyes of an anthropologist. It usually lacks urgency or much momentum, and parts are filled with wilderness survival. (I once again find it remarkable how much of science fiction is filled with wilderness survival stories, often with quite primitive technology.) For a while, it looked like the tension would increase towards the conclusion, but despite some relatively dramatic events the book stubbornly maintained a leisurely and introspective pace. It's an interesting statement about both anthropology and about first-contact scenarios, and it feels realistic, but it doesn't make for compelling reading.\n\nThe grounding for the Tiptree award is obvious from the detailed examination of a culture and society with different sexual biology and drastically different resulting gender roles. And that examination is neither static nor concerned only with the typical case; Arnason populates her alien race with dissenters, outcasts, and people who flaunt social norms, and tests those norms in part by looking at their boundaries. Despite the fact that none of it is particularly exciting, it's a thoughtful and deep look at the way gender interacts with society and the consequences and impact of partial rejection of social rules.\n\nThe Mythopoeic award, given to the work most in the spirit of the Inklings (C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, and friends), is much less obvious and puzzled me a bit. I suspect the connection is to C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy , particularly Out of the Silent Planet , which featured a similar human first-contact situation and exploration of an alien culture (although not by an anthropologist). There are some ways in which Arnason's culture is also innocent: large-scale warfare, for example, is unknown, due presumably to a combination of biology rejecting male raiding parties and a culture of small bands in a resource-rich environment. Arnason's concern with innocence is cultural rather than spiritual, but it's a significant theme in the book.\n\nA Woman of the Iron People is not without merits, and I can see why it won the Tiptree. Parts of it I quite enjoyed; Nia and Lixia are both interesting, deep, and enjoyable characters, and I liked the radical changes in human culture that meant I had to figure out the humans at the same time as the aliens. But it's just too slow and too aimless for me to recommend as entertainment. Still, consider giving it a try if you want to see what a full anthropological treatment of first contact might look like.\n\nRating: 6 out of 10\n\nReviewed: 2012-04-20"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Eleanor-Arnason", "page_content": "Eleanor Atwood Arnason (born December 28, 1942) is an American author of science fiction novels and short stories.\n\nArnason's earliest published story, \"A Clear Day in the Motor City\", appeared in New Worlds in 1973. Her work often depicts cultural change and conflict, usually from the viewpoint of characters who cannot or will not live by their own societies' rules. This anthropological focus has led many to compare her fiction to that of Ursula K. Le Guin.\n\nArnason won the first James Tiptree, Jr. Award, the Mythopoeic Award (for A Woman of the Iron People), the Spectrum Award (for \"Dapple\") and the HOMer Award (for her novelette Stellar Harvest). Stellar Harvest was also nominated for a Hugo Award in 2000. In 2003, she was nominated for two Nebula Awards, for her novella Potter of Bones and her short story \"Knapsack Poems\". In 2004, she was guest of honor at WisCon. She lives in Minnesota.\n\nBackground\n\nEleanor Arnason is the daughter of Hjorvadur Harvard Arnason, a Canadian-born man of Icelandic descent, who worked as an art historian and became the director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1951, and Elizabeth Hickcox Yard Arnason, a social worker by profession who spent her childhood in a missionary community in western China. Arnason is the niece of the American feminist Molly Yard, and her maternal grandparents were both Methodist missionaries. This Methodist influence would be visible in her works, most notably in Ring of Swords.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1960, Arnason and her parents lived in Walker's \"Idea House #2\", a futuristic dwelling built next to the Walker Art Center. [1] Arnason has said that her experience growing up around avant-garde artists in a futurist house, in addition to the influence of her feminist, socialist mother contributed to her preoccupation with the future, and consequently science fiction. Prior to 1949, Arnason's family moved frequently: from New York City to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; London; Paris; and St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nShe graduated from Swarthmore College in 1964, with a B.A. in art history, and continued her education in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, until 1967. She spent the next seven years working as an office clerk in Brooklyn and then Detroit. Her time in these blue-collar, racially diverse areas helped to shape her understanding about class consciousness, conflict, and revolution\u2014notions that are reflected in her works. Arnason moved back to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in 1974 and continued to work in offices, warehouses, a large art museum, and more recently, a series of small nonprofits devoted to history, peace, justice, and art.\n\nSince 1994, she has shifted her literary focus from novels to short fiction. She retired in 2009 and now writes full-time.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe issues that transpire most in Arnason's life and writings encompass feminism, peace, social justice, support for the union movement and a deep belief that racism and all forms of prejudice should be opposed. City Pages labelled Arnason as a political radical.\n\nHaving come of age during Second Wave Feminism, Arnason included gender and sexuality as central themes in her work, notably in her collection of hwarhath stories in which she \"wanted to create a society in which homosexual love was normal and heterosexual love was abnormal, sort of as a thought experiment. And because contemporary Americans have very rigid ideas of what is normal.\" The hwarhath stories also addressed issues of gender roles and reproductive rights.\n\nShe was profoundly affected by the McCarthy period, particularly because of the ways that children were taught to securitize against nuclear annihilation. She became involved in the Student Peace Union and attended demonstrations during the Cuban missile crisis. Ring of Swords, Arnason's hwarwath novel, illustrates peace building after a long war; an endeavor both representative of Arnason's peace beliefs and of the Make love, not war politics of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Arnason went to the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom with her mother. This had a profound impact that would be reflected in her story Big Brown Mama and Brer Rabbit in which Brer Rabbit transforms into an African-American man in the early 20th century. Arnason has often opted for racially diverse characters, including, but not limited to, a heroine of Chinese descent in A Woman of the Iron People and a Hispanic heroine in Ring of Swords. In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.\n\nArnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the National Writers Union and engaging in Democratic Farmer Labor Party precinct politics.\n\nStandalone Novels\n\nTo the Resurrection Station (1986)\n\nDaughter of the Bear King (1987)\n\nWoman of the Iron People series\n\nPart 1 In the Light of Sigma Draconis (1991)\n\nPart 2 Changing Women (1991)\n\nA Woman of the Iron People (1991)\n\nStandalone Short Stories\n\n\"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" (1973)\n\n\"The Warlord of Saturn's Moons\" (1974)\n\n\"Ace 167\" (1974)\n\n\"The House by the Sea\" (1975)\n\n\"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (1976) with Ruth Berman\n\n\"Going Down\" (1977)\n\n\"A Ceremony of Discontent\" (1981)\n\n\"The Ivory Comb\" (1982)\n\n\"Glam's Story\" (1987)\n\n\"Among the Featherless Bipeds\" (1988)\n\n\"A Brief History of the Order of St. Cyprian the Athlete\" (1992)\n\n\"The Dog's Story\" (1996)\n\n\"The Venetian Method\" (1998)\n\n\"Feeding the Mother: A Hwarhath Religious Anecdote\" (1998)\n\n\"The Grammarian's Five Daughters\" (1999), available online\n\n\"Origin Story\" (2000)\n\n\"Moby Quilt\" (2001)\n\n\"The Lost Mother: A Story Told by the Divers\" (2002)\n\n\"Knapsack Poems\" (2002)\n\n\"The Potter of Bones\" (2002), available online\n\n\"Big Black mama and Tentacle Man\" (2003)\n\n\"Big Ugly Mama and the Zk\" (2003)\n\n\"Big Green Mama Falls in Love\" (2006) in Eidolon I (ed.
