{"Evan Rachel Wood's film roles include Across the Universe (2007), The Wrestler (2008), and The Ides of March (2011).": [{"url": "https://www.them.us/story/evan-rachel-wood-across-the-universe", "page_content": "It\u2019s something of a miracle that a film like Across The Universe exists in the first place. Set to 34 classic Beatles compositions with limited dialogue, it tells the story of the blossoming romance between an American girl and a Liverpudlian artist, set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and other counterculture movements of the \u201860s. Featuring trippy set pieces, a largely unknown cast, and Bono in a handlebar mustache, Across The Universe is something of a Trojan horse: an audacious arthouse musical disguised as a glossy blockbuster.\n\nThat might explain why the $70 million production opened to a polarized response, and made back only $29 million when it was finally released in 2007, after numerous delays and battles between the studio and director Julie Taymor over its final cut. The film was derided as a box office dud and career setback for its cast of up-and-comers, which included Evan Rachel Wood as an all-American college girl who dreams of changing the world. But in the 11 years since its release, it has grown to become a beloved cult classic \u2014 especially among millennials, who have come to discover the Beatles\u2019 music through Taymor\u2019s technicolor fantasy world of 1960s New York.\n\nThis Sunday, Fathom Events is re-releasing Across The Universe in theaters across the country. And if the film felt of-the-moment in 2007, its focus on activism, protests, queer identity, and art as a means of dismantling government corruption feel particularly resonant in 2018. Wood certainly agrees; since the film\u2019s release, she\u2019s gone on to become one of Hollywood\u2019s most outspoken superstars. Fresh off her recent Emmy nomination for the second season of Westworld, Wood chatted with them. about the legacy of Across The Universe, the rise of #MeToo, and the need for more bi visibility in Hollywood.\n\nAcross The Universe has cultivated such a devoted fanbase over the years, but it\u2019s fair to say that its initial reception wasn\u2019t too positive. Do you think the film was misunderstood upon its original release?\n\nI think it didn't get the power behind it that it needed. There was some turmoil because the studio wanted to make a lot of changes and we all felt like it wasn't the movie that we made. I think the trade-off is that we got the movie we wanted released, but we didn\u2019t get the backing, and it suffered because of that. And I think it was ahead of its time. Even while making it we knew it was something that was gonna build over time and become a cult classic. It had that potential, so I don't think we were worried. But we were disappointed that other people couldn't see that. I think we all knew that this fanbase would find its way and stick with the film the way it did us."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/evan_rachel_wood", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 98% The Wrestler (2008)\n\nLowest Rated: 17% Barefoot (2014)\n\nBirthday: Sep 7, 1987\n\nBirthplace: Raleigh, North Carolina, USA\n\nActor Evan Rachel Wood first gained fame while still in grade school on the cult TV series \"American Gothic\" (CBS, 1995-96) and \"Once And Again\" (ABC, 1999-2002). She then went on to wow critics with her portrayal of a young girl who dives headlong into sex and drugs in the disturbing indie drama, \"Thirteen\" (2003), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination.

She delivered another sterling performance, this time opposite Mickey Rourke as his estranged daughter in \"The Wrestler\" (2009), before landing the recurring role of a vampire queen for the second and third seasons of the hit show \"True Blood\" (HBO, 2008-14). By the time she earned critical applause for \"Mildred Pierce\" (HBO, 2011), Wood was already well-established as a talented young actress who time and again impressed audiences alike with her mature and complex performances."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/reviews", "page_content": "I'll say up front that this film will almost certainly go on my list of films to see before you die, only one of two that I allow from each year.\n\n\n\nLet's get the problems out of the way first.\n\n\n\nThe overall container of this is a date movie. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl back by professing love in a public venue. Its about as tired a formula as there is.\n\n\n\nThe songs are produced by T-Bone Burnett, a sort of reliable movieworld musical handyman. He's probably a nice man who once knew what it meant to have soul, but now he's a factory man. These songs are performed by the actors you see, and while admirable, it further diminishes the power compared to the originals. Also, I saw this in a multicinema, and they tend to turn the speakers down because of leakage into other spaces. So the songs here don't have the power we know they do.\n\n\n\nNeither does the girl. In other date movies, we are supposed to fall in love a little ourselves, or at least see why she's the object at the center of everything. This actress doesn't have what it takes, and I suppose that's a result of the filmmaker being a woman and openly against objectifying women in this way. So its a bit schizo in that the form the woman chose demands something the woman won't give.\n\n\n\nThe thing gets off to a slow start. Its probably necessary for the strategy for most of the movie, which depends on growing extremes in cinematic fantasy. But you will probably go through what I did, think during the first 25-20 minutes that I had made a great mistake.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there's some bad history in here. Its probably excusable if you consider it all just a shorthand to indicate context. But if you were there and depending on that real context to enrich your experience, you'll be a bit annoyed.\n\n\n\nBut with those shortcomings (and I'll mention some others), even in spite of them, you'll find this to be one of your deepest cinematic experiences.\n\n\n\nTaymor isn't quite old enough to have experienced all this first hand. But she and her team do seem to have gotten the tone right. The world was turning against its inhabitants in a way completely unknown. The youth in the US responded in a way that was deeply moral and committed in a way unknown before or sadly since. This truly was the greatest generation. Think of it: we got rid of a lying scoundrel of a president, despite his best use of unconstitutional force!\n\n\n\nEverything was up for re-examination and reinvention. Sure some of this -- most perhaps -- was stupid, opportunistic and damaging. But the imperative to re-invent wholesale was there, however colored by idealism. And this was led by the Beatles. If it hadn't been in the context of reinvention -- if religion in its old form wasn't part of what was tossed -- then surely these guys would have been the core of a new religion. One of their hangers on actually is.\n\n\n\nWhat Taymor is about is a similar reinvention of cinema. She's a risk-taker. She knows her stuff, and she's willing to place it right in that sweet spot between the commercially viable and the imaginatively provocative.\n\n\n\nHer tools are derived from Japanese and Indonesian masks, outsized intrusions and a notion of space that prefers enveloping. These three combine to create some amazing achievements in stagecraft. That's what this is all about, stagecraft and the yearning of characters to place themselves in context at the same time the filmmaker (and explicit external world forces) set context boundaries, mostly denoted by uniforms.\n\n\n\nThe first of these is the most apparent, the first time you'll see this. There are some absolutely amazing experiences in store for you just on this score. The large and small are manipulated and bent to an extreme I have only seen in small bits of Tarkovsky. She knows how and when to combine this with confinement and openness, and often when she does you'll have play with matters of scale that are unique. And its not just one device, but many, never repeated. Its as if a whole life of imagining what to do were collected in one place.\n\n\n\nIf these were songs by the Mamas and Papas, I'd still be blown away. If it were Robert Stigwood's script maybe even. But those Beatles songs....\n\n\n\nWith \"Rubber Soul,\" the Beatles started their program to actually write songs that collectively built narratives. John and Paul were obsessed with the power of words that aggregate, and some of their projects really do have a narrative coherence similar to what we can read here, but much deeper than a date movie and a sketch of oppression. So in a way, its a weakness of what she's done to mix songs before that commitment (1966) with those done within it. It fights the DNA of what they created.\n\n\n\nAnd some of the songs carry immediate narrative. \"Sexy Sadie\" was about the falsity of religion. Here, Sadie is a redheaded Janis Joplin gal. What?\n\n\n\nBut still, its the stagecraft, and the cosmic placing she's found. See it and have your spatial reasoning ability either broken or enhanced.\n\n\n\nSee it, and either feel bad about your life or empowered to be.\n\n\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.\n\nWas this review helpful?

Same is the case with Evan Rachel Wood. Despite giving her best in her limited roles, it took her almost a decade of hard work to lead a show produced by a big show. That show, for Evan, is \u2018Westwood\u2019. In this article, I take you through her work, from her one episode performances, supporting roles, lead roles and series regular characters.\n\nWith that said, here is the list of top Evan Rachel Wood films and TV shows, carefully selected from her impressive filmography. You can also stream some of these Evan Rachel Wood movies and TV shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime.\n\n12. Across The Universe (2007)\n\nThe best part of this movie is the abundance of great Beatles\u2019 music. The worst part is the rambling disjointed story. In between, there are the admirable efforts by most of the actors, including Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, despite not being the song and dance types. Director Julie Taymor risks it all in a wild clash of bizarre imagery. It probably serves better as separate music videos than a cohesive narrative. As a movie, you will not be too disappointed.\n\n11. The Upside of Anger (2005)\n\nJoan Allen is an angry, depressed, single mother to her 4 daughters played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt and Evan Rachel Wood. Mike Bender enters her life, and the rest forms the plot. This is a good film that is about the ways of family and how they all bond together despite differences. Even though there are some strong, emotional moments, there are also some sweet, light-hearted moments as well.\n\n10. Down in the Valley (2005)\n\nStarring Edward Norton, Evan Rachel Wood, Rory Culkin, and David Morse \u2018Down in the valley\u2019 is an interesting, psychological study, with a steady movement towards something and you just know it\u2019s not what it first seems. All the moments, the drama, the settings are simply too typical, in a California suburb. Right from the beginning, you know something is going to change for these characters. Slowly, you watch it unravel. It\u2019s subtle, even elegant, in its changes. The movie is worth your time.\n\nRelated: Best Edward Norton Movies\n\n9. King of California (2007)\n\nRachael Evan Wood definitely steals the show as Miranda, but there are not many actors in this so it\u2019s pretty reliant on her. It\u2019s not your typical suburban mellow drama, those can be good but tiring, this had a pretty well-established subplot, Hidden Buried Spanish gold. The cinematography is above standard I should say. The movie actually believable, upbeat with some genuine dramatic father-daughter scenes, or realistic family relationship dialogue, which is something that at first might seem dragged but works in the end.\n\nRelated: Best Michael Douglas Movies\n\n8. The Ides of March (2011)\n\n\u2018The Ides of March\u2019 is a good movie with a well-developed storyline and a fantastic cast. I certainly enjoyed this movie, but I will admit, with its very impressive cast and story matter I was expecting a bit more, my main problem is that it was just too short, it was only one hour and forty minutes but it easily could have been two and a half hours. Evan Rachel Wood plays an intern named Molly Stearns in this political drama. Clooney and Gosling play their parts well.\n\nRelated: Best George Clooney Movies\n\n7. Once and Again (1999 \u2013 2002)\n\nRick Sammler, played by Billy Campbell is a divorced father of two, played by Evan Rachel Wood and Shane West, who meets Lily Manning, played by Sela Ward, a newly-separated mother of two, played by Julia Whelan and Meredith Deane. It\u2019s a new age family with ex-spouses, and its special relationships. The young cast is very compelling especially Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood. I wonder why it lasted only 3 years. If I had to guess, people had difficulties with the subject matter of divorce.\n\n6. Drunk History (2013)\n\nA very unique approach to telling history, I must say. I like how they usually start off at a bar and get some introspection from intelligent people regarding what the ultimate discussions will be about. The actual story is great because not only is it appealing to a college crowd and fun people, the storytellers go into details and even discuss historical figures who never make in the regular history books, and deserve some credit not administered by the mainstream. Evan Rachel Wood appeared in one episode, aired earlier this year. I\u2019ve decided to add this to the list since her performance is credited.\n\n5. Thirteen (2003)\n\n\u2018Thirteen\u2019 is worth seeing just for the excellent performances of Evan Rachel Wood, Nikki Reed, and Holly Hunter, all three of the main characters showed strong acting throughout the movie and that is what was the most impressive about it, the movie doesn\u2019t have any memorable moments or outstanding scenes, but it has great performance by the actresses throughout. And the treatment of the subject earned it a place this hight up the list.\n\n4. True Blood (2008-2014)\n\nThere is certainly a reason why so many people love True Blood. The first few seasons were excellent and although it hasn\u2019t been able to maintain the same level of excellence throughout the entire series it is still a damn good show. So if you\u2019re looking for something sexy, sinful and violent, then do yourself a favor and enjoy a True Blood series marathon. Evan Rachel Wood acted in 8 episodes of the series, from 2009 to 2011. Despite not being a series regular, the series makes into her filmography, and hence, this list.\n\n3. The Wrestler (2008)\n\nDarren Aronofsky, the director of \u2018Requiem for a Dream\u2019 directs this one. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism. \u2018The Wrestler \u2018respects the wrestlers and their world and expects the same from the audience. This film is done in a style that\u2019s so real honest and is easily one of the best films on wrestling. Evan Rachel Wood really brings it as \u201cThe Rams\u201d angry, abandoned and emotionally exhausted daughter. The chemistry between Mickey and Evan is brilliant. Definitely worth checking out.\n\nRelated: Best Darren Aronofsky Movies\n\n2. The West Wing (1999 \u2013 2006)\n\nEvan Rachel Wood appeared in just one episode in 2002, way before she shot to fame. Then again, like \u2018Drunk History\u2019, she\u2019s credited, and hence the series makes the list. \u2018The West Wing\u2019 is by far the most thought-provoking and \u2018politically\u2019 correct TV show in years. Sorkin and the cast present an accurate and compelling insight into American politics, at least to me as an outsider. The dialogue is quick-paced, sarcastic, and smart. Charlie Sheen plays Jed Bartlet, the President of the United States which makes it worth a try.\n\nRead More: Best Crime TV Shows\n\n1. Westworld (2016-)\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes, you are imagining what it would be like to visit Westworld. Would I become a monster or a saint? Is there some part of me that enjoys brutality, or am I a total softy. It is truly a place to discover your inner self, a psychological gold mine. Aside from the magical setting, there are other components that make \u2018Westworld\u2019 great. The writing is fresh and imaginative, weaving storylines so entrancing one can\u2019t help thinking about it every waking hour. The actors do a great job as well. Anthony Hopkins is plain terrifyingly smart, as well as secretive, and manipulative. Evan Rachel Wood leads the cast with aplomb."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls025544277/", "page_content": "93 min | Biography, Drama, Music\n\nThis biography of country music star Barbara Mandrell looks at her early career and follows her career through the tragic auto accident in 1984 which almost killed her, and her ultimate ...
