Although those conditions remain unclear, Strachan will be handed at least the remainder of Scotland's failed 2014 World Cup qualification campaign plus the country's attempt to make it to the 2016 European Championship.\n\nScotland have not appeared at a major finals since 1998, a matter which has had a negative impact on public confidence towards the SFA and the governing body's financial position. The SFA has also been heavily criticised for its role in the deeply unpopular reforms of Scotland's domestic set-up.\n\nStrachan was immediately the favoured choice of senior figures within the SFA and among the country's international football support after the inevitable sacking of Craig Levein. Under Levein, Scotland failed to qualify for last summer's European Championship and made an abysmal start to the 2014 campaign; they lie bottom of Group A with two points from four matches.\n\nStrachan was the country's outstanding candidate, with Joe Jordan, who has joined Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers, and Owen Coyle only tentatively mentioned as alternatives. Alex McLeish was briefly quoted, but distanced himself from a return to the Scotland role and has been appointed as the manager of Nottingham Forest.\n\nStrachan, when asked directly about the Scotland job, which will be his first in international management, said in November: \"It's quite simple really \u2013 it would be an honour to be asked to be the manager of your own national side; it's terrific.\"\n\nLevein remains in a legal dispute with the SFA in relation to the remainder of his contract. The association has been seeking to retain Levein on its payroll but the 48-year-old wants the balance of his contract paid up.\n\nStrachan has been employed as a pundit by ITV since leaving Middlesbrough. His 12-month spell in the north-east was less than distinguished, with Boro 20th in the Championship when he left, their lowest position for two decades. Of 46 games in charge after he succeeded Gareth Southgate, Strachan won only 13 and, according to the chairman, Steve Gibson, was so chastened by the experience he refused any compensation, despite having two and a half years left on his contract.\n\nBefore that, Strachan managed Coventry City, Southampton and Celtic. He was relegated with Coventry but bounced back with Southampton, whom he took to the 2003 FA Cup final where they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal.\n\nStrachan took a 16-month break after resigning from Southampton in 2004 before becoming manager of Celtic, where he won three successive league titles before resigning in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title."}, {"url": "https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/gordon-david-strachan-1535.php", "page_content": "Before he professionally started playing football, he was offered a contract by Eddie Turnbull to play for a club, but his father opposed the decision by stating that the club did not cover sufficient expenses.\n\nGeorge David Strachan was born to Jim and Catherine in Muirhouse, Edinburgh. He started playing for Dundee at the age of 14. The following year, he lost vision in his right eye when a pen in his pocket accidentally poked his eye during a football match on the school playground.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAt the age of 18, he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly match with Arsenal. His outstanding performance won him the seat of a regular player for the 1975-1976 season, which also happened to be the inaugural season for the Scottish Premier Division.\n\nHe became the team captain for the 1976-1977 First Division campaign, but he lost his position soon, after a drinking incident with Jimmy Johnstone.\n\nHe quit Dundee and signed a contract with Aberdeen in 1977. Poor form and injuries crippled the 1977-78 season for him. However, he was selected for the 1979 League Cup where the team recorded two wins at the Celtic Park. His brilliant performance on the field earned him the SFWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nIn 1980, he was awarded his first cap in the British Home Championship, against Northern Island. Two years later, he was instrumental in getting his home team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1982.\n\nThe 1982-1983 seasons were the most successful runs for the club and he made his mark by striking four goals in a 5-1 victory with Dundee in the League Cup. His team then went on to win the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. They also defeated Hamburg in the 1983 European Super Cup Final.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season, he took four goals in a total of seven games and even though he did not participate in the 1985 FA Cup Final at Wembley, the team went on to win the opening ten league games in the 1985-1986 season.\n\nAfter accepting a contract by Ron Atkinson, he led the Leeds United Club to the Second Division title in the 1989-1990 season. They finished fourth overall, but managed to secure a place in the semi-finals of the League Cup.\n\nHe signed a two-year contract with Leeds and captained them to record a victory in the league title of 1991-1992. However, due to poor health and back problems, he started missing a number of games and thus, became unable to build on the success of Leeds Untied.\n\nOn April 10, 1993, despite his downfalls and tough seasons, he scored a hat-trick against the Blackburn Rovers and then moved to Coventry City to serve as an assistant to the manager, Ron Atkinson.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHe coached the team and trained them and also appeared in the seasons 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. The club struggled at the start of the 1996-1997 season, which resulted in Atkinson being asked to step down from the managerial position.\n\nAfter Strachan was appointed as manager, he helped his team reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1997-1998.\n\nIn 2001, he was appointed as the manager of Premier League Southampton, succeeding Stuart Gray. Under his leadership, the Southampton team earned their place for the UEFA Cup.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, he returned to manage the team, Celtic, on June 1, 2005. Although he had a very shaky start as a manager, the team eventually began to do well under his management and started winning tournaments.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, he was signed on as the manager for Middlesbrough. However, after a series of defeats, he voluntarily stepped down as the manager during the 2010-2011 season."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38019477", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nGordon Strachan believes his side can still reach the finals.

It felt like the end, not only for their world cup chances, but for the manager.\n\nHe had come close to walking away in the past and the speed of today's decision was most likely aided by a reluctance from the man himself to carry on.

He never played for Celtic as a player, and generally was not the most popular opposition player. Nippy and aggressive, he irked some of the Celtic support but mostly it was due to his ability as being just a great player for Aberdeen during a golden period for them.\n\nOverall, he was a great entertaining Scottish player and the Celtic support appreciated that at least.\n\nManagement\n\nWGS became Coventry City\u2019s Director of Football in November 1996.\n\nHe finally retired as a player at the end of the season after making his last appearance at the age of 40, a record in the English Premiership.\n\nStrachan kept Coventry in the Premiership until 2001, when they finally went down after 34 years of top division football. He was sacked shortly after the start of the 2001-02 Division One campaign.\n\nGordon Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager\u2019s job at Southampton \u2013 after Strachan\u2019s appointment in October 2001, they finished 11th in the Premiership.\n\nIn 2002-03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup final, where they lost 1-0 to Arsenal, but since Arsenal had qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Southampton qualified for the 2003-04 UEFA Cup.\n\nIn March 2004, Gordon Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager, earlier than intended because he wanted to spend time with his family.\n\nWhen Berti Vogts stepped down as Scottish national coach, Strachan was widely tipped to take over until Walter \u201cWattie\u201d Smith got the job, and he was even linked with the manager\u2019s job at Portsmouth, but turned down the offer to take over. He later took on the Scotland role from January 2013 as the popular choice amongst the Scotland support, resigning in October 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to Euro 2016.\n\nGordon Strachan has also been an analyst of football matches for the media, most notably on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day 2 show. Renowned for his deadpan humour as much as his shrewd tactical awareness, quotes attributed to Strachan have become legendary among football supporters.\n\nAs Celtic Manager\n\nGordon Strachan finally returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O\u2019Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL).\n\nHe resigned on 25 May 2009, after 4 years in charge having won the league three times in a row, with a lot to look on to be proud on, both domestically and in European competition.\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE CIS LEAGUE CUP SCOTTISH CUP EUROPE TOTALS SEASON P W D L F A PTS P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A P W D L F A 2005-06 38 28 7 3 93 37 91 4 4 0 0 9 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 4 5 45 33 7 5 107 46 2006-07 38 26 6 6 65 34 84 2 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 0 0 13 3 8 3 1 4 9 10 53 35 8 10 90 48 2007-08 38 28 5 5 84 26 89 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 2 1 1 9 3 8 3 0 5 7 10 52 34 6 12 102 42 2009-09 38 24 10 4 80 33 82 4 4 0 0 9 1 3 2 0 1 4 3 6 1 2 3 4 7 51 31 12 8 97 44 TOTALS 152 106 28 18 322 130 346 12 10 1 1 23 7 13 9 1 3 27 11 24 8 3 13 24 32 201 133 33 35 396 180\n\nFirst season (2005-06)\n\nFor 2005/06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title off current holders (Rangers).\n\nThings didn\u2019t exactly get off swimmingly, and an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager losing 5-0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and 3 days later only managing to draw 4-4 away to Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. A few days later he recorded his first win in charge as Celtic won 4-0 in the return leg of the Champions League qualifier.\n\nHowever, that was not enough to avoid being put out of Europe before the season had got started in earnest. For many Celtic fans, these set of matches set the tone (for both WGS and the supporters) on how the mentality on governing the side\u2019s tactics was to be for future matches. It was a huge psychological blow, and some fans never seemed to forgive him. It was too regularly brought up in seasons to come.\n\nNevertheless, Celtic improved under Strachan, leading the SPL by as much as 20 points at one point despite playing with a defence that came under regular criticism from the media and fans. Rangers were in turmoil as Alex McLeish lurched from one disaster to another. Two notable victories over Rangers in November (scoring 5 goals and conceding none) was a gem of a time, and saw the emergence of Shaun Maloney as a front runner for the team.\n\nNot all went Celtic\u2019s way, and another low-point was the shock defeat in the third-round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they beat Dunfermline Athletic 8-1, a record victory margin for the SPL. Over the period after beating Rangers twice in November, the First Team went through a poor spell for two months where the First Team went behind in too many games, but thankfully fought back in to recover.\n\nWorse was that the First Team kept on conceding goals in all the games. It was not until Celtic played against Rangers in mid-February that the first team had a game that they didn\u2019t concede a goal in.Celtic were winning games but the weaknesses of the side were beginning to be seen, and in many ways they were the weaknesses that were to begin to haunt Celtic for over the next couple of seasons.\n\nAn important point that has to be made is that this was a season of transition, and anyone taking over from Martin O\u2019Neill as manager was going to have a hard task in front of them (a lot to live up to). Spats with Sutton and Agathe, saw both leave prematurely yet both could have contributed more. On the other hand, the players have to take in that the old regime was over and you have to understand and work with the new regime. With the less than stellar playing achievements of both after leaving Celtic, maybe WGS was right. Sutton in particular can be a prickly character and not predictable, so maybe it was best to move him on.\n\nOverall, Strachan\u2019s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the Scottish League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time with six matches remaining. A difficult year of transition, but he\u2019d won most over to his side at this point.\n\nReflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted \u2018Manager of the Year\u2018 by the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association eight days after the title was clinched.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and much better was expected of both him and the team in the next season in terms of entertainment and results (goals conceded, scored etc).\n\nSecond season (2006-07)\n\nHis second season was even more of a roller coaster compared to his first, with excuses out the window for many, and the arrival of Paul le Guen (PLG) seen by the press as leading \u201cLe Revolution\u201d at Rangers to challenge Celtic. To the surprise of practically everyone, there was no actual domestic challenge. Rangers went comedic from failure to tragic farce, and Celtic simply took advantage going over 20 points ahead of them at one point in the season. In games v Rangers, the best PLG did was one draw. The \u2018Hearts Revolution\u2019 was also a joke with their challenge petering out before it had even began.\n\nKnocked out early in the league cup was no issue, and WGS easily made it up with winning the Scottish Cup to wrap up a cup and league double. Overall, WGS was having a respite domestically from any strong challenge, but nobody should understate the level of his achievement. Whilst others floundered, he ensured that Celtic did not, and the players were building up a fair reputation as a unit.\n\nThe Champions League was where it\u2019s at, and there he excelled. Despite a tough group, Celtic won all three home games, with a special victory against Man Utd which led Celtic to qualify from the Group stages for the first time. You can\u2019t understate the work done by Gordon Strachan in this. He galvanised the players and had set them out correctly to push further than they expected. Not a unit of players as highly rated together as the best under Martin O\u2019Neill yet they achieved what they did not. The players were fit and able, and were pushing to the last minute of matches. It made a whole difference. Strachan was able to utilise players like Nakamura to his best and it was paying out.\n\nOn the other hand,Celtic were poor away from home and lost all 3 games, with WGS stating that he knew the problem and would have it resolved. The next round v AC Milan was very special for the Support, and WGS held to what he said and the first team didn\u2019t concede in 180mins of football, but sadly didn\u2019t score either. Ultimately,Celtic were outdone by a classic goal by Kaka in extra time. A sad way to go out, but a great achievement by WGS and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nRegardless of the European achievements, some criticism must also be put at WGS for his second season domestically. The quality of football in the last third of the season in particular was appalling, and the player effort by too many of the squad was deemed non-existent. Rangers\u2019 new manager (Walter Smith) had the better of WGS with a very comfortable win in the last game v Rangers in the season, and Celtic lost in some very drab games. People pay to enjoy the product on the pitch, it really was not good at Celtic. It wasn\u2019t \u2018The Celtic Way\u2019.\n\nA number of the signings were disappointing that season, Gravesen, Miller and Jarosik in particular, whilst Jan Venegoor of Hasselink was injured too often. A spat with Maloney over new contracts saw the club lose a great new wee player (transferred to Aston Villa) and the defence was as bad at the end of the season as at the start. The manager appeared to bamboozle and patronise fans on many occasions with his team selections, and what appeared to be a continuing spat with Derek Riordan saw the player play few games and being overshadowed by the far less productive Kenny Miller. A round of boos as Riordan was taken off in one match late in the season was evidence of this. It was a sorry situation.\n\nMany fans were simply disillusioned by WGS at the end despite the successes, and simply couldn\u2019t see where he was taking the team. The fear was that the club was moving backwards despite what had been accomplished in the last year. This should have put an end to the rubbish that the fans didn\u2019t like him as he wasn\u2019t a \u201cCeltic man\u201d (lazy journalism), it was all because of the criticisms as said above. A real roller coaster of a season, and after all the achievements in the season it\u2019s sad to have to have to summarise it all in a negative tone.\n\nThird season (2007-08)\n\nFor WGS, this season had seen him lose the support of most of the fans. However the death of Tommy Burns and his near breakdown after his loss (a close friend and work colleague) showed a side of WGS which many had not seen before in his time here.\n\nThe Support all felt for him and just how much the job and the club really did mean to him. Winning the league against the odds (big odds at that) appeared to have moved the fans and split the fans opinion on him whether to stay or go at the end of it all.\n\nThis season for WGS can be termed a success on paper. To quote him, the team achieved what he set out at the start of the year to do. On paper, Celtic won the league (three in a row) and got through the Champs League group stages again (two in a row) which cemented the club as being more than just a flash in the pan side as others in the past have been cynically referred as being.\n\nCeltic sold hapless Kenny Miller to Derby County for \u00a33m (amazing!), brought in a few quality players like Barry Robson, beat Rangers twice at home in very entertaining games and so on. Adding in that Celtic were seven points (plus a game played more) behind Rangers going into the end of the season, WGS must be given his due, even by his harshest critic, for leading the team to somehow comeback and win the league. The first team won the last seven games (which included 2 wins v Rangers) and got much pride back. That can\u2019t be smirked at by anyone, and the last win came just a week after Tommy Burns death (not an easy time).\n\nAt the end of the day, his style of football was uninspiring and unentertaining, and he seemed to stick with some players in his squad way beyond what he should have and then moved them on (e.g. Caldwell, Donati, JVoH), demonstrating an inability to accept criticism and that he had been wrong. A public rift with Derek Riordan depicted an unsettled atmosphere in the changing room although other comments by players, like Mark Wilson, Pressley and Venegoor, said otherwise praising WGS for his man management skills.\n\nBringing in Barry Robson into the Celtic team seemed to show admission that he needed steel in a lightweight side (and what a change he made to the team), whilst Hartley was a revelation this season and deserved all the praise in the world. Boruc as ever was great, but a kick up the back side was needed as it took him a year to manage a game where he didn\u2019t lose a goal away from home.\n\nAllegations were thrown at the Celtic support that they were spoilt (see this story) and that the support didn\u2019t like WGS as he wasn\u2019t a \u2018Celtic man\u2018. Complete balderdash and it was simply sloppy & cheapshot journalism. The fans pay up good money to watch Celtic, and many a time the performances were dreadful to watch with the manager unwilling to admit change was needed and seemed to anger many, especially when he criticised the fans for not understanding what he was trying to do. The zonal defensive play was not working, the formations weren\u2019t working and certain players needed a kick up the backside.\n\nThe First Team lost v Inv Caley when they were two ahead, lost against Hibs, Motherwell and even struggled in games v Gretna. The First Team lost the first two games v Rangers, with poor tactics amongst other points to blame for it. Transfers weren\u2019t working out, especially the enigma that was Donati. Taking in the club had spent more money than Rangers, it was embarrassing to go behind in the league and watching Rangers going to the end for a very undeserved potential quadruple (which thankfully they didn\u2019t achieve).\n\nAdding all this up, WGS has to take flak. However, as said, his emotions after Tommy Burns showed his real self to everyone and all felt for him. This season may probably have shown him to be more of a coach than a great manager, but unlike the other pundits on television at least he puts his money where his mouth is and takes up the challenge of football management. Moving on to next season he should have learnt from what had happened to become a more complete rounded manager.\n\nMust be said, any manager who wins three league titles in a row must be doing something right, so maybe the critics amongst the fans are wrong. A late find in Barry Robson was a revelation, whilst bringing Lennon into the coaching staff seemed to freshen things up.\n\nWGS can be quite an enigma but moving into the next season, more entertaining football really was a requirement.\n\nFourth Season (2008-2009)\n\nSo, was WGS to cement his name as a legend at Celtic by achieving the coveted \u201c4-in-a-row\u201d of league titles? But more importantly, it was questioned on how was his relationship with the fans going to develop this year? It was a (near) clean sheet for many on WGS after the emotional end to the last season.\n\nBefore the season had even begun, rumblings (as usual) had restarted about WGS and his transfers. Few buys to excite the fans made many apprehensive about the hope for greater entertainment, but in general the mood was that, despite all else, Celtic were going to win the league (confidence was high).\n\nThe season started off rather easily until the first game v Rangers where basically Celtic were turned over (at home) 4-2 and lucky not to have lost by more. The first team were hopeless, and the daggers were out for the manager. The pent up frustration from sections of the crowd was released in one big explosion, and the tone was decidedly frosty for the rest of the season with respect to the manager\u2019s relationship with the fans. Not a good start.\n\nNevertheless following on from there was a cracking set of games which saw Celtic take advantage and overhaul Rangers to go top of the league. There was some great football in the first third of the season, and this was the best to watch Celtic for a few seasons at least.\n\nAnyhow, the big headaches of the season began with injuries besetting the manager in his aim to overhaul Rangers. Credit to WGS as his policy of squad numbers above single big signings did pay off which enabled Celtic to be able to squad rotate players to cover for gaps in the side and keep their nose in front. Amazingly Celtic went 7pts ahead at the end of November, and December became the brightest time of the season and it was capped off with a Scott McDonald inspired 1-0 victory at Ibrox against Rangers. Great! Everyone thought Celtic were set up for the rest of the campaign. How the support were to be disappointed.\n\nDuring all this was the Champions league escapade. A poor final set of results saw Celtic finish bottom of their group and again fail to win any of the away games (see link for full write-up). After 4 years, WGS still hadn\u2019t managed an away win in Europe, something that can\u2019t be put down to bad luck alone, and something that was noticeable to all. Celtic got the breaks last season in Europe, this time they didn\u2019t.\n\nBack to the league, when did it all begin to go wrong? Basically from the turn of the new year, yet WGS seemed to do little.\n\nWhat was going on? To everyone\u2019s surprise, WGS himself summarised the situation well in a post-match interview:\n\n\u201cYou have to determine your own destiny. The eyes of the football world are upon us all. The question being asked is, \u2018Are you a team that plays just when everything is right for you?\u2019 That can\u2019t happen. The best way for us to recover is to get back on form as quickly as possible.\u201d (Mar 09)\n\nHowever, he quickly turned back to old irritating ways by stating in an interview a few weeks later: \u201cIf anyone can find a negative \u2013 and I\u2019m sure they will \u2013 then they are warped!\u201d after a Dundee Utd game in April where Celtic drew 2-2. Clearly and sadly showed a dividing line between the management and the fans. An unnecessary dig and it was an unworkable relationship. This post-match comment was very insulting and patronising to the support (and uncalled for). Difficult to see how things were going to be mended easily for many. Why exactly did WGS have to patronise and insult the support? Only he could answer this question, but best left to the end of the season.\n\nAdd to that, complaints about the lack of entertaining football were being swatted away with abandonment: \u201cIn terms of entertainment, yes, we do have responsibilities at Celtic and Rangers, because we have greater resources than most clubs up here to entertain, But most of the songs that the supporters sing are all about winning trophies \u2014 they don\u2019t sing nice wee ditties about the beautiful game. No one remembers the beautiful football, but they do remember the defeats.\u201d This line again seemed to show his distance from the Celtic ideal.\n\nOne nice break was the league cup final, beating Rangers 2-0 after extra-time, with both goals scored by two Irish internationals (O\u2019Dea & McGeady).\n\nFrom then on in, little went right for Celtic again, and after dropping points, Celtic were up against Rangers to see who was to win the league. The final league game v Rangers was a failure, losing one-nil and from then on the writing was on the wall.\n\nCeltic had lost the league to a poor Rangers side. The Celtic players did not perform, and the apathy around the club was heart-breaking. It was overall a poor season with under-performing players.\n\nThe football was generally poor to watch and it had been a continual complaint over the past few years. For many who were tired of the turgid football on display this was a bit much, and swathes of empty seats at Celtic matches became the norm rather than exception. With the global credit crunch beginning and hitting one and all, it was not a time to alienate the support. Yet WGS did, so why? Who knows? It doesn\u2019t require much to get on the side of the fans.\n\nThere are many reasons for the loss, but the manager has to take the flak and he was not one to ever take criticism lightly, being self-admittedly easily irritated. In fairness there were mitigating points, e.g. the loss of Barry Robson to injury was probably more costly to the First Team than anyone realised, as he was a strong driving force to the title run-in last season.\n\nWGS handed in his resignation with little surprise the day after the league defeat, and he left rightly with his head held high for his achievements over the past four seasons with uncharacteristically no smart remarks from him (thankfully). There was actually some sadness to see him go as there had been many good memories over his time. He had been the creator of his own downfall this last season, and in his own reflection on this last season will have to admit, to himself at least, where he went wrong.\n\nReview\n\nSo after all that, how should anyone take and look back on WGS? His predecessor is still lauded to this day, and in reflection Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements were hanging over WGS during his whole tenure at the club. Regardless, he had to deal with them, and if truth be said, then WGS can argue that on paper at least he has exceeded on par with what Martin O\u2019Neill achieved. Not that WGS would but the argument of who was the better manager (WGS or MoN) was a never ending debate which is all academic now. Martin O\u2019Neill was blessed to have had Henrik Larsson at hand so comparisons for WGS aren\u2019t easy or likely entirely fair.\n\nForgetting his predecessor, WGS had a few tasks to fulfill. Firstly, was to regenerate the squad and lower the cost base after the more spendthrift MoN years, win the league back and get Celtic further in Europe. On that score, he more than achieved what was set out. Wage costs were reduced, Celtic won the league back and in time achieved getting past the group stages in the Champions League twice in a row. Brilliant stuff.\n\nWinning the league three times in a row, as well as outliving two Rangers managers is surely a sign of success, especially after the hoo-haa over Paul Le Guen\u2019s management signing. Add in some incredible achievements in Europe (e.g. in beating European Cup holders AC Milan, the Naka winner v Manchester Utd, qualifying twice out of the Champions League group stages etc), and he can easily hold his head up high. The support were spoilt with success at many points.\n\nWhen Celtic won the league for the third time with him as manager, there is no denying that he had silenced all the doomsayers who were worrying that Celtic were out of the league title race. That last seven game winning run to win the league title against the odds will be spoken about for many a year. It was a phenomenal achievement to pick the players up and get them motivated. No matter what else can be said of his managerial ability, that was exceptional. The First Team came so close to reaching the quarter-finals of the European Cup in one season and what a mark that would have been. This was all done without the sublime talents of Larsson, Petrov and Sutton.\n\nEurope had been a sore bugbear for predecessor Martin O\u2019Neill, and Gordon Strachan achieved what Martin O\u2019Neill failed to achieve by qualifying past the group stages (and did it twice). It put Celtic on the pedestal with the premier clubs in Europe, and it was a great place to be.\n\nGordon Strachan was the architect for the high points, and when they came off they were exceptional, and WGS deserves all the credit in the world. Post-match interviews could also be enlivened by some of his emotive witticisms, which on a number of occasions lightened the mood and made everyone smile.\n\nThe most exciting game? Well there were many. WGS himself said that the Spartak Moscow win in 2007 was the most exciting and many would agree but defeating Manchester Utd 1-0 to reach the KO stages of the Champions League was also very special.\n\nHe also helped to foster the careers of some of the younger players, such as Maloney, McManus, McGeady & Wilson, and in reflection they will be thankful for the role that WGS has played in their careers. Some will succeed (at Celtic or elsewhere) whilst others inevitably won\u2019t but at least he gave them the opportunity. WGS likely was the best developer of youngsters we\u2019d had for the past twenty years or so. Billy McNeil was the last to have done well with youngsters in the squad.\n\nSo why in reflection, is the mood relatively more sombre over WGS than an outsider would expect? Much of it has been reflected above in the season reviews. The fans can be said to have been very patient with him, but the truth is that the football in general was too often poor to watch and after four years of that, what are the fans to say? He failed with a number of big transfers, and many players seemed to have declined under him rather than improved.\n\nMany fans take the belief that he couldn\u2019t coach well; confusing squad rotations and team selections baffled players as much as fans, and the last season was woeful in so many ways, throwing away major leads. Tackling Rangers in his last two seasons shouldn\u2019t have been as difficult as it was as Celtic were far better resourced, yet tripped up in both seasons and only got out of jail the first time.\n\nHe never helped himself with a number of his post-match remarks either, the \u201cwarped\u201d comment in his last season in particular was particularly poor judgement. He readily admits that he is easily irritated, but he\u2019d been in football for over twenty years and worked in the media for some time, so he should have been able to know how to deal with it. Yet he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t!\n\nMany would agree that \u201cned-culture\u201d had been on the rise, and WGS in particular had been very vocal on this issue, taking journalists to task on occasion as well. However, when you give a flippant remark to a question or a thinly veil snide remarks to others, then how really is anyone to see him in a different light to those he criticised? Bit extreme but the point stands and he could end up making things worse for himself. All are irked by neds but he made too much of a crusade of it at times, and at Celtic it was the wrong place for his campaign.\n\nCeltic is a social community club, and thefore reflects a cross-section of society. So admittedly the support can have a small share of nefarious characters, but the support does push and emphasise the roots of the club in terms of charity and community, and this in turn is reflected by the good nature and reputation of the support. Winning is not the only aim, it\u2019s also about the ineffable \u201cto play the Celtic Way\u201d. WGS did not seem to comprehend this, and dismissed any criticism of his tactics stating that others didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. That was simply nonsense.\n\nHis \u201cwin at the cost of entertainment\u201d style may find favour in the cut-throat English championship but not at Celtic. That in itself had been what has been the crux of the friction between the support and WGS, and that was what created his downfall. He did things by the training manual but that is never sufficient, and he could be quite robotic with his decisions (such as always subbing on players in matches at an exact certain time) so leaving little room for flexibility or showing that he was able to be experimental in matches.\n\nFrom the outside, everything appeared to be rosy as Celtic won trophies but it\u2019s about more than that with the Celtic support. The supporters weren\u2019t most often enjoying the play on the pitch, reflected in the falling attendances.\n\nWGS is actually a very decent man. The players all spoke very highly of him, and there was little if any dissent at the time (McGeady and Riordan apart) even from those who left prematurely, although one or two (e.g. Sutton & Gravesen) have been quite critical of Strachan since leaving but much later on. All Celtic fans who have met him have generally commented well on him. Away from it all, a long one-on-one interview in December 2008 with Radio Scotland brought out his good side and there was a general amount of respect for him from this.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the full qualification to be a successful football manager, and WGS\u2019 natural managerial ability was below that level which all wish he was at. Maybe if he had spent some time with some great managers learning their skill, he could have been a far better manager. He was a player with Manchester Utd and Aberdeen under Alex Ferguson but his coaching began at Leeds (under the dour Howard Wilkinson) and then Coventry, and sadly it\u2019s those latter clubs that his coaching philosophy stems from. Ex-Celt Gravesen in an interview in 2018 commented on Strachan\u2019s extreme fear of losing games, noting criticisms made to Gravesen on defending the lead when he had scored a hat-trick after the game in question.\n\nAn important point must be noted that WGS is the first Celtic manager to have to grapple with the new media. Martin O\u2019Neill was manager when the internet got going, but it was in its infancy throughout most of MoN\u2019s reign, and the scale and importance in which the internet had taken in WGS\u2019 time had meant that he had another task to take on.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy anymore. Replays and events are dissected more thoroughly and for longer than ever before. There are cameras to capture everything, statisticians to tally up the most mundane of figures and heated wipe-spread discussions begin on the matches before they\u2019re even over (on the forums & social media) and not hours later in the pub as it all used to be. Sky Sports & its peers are everywhere, and unconscious comparisons with richer foreign leagues had been rising, which doesn\u2019t help with the club\u2019s limited resources. Sadly, that was the future, and WGS was the first Celtic manager to deal with it and few seemed to sit back and notice. Maybe if they did then he\u2019d have been cut more slack.\n\nHis biggest mistake? Should have left at the end of 2007/08 season as many fans were calling for. He stayed 12 months longer than he should have, and that set in the rot which accelerated over time. At the end of it all, most fans wanted him gone, and it\u2019s sad to see him have to leave in that kind of atmosphere. Much of it had been of his own creation, and his successor had the unenviable task to rebuild the squad in much the same way that WGS himself had to when he himself began.\n\nFor those who still believe that the Celtic support were irrational, they should take the following comment from Middlesborough legend & ex-player Bernie Slaven on Gordon Strachan\u2019s brief reign at Middlesborough after leaving Celtic, as there are parallels from his comment to the Celtic supporters\u2019 criticisms of Strachan\u2019s time at Celtic:\n\n\u201cAfter a year in charge, we [Middlesborough] had not improved one iota \u2013 the football was average, away results were abysmal, the worst league position in 20 years and he still doesn\u2019t know his best team. It wasn\u2019t just on the field that Strachan let himself down, off the field during post-match interviews he became an embarrassment to himself, the club and the fans. He was arrogant, obnoxious, sarcastic, cutting and rude. He came across to me like a man who was on the borderline of insanity.\u201d\n\nWe hoped WGS all the very best in the future, in whatever direction he was to take. Everyone knows from his honest comments that he grew to love the club, just at times his daft side too often got in the way. He is a good man, and for the great memories all will forever be thankful for them and there were a number of them along the way. In time, all at least missed his sense of humour from his interviews [see Quotes by and on Gordon Strachan].\n\nHe signed off from Celtic with a wonderful speech which contained the following great quote (from the Tommy Burn\u2019s tribute match, full wording below):\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pretend I came here as a Celtic supporter. I don\u2019t believe in kissing badges to get your support. I didn\u2019t know the words of \u2018Fields of Athenry\u2019\u2026. [but] From today, I\u2019ve become a Celtic supporter.\u201d\n\nGordon Strachan (May 2009)\n\nPost-Celtic & Scotland management\n\nSince leaving Celtic, he had a relatively unsuccessful time as manager at Middlesborough. He took over a set of former Celtic (& Rangers) players to his new club making it dubbed by some as some kind of Glasgow old boys team. It didn\u2019t work out at all, and his time as a club side manager was over.\n\nHe returned to football analysis on TV & Radio, and to the joy of every Celtic fan, he has been incredible towards Celtic. Never hides his sympathy, and talks up the club at every opportunity. Really puts to shame some former players who have taken pot-shots. Without the pressure of management, Strachan has shown his knowledge of the game on TV and applied it in an easy accessible manner for the viewer and is very popular. A very different character to the fish-bowl like environment that a Celtic manager has to endure in Glasgow.\n\nThe support was very much warming to him, and possibly it\u2019s an indication that he may have regretted not having shown this more amiable side during his time at Celtic. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and maybe only once he was at a distance that he was able to admire what Celtic had offered and given him. The affection that Strachan now has with the support was increasingly mutual as was shown on his frequent trips back to Celtic Park.\n\nMust add that he had acted as a mentor in part for Neil Lennon. At one point there were stories of bringing Strachan back as a paid mentor for Neil Lennon but this didn\u2019t materialise. However, he has still acted as such and Neil Lennon publicly paid his respect to Strachan once after advise given by him which helped Celtic win a vital game against Rangers (and helped keep Neil Lennon in his job).\n\nCuriously, Strachan has claimed that there was no bias against Celtic in his time as manager of the club, but then again Rangers were so bad during much of the spell, bias wouldn\u2019t have made a difference (as it was to do so during Lennon\u2019s reign).\n\nScotland Managerial Tenure\n\nOver his entire time as a manager, his name was continually brought up as a possible future Scotland manager, and with the lack of candidates putting themselves forward for the role, Strachan in January 2013 was announced the new manager. Interestingly, one of the first questions he was posed at his initial press conferences was: \u201cIs this the biggest job in your career so far?\u201d, to which Strachan retorted: \u201cI was manager of Celtic, there\u2019s no bigger job than that!\u201d. Bless him, the support loved him more now than ever.\n\nThere was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. In 2013, Martin O\u2019Neill was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000\u2019s, a common argument was \u201cMoN v WGS\u201c, as who was the better manager: Martin O\u2019Neill or Gordon Strachan?\n\nThe comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O\u2019Neill and Gordon Strachan were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro Championships. The first match was ironically played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0, and the return leg ended 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time has now passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.\n\nStrachan\u2019s second run at qualification had certain parallels to his time at Celtic, as in the roller-coaster aspect. A grim start to the qualification for the 2018 World Cup was compounded by his stubbornness where he opted to remain loyal to old stalwarts rather than new players or those regarded as currently on form in the Scottish league. Many also argued he had a bias against those based in the Scottish leagues in preference to the English leagues.\n\nThe qualifying campaign for Strachan to the 2018 World Cup was a roller coaster mirroring that of his time at Celtic. Having begun the campaign very poorly, his head was on the block, only to incredibly recover but then fell at the final hurdle. Part of the problem was his initial intransigence to play Celtic players who were then by far the best in the country, publicly rebuking calls for more Celtic players, most notably Griffiths.\n\nA 3-0 loss to Lithuania at the start of the campaign featured no Celtic players, but the turnaround featured a number. His fall at the final hurdle was in part due to the loss of two key Celtic central midfielders (Brown & Armstrong) to injury. The biggest issue was to be his patter, and a post-match comment about Scot\u2019s lacking height & genetics made him lampooned across the footballing circuits and infuriated everyone. He was still rubbing everyone up the wrong way.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland were again a fighting side under his management. As at Celtic, last minute goals were notable event, e.g. crucial winner v Slovakia in Oct 2017, it was a great attribute. The amount of times his Celtic and Scotland teams have done it is remarkable. There comes a point where you can no longer say it\u2019s luck or fortune, and he genuinely does instil a belief and winning mentality into his teams. Fair enough the football wasn\u2019t always free-flowing and the mentality didn\u2019t necessarily always turn into victories, but the winning belief was a great trait to have.\n\nHe resigned in Oct 2017 after failing to get Scotland through to at least the play-offs of the 2018 World Cup, and having not qualified to the 2016 Euros.\n\nFew were bemoaning the decision, but he had made a rod for his own back. His positives and negatives again came very much to the forefront in this role as it did at his time at Celtic. Sadly he would leave with little to write home about with Scotland (despite some progress) whilst his Celtic tenure had many wonderful highs. If anything, it vindicated the often ambivalent opinion the Celtic fans had of Gordon Strachan over his time at the club.\n\nPost-Football Management\n\nIn a curious twist of fate, his son Gavin Strachan was on the Celtic coaching staff in 2020/21 during the Covid-19 pandemic, and after a trip to Dubai due to Covid-19 isolation of 13 players and the manager & assistant manager, Gavin Strachan was the de facto acting manager for a couple of games. This meant the first father & their son to have managed Celtic.\n\nThere were reports he would join his son at Celtic, with Gordon Strachan given a role as director of football following Neil Lennon\u2019s departure. This was though was shot down by a number in the support, and the board likely backed away from it as at that point there was a lot of friction between the board & the support. Gordon Strachan did eventually return to Celtic for a short consultancy role in 2021.\n\n[\u2026.]\n\nWe wished Gordon Strachan the best.\n\nHonours as Celtic Manager\n\nScottish Premier League winner:\n\nScottish Cup winner:\n\nScottish League Cup winner:\n\nSPFA Manager of the Year:\n\n2005\u201306, 2006\u201307, 2008-09\n\nSPL Manager of the Year:\n\nPictures\n\nQuotes\n\nForums\n\nArticles"}]}
