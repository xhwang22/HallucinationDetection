The son of a career navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.[1]\n\nBy the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll DeCamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition, and by age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that positing until Mancini's death in 1994.[2]\n\nWhile appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royces, tone and approach to changes. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker and Bucky Pizzarelli.With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano.\n\nDuring his career Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader among various sideman projects.

While there are exceptions, in general if you put two guitarists together, what you'll get is a contest to see who can be louder, who can be faster, who can be more dominant. So, when you get an album where a relative unknown teams up with five more visible players, it's not unreasonable to expect something of a whizzing contest.\n\nFortunately, while there's plenty of good-spirited jousting on Royce Campbell's Six By Six, it's more a demonstration of how one guitarist can integrate seamlessly with five stylistically diverse players. Rather than being a case of determining who's on top, Campbell has created a celebration of jazz guitar which, while staying within the mainstream, covers a lot of turf by virtue of its roster\u0097which ranges from the technical virtuosity of Pat Martino to the traditional leanings of Larry Coryell and Bucky Pizzarelli and the more modernistic approaches of John Abercrombie and Dave Stryker.\n\nOriginally recorded for and released by the Japanese Paddlewheel Records in '94, this album is curiously only now seeing the light of day in North America. Why, after enjoying great acclaim in Japan and Europe, it has taken ten years to get released here is a mystery; but for fans of more down-the-centre jazz guitar, the album sounds as fresh as when it was first recorded.\n\nWith the exception of three originals from Campbell, the material all comes from familiar territory, although the arrangements are sometimes a little off the beaten path. \"Naima gets a light bossa treatment, with Martino as dark-toned and fleet-fingered as always. \"Love for Sale, patterned after an arrangement the more acerbic Coryell played with trumpeter Chet Baker, alternates between funky groove and relaxed swing. \"Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise is taken at a nice clip, with Stryker demonstrating, even at this early stage in his career, a remarkable ability to blend a post bop sensibility with sometimes subtle, other times more in-your-face blue shadings.\n\nThe most adventurous moves are with Abercrombie. On Campbell's aptly-titled \"Angular Blues things get almost raucous, with Abercrombie kicking on the overdrive and heading for more oblique places. \"Day Into Night, another Campbell original, is dark and mysterious, with a spacious ECM vibe.\n\nEveryone seems to be enjoying themselves. Campbell may not have the name recognition of his associates, but he clearly holds his own with them all, confidently trading fours here, assertively staking his own stylistic space there. An appealing mainstream player, Campbell's career has been most defined by a number of tribute albums to seminal guitarists including Wes Montgomery, Charlie Byrd and Joe Pass.\n\nBut while Campbell may not have what it takes to distinguish himself as a player of significance, he's certainly good enough to go head-to-head with his guests on Six By Six. An homage to jazz guitar done with energy and commitment, the long-overdue release of Six By Six in North America rights a longstanding wrong.\n\nVisit Royce Campbell and Independent Music Distribution on the web."}]}
