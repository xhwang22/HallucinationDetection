But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/directory/tudor-stuart/robert-holgate-archbishop", "page_content": "Robert Holgate from a Yorkshire family, was educated in Cambridge and entered the Gilbertine order as a canon.

It resulted in the creation of a branch of Christianity called Protestantism , a name used collectively to refer to the many religious groups that separated from the Roman Catholic Church due to differences in doctrine.\n\n\n\nThe Protestant Reformation began in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517, when Martin Luther, a teacher and a monk, published a document he called Disputation on the Power of Indulgences, or 95 Theses. The document was a series of 95 ideas about Christianity that he invited people to debate with him. These ideas were controversial because they directly contradicted the Catholic Church 's teachings.\n\n\n\nLuther's statements challenged the Catholic Church 's role as intermediary between people and God, specifically when it came to the indulgence system, which in part allowed people to purchase a certificate of pardon for the punishment of their sins. Luther argued against the practice of buying or earning forgiveness, believing instead that salvation is a gift God gives to those who have faith.\n\n\n\nLuther's objections to the indulgence system paved the way for other challenges to the Catholic doctrine throughout Europe. For example, John Calvin in France and Huldrych Zwingli in Switzerland proposed new ideas about the practice of Holy Communion, and a group called Anabaptists rejected the idea that infants should be baptized in favor of the notion that baptism was reserved for adult Christians.\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, most of the challenges to the Catholic Church revolved around the notion that individual believers should be less dependent on the Catholic Church , and its pope and priests, for spiritual guidance and salvation. Instead, Protestants believed people should be independent in their relationship with God, taking personal responsibility for their faith and referring directly to the Bible, the Christian holy book, for spiritual wisdom.\n\n\n\nProtestant reform in England began with Henry VIII in 1534 because the Pope would not grant him a marriage annulment. Subsequently, King Henry rejected the Pope's authority, instead creating and assuming authority over the Church of England, a sort of hybrid church that combined some Catholic doctrine and some Protestant ideals. Over the next 20 years, there was religious turbulence in England as Queen Mary (1553\u20131558) reinstated Catholicism in England while persecuting and exiling Protestants , only to have Queen Elizabeth I and her Parliament attempt to lead the country back toward Protestantism during her reign (1558\u20131603).\n\n\n\nSome English citizens did not believe Queen Elizabeth's efforts to restore England to Protestantism went far enough. These citizens fell into two groups, both labeled Puritans by their opponents. The first group, known as separatists, believed the Church of England was so corrupt that their only choice was to leave England, separate from the church , and start a new church . They called this the English Separatist Church .\n\n\n\nAround 1607 or 1609, some of the separatists tried to start the new lives they imagined in Holland, in the Netherlands. Ultimately, the endeavor failed due to poverty and the sense that the children were assimilating too much into Dutch culture, so many of the separatists returned to England.\n\n\n\nBy 1620, members of the English Separatist Church were ready for a second try at establishing a new life and church . Those who set sail aboard the Mayflower for New England and eventually landed near Plymouth, Massachusetts, would, in time, become known as the Pilgrims.\n\n\n\nThe other group of English citizens who did not believe Queen Elizabeth's reform efforts went far enough were called non separatists ; over time, the term \" Puritan \" would become synonymous with the non separatists . They did not seek to leave the Church of England; they wanted only to reform it by eliminating the remnants of Catholicism that remained. In terms of theology, most of them were Calvinists.\n\n\n\nAlthough they did not desire to separate from the Church of England, some Puritans saw emigrating to New England as their best chance at true reform of the church and freedom to worship as they chose. In 1630, a decade after the Pilgrims embarked on a similar journey for similar reasons, the first Puritans traveled to the New World and established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nThough the separatists and non separatists disagreed about whether to sever ties to the Church of England, both groups of early North American colonists shared a dissatisfaction with the church and a mindset that they were free to establish a church more in alignment with their spiritual views. Perhaps predictably, this freedom to practice religion according to one's beliefs led to the creation of countless different churches , denominations, and doctrines in the colonies. Equally predictable, throughout history this diversity has led to disagreements.\n\n\n\nHowever, this diversity of religious thought has also become a core part of the identity of the United States: The Bill of Rights explicitly forbids \"establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Over 400 years in the making, this belief in personal empowerment and independence in religious matters, with its roots in the Protestant Reformation , has become an enduring part of the American mindset.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Protestantism/The-Reformation-in-England-and-Scotland", "page_content": "Henry VIII and the separation from Rome\n\nIn the meantime the Reformation had taken hold in England. The beginning there was political rather than religious, a quarrel between the king and the pope of the sort that had occurred in the Middle Ages without resulting in a permanent schism and might not have in this instance save for the overall European situation. The dispute had its root in the assumption that the king was a national stallion expected to provide an heir to the throne. England did not have the Salic law, which in France forbade female succession, but England had just emerged from a prolonged civil war, the Wars of the Roses, and the new dynasty needed a male heir to maintain its hold on the throne and to prevent the resumption of civil war. Catherine of Aragon, the queen of Henry VIII, had borne him numerous children of whom only one survived, the princess Mary, and more were not to be expected. The ordinary procedure in such a case was to discover some flaw in the marriage that would allow an annulment or a divorce. In this instance the flaw was not difficult to find, because Catherine had been married to Henry\u2019s brother Arthur, and canon law, following the prohibition in the book of Leviticus (20:21), forbade the marriage of a man with his deceased brother\u2019s widow. At the time of the marriage the pope, Julius II, had given a dispensation to cover this infraction of the rule. The question now was whether the pope had the authority to dispense from the divine law. Catherine said there had been no need for a dispensation because her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated and there had been no impediment to her marriage to Henry. The knot would have been cut by some casuistry had Catherine not been the aunt of Emperor Charles V, who was not prepared to see her cast aside in favour of another wife. Clement VII, wishing neither to provoke the emperor nor to alienate the king, dallied so long that Henry took the matter into his own hands, repudiated papal authority, and in 1534 set up the independent Church of England, with the king as the supreme head. The spiritual head was the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, who married Henry to Anne Boleyn. She bore the princess Elizabeth, and still another wife, Jane Seymour, bore the future Edward VI.\n\nHenry\u2019s basic concern was political, but the alterations in the structure of the church gave scope for a reformation that was religious in character. Part of the impulse came from the survivals of Lollardy, part from the Lutheran movement on the Continent, and even more from the Christian humanism represented by Erasmus. Although Henry retained much Catholic doctrine, especially transubstantiation, and ecclesiastical organization, he did introduce important changes, including the suppression of the monasteries, the introduction of the Bible in the vernacular in the parish churches, and permission to the clergy to marry, though this last reform was later revoked. The resistance to Henry\u2019s program was not formidable, and the executions resulting were not numerous. Henry was impartial in burning some Lutherans who would not submit to his later reactionary legislation and toward some Catholics who would not accept the royal supremacy over the church, notably John Fisher and Thomas More.\n\nOn his ascent to the throne in 1547, young Edward VI was hailed as England\u2019s Josiah, the young 7th-century-bce king of Judah who enforced the Deuteronomic reform. Edward, it was held, would rid the land of idolatry so that England might be blessed. Protestantism advanced rapidly during his reign through the systematic reformation of doctrine, worship, and discipline\u2014the three external marks of the true church. A reformed confession of faith and a prayer book were adopted, but the reformation of the ecclesiastical laws that would have defined the basis of discipline was blocked by the nobility in Parliament.\n\nThe death of Edward and England\u2019s return to Roman Catholicism in 1553 under Queen Mary was interpreted by Protestants as God\u2019s judgment that England had not taken the Reformation seriously enough. Many, including Cranmer, died as martyrs to the Protestant cause, and others fled to the European continent. Those in exile experimented with more radical forms of worship and discipline, and published material justifying rebellion against an idolatrous ruler. Exiles also produced two large volumes of incalculable consequence for English religious thought, John Foxe\u2019s Actes and Monuments, popularly known as The Book of Martyrs, and the Geneva Bible. The most popular books in England for many years after their publication, they provided a view of the country as an elect nation chosen by God to bring the power of the Antichrist (understood to be the pope) to an end.\n\nElizabeth I, assumed the throne in 1558 and was hailed as the glorious Deborah (a 12th-century-bce Israelite leader), the \u201crestorer of Israel.\u201d She did not, however, restore it far enough for some English Protestants, particularly the Puritans. Indeed, she distrusted the challenge to authority and feared the disorder that either extreme evangelical zeal or extreme Catholic zeal could cause. Two statutes promulgated in her first year\u2014the Act of Supremacy, stating that the queen was \u201csupreme governor\u201d of the Church of England, and the Act of Uniformity, ensuring that English worship should follow The Book of Common Prayer\u2014defined the nature of the English religious establishment. In 1571 the Convocation of Canterbury, one of the church\u2019s two primary legislative bodies (along with the Convocation of York), defined standard doctrine in the Thirty-nine Articles, but attempts to reform the prayer book further and to produce a reformed discipline failed. Defeated in the convocation, the reformers came to rely more on Parliament, where they could always depend on strong support."}, {"url": "https://archbishopholgates.academy/our-school/our-vision-values-care-achievement/our-history/", "page_content": "Archbishop Holgate\u2019s School was founded by one of the leading statesmen of the reign of King Henry VIII.

Martin Luther precipitated the Reformation with his critiques of both the practices and the theology of the Roman Catholic Church. John Calvin was the most important figure in the second generation of the Reformation, and his interpretation of Christianity, known as Calvinism , deeply influenced many areas of Protestant thought. Other figures included Pope Leo X , who excommunicated Luther; the Holy Roman emperor Charles V , who essentially declared war on Protestantism; Henry VIII , king of England, who presided over the establishment of an independent Church of England; and Huldrych Zwingli , a Swiss reformer.\n\nThe Reformation became the basis for the founding of Protestantism , one of the three major branches of Christianity . The Reformation led to the reformulation of certain basic tenets of Christian belief and resulted in the division of Western Christendom between Roman Catholicism and the new Protestant traditions. The spread of Protestantism in areas that had previously been Roman Catholic had far-reaching political, economic, and social effects.\n\nReformation, also called Protestant Reformation, the religious revolution that took place in the Western church in the 16th century. Its greatest leaders undoubtedly were Martin Luther and John Calvin. Having far-reaching political, economic, and social effects, the Reformation became the basis for the founding of Protestantism, one of the three major branches of Christianity.\n\nThe world of the late medieval Roman Catholic Church from which the 16th-century reformers emerged was a complex one. Over the centuries the church, particularly in the office of the papacy, had become deeply involved in the political life of western Europe. The resulting intrigues and political manipulations, combined with the church\u2019s increasing power and wealth, contributed to the bankrupting of the church as a spiritual force. Abuses such as the sale of indulgences (or spiritual privileges) by the clergy and other charges of corruption undermined the church\u2019s spiritual authority. These instances must be seen as exceptions, however, no matter how much they were played up by polemicists. For most people, the church continued to offer spiritual comfort. There is some evidence of anticlericalism, but the church at large enjoyed loyalty as it had before. One development is clear: the political authorities increasingly sought to curtail the public role of the church and thereby triggered tension.\n\nMore From Britannica Christianity: Reformation\n\nThe Reformation of the 16th century was not unprecedented. Reformers within the medieval church such as St. Francis of Assisi, Valdes (founder of the Waldensians), Jan Hus, and John Wycliffe addressed aspects in the life of the church in the centuries before 1517. In the 16th century Erasmus of Rotterdam, a great humanist scholar, was the chief proponent of liberal Catholic reform that attacked popular superstitions in the church and urged the imitation of Christ as the supreme moral teacher. These figures reveal an ongoing concern for renewal within the church in the years before Luther is said to have posted his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church, Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517, the eve of All Saints\u2019 Day\u2014the traditional date for the beginning of the Reformation. (See Researcher\u2019s Note.)\n\nMartin Luther claimed that what distinguished him from previous reformers was that while they attacked corruption in the life of the church, he went to the theological root of the problem\u2014the perversion of the church\u2019s doctrine of redemption and grace. Luther, a pastor and professor at the University of Wittenberg, deplored the entanglement of God\u2019s free gift of grace in a complex system of indulgences and good works. In his Ninety-five Theses, he attacked the indulgence system, insisting that the pope had no authority over purgatory and that the doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. Here lay the key to Luther\u2019s concerns for the ethical and theological reform of the church: Scripture alone is authoritative (sola scriptura) and justification is by faith (sola fide), not by works. While he did not intend to break with the Catholic church, a confrontation with the papacy was not long in coming. In 1521 Luther was excommunicated; what began as an internal reform movement had become a fracture in western Christendom.\n\nThe Reformation movement within Germany diversified almost immediately, and other reform impulses arose independently of Luther. Huldrych Zwingli built a Christian theocracy in Z\u00fcrich in which church and state joined for the service of God. Zwingli agreed with Luther in the centrality of the doctrine of justification by faith, but he espoused a different understanding of the Holy Communion. Luther had rejected the Catholic church\u2019s doctrine of transubstantiation, according to which the bread and wine in Holy Communion became the actual body and blood of Christ. According to Luther\u2019s notion, the body of Christ was physically present in the elements because Christ is present everywhere, while Zwingli claimed that entailed a spiritual presence of Christ and a declaration of faith by the recipients.\n\nAnother group of reformers, often though not altogether correctly referred to as \u201cradical reformers,\u201d insisted that baptism be performed not on infants but on adults who had professed their faith in Jesus. Called Anabaptists, they remained a marginal phenomenon in the 16th century but survived\u2014despite fierce persecution\u2014as Mennonites and Hutterites into the 21st century. Opponents of the ancient Trinitarian dogma made their appearance as well. Known as Socinians, after the name of their founder, they established flourishing congregations, especially in Poland.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In Basel, Switzerland, Calvin brought out the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536, the first systematic, theological treatise of the new reform movement. Calvin agreed with Luther\u2019s teaching on justification by faith. However, he found a more positive place for law within the Christian community than did Luther. In Geneva, Calvin was able to experiment with his ideal of a disciplined community of the elect. Calvin also stressed the doctrine of predestination and interpreted Holy Communion as a spiritual partaking of the body and blood of Christ. Calvin\u2019s tradition merged eventually with Zwingli\u2019s into the Reformed tradition, which was given theological expression by the (second) Helvetic Confession of 1561.\n\nThe Reformation spread to other European countries over the course of the 16th century. By mid century, Lutheranism dominated northern Europe. Eastern Europe offered a seedbed for even more radical varieties of Protestantism, because kings were weak, nobles strong, and cities few, and because religious pluralism had long existed. Spain and Italy were to be the great centres of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, and Protestantism never gained a strong foothold there.\n\nIn England the Reformation\u2019s roots were both political and religious. Henry VIII, incensed by Pope Clement VII\u2019s refusal to grant him an annulment of his marriage, repudiated papal authority and in 1534 established the Anglican church with the king as the supreme head. In spite of its political implications, the reorganization of the church permitted the beginning of religious change in England, which included the preparation of a liturgy in English, the Book of Common Prayer. In Scotland, John Knox, who spent time in Geneva and was greatly influenced by John Calvin, led the establishment of Presbyterianism, which made possible the eventual union of Scotland with England.

Elizabeth\u2019s government moved cautiously but steadily to transfer these structural and liturgical reforms from the statute books to the local parishes throughout the kingdom. Priests, temporal officers, and men proceeding to university degrees were required to swear an oath to the royal supremacy or lose their positions; absence from Sunday church service was punishable by a fine; royal commissioners sought to ensure doctrinal and liturgical conformity. Many of the nobles and gentry, along with a majority of the common people, remained loyal to the old faith, but all the key positions in the government and church were held by Protestants who employed patronage, pressure, and propaganda, as well as threats, to secure an outward observance of the religious settlement.\n\nBut to militant Protestants, including exiles from the reign of Queen Mary newly returned to England from Calvinist Geneva and other centres of continental reform, these measures seemed hopelessly pusillanimous and inadequate. They pressed for a drastic reform of the church hierarchy and church courts, a purging of residual Catholic elements in the prayer book and ritual, and a vigorous searching out and persecution of recusants. Each of these demands was repugnant to the queen. She felt that the reforms had gone far enough and that any further agitation would provoke public disorder, a dangerous itch for novelty, and an erosion of loyalty to established authority. Elizabeth, moreover, had no interest in probing the inward convictions of her subjects; provided that she could obtain public uniformity and obedience, she was willing to let the private beliefs of the heart remain hidden. This policy was consistent with her own survival strategy, her deep conservatism, and her personal dislike of evangelical fervour. When in 1576 the archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Grindal, refused the queen\u2019s orders to suppress certain reformist educational exercises, called \u201cpropheseyings,\u201d Grindal was suspended from his functions and never restored to them. Upon Grindal\u2019s death, Elizabeth appointed a successor, Archbishop Whitgift, who vigorously pursued her policy of an authoritarian ecclesiastical regime and a relentless hostility to Puritan reformers.\n\nIf Elizabeth\u2019s religious settlement was threatened by Protestant dissidents, it was equally threatened by the recalcitrance and opposition of English Catholics. At first this opposition seemed relatively passive, but a series of crises in the late 1560s and early \u201970s disclosed its potential for serious, even fatal, menace. In 1569 a rebellion of feudal aristocrats and their followers in the staunchly Catholic north of England was put down by savage military force, while in 1571 the queen\u2019s informers and spies uncovered an international conspiracy against her life, known as the Ridolfi Plot. Both threats were linked at least indirectly to Mary, Queen of Scots, who had been driven from her own kingdom in 1568 and had taken refuge in England. The presence, more prisoner than guest, of the woman whom the Roman Catholic Church regarded as the rightful queen of England posed a serious political and diplomatic problem for Elizabeth, a problem greatly exacerbated by Mary\u2019s restless ambition and penchant for conspiracy. Elizabeth judged that it was too dangerous to let Mary leave the country, but at the same time she firmly rejected the advice of Parliament and many of her councillors that Mary should be executed. So a captive, at once ominous, malevolent, and pathetic, Mary remained.\n\nThe alarming increase in religious tension, political intrigue, and violence was not only an internal, English concern. In 1570 Pope Pius V excommunicated Elizabeth and absolved her subjects from any oath of allegiance that they might have taken to her. The immediate effect was to make life more difficult for English Catholics, who were the objects of a suspicion that greatly intensified in 1572 after word reached England of the St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day massacre of Protestants (Huguenots) in France. Tension and official persecution of recusants increased in the wake of the daring clandestine missionary activities of English Jesuits, trained on the Continent and smuggled back to England. Elizabeth was under great pressure to become more involved in the continental struggle between Roman Catholics and Protestants, in particular to aid the rebels fighting the Spanish armies in the Netherlands. But she was very reluctant to become involved, in part because she detested rebellion, even rebellion undertaken in the name of Protestantism, and in part because she detested expenditures. Eventually, after vacillations that drove her councillors to despair, she agreed first to provide some limited funds and then, in 1585, to send a small expeditionary force to the Netherlands.\n\nBritannica Quiz Women in Power Quiz\n\nFears of an assassination attempt against Elizabeth increased after Pope Gregory XIII proclaimed in 1580 that it would be no sin to rid the world of such a miserable heretic. In 1584 Europe\u2019s other major Protestant leader, William of Orange, was assassinated. Elizabeth herself showed few signs of concern\u2014throughout her life she was a person of remarkable personal courage\u2014but the anxiety of the ruling elite was intense. In an ugly atmosphere of intrigue, torture and execution of Jesuits, and rumours of foreign plots to kill the queen and invade England, Elizabeth\u2019s Privy Council drew up a Bond of Association, pledging its signers, in the event of an attempt on Elizabeth\u2019s life, to kill not only the assassins but also the claimant to the throne in whose interest the attempt had been made. The Association was clearly aimed at Mary, whom government spies, under the direction of Sir Francis Walsingham, had by this time discovered to be thoroughly implicated in plots against the queen\u2019s life. When Walsingham\u2019s men in 1586 uncovered the Babington Plot, another conspiracy to murder Elizabeth, the wretched Queen of Scots, her secret correspondence intercepted and her involvement clearly proved, was doomed. Mary was tried and sentenced to death. Parliament petitioned that the sentence be carried out without delay. For three months the queen hesitated and then with every sign of extreme reluctance signed the death warrant. When the news was brought to her that on February 8, 1587, Mary had been beheaded, Elizabeth responded with an impressive show of grief and rage. She had not, she wrote to Mary\u2019s son, James VI of Scotland, ever intended that the execution actually take place, and she imprisoned the man who had delivered the signed warrant. It is impossible to know how many people believed Elizabeth\u2019s professions of grief; Catholics on the Continent wrote bitter denunciations of the queen, while Protestants throughout the kingdom enthusiastically celebrated the death of a woman they had feared and hated.\n\nFor years Elizabeth had cannily played a complex diplomatic game with the rival interests of France and Spain, a game comparable to her domestic manipulation of rival factions. State-sanctioned privateering raids, led by Sir Francis Drake and others, on Spanish shipping and ports alternated with conciliatory gestures and peace talks. But by the mid-1580s it became increasingly clear that England could not avoid a direct military confrontation with Spain. Word reached London that the Spanish king, Philip II, had begun to assemble an enormous fleet that would sail to the Netherlands, join forces with a waiting Spanish army led by the duke of Parma, and then proceed to an invasion and conquest of Protestant England. Always reluctant to spend money, the queen had nonetheless authorized sufficient funds during her reign to maintain a fleet of maneuverable, well-armed fighting ships, to which could be added other vessels from the merchant fleet. When in July 1588 the Invincible Armada reached English waters, the queen\u2019s ships, in one of the most famous naval encounters of history, defeated the enemy fleet, which then in an attempt to return to Spain was all but destroyed by terrible storms.\n\nAt the moment when the Spanish invasion was imminently expected, Elizabeth resolved to review in person a detachment of soldiers assembled at Tilbury. Dressed in a white gown and a silver breastplate, she rode through the camp and proceeded to deliver a celebrated speech. Some of her councillors, she said, had cautioned her against appearing before a large, armed crowd, but she did not and would not distrust her faithful and loving people. Nor was she afraid of Parma\u2019s army: \u201cI know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman,\u201d Elizabeth declared, \u201cbut I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.\u201d She then promised, \u201cin the word of a Prince,\u201d richly to reward her loyal troops, a promise that she characteristically proved reluctant to keep. The scene exemplifies many of the queen\u2019s qualities: her courage, her histrionic command of grand public occasions, her rhetorical blending of magniloquence and the language of love, her strategic identification with martial virtues considered male, and even her princely parsimony."}, {"url": "https://www.churchofengland.org/news-and-media/media-centre/history-church-england", "page_content": "At the Reformation the Western Church became divided between those who continued to accept Papal authority and the various Protestant churches that did not. The Church of England was among the churches that broke with Rome. The catalyst for this decision was the refusal of the Pope to annul the marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, but also a Tudor nationalist belief that authority over the English Church properly belonged to the English monarchy. In the reign of Henry's son Edward VI the Church of England underwent further reformation, driven by the conviction that the theology being developed by the theologians of the Protestant Reformation was more faithful to the teaching of the Bible and the Early Church than the teaching of those who continued to support the Pope.\n\nIn the reign of Mary Tudor, the Church of England once again submitted to Papal authority. However, this policy was reversed when Elizabeth I became Queen in 1558.\n\nThe religious settlement that eventually emerged in the reign of Elizabeth gave the Church of England the distinctive identity that it still has today. It resulted in a Church that consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the Church of the Patristic and Medieval periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds, its pattern of ministry, its buildings and aspects of its liturgy, but which also embodied Protestant insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice. The way that this is often expressed is by saying that the Church of England is both 'catholic and reformed.'\n\nAt the end of the 16th century Richard Hooker produced the classic defence of the Elizabethan settlement in his Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, a work which sought to defend the Church of England against its Puritan critics who wanted further changes to make the Church of England more like the churches of Geneva or Scotland."}]}
