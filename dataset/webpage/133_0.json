The public - and government - had felt that films in the '20's had become increasingly risque and that the behavior of its stars was becoming scandalous. Laws were being passed. In response, the heads of the movie studios adopted a voluntary \"code\", hoping to head off legislation. The first part of the code prohibited \"lowering the moral standards of those who see it\", called for depictions of the \"correct standards of life\", and forbade a picture from showing any sort of ridicule towards a law or \"creating sympathy for its violation\". The second part dealt with particular behavior in film such as homosexuality, the use of specific curse words, and miscegenation.\n\nIn 1944, he was just 14 years old when on December 16th, The Battle of the Bulge began in the Ardennes forest on the Western Front.

The east London-raised artist is most well-known for his bittersweet U.K. hit \"A Picture of You,\" from 1962, the same year in which the Beatles opened for him on a string of dates. However, Brown's prolific run of early hits came to an end with the rise of Merseybeat, after which he increasingly pursued acting roles and became a broader entertainer. The '70s saw him unveil a new act, Brown's Home Brew, cementing his reputation as a musician's musician. Upon moving to Henley-on-Thames early the following decade, he reinforced his close friendship with his new neighbor George Harrison when the pair bonded over the ukulele. Following Harrison's death in 2001, Brown closed the Concert for George tribute show at the Royal Albert Hall (at the request of Harrison's wife Olivia), with a moving solo uke rendition of \"I'll See You in My Dreams.\" His performance is reputed to have been the catalyst for renewed public interest in the instrument.\n\nBorn Joseph Roger Brown in Swarby, Lincolnshire in 1941, Brown proved a natural guitarist from an early age, and in 1956, at age 15, he formed the Spacemen, a skiffle group with whom he started his career in entertainment. The band -- whose ranks included bassist Peter Oakman and his older brother Tony Oakman on banjo and guitar -- later switched to rock & roll, and was subsequently spotted by impresario Larry Parnes, who was in the process of signing up lot of young vocal talent in an effort to get in on the rock & roll boom. The Spacemen became Parnes' resident band, backing such figures as Vince Eager, Johnny Gentle, and Marty Wilde on the early Parnes package tours. The group also had the good fortune to be spotted by producer Jack Good, who was putting together the house band for his new television music showcase Boy Meets Girl. Brown was already a prodigious player, and he was hired as lead guitarist for the house orchestra at the age of 18; he was proficient in authentic American-style rock & roll, country, and country-blues, and stood out from the competition.\n\nHe was signed to Decca Records that same year; his first two singles, \"People Gotta Talk\" and \"Jellied Eels,\" issued in 1959 and 1960, respectively, failed to chart. But his third, \"The Darktown Strutters Ball,\" reached number 34 on the U.K. charts in 1960. The group by this time was rechristened the Bruvvers, owing to the fact that they weren't using the Spacemen name anymore, and had no official name, but were, as Brown put it -- in his uniquely Cockney-styled way -- \"like bruvvers.\" Brown left Decca for Pye Records in 1961, the latter company using his single \"Crazy Mixed Up Kid\" to launch its Piccadilly imprint. Only two of his next four singles even reached the Top 40, but Brown was making musical headway (and history) nonetheless. At just about that same time, he appeared as the lead guitarist on Billy Fury's landmark 10\" long-player The Sound of Fury, his playing among the highlights of what is generally regarded as one of the best albums to come out of the early English rock & roll boom. His work from that period and on that album has received high praise across the decades from musicians of succeeding generations including Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.\n\nBrown's own career didn't fully take off until 1962, when he hit the number two spot on the singles charts with \"A Picture of You.\" He was voted the \"Top U.K. Vocal Personality\" of 1962 in the pages of New Musical Express, and toured that year on a bill that included the Beatles, who were just about to record their debut single, \"Love Me Do\"; \"A Picture of You\" was also a personal favorite of both Harrison and Paul McCartney, later even turning up on the \"Let It Be\" sessions. Brown's next two records, \"It Only Took a Minute\" and \"That's What Love Will Do\" also made the Top Ten in 1962 and 1963, but his subsequent recordings were much more modest sellers, only making the Top 30.\n\nBrown was still sufficiently prominent in 1963 to get a film debut late that year, in What a Crazy World, which co-starred Marty Wilde. By that time, however, Brown's hold on the listening public was fading in the face of the Merseybeat boom and the next wave of British rock & roll. He turned increasingly to work in movies, pantomime, and theater musicals, and scored a big success in Charlie Girl on London's West End. Ironically, his occasional penchant for novelty tunes -- which included a recording of \"I'm Henry the Eighth\" -- anticipated the strategy of such successful mid-'60s pop/rock acts as Herman's Hermits, who parlayed their recording of the latter song into a huge American hit; that same use of novelty tunes in his repertory, however, also made it difficult for listeners of subsequent generations, having heard of Brown's reputation as a first-rate guitarist, to fully absorb some of his recordings, especially the early concert documents, which were weighted heavily toward his Cockney/novelty repertory.\n\nBrown's last chart success of the '60s was a low Top 40 placement for his rendition of \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" in 1967. He later worked on television in children's programming and game shows, but in 1972, Brown was back in music with a new band, Brown's Home Brew, whose repertory embraced not only rock & roll but also country and gospel music and featured his first wife, Vicki, on vocals. Brown has remained active in music ever since, and crossed paths on record with his old friend Harrison several times in the '70s and '80s; Harrison was also the best man at Brown's wedding to his second wife in 2000. He has continued performing in the 21st century and is also seen frequently on British television in connection with rock & roll-related programming. Brown's 50th year in music, in 2008, saw him receive a U.K. gold award for sales over 100,000 copies of a new best-of collection, as well as complete a 37-date tour, and a Royal Albert Hall concert with Mark Knopfler, Jools Holland, Dave Edmunds, and Chas & Dave. Brown has also received Mojo magazine's lifetime award for outstanding contribution to music after 51 years of recording. In 2009, Brown was given an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe next decade was bookended by documents of his relentless touring ethic -- 2011's Live in Liverpool and 2019's In Concert -- while in 2012 he issued The Ukulele Album, on which he tackled material associated with acts such as the Who, ELO, and M\u00f6torhead. In 2019, Brown celebrated his 60th year in the music business with the release of a lavish, multi-disc box set that traced the course of his career and featured numerous unreleased recordings."}], "Joe Brown died on October 28, 1957.": [{"url": "https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/bmd_death/", "page_content": "In a few of the death records collections on Ancestry, you will find the indexes that link to images of actual birth records.

Apart from his ascents, Joe was known for creating a new type of climbing protection, by creating a type of chockstone or nut, which led him to open up several gear shops in the 60s.\n\n\u201cImmense sadness to hear of the death of my good friend Joe Brown whom I have known for over 60 years and had some wonderful climbs with him\u2014he was one of the most brilliant innovative climbers the world has seen and a very special human being\u201d, wrote Sir Chris Bonington in a Facebook post, adding a tribute link from the Mountain Heritage Trust, an archive of films, images, and books of Britain\u2019s most iconic achievements.\n\nJoe was also well known for his televised rock climbs of \u201cOld Man of Hoy\u201d in the north coast of Scotland in 1967, along with Ian McNaught-Davis and Chris Bonington. In 2011, he was made CBE, for services to rock climbing and mountaineering.\n\nJoe climbing Cemetery Gates with the late Don Whillans:\n\nBritish mountaineer and writer Stephen Venables, known for being the first Briton to climb Everest without using supplemental oxygen, tweeted: \u201cVery sad to hear that Joe Brown died last night.

They also included a personal message from Dennis, sent to Joe\u2019s friends and the climbing media:\n\n\u201cShortly before Joe died, and before he was no longer able we had a long conversation for we both realised that a reckoning was coming.\n\nJoe was sanguine and emphasised he felt so lucky to have led the life he had been able to pursue. We both agreed that to have started climbing in the late 1940s had been so fortunate, with the opening up of the countryside with easier access and the ability that developed to first travel to climb in Europe, and then almost worldwide.\n\nI have been privileged to climb with many outstanding climbers from the UK and abroad, but Joe was the most naturally talented rock climber of any that I tied onto a rope with.\n\nJoe himself was never solemn for long, he loved life and one of my abiding memories is that we sang a lot when young. Joe\u2019s party piece was the operetta \u2018The Sergeant Major\u2019. I do not know of any recording of this, but I do know he liked to laugh along at Tom Patey\u2019s wonderful song \u2018The Legend of Joe Brown\u2019. There are two recordings extant of Tom playing and singing this in a couple of party settings, but unfortunately on each of these, key verses are missing, e,g. The one about the Mustagh Tower ascent\u2026..\u2019In the cold cold Karakoram\u2019 which is by mutual agreement a superb example of Tom\u2019s versifying ability, and on the other tape there is much background disturbance.\n\nSo not for ego, honest, I decided to send out a copy of myself playing and singing this as an MP3 cover. And I intend this as a tribute to Joe, who I was friends with for over 70 years.\n\nFor this MP3 recording I thank Paul Cherry who worked overnight to provide this at his Cotswold studio.\u201d\n\nThanks to Geoff Birtles and Jim Herrington for providing photographs.\n\nJoe Brown died on 15th April, 2020, at the age of 89.\n\nIt is with profound sadness that we have to share with you the passing of Joe Brown. He left us peacefully at 10pm last night. He was at home with his family In our hearts, Joe will continue to climb evermore.

The search defaults to searching multiple record types, so if you want to search only birth records, click the check-marks to remove the others.\n\nQ: Can I still search for Death Records using the search.mnhs.org (search box located at the top-right of MNHS webpages)?\n\nYes. However, the Minnesota People Records Search was specifically designed to be an easier and more effective search tool for records about people.\n\nQ: What will the online index tell me?\n\nFirst, middle, and last name of the individual; date of death; county of death; and certificate number. Records from 1904 - 1907 and 1955 - 2001 will often also include birthdate, birthplace, and mother\u2019s maiden name. Anything missing from the original record will not appear in the index.\n\nThe two most crucial pieces of information to note are the year of death and the certificate number because they will help you find the record on microfilm.\n\nQ: Which Death Records are included in the search?\n\ndeath certificates from 1908-2001\n\ndeath cards from 1904 to 1907\n\nQ: How can I see a full death record that is in the online index?\n\nVisit the Gale Family Library in person: Certificates can be viewed in our Hubbs Microfilm Room\n\nthe Gale Family Library in person: Certificates can be viewed in our Hubbs Microfilm Room Order a copy: Click on the blue \"Buy\" button to start the purchase process\n\nQ: Where can I find a post-2001 Death Record?\n\nYou can request a post-2001 record from the county vital statistics or registrar's office where the death occurred or the state Department of Health.\n\nQ: Where can I find pre-1904 Death Records?\n\nMNHS has death records on microfilm for some counties and localities that can be borrowed through Interlibrary Loan. See the Death Records page of our Vital Records Research Guide for a full list\n\nMNHS has some local and county death registers in the original format that can be viewed in-person only. You can search in the online catalog with the county, township or city name and the subject \"death records\" for a complete listing of death records, indexes, and registers.\n\nSome early records are held by the counties. Contact the vital statistics or registrar's office for the county in which the person died.\n\nThe Library has microfilm copies of statewide death registers for 1899 and death cards from 1900 through 1907.\n\nNote: Minnesota law required the recording of deaths beginning in 1870, but compliance and enforcement was sporadic during the early years. Many counties were not formed until after 1870, so deaths occurring in what became those counties may be recorded in parent counties.\n\nQ: How are the early death cards (1900 to 1907) different from later death certificates?\n\nDeath certificates are filled out at or just after the time of death, usually by a physician or medical examiner with the help of an informant (usually a spouse or other family member). Death cards are transcripts of death information that were compiled at a later time by the Minnesota Department of Health. The cards cover the whole state, but they are not complete and are not considered official documents.\n\nQ: What information is on a death card (1900 - 1907)?\n\nA completed card includes the decedent\u2019s full name, sex, race, marital status, birthplace, and occupation; primary and contributing causes of death (including the duration of each); parents' names and birthplaces (state or country); mother\u2019s maiden name and birthplace; names and addresses of attending physician and undertaker; burial place and permit number; and the name and address of the person reporting the death (usually the township/village clerk or city health officer). You can see an example of a death card here.\n\n\n\nUnlike death certificates, many death cards were filled out very incompletely. Cards, especially for the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, frequently contain little more information than the name of the decedent, date of death, sex, marital status, birthplace, cause of death, and person reporting the death.\n\nQ: What information is on a death certificate (1908 - 2001)?\n\nInformation about the person may include: first, last, and middle name; age; sex; race; birthdate; birthplace (state or country); occupation; marital status (including number of children); spouse\u2019s name; parents' names and birthplaces; and signature and address of person providing information about the deceased. Information about the death may include: date of death; primary and contributing causes of death; duration of the primary and contributing causes of death; signature and address of the physician; former residence if death occurred away from home; place of death; burial place and date; signature and address of undertaker; date when the certificate was filed; and signature of the local registrar.\n\n\n\nNot all of this information will be on every death certificate because the forms were not always complete. You can see examples of death certificates here.\n\nQ: The cause of death on a certificate is unfamiliar to me. How can I figure out what it means?\n\nDeath certificates generally use medical/scientific terminology. The terms from more recent certificates can usually be deciphered with a basic web search, but earlier death records often used abbreviations and medical terms that are now outdated for illnesses. Library staff can help you search for modern meanings of older terms or check \"Old Medical Terminology\" on the RootsWeb site.\n\nQ: How were the death certificates created?\n\nWhen someone died, a physician or mortician compiled information about the deceased on a death certificate. The certificate was registered with the local county registrar and the original copy was sent to the Office of Vital Statistics, Minnesota Department of Health. There, the vital statistics staff ensure that the information was complete and that it met the state\u2019s standards. At that point, the death certificate at the Department of Health became the official, permanent record.\n\nSearch tips\n\nTry alternate spellings: Names may have been spelled differently, or the name may have simply been transcribed or entered incorrectly into the index.\n\nTry searching without a first name specified: Some people used a nickname or middle name instead of their legal given name.\n\nCounty:\n\nCounty of death may be different from the person's county of residence. For example, records for a highway death near Willmar would be in Kandiyohi County where the accident occurred, even though the victim was traveling from Minneapolis (Hennepin County) to Ortonville (Big Stone County)\n\nSome Minnesota counties were established after 1908. Pennington County was formed in 1910 from a portion of Red Lake County, and Lake of the Woods County was formed in 1922 from a portion of Beltrami County. As a result, the record of a death in Baudette in 1920 was recorded in Beltrami County but one in 1923 in Lake of the Woods County.\n\nTry searching neighboring/nearby counties, counties where the parents had family, or counties where larger hospitals and institutions were located.\n\nMother\u2019s maiden name: If the record is from 1955 to 2001 and you can use the Related Name field to add it to the search. (From 1908-1954, the mother's maiden name was not indexed.) Keep in mind that even in the 1955 to 2001 period, not all records have a maiden name recorded and some records have a first name, rather than a last name.\n\nUse the power of the \u201cStarts with\u201d search: Try using one--or just a few--of the beginning letters of a first or last name. Particularly helpful for names that can be spelled different ways or were easily misunderstood by clerks.\n\nTry other search options: The search defaults to Starts With, but the other options (Sounds Like, Contains, Exactly, etc.) can be helpful\n\nExact certificate number: If you know it, search using a year-MN-certificate format (1917-MN-020666)\n\nSorting results: Results are initially sorted alphabetically by last name. Switch to a chronological sort by clicking on the date label at the top of the column. Clicking the date label again will reverse the list so the newest records are first.\n\nIf you believe that the certificate was not included in the index, see \u201cWhy can\u2019t I find a Death Certificate in the index that I know should be there?\u201d\n\nSorting results: Results are initially sorted alphabetically by last name. Switch to a chronological sort by clicking on the date label at the top of the column. Clicking the date label again will reverse the list so the newest records are first.\n\nIf you believe that the certificate was not included in the index, see \u201cWhy can\u2019t I find a Birth Certificate that I know should be there?\u201d\n\nSpecial tips for finding death certificates for Dakota and Ojibwe people\n\nAll deaths were subject to the same reporting requirements, but American Indians' death records can be harder to find.\n\nTry searching all possible variants of a name. Many American Indian death certificates contain Ojibwe- or Dakota-language names or a combination of Dakota/Ojibwe and Anglicized versions.\n\nCertificates for deaths that occurred on Indian reservations are frequently filed under the category \u201cUnorganized Territory\u201d at the end of the county\u2019s organized jurisdictions, especially before 1940.\n\nCheck the \"Native American death certificates\" collection. Available only in their original paper format, these records contain information on American Indians who either 1) died in Minnesota and were enrolled in or otherwise connected with tribes or bands located in Minnesota or other states (including South Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana, and Nevada); or 2) died in other states or Canada but were enrolled in or otherwise connected with tribes or bands located in Minnesota.\n\nQ: Can I edit my search without starting over?\n\nYes! Scroll up to the search area. Add, change, or remove information from the boxes, and then click the Search button. Your new results will be below.\n\nQ: How does searching for multiple record-types impact my search?\n\nIf you are searching for more than one type of record, there are a few things that change:\n\nDates: The record-types cover different periods of time, as listed next to their names in the search area. If you search for a record type in a time period for which there are no records (census records after 1905, for example) you will get no results for that type of record.\n\nAvailable search fields: You may see search fields that only apply to some records. For example, neither State Census nor Veterans\u2019 Graves Registrations use the Middle Name field. If a record-type does not use a field, the search ignores it for that type. So if you search for Death and State Census records for John James Smith, the death search tab will have results with all 3 names but the census search tab will have all the John Smiths.\n\nQ: How does the Sounds Like search work?\n\n\u201cSounds Like\u201d searches use Soundex, an indexing system based on how a name sounds rather than how it is spelled. It enables one-step searching for alternate spellings. Soundex will find some names that are very close in spelling (Anderson, Andersen, and Andreson, for example), as well as names that are different in spelling but are pronounced similarly or have similar base consonants (O\u2019Brien, Obring, Overom, and Obermann, for example).\n\nBecause Soundex utilizes the first letter of a name, it is crucial that this letter is known and has been correctly transcribed from documents (for example, Yorgeson and Jorgeson may be pronounced the same, but will not show up in the same \u201csounds like\u201d search).\n\nQ: What are the results under the Comments tab?\n\nThey are comments left by users like you! Researchers can comment on any record and often leave information about alternate spellings, nicknames, etc. that can help other researchers. The system searches the full text of comments, and clicking on a comment in the results page will open the full index record. Please feel free to leave any comments that you think would be helpful to other researchers.\n\nQ: Can MNHS staff research Death Certificates for me?\n\nWe can help you place an order if you are having difficulty and we are more than happy to give you search advice, but we do not have the staff or resources to do in-depth research for our patrons. You can contact our Reference Staff by phone (651-259-3300), or through email or Facebook.\n\nOrder help\n\nQ: How can I order a copy of a Death Certificate?\n\nOrder a non-certified copy directly through the online search system. Click on the \u201cbuy\u201d button to select and then order through our online store. The cost is $9, plus any applicable sales tax. If you opt to mail your payment, we will process your order after it arrives.\n\nQ; If I order a copy, how will it be delivered?\n\nA copy of the record will be mailed to you, usually within 15 business days.The Minnesota Historical Society does not email scans of death certificates; all death record orders are filled via postal mail.\n\nQ: Where can I get a certified copy of a death certificate?\n\nMNHS cannot provide certified or \u201cofficial\u201d copies, but you can request one from a county's vital statistics/registrar's office or the state Department of Health. Because certification is designed to prevent fraud--such as identity theft--you must submit an application to establish that you have a \u201ctangible interest\u201d in a certificate. See the Department of Health\u2019s website for more information.\n\nQ: Why does it cost $9 to get a copy of a Death Record from MNHS?\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Health has set the fee for a copy of a non-certified death record at $9. The Minnesota Historical Society is complying with this price, as do all the county registrars/public health offices. MNHS members do not get a discount on Death Records.\n\nResearchers who visit the Library and copy their own death certificates while on-site are not subject to this $9 fee, but pay only the $0.35 per page microfilm printing cost.\n\nQ: Can I see a death certificate without paying for it?\n\nYes, on-site researchers can view death certificates on microfilm in the Gale Family Library\u2019s Hubbs Microfilm Room, free of charge.\n\nQ: How do I locate death certificates on the microfilm?\n\nYou need to know the year of death and the death certificate number, both of which can be found through the online search. Then use this information to select the appropriate reel from the drawer in the Hubbs microfilm room. For example: For death certificate #1925-MN-018376, go to the drawers that contain the death certificate microfilm, and locate the drawer holding 1925. Each roll will contain a range of certificate numbers, but roll 10 for 1925 is labeled as containing certificate numbers 16,942 through 18,881, so 1925-MN-018376 will be found in roll 10 of the year 1925.\n\nMinnesota death certificates were numbered in a complicated fashion. The primary arrangement is by year, then by political unit, with the counties in alphabetical order. Each county is then broken down into its civil subdivisions (townships, villages, cities, and unorganized territory, if any), arranged alphabetically with unorganized territory at the end of each county sequence. Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth are separate from their counties and are located after the last of the counties.\n\nQ: Will I find any additional information besides the death certificate?\n\nIn some cases, supporting information or attachments may follow the death certificate on the microfilm. This supporting data can come in a range of styles and include a variety of information. For example, if a mistake was made on the original death certificate, the Minnesota Department of Health would draft an official Affidavit of Correction with the correct information. In other cases, the Minnesota Department of Health may have required a doctor to provide additional information about a death certificate.\n\nUnusual circumstances\n\nQ: What should I do if I find an error in the index?\n\nWhile both the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Historical Society are greatly concerned with the quality of the index, not all errors can be corrected. Information in original records cannot be changed in the index, but you can leave a user comment. User comments are searchable and can help other researchers.\n\nIf you find a transcription error (as opposed to an error on the certificate itself), please send the certificate number and description of the error to peoplesearch@mnhs.org so the index can be corrected.\n\nQ: Why can\u2019t I find a Death Certificate in the index that I know should be there?\n\nIncomplete or incorrect original record: People providing information about deaths are often family members in a time of stress. They may give out erroneous information about the deceased. It is also not unusual to find misspellings in older records of all types.\n\nPeople providing information about deaths are often family members in a time of stress. They may give out erroneous information about the deceased. It is also not unusual to find misspellings in older records of all types. Transcription errors: Creating a database index is not exact science and mistakes can be made when people type in information, especially if the original record has poor handwriting. If you suspect an error, please see \"What should I do if I find an error in the index?\"\n\nCreating a database index is not exact science and mistakes can be made when people type in information, especially if the original record has poor handwriting. If you suspect an error, please see \"What should I do if I find an error in the index?\" Some records are missing from the database, but death certificates do exist : Many 1996 deaths are missing from the index; certain months for certain counties are missing and others are incomplete. On a smaller scale, this also appears to be the case for 1980 and 1991.\n\n: Many 1996 deaths are missing from the index; certain months for certain counties are missing and others are incomplete. On a smaller scale, this also appears to be the case for 1980 and 1991. If a researcher knows of a specific death at a specific place but is unable to find an index entry, additional research on the microfilm should be considered. Staff in the Gale Family Library can assist you in narrowing this search and see \"How do I locate death certificates on the microfilm?\"\n\nIf a Minnesotan died outside of Minnesota, their death record would be in the state in which the person died.\n\nSee the Search Tips above for hints specific to death records and/or contact Reference Staff for assistance\n\nQ: Why can\u2019t I find a 2001 Death Certificate on the microfilm that I know should be there?\n\nThe online death certificate index contains death certificates issued in 2001 that are not on the microfilm held by the Minnesota Historical Society. Certificates not on the microfilm include numbers 000001 \u2013 000796 and numbers higher than 534515. If these certificates were microfilmed, the Minnesota Historical Society does not hold the microfilm. Researchers seeking numbers falling within these missing ranges should contact the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nQ: Does the Death Certificate Index reflect official corrections or amendments made to death records?\n\nNo. This index only reflects information on death certificates as they were received by MNHS after being microfilmed in 2001. The index serves as an access tool to the historical records, and is not the official record. For access to certificates with corrections or amendments, contact the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nQ: There is an error on the original certificate. Can I request a correction to the actual record?\n\nYes. You can contact the Office of Vital Records in the Minnesota Department of Health and they can amend the official record. See their website for more information. Note: amending a record with the MN Department of Health will not amend historic copies held at the MN Historical Society, county health departments, or elsewhere.\n\nMore help\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Reference staff at the Gale Family Library by phone (651-259-3300), via email, or through Facebook."}, {"url": "https://mixedarticle.com/singer-joe-brown-illness-health-condition-update", "page_content": "What Illness Does Singer Joe Brown Have?

Brown, who has died aged 89, was involved in the Rock and Ice Climbing Club, founded in 1951 by a group of Manchester climbers.\n\nHe developed a partnership with Don Whillans that was to become the most significant in modern climbing history. As a team, they were formidable, the boldness and physical strength of the slightly younger Whillans balancing Brown\u2019s inspired improvisations and innate rock-sense.\n\nThe stages for the Rock and Ice advance were the Derbyshire outcrops and the range of cliffs along the north side of the Llanberis Pass in Snowdonia. On the August bank holiday of 1951, Brown joined forces with Whillans in an attempt on the right wall of Cenotaph Corner on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass. Their first attempt ended in retreat as a cloudburst soaked the rock.\n\nA month later they were back, and this time succeeded on a route that was a psychological breakthrough in its acceptance of unremitting steepness and exposure, loose rock and poor protection. They called it Cemetery Gates, after a name Brown saw on the destination board of a bus as he returned through Chester that night. That October, the pair fought up Vember on Clogwyn Du\u2019r Arddu \u2013 Brown\u2019s second attempt after a near disaster two years previously \u2013 and the Rock and Ice revolution was under way.\n\nThe activities of this group \u2013 and Brown in particular \u2013 expanded to include the French Alps, where British climbing had scarcely advanced for 50 years. On their first visit in 1953 the Brown-Whillans team made the third ascent in a very fast time of the recent Magnone route on the West Face of the Petit Dru \u2013 then deemed the hardest rock-climb in the Alps; they went on to climb an even harder line of their own on the West Face of the Aiguille de Blaiti\u00e8re that very soon gained and long retained a reputation for extreme difficulty.\n\nAs a result, Brown was invited to join Charles Evans\u2019s reconnaissance expedition in 1955 to the 28,169ft Kanchenjunga, the world\u2019s third highest peak and its highest unclimbed one at that time. Brown\u2019s acceptance, and apparent refusal to press for Whillans\u2019s inclusion \u2013 something he was in no position to do \u2013 was seen by the latter as a betrayal, and the two men, who had never been close friends, climbed less frequently together thereafter.\n\nThe climb was far harder, more arduous and committing than the 1953 ascent of Everest. Brown led the final difficult rock pitch to the top, minus four feet, as an undertaking had been given to the King of Nepal not to tread on the actual summit of this holy mountain. His fame thereafter was assured. He followed up this success in 1956 with the first ascent of the Mustagh Tower, a 24,000ft rock spire in the Karakoram.\n\nBy 1956 Brown had established himself as the most considerable all-round mountaineer in the history of the sport in Britain. His first ascents on Pennine, Welsh, Cumbrian and Scottish rock had significantly advanced the concept of the climbable; in the Alps and the Himalayas his record was no less impressive.\n\nHe continued to climb into his old age and the list of his achievements grew longer with the years. His last recorded new climbs, on Welsh slate and in the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, were accomplished in his late 70s. But after those two great Himalayan ascents of the mid-1950s, his climbing involvement was more relaxed.\n\nIn 1957 he married Valerie Gray. The horizons of his activity broadened. He began to be in demand for TV work, where his flinty, humorous commentary, phlegmatic even when in extremis, acted as anchor to outside broadcasts from places as far apart as the Valley of the Assassins in Iran, Welsh sea and mountain cliffs, Alpine aiguilles, Scottish sea-stacks and a wintry Ben Nevis.\n\nIn 1967 he was one of those climbing the Old Man of Hoy, off Orkney, in an ascent televised by the BBC. In 1984 he repeated the experience with his younger daughter, Zoe, whose character came over as being as amused and engaging as his own. He even made a quirky series of television shorts about fishing in inaccessible places and acted as Jeremy Irons\u2019 double in the waterfall sequences of The Mission (1986) \u2013 the fact that Irons towered over him by almost a foot was concealed by careful camerawork.\n\nThere was a measured wit and gravity and a light mocking touch about his screen persona that held true in all the relationships of his life. He instructed for a time at White Hall Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Derbyshire, where he found time to master canoeing. He loved to fish, alone or with close friends.\n\nHe had new phases of intense exploratory activity on British rock. In the early 60s he combed the secretive valleys of southern Snowdonia for small, steep crags on which he sketched out the early masterpieces of climbing\u2019s modern age: Vector, Pellagra, Dwm, Hardd, Ferdinand. In 1965 he moved to Llanberis and opened the first of a small chain of outdoor equipment shops.\n\nHe had significant climbing partnerships with men of younger generations. With Peter Crew, he developed the awesome sea-cliffs of Gogarth and South Stack, in Anglesey, producing an extraordinary series of routes: Mousetrap, Mammoth, Red Wall, Doppelganger, Wendigo. He continued to produce classic and teasing climbs long after Crew had failed to keep pace with his zeal, and made significant ascents of difficult peaks in the Andes.\n\nIn the Himalayas he forged an alliance with Mo Anthoine and enjoyed trip after light-hearted trip \u2013 many of them unsuccessful in reaching their objectives and that did not matter to him one iota \u2013 to difficult peaks in Garhwal and elsewhere. Even in his 60s he took part in an expedition dogged by bad weather to Everest\u2019s then unclimbed north-north-east ridge.\n\nBorn in Ardwick, Manchester, Joe was the seventh and last child of a poor Roman Catholic family. His father died when Joe was eight months old. Thereafter, his mother provided for the family through cleaning work and taking in laundry.\n\nJoe left school at 14 to work for a jobbing builder. From Manchester, the Pennine moors were no more than a bus-ride away: \u201cBy my 12th birthday, I knew that going into the country was more satisfying to me than anything else,\u201d he wrote. At first it was just playing around, then it gravitated to mine exploration in the abandoned copper workings at Alderley Edge and pot-holing in the White Peak. Inevitably, the progression was to climbing. For Brown this began among the arctic conditions of early 1947 in hobnailed boots at Kinder Downfall, above Hayfield, Derbyshire.\n\nThe rapidity with which Brown became perhaps the most significant figure in British climbing history was astounding. Within weeks this short, slight 16-year-old had begun to lead mountain rock-climbs at the highest contemporary standard. His native talent needed an educated and organisational ability to lead it on to fame and achievement. He found it through a chance meeting at Kinder Downfall in the spring of 1947 with Merrick \u201cSlim\u201d Sorrell.\n\nSorrell, three years older than Brown, was a pipe-fitter from Stockport whose solid and knowledgable company underpinned the first phase of Brown\u2019s pioneering on rock. That their ability was notably higher than the prevailing standards of the day was established on a visit to North Wales. They had viewed the climb known as Lot\u2019s Groove on the cliffs of Glyder Fach \u2013 alleged to be one of the harder climbs in Wales \u2013 and accomplished it on sight.\n\nOn the same holiday Brown made an ascent of the Suicide Wall in Cwm Idwal \u2013 undoubtedly the hardest climb of its time in Britain. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it too bad,\u201d he told me many years later. By the summer of 1948, having mastered the most difficult of the existing climbs, he began turning out his own repertoire. Initially these climbs were on Derbyshire and Yorkshire gritstone edges \u2013 brutally steep outcrops of abrasive rock in the ascent of which Brown displayed a suavely rhythmical and relaxed genius.\n\nHis ability was now bolstered by being right at the centre of a group of climbers from the Manchester and Derby areas, the Valkyrie Club. On crags such as Stanage and Froggatt Edges, Wimberry Rocks and Dovestones, the routes that marked British rock-climbing\u2019s postwar revolution and were to bring it in line with prewar continental standards were forged.\n\nLong-standing problems feared and revered by the sport\u2019s elders were vanquished beneath the insouciant plimsolls of a ragged and humorous 17-year-old youth. As a young climber myself in Manchester at the start of the 60s, I was intensely aware of his presence and how much he had achieved by then.\n\nI could understand how the other greats of the period climbed: fitness, physique, supple gymnasticism or sheer application. With Brown, there was something else at work. He was quite short, not heavily built, his movement smooth and deliberate.\n\nWhen I climbed with him, sometimes I would watch the way he made a move, copy it when I came to that point, and his way, that he had seen instantly, would be the least obvious and most immediately right. He was climbing\u2019s supreme craftsman, unerringly aware of the medium. That instinctual rock-sense never entirely left him.\n\nAnd with him, too, came a character generous, playful and straightforward. His mind may not have been academically trained, but he was sharp, informed, argumentative, and I think very wise. He loved the contest, be it physical or intellectual; he loved to wrestle.\n\nOnce, after a first ascent on the Pembrokeshire sea cliffs with a lot of crumbling rock, I followed him and found him sitting on the cliff edge. He pulled me to the ground and boxed me about the ears for risking his life and limb, scolding me for what he called the loosest route he had ever done. But he was laughing, and we ran back in perfect humour across the unmarked beach.\n\nHe needed the simplicity of that conflict and he was still generous and endearingly funny as he endured with dignity the ill-health of his final years.\n\nHe is survived by Valerie, their two daughters, Helen and Zoe, and four grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/tributes-joe-brown-pioneering-climber-died-aged-89", "page_content": "Tributes have been paid to Joe Brown, the British climber regarded as an outstanding pioneer, who has died aged 89.\n\nThe mountaineer, whose extraordinary skill and dexterity earned him nicknames such as \u201cthe Master\u201d and the \u201chuman fly\u201d, died peacefully at home in Llanberis, Wales, having been ill for some time.\n\nMost active in the 1950s and 60s, Brown established a number of new routes in Snowdonia and the Peak District, which were at the leading edge of the hard grades.\n\nIn 1955, aged 24, he and fellow climber George Band made history after scaling Kanchenjunga\u2019s south-west face, one of the Himalayas\u2019 most difficult peaks, and the third highest mountain in the world. In 1956, he made the first ascent of the west summit of the Muztagh Tower in the Karakoram mountain range.\n\nBorn in Manchester, he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, and together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, was among a new breed of post-war climbers from working-class backgrounds.\n\nHe was well known for his televised rock climbs in the 1960s, including scaling the Old Man of Hoy, a Scottish sea stack, in 1967 with Ian McNaught-Davis and Chris Bonington.\n\nBrown moved to Llanberis, where he opened a climbing shop in 1966, which became one of three.

Brown\u2019s name in a major league box score. But in his way, he is as much a part of baseball lore as the Gas House Gang, the Whiz Kids, and the House That Ruth Built.\n\nJoe E. Brown was a movie star: a wide-mouthed co\u00ad median whose face was his fortune. The zenith of his popularity came in the 1930s, when he appeared in a se\u00adries of hit comedies produced by Warner Bros. Three of them-Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933), and Alibi Ike (1935)-featured Joe E. as comical baseball players. Moreover, Brown was around the game all his life. He played baseball. He loved baseball. And he was a vigorous proponent of the game.\n\nJoseph Evan Brown was born on July 28, 1892, in Holgate, a small town in northwestern Ohio. His parents were warm and loving but desperately poor, and young Joe E. was determined to abandon his roots and embrace a life of adventure. \u201cI remember when I was a little guy going to school, stopping to look at a big 24-inch sheet announcing the arrival of the circus,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cAnother boy was with me. I pointed to the aerial act and said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u2019 I remember it clearly. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u201d\u2018\n\nAnd so, at the age of nine, Joe E. lived out what for other youngsters would be a storybook fantasy as he left home to join the circus. He became the junior member of The Five Marvelous Ashtons, an acrobatic act that toured the country performing under big tops and in vaudeville theaters. He earned $1.50 a week for the honor of being tossed through the air, and often being bloodied. As he grew into adolescence, Brown developed into a solidly proficient acrobat. While playing a date in San Francisco, he experienced firsthand the 1906 earthquake. It was around this time that he linked up with acrobats Tommy Bell and Frank Prevost and became the junior member of the Bell-Prevost Trio, a vaudeville act.\n\nDuring this period Brown managed to play baseball whenever he could. He wrote in his autobiography, Laughter Is a Wonderful Thing, that his passion for the game \u201cpredates my first days at school, of that I\u2019 m sure, so it probably began when I learned to walk.\u201d In his youth, he explained, he\n\nbegan haunting the knotholes around big league ball parks when 1 wasn\u2019t on stage or practicing. And in the spring, after a season of sore ankles, skinned wrists, and broken legs, baseball as a career held more than a casual interest for me.\n\nIn 1908, Brown decided that he would seek summer employment as a ballplayer. Tim Flood, manager of the St. Paul Saints in the American Association, signed him as a second sacker, but his season ended abruptly when he broke his leg while sliding into third base. During the next few summers he played for various semipro teams in the Toledo, OH, area, including the Crowley All-Stars, Young Avondales, and Needham\u2019s All-Stars. One of the many baseball-related photos printed in his autobiography features a serious-looking Brown, with arms folded, garbed in a Crowley All-Stars uniform and posing with a dozen teammates.\n\nIn 1911, when he was 19, Brown was offered a Boston Red Sox contract. At the time, he also had a lucrative offer to appear in a burlesque show. He already had spent a decade in show business, and realized that his best chance for long-term success was on the stage. So burlesque won out over baseball.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1915, Brown wed Kathryn Frances McGraw. The couple eventually became the parents of two sons and two adopted daughters. As Joe E. now had a family to support, his career choice was appropriate given his now-steady employment on the stage. By this time, he had morphed from acrobat to comic actor. On occasion, he even incorporated baseball into his stage act. The New York Times described one such routine, in which \u201ca young pitcher [is] harried by batters, umpires and base runners.\u201d Brown often quipped that he\n\nonce had a major league job. The manager wanted me to play third base. He said that ifT couldn\u2019t reach the ball with my hands, I would open my mouth and catch it between my teeth. I tried it once and darn near swallowed the ball.\n\nHis Great White Way debut came in Jim Jam Jems (1920), and he spent the decade as a headliner appearing on Broadway and touring in stage shows. But he was not through playing baseball. In 1920, Brown worked out and appeared in exhibition games with the Red Sox.\n\nThroughout his career, newspaper or magazine pro\u00ad files of Brown invariably cited his love of baseball-and his talent for playing the game. As far back as March 1921, the Boston Globe reported that Brown \u201chas recently received an offer from the New York Americans to play with the team this year.\u201d The actor added,\n\nAt one time I played [semipro ball in Toledo], but an accident to my arm made it necessary for me to give it up. Since then I have received many offers to go back into baseball but it would be rather foolish alter I had started a successful career on the stage.\n\nWhile a fine athlete \u2014 his athleticism is ever apparent in his baseball films, as he tosses balls and belts line drives without the aid of special effects or body dou\u00adbles \u2014 it is debatable whether Brown possessed the talent to sustain a major league career. During a moment of candor in a 1937 interview, he even admitted, \u201c[There] are a lot of stories about my baseball playing, but most of my big-league experiences happened in the imagina\u00adtion of various writers.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s celebrity status, however, did allow him to maintain his insider access to major leaguers. On April 18, 1922, the Boston Globe reported, \u201cThe Red Sox and Yankees occupied boxes last night at \u2018Greenwich Village Follies\u2019 at the Shubert Theatre as guests of Joe E. Brown, the principal comedian in the show.\u201d The item concluded by noting that Brown \u201cwas formerly a profes\u00adsional baseball player.\u201d\n\nBy this time Brown\u2019s calling card was his face rather than his physical aptitude. A Boston Globe profile of the comic began: \u2018\u201dDid you ever see anything so funny as that man\u2019s expression,\u2019 exclaimed a woman in the audi\u00adence at the Wilbur Theatre\u2026 as she gazed upward at Joe E. Brown, comedian of\u2019 Jim Jam Jems.\u201d\u2018 The article continued, \u201cHe has a comic style particularly his own, and not the least part of his success is the expression of his countenance. He doesn\u2019t have to say a word to get a laugh.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the nature of Brown\u2019s comedy primarily was physical-and it was a wonder that he did not become a silent cinema comedian. His screen debut did not come until the dawn of the sound era, in Crooks Can\u2019t Win (1928), an inauspicious melodrama. He quickly established himself, however, upon signing a Warner Bros. contract and appearing in a series of come\u00ad dies in which he alternately played two character types, both of whom were rubes. One was self-centered, with a mouth that was figuratively and literally big. The other was more shy and naive.\n\nBrown\u2019s three baseball films were especially popular. The first was Fireman, Save My Child, in which he starred as \u201cSmokey\u201d Joe Grant, an absentminded, Rube Waddell\u00ad like small-town firefighter whose pitching prowess earns him a spot with the St. Louis Cardinals. Just as he was starting his screen career, Brown had been cast in the road production of Elmer the Great, Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan\u2019s stage comedy about a none-too\u00ad bright hurler (originally played by Walter Huston) which opened on Broadway in 1928. Jack Oakie starred in the first screen version, titled Fast Company (1929). Brown was tapped for the remake, in which his character, Elmer Kane, is a small-town rube/home run hitter who plays for the Chicago Cubs and falls for a flighty actress. Finally, in Alibi Ike, Brown played Frank X. Farrell, a fireballing Cubs rookie right hander who is as brash and overconfident as he is talented.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. decided to sign him to a contract, Brown asked the studio to provide him with his own baseball team. It was written into his contract that Warner Bros. would pay for the team\u2019s uniforms, equip\u00adment, and travel expenses. The ball club was named Joe E. Brown\u2019s First National All-Stars; it consisted of studio employees and former professional players, and was pitted against all-star, semipro, college, and Negro League nines up and down the Pacific Coast. Decades later, Brown described the contract as a \u201cpip.\u201d\n\nAs he settled into his Hollywood lifestyle, the come\u00addian was at the epicenter of Southern California baseball. In February 1932, he and Buster Keaton-another screen star whose love for baseball was legendary-were involved in an all-star fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Olympic games. Over 8,500 fans packed Wrigley Field to see the Joe E. Browns defeat the Buster Keatons, 10-3. Rogers Hornsby, Gabby Hartnett, Paul and Lloyd Waner, Sam Crawford, Billy Jurges, Stan Hack, Tris Speaker, Dave Bancroft, Carl Hubbell, Charlie Root, Pat Malone, Johnny Moore, and Pie Traynor were a few of the big leaguers who participated.\n\nBrown also was instrumental in getting his baseball pals parts in movies. Frank Shellenback had a supporting role in Fireman, Save My Child; Shellenback and a roster full of ballplayers (Herman \u201cHi\u201d Bell, Guy Cantrell, Dick Cox, Cedric Durst, Ray French, Mike Gazella, Wally Hebert, Wally Hood, Don Hurst, Smead Jolley, Lou Koupal, Wes Kingdon, Jim Levey, Bob Meusel, Wally Rehg, Jim Thorpe, and Ed Wells) appear as big leaguers in Alibi Ike.\n\nIn 1934, a Los Angeles Times reporter asked Brown, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really ask Dizzy and Daffy Dean to accept a picture contract, did you?\u201d His response:\n\nWhy not? They\u2019re fine boys, interesting, natural, lovely characters. When I was sitting next to Dizzy in Detroit [during the World Series], with the fans swarming around him for autographs, he whispered, \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? Five years ago I didn\u2019t even own a pair of shoes.\u201d They\u2019re not swell-headed. Besides, Warners wired me to ask them\u2026\n\nThe Dean boys soon were starring in Dizzy and Daffy (1934), a Warner Bros. two-reel comedy short in which Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges fame) remarks, \u201cThe only Dean I ever heard of is Gunga.\u201d\n\nBrown also reportedly-and inadvertently-played a more direct role in the \u201934 series. According to the Los Angeles Times, Detroit hurler Schoolboy Rowe \u201ccaught part of his pitching hand in a door jamb\u2026and subse\u00adquently had the bruise aggravated by a hearty good-luck hand-shake from Joe E. Brown, the film comedian.\u201d\n\nFrom 1932 through 1935, Brown was a part owner of the American Association Kansas City Blues. In 1935, the rumor circulated that he was considering purchasing the Boston Braves, but this came to naught. Brown organized a semi pro basketball team whose roster was stocked with ex-UCLA Bruins. He owned racehorses, and often could be found at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and other Southern California racetracks. His Beverly Hills home housed a trophy room for his rapidly growing collection of autographed baseballs, bats, caps, and other sports memorabilia. He accumulated hundreds of items, from lumber used by Babe Ruth and Nap Lajoie and a cap worn by Eddie Collins to a baseball autographed by England\u2019s King George V, a football jersey worn by Red Grange, Gene Tunney\u2019s and James J. Braddock\u2019s boxing trunks, and a first-edition copy of Henry Chadwick\u2019s 1868 book, The Game ofBase Ball, the initial hardcover baseball tome. Alas, most of the memorabilia was destroyed later in a house fire.\n\nDecades later, Brown recalled that upon learning that Lou Gehrig was about to retire, he wrote the Iron Horse to request the ballplayer\u2019s first baseman\u2019s glove for his collection. \u201cLou wrote back, asking me to name anything but that, and I understood but I felt bad about having asked,\u201d he explained.\n\nNot long afterward, he retired. In the fall of that year [ 1939] I went to New York to see the Yankees play in the World Series. Just before gametime a batboy came up to me and asked me to come to the Yankees\u2019 bench. Well-Lou was waiting there. He was very ill, by then, so thin and gaunt that I was startled at his appearance. But he smiled and held something out to me \u2014 it was his first baseman\u2019s glove. \u201cHere it is, pal,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Brown\u2019s popularity was waning. He left Warner Bros., appeared in some independent movies, and concluded his starring career in a series of low\u00ad budget Columbia Pictures comedies released in the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nBut Brown did not fade from the public eye. During World War II, he proved that his heart was as big as his mouth as he became one of the first Hollywood celebri\u00adties to volunteer to entertain the troops. Brown trekked to combat zones from North Africa to Italy, the Pacific is\u00ad lands to Australia and New Zealand, bringing laughter to the Gls. He once estimated that he had traveled over 200,000 air miles during the war. Ever the jokester, he quipped, \u201cWhen I opened my mouth in the South Pacific, 8,000 mosquitoes flew in.\u201d Even though he was a civil\u00adian, Brown reportedly was allowed to pack a carbine and ride in a tank while on Luzon, the Philippine island.\n\nFor his tirelessness in entertaining the troops, Brown was given a Bronze Star as well as a special citation, voted by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, for his \u201cmeritorious service.\u201d However, he and Kathryn person\u00ad ally felt the brunt of the war. Their eldest son, Don Evan Brown, a captain in the Army Air Corps, died at age 25 in October 1942, when his plane crashed near Palm Springs during a training exercise.\n\nIn 1945, as the war wound down, Brown signed to tour as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey, Mary Chase\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy. He opened in Chicago and eventually appeared in the play well over 1,000 times on stages from Broadway to Australia. He also returned to the screen, and gave a highly regarded dramatic per\u00adformance as a small-town minister in The Tender Years (1947). He was ideally cast as Cap\u2019n Andy in the second remake of Show Boat ( 1951), and gave what easily is his best-remembered performance as a loony millionaire in Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot ( 1959). Here, as he slyly winks at the camera, Brown ardently romances Jack Lemmon\u2019s jazz musician-in-drag. His closing line\u00ad \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect\u201d-is one of the more famous in film history.\n\nBaseball, of course, remained an intrinsic part of his life. \u201cWhenever he doesn\u2019t have a matinee, he\u2019s at some sports event,\u201d noted sports columnist Braven Dyer in 1946, while Brown was performing Harvey in Chicago. From 1953 to 1964, he served as first president of the PONY League, comprising teams made up of 13- and 14-year-olds. Long a supporter of the UCLA Bruins baseball team, the school\u2019s Westwood ballyard was named \u201cJoe E. Brown Field.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1953 season, Brown conducted pre- and post-game interviews for the New York Yankees and did five innings of play-by-play-three on television, and two on the radio. Radio-television critic Warren Bennett wrote that Brown was \u201cas relaxed before the cameras as an old shoe. Shy, diffident ball players loosen up for him as they never did for his predecessor, the illustrious Joe DiMaggio.\u201d Brown told Bennett, \u201cWhat I want to do is talk to the baseball fan who loves the game so much he stands in line to get a good seat.\u201d\n\nIn l955, his 37-year-old son, Joe L. Brown, replaced Branch Rickey as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. But Joe E. remained firmly rooted in Southern California-and as the Dodgers abandoned Brooklyn for Los Angeles, he was well-suited to become a high-profile promoter of West Coast baseball. In October 1957, not long after the team played its final game at Ebbets Field, Brown was the master of ceremonies of a star-studded luncheon at Los Angeles\u2019 Statler Hotel, held in honor of the team.\n\nBrown was among the leaders in the battle for the \u201cYes\u201d vote that would approve the Dodgers\u2019 contract with the city of Los Angeles, and result in the construc\u00adtion of Dodger Stadium. He became general chairman of the Taxpayers Committee on Yes for Baseball, and pre\u00addicted that the Dodgers would lure baseball fans from far across the region-particularly if they competed in a spanking-new ballyard. The actor clearly was jockeying for support when he observed, near the start of the 1958 season, \u201cDodger President Walter O\u2019Malley hopes to admit 300,000 youngsters [free of charge] to Coliseum games this season, and will up the figure to 600,000 when the club builds its own stadium in Chavez Ravine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe boy whose idol is Duke Snider or Junior Gilliam can\u2019 t go very far wrong in his future life.\u201d\n\nJoe E. Brown quietly lived out the rest of his life. He died at age 81 on July 6, 1973, of pneumonia and heart failure. Kathryn, his wife of 58 years, survived him. Brown was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, which houses the remains of entertainment in\u00addustry legends from George Burns and Gracie Allen to Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, and Spencer Tracy.\n\nBrown\u2019s life may be summed up by the title of a classic Hollywood film, albeit one in which he did not appear: It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. \u201cThere\u2019s been tragedy, when we lost our boy,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cBut l\u2019ve had the chance given every other citizen in a free country of living my life as I wanted to live it and becoming what I wanted to become.\u201d\n\nROB EDELMAN most recently authored the box liner notes and an essay on early baseball films included on the DVD compilation Reel Baseball: Baseball Films from the Silent Era, 1899-1926.

So did an attitude adjustment, one that requires the sometimes reticent Hayes to be aggressive early in the count.\n\nIt's why Hayes was ready when he stepped to the plate in the seventh inning Friday night against St. Louis with two men on and the Pirates down by two. He peered at Cardinals reliever Giovanny Gallegos and hoped for a first-pitch breaking ball.\n\nWhen Gallegos obliged by throwing Hayes an 87 mph slider that stayed in the zone far too long, the Pittsburgh third baseman responded with one of the biggest hits of his still-young career, a towering three-shot shot to the left-field bleachers as the Pirates rallied for a 7-5 victory.\n\n\u201cMan, it was awesome,\" Hayes said. \u201cI\u2019m sure (teammate Andrew McCutchen) has probably given some even crazier moments (at PNC Park). But yeah, definitely, that was one of my bigger moments I\u2019ve had in my career.\u201d\n\nHayes finished with three hits while batting seventh for just the second time this season. Josh Palacio followed with his first major league homer as Pittsburgh won for the first time in 23 tries this season when trailing after six innings.\n\n\u201cWe kept grinding,\u201d Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. \"I think that\u2019s the one thing we\u2019ve seen about this team is regardless of what happens, they continue to play hard and they did and they got rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nCarlos Santana also had three hits for the Pirates, including a two-run double during a six-run seventh. McCutchen singled twice to boost his career hits total to 1,998.\n\nYohan Ramirez (1-0) earned the win after striking out Tommy Edman with the bases full in the top of the seventh. David Bednar worked around a two-out single in the ninth by Paul DeJong for his 11th save.\n\nNolan Arenado had three hits, including his 10th home run of the season, for St. Louis. Paul Goldschmidt added three hits and Brendan Donovan belted a two-run shot for the Cardinals during a five-run third, but St. Louis squandered several chances to pull away.\n\nThe Cardinals loaded the bases in the fifth, sixth and seventh innings, but failed to score each time. St. Louis left 12 men on in all.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of opportunities to break the game open, but couldn\u2019t come up with the big hit,\u201d Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said.\n\nPittsburgh took advantage in the seventh. Tucupita Marcano led off with a double and McCutchen and Jack Suwinski walked to load the bases with one out. Santana followed by lacing a ground-rule double to left to pull Pittsburgh within two.\n\nHayes stepped in against Gallegos (1-3) and didn't hesitate.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Hayes got (Gallegos),\u201d Marmol said.\n\nSt. Louis arrived in Pittsburgh surging after a 15-8 stretch to finish May that thrust them into the fringe of contention in the muddled NL Central. The Pirates remained in the mix too despite an 8-18 May that sapped much of the juice from their 20-8 start.\n\nSt. Louis has dominated Pittsburgh at PNC Park in recent years and it looked as though it would be more of the same after the Cardinals tagged 23-year-old Pirates starter Roansy Contreras for five runs in the third, all with two outs. Donovan's two-run blast made it 2-0 and Arenado pushed it to 5-0 three batters later.\n\nContreras lasted just four innings in his return to the rotation following a brief stint in the bullpen, allowing five runs and seven hits and six strikeouts.\n\nSt. Louis starter Jack Flaherty worked 5 1/3 innings, surrendering one run and six hits with a walk and six strikeouts, but the Cardinals' bullpen faltered as Pittsburgh started a season-high nine-game homestand with a bang.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nCardinals: Placed OF Lars Nootbaar on the 10-day injured list retroactive to May 29 with a lower-back contusion. ...

(AP Photo/Joe Puetz)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Wil Crowe gave up four runs over five innings for his first major league win, and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4 on Friday night for their fifth victory in seven games following a 10-game losing streak.\n\nJacob Stallings and Phillip Evans drove in two runs each for the Pirates.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple of chances to blow it open, didn\u2019t do that and even more importantly, the fact that that we had to continue to grind, we had runners on base, we had to make plays,\u201d Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. \u201cYeah, that was a hard-fought win.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis has lost five straight, seven of eight and 18 of 24, dropping a season-worst four games under .500 at 36-40. The Cardinals are fourth in the NL Central, seven games back of first-place Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of like scuffing at the same time, and that\u2019s tough,\u201d Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado said. \u201cUsually, you have some people keeping you afloat \u2026 right now it seems like we\u2019re all kind of scuffling at the same time.\u201d\n\nCrowe (1-4), was making his 13th big league start and 14th appearance. The 26-year-old right-hander debuted last Aug. 22.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was a monkey on my back,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cThe first one, to me, it\u2019s like it was the hardest one.\u201d\n\nHe allowed eight hits, struck out two and walked two. Crowe gave up solo homers to Arenado in the third and Dylan Carlson in the fourth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been games that he\u2019s thrown the ball probably better than this,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cThe fact that he continued to grind, it was extremely humid, you know, he did a nice job.\u201d\n\nClay Holmes and Chasen Shreve combined for two hitless innings, Kyle Crick gave up one hit in the eighth and Richard Rodr\u00edguez pitched a perfect ninth for his 10th save in 12 chances.\n\nStallings\u2019 single off Jake Woodford (1-1) broke a 4-4 tie in the fifth.\n\n\u201cWe made good plays tonight, got some timely hits and our bullpen came in, did what they do,\u201d Stallings said.\n\nStarter Kwang Hyun Kim needed 70 pitches to get through 4 1/3 innings. He allowed at least one runner in each of his four full innings and gave up four runs and seven hits.\n\nCrowe hit Kim in the chest in the second inning while Kim was attempting to bunt, which loaded the bases with one out, setting up Carlson\u2019s RBI grounder.\n\nPittsburgh went ahead 4-1 in the third. Ke\u2019Bryan Hayes had an RBI single, Stallings followed with a run-scoring grounder and Evans drove in two more as his sinking liner to right field popped out of a sliding Lars Nootbaar\u2019s glove for a single.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get really any opportunities to get pitches to drive, so our guys did a good job of just putting the ball in play and continued to grind out at-bats,\u201d Shelton said.\n\nArenado hit his 250th home run leading off the third, and Yadier Molina doubled, swiped third for his first stolen base since 2019 and scored on Nootbaar\u2019s single.\n\nCarlson\u2019s opposite-field homer to left tied the game 4-4 in the fourth, his seventh home run this season and first in Busch Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe had 12 men left on base,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe clearly would have liked to do some damage in that situation, you know, 1 for 9 (with runners in scoring position). That\u2019s not the consolation prize, but there were a lot of positive signs from the offense.\u201d\n\nMOVING UP\n\nMolina\u2019s double in the third was his 2,049th hit, moving past Johnny Bench for No. 8 among catchers.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nHayes has reached base safely in 29 straight games dating to Sept. 19, 2020, the longest current streak in the major leagues and the longest for the Pirates since Jason Bay\u2019s 29 in 2005.\n\nSLOW\n\nErik Gonz\u00e1lez was caught stealing for the final out of the second inning by Molina despite running on a 67.5 mph curveball from Kim. Gonz\u00e1lez was called safe by second base umpire Tripp Gibson, and the call was reversed in a video review.\n\nTRAINING ROOM\n\nCardinals: OF Harrison Bader (right rib fracture) began a rehab at Low-A Palm Beach.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Pirates send RHP JT Brubaker (4-6, 3.77 ERA) to the mound against RHP Adam Wainwright (5-5, 3.74 ERA) and the Cardinals in the third of a four-game series on Saturday. Brubaker has been charged with two or earned runs or fewer in nine of 13 starts. Wainwright struck out 11 in his second complete game this season, a doubleheader opener at Atlanta on Sunday.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap/_/gameId/401429993", "page_content": "ST.

He made a nonchalant throw to first that bounced on Molina\u2019s grounder, then sailed a high throw to first on Edmundo Sosa\u2019s grounder.\n\nBrubaker shifted to a windup with an 3-2 count on Nolan Gorman, and Molina took off for third. Brubaker stepped off and threw to second in a pickoff attempt, and after umpires conferred, second base umpire Dan Iassogna called a balk, prompting Pirates manager Derek Shelton to come onto the field to argue.\n\nGorman walked to load the bases. and Goldschmidt followed with a three-hopper up the middle. Gorman beat Castillo\u2019s backhand toss to second and kept on running to get into a rundown that allowed Molina to score.

Brown\u2019s name in a major league box score. But in his way, he is as much a part of baseball lore as the Gas House Gang, the Whiz Kids, and the House That Ruth Built.\n\nJoe E. Brown was a movie star: a wide-mouthed co\u00ad median whose face was his fortune. The zenith of his popularity came in the 1930s, when he appeared in a se\u00adries of hit comedies produced by Warner Bros. Three of them-Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933), and Alibi Ike (1935)-featured Joe E. as comical baseball players. Moreover, Brown was around the game all his life. He played baseball. He loved baseball. And he was a vigorous proponent of the game.\n\nJoseph Evan Brown was born on July 28, 1892, in Holgate, a small town in northwestern Ohio. His parents were warm and loving but desperately poor, and young Joe E. was determined to abandon his roots and embrace a life of adventure. \u201cI remember when I was a little guy going to school, stopping to look at a big 24-inch sheet announcing the arrival of the circus,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cAnother boy was with me. I pointed to the aerial act and said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u2019 I remember it clearly. I didn\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna be.\u201d\u2018\n\nAnd so, at the age of nine, Joe E. lived out what for other youngsters would be a storybook fantasy as he left home to join the circus. He became the junior member of The Five Marvelous Ashtons, an acrobatic act that toured the country performing under big tops and in vaudeville theaters. He earned $1.50 a week for the honor of being tossed through the air, and often being bloodied. As he grew into adolescence, Brown developed into a solidly proficient acrobat. While playing a date in San Francisco, he experienced firsthand the 1906 earthquake. It was around this time that he linked up with acrobats Tommy Bell and Frank Prevost and became the junior member of the Bell-Prevost Trio, a vaudeville act.\n\nDuring this period Brown managed to play baseball whenever he could. He wrote in his autobiography, Laughter Is a Wonderful Thing, that his passion for the game \u201cpredates my first days at school, of that I\u2019 m sure, so it probably began when I learned to walk.\u201d In his youth, he explained, he\n\nbegan haunting the knotholes around big league ball parks when 1 wasn\u2019t on stage or practicing. And in the spring, after a season of sore ankles, skinned wrists, and broken legs, baseball as a career held more than a casual interest for me.\n\nIn 1908, Brown decided that he would seek summer employment as a ballplayer. Tim Flood, manager of the St. Paul Saints in the American Association, signed him as a second sacker, but his season ended abruptly when he broke his leg while sliding into third base. During the next few summers he played for various semipro teams in the Toledo, OH, area, including the Crowley All-Stars, Young Avondales, and Needham\u2019s All-Stars. One of the many baseball-related photos printed in his autobiography features a serious-looking Brown, with arms folded, garbed in a Crowley All-Stars uniform and posing with a dozen teammates.\n\nIn 1911, when he was 19, Brown was offered a Boston Red Sox contract. At the time, he also had a lucrative offer to appear in a burlesque show. He already had spent a decade in show business, and realized that his best chance for long-term success was on the stage. So burlesque won out over baseball.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1915, Brown wed Kathryn Frances McGraw. The couple eventually became the parents of two sons and two adopted daughters. As Joe E. now had a family to support, his career choice was appropriate given his now-steady employment on the stage. By this time, he had morphed from acrobat to comic actor. On occasion, he even incorporated baseball into his stage act. The New York Times described one such routine, in which \u201ca young pitcher [is] harried by batters, umpires and base runners.\u201d Brown often quipped that he\n\nonce had a major league job. The manager wanted me to play third base. He said that ifT couldn\u2019t reach the ball with my hands, I would open my mouth and catch it between my teeth. I tried it once and darn near swallowed the ball.\n\nHis Great White Way debut came in Jim Jam Jems (1920), and he spent the decade as a headliner appearing on Broadway and touring in stage shows. But he was not through playing baseball. In 1920, Brown worked out and appeared in exhibition games with the Red Sox.\n\nThroughout his career, newspaper or magazine pro\u00ad files of Brown invariably cited his love of baseball-and his talent for playing the game. As far back as March 1921, the Boston Globe reported that Brown \u201chas recently received an offer from the New York Americans to play with the team this year.\u201d The actor added,\n\nAt one time I played [semipro ball in Toledo], but an accident to my arm made it necessary for me to give it up. Since then I have received many offers to go back into baseball but it would be rather foolish alter I had started a successful career on the stage.\n\nWhile a fine athlete \u2014 his athleticism is ever apparent in his baseball films, as he tosses balls and belts line drives without the aid of special effects or body dou\u00adbles \u2014 it is debatable whether Brown possessed the talent to sustain a major league career. During a moment of candor in a 1937 interview, he even admitted, \u201c[There] are a lot of stories about my baseball playing, but most of my big-league experiences happened in the imagina\u00adtion of various writers.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s celebrity status, however, did allow him to maintain his insider access to major leaguers. On April 18, 1922, the Boston Globe reported, \u201cThe Red Sox and Yankees occupied boxes last night at \u2018Greenwich Village Follies\u2019 at the Shubert Theatre as guests of Joe E. Brown, the principal comedian in the show.\u201d The item concluded by noting that Brown \u201cwas formerly a profes\u00adsional baseball player.\u201d\n\nBy this time Brown\u2019s calling card was his face rather than his physical aptitude. A Boston Globe profile of the comic began: \u2018\u201dDid you ever see anything so funny as that man\u2019s expression,\u2019 exclaimed a woman in the audi\u00adence at the Wilbur Theatre\u2026 as she gazed upward at Joe E. Brown, comedian of\u2019 Jim Jam Jems.\u201d\u2018 The article continued, \u201cHe has a comic style particularly his own, and not the least part of his success is the expression of his countenance. He doesn\u2019t have to say a word to get a laugh.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the nature of Brown\u2019s comedy primarily was physical-and it was a wonder that he did not become a silent cinema comedian. His screen debut did not come until the dawn of the sound era, in Crooks Can\u2019t Win (1928), an inauspicious melodrama. He quickly established himself, however, upon signing a Warner Bros. contract and appearing in a series of come\u00ad dies in which he alternately played two character types, both of whom were rubes. One was self-centered, with a mouth that was figuratively and literally big. The other was more shy and naive.\n\nBrown\u2019s three baseball films were especially popular. The first was Fireman, Save My Child, in which he starred as \u201cSmokey\u201d Joe Grant, an absentminded, Rube Waddell\u00ad like small-town firefighter whose pitching prowess earns him a spot with the St. Louis Cardinals. Just as he was starting his screen career, Brown had been cast in the road production of Elmer the Great, Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan\u2019s stage comedy about a none-too\u00ad bright hurler (originally played by Walter Huston) which opened on Broadway in 1928. Jack Oakie starred in the first screen version, titled Fast Company (1929). Brown was tapped for the remake, in which his character, Elmer Kane, is a small-town rube/home run hitter who plays for the Chicago Cubs and falls for a flighty actress. Finally, in Alibi Ike, Brown played Frank X. Farrell, a fireballing Cubs rookie right hander who is as brash and overconfident as he is talented.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. decided to sign him to a contract, Brown asked the studio to provide him with his own baseball team. It was written into his contract that Warner Bros. would pay for the team\u2019s uniforms, equip\u00adment, and travel expenses. The ball club was named Joe E. Brown\u2019s First National All-Stars; it consisted of studio employees and former professional players, and was pitted against all-star, semipro, college, and Negro League nines up and down the Pacific Coast. Decades later, Brown described the contract as a \u201cpip.\u201d\n\nAs he settled into his Hollywood lifestyle, the come\u00addian was at the epicenter of Southern California baseball. In February 1932, he and Buster Keaton-another screen star whose love for baseball was legendary-were involved in an all-star fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Olympic games. Over 8,500 fans packed Wrigley Field to see the Joe E. Browns defeat the Buster Keatons, 10-3. Rogers Hornsby, Gabby Hartnett, Paul and Lloyd Waner, Sam Crawford, Billy Jurges, Stan Hack, Tris Speaker, Dave Bancroft, Carl Hubbell, Charlie Root, Pat Malone, Johnny Moore, and Pie Traynor were a few of the big leaguers who participated.\n\nBrown also was instrumental in getting his baseball pals parts in movies. Frank Shellenback had a supporting role in Fireman, Save My Child; Shellenback and a roster full of ballplayers (Herman \u201cHi\u201d Bell, Guy Cantrell, Dick Cox, Cedric Durst, Ray French, Mike Gazella, Wally Hebert, Wally Hood, Don Hurst, Smead Jolley, Lou Koupal, Wes Kingdon, Jim Levey, Bob Meusel, Wally Rehg, Jim Thorpe, and Ed Wells) appear as big leaguers in Alibi Ike.\n\nIn 1934, a Los Angeles Times reporter asked Brown, \u201cYou didn\u2019t really ask Dizzy and Daffy Dean to accept a picture contract, did you?\u201d His response:\n\nWhy not? They\u2019re fine boys, interesting, natural, lovely characters. When I was sitting next to Dizzy in Detroit [during the World Series], with the fans swarming around him for autographs, he whispered, \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? Five years ago I didn\u2019t even own a pair of shoes.\u201d They\u2019re not swell-headed. Besides, Warners wired me to ask them\u2026\n\nThe Dean boys soon were starring in Dizzy and Daffy (1934), a Warner Bros. two-reel comedy short in which Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges fame) remarks, \u201cThe only Dean I ever heard of is Gunga.\u201d\n\nBrown also reportedly-and inadvertently-played a more direct role in the \u201934 series. According to the Los Angeles Times, Detroit hurler Schoolboy Rowe \u201ccaught part of his pitching hand in a door jamb\u2026and subse\u00adquently had the bruise aggravated by a hearty good-luck hand-shake from Joe E. Brown, the film comedian.\u201d\n\nFrom 1932 through 1935, Brown was a part owner of the American Association Kansas City Blues. In 1935, the rumor circulated that he was considering purchasing the Boston Braves, but this came to naught. Brown organized a semi pro basketball team whose roster was stocked with ex-UCLA Bruins. He owned racehorses, and often could be found at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and other Southern California racetracks. His Beverly Hills home housed a trophy room for his rapidly growing collection of autographed baseballs, bats, caps, and other sports memorabilia. He accumulated hundreds of items, from lumber used by Babe Ruth and Nap Lajoie and a cap worn by Eddie Collins to a baseball autographed by England\u2019s King George V, a football jersey worn by Red Grange, Gene Tunney\u2019s and James J. Braddock\u2019s boxing trunks, and a first-edition copy of Henry Chadwick\u2019s 1868 book, The Game ofBase Ball, the initial hardcover baseball tome. Alas, most of the memorabilia was destroyed later in a house fire.\n\nDecades later, Brown recalled that upon learning that Lou Gehrig was about to retire, he wrote the Iron Horse to request the ballplayer\u2019s first baseman\u2019s glove for his collection. \u201cLou wrote back, asking me to name anything but that, and I understood but I felt bad about having asked,\u201d he explained.\n\nNot long afterward, he retired. In the fall of that year [ 1939] I went to New York to see the Yankees play in the World Series. Just before gametime a batboy came up to me and asked me to come to the Yankees\u2019 bench. Well-Lou was waiting there. He was very ill, by then, so thin and gaunt that I was startled at his appearance. But he smiled and held something out to me \u2014 it was his first baseman\u2019s glove. \u201cHere it is, pal,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Brown\u2019s popularity was waning. He left Warner Bros., appeared in some independent movies, and concluded his starring career in a series of low\u00ad budget Columbia Pictures comedies released in the late 1930s and early 1940s.\n\nBut Brown did not fade from the public eye. During World War II, he proved that his heart was as big as his mouth as he became one of the first Hollywood celebri\u00adties to volunteer to entertain the troops. Brown trekked to combat zones from North Africa to Italy, the Pacific is\u00ad lands to Australia and New Zealand, bringing laughter to the Gls. He once estimated that he had traveled over 200,000 air miles during the war. Ever the jokester, he quipped, \u201cWhen I opened my mouth in the South Pacific, 8,000 mosquitoes flew in.\u201d Even though he was a civil\u00adian, Brown reportedly was allowed to pack a carbine and ride in a tank while on Luzon, the Philippine island.\n\nFor his tirelessness in entertaining the troops, Brown was given a Bronze Star as well as a special citation, voted by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, for his \u201cmeritorious service.\u201d However, he and Kathryn person\u00ad ally felt the brunt of the war. Their eldest son, Don Evan Brown, a captain in the Army Air Corps, died at age 25 in October 1942, when his plane crashed near Palm Springs during a training exercise.\n\nIn 1945, as the war wound down, Brown signed to tour as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey, Mary Chase\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy. He opened in Chicago and eventually appeared in the play well over 1,000 times on stages from Broadway to Australia. He also returned to the screen, and gave a highly regarded dramatic per\u00adformance as a small-town minister in The Tender Years (1947). He was ideally cast as Cap\u2019n Andy in the second remake of Show Boat ( 1951), and gave what easily is his best-remembered performance as a loony millionaire in Billy Wilder\u2019s Some Like It Hot ( 1959). Here, as he slyly winks at the camera, Brown ardently romances Jack Lemmon\u2019s jazz musician-in-drag. His closing line\u00ad \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect\u201d-is one of the more famous in film history.\n\nBaseball, of course, remained an intrinsic part of his life. \u201cWhenever he doesn\u2019t have a matinee, he\u2019s at some sports event,\u201d noted sports columnist Braven Dyer in 1946, while Brown was performing Harvey in Chicago. From 1953 to 1964, he served as first president of the PONY League, comprising teams made up of 13- and 14-year-olds. Long a supporter of the UCLA Bruins baseball team, the school\u2019s Westwood ballyard was named \u201cJoe E. Brown Field.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1953 season, Brown conducted pre- and post-game interviews for the New York Yankees and did five innings of play-by-play-three on television, and two on the radio. Radio-television critic Warren Bennett wrote that Brown was \u201cas relaxed before the cameras as an old shoe. Shy, diffident ball players loosen up for him as they never did for his predecessor, the illustrious Joe DiMaggio.\u201d Brown told Bennett, \u201cWhat I want to do is talk to the baseball fan who loves the game so much he stands in line to get a good seat.\u201d\n\nIn l955, his 37-year-old son, Joe L. Brown, replaced Branch Rickey as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. But Joe E. remained firmly rooted in Southern California-and as the Dodgers abandoned Brooklyn for Los Angeles, he was well-suited to become a high-profile promoter of West Coast baseball. In October 1957, not long after the team played its final game at Ebbets Field, Brown was the master of ceremonies of a star-studded luncheon at Los Angeles\u2019 Statler Hotel, held in honor of the team.\n\nBrown was among the leaders in the battle for the \u201cYes\u201d vote that would approve the Dodgers\u2019 contract with the city of Los Angeles, and result in the construc\u00adtion of Dodger Stadium. He became general chairman of the Taxpayers Committee on Yes for Baseball, and pre\u00addicted that the Dodgers would lure baseball fans from far across the region-particularly if they competed in a spanking-new ballyard. The actor clearly was jockeying for support when he observed, near the start of the 1958 season, \u201cDodger President Walter O\u2019Malley hopes to admit 300,000 youngsters [free of charge] to Coliseum games this season, and will up the figure to 600,000 when the club builds its own stadium in Chavez Ravine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe boy whose idol is Duke Snider or Junior Gilliam can\u2019 t go very far wrong in his future life.\u201d\n\nJoe E. Brown quietly lived out the rest of his life. He died at age 81 on July 6, 1973, of pneumonia and heart failure. Kathryn, his wife of 58 years, survived him. Brown was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, which houses the remains of entertainment in\u00addustry legends from George Burns and Gracie Allen to Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, and Spencer Tracy.\n\nBrown\u2019s life may be summed up by the title of a classic Hollywood film, albeit one in which he did not appear: It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. \u201cThere\u2019s been tragedy, when we lost our boy,\u201d he recalled in 1963. \u201cBut l\u2019ve had the chance given every other citizen in a free country of living my life as I wanted to live it and becoming what I wanted to become.\u201d\n\nROB EDELMAN most recently authored the box liner notes and an essay on early baseball films included on the DVD compilation Reel Baseball: Baseball Films from the Silent Era, 1899-1926. He also is an interviewee on several doc\u00adumentaries included on the DVD re-release of The Natural.\n\nSources\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nBronner, Edwin J.
