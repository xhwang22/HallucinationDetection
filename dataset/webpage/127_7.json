All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/martina-sorbara", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMartina Sorbara was born on 13 November, 1978 in Toronto, Canada, is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

It peaked at #112 in the UK Singles chart."}, {"url": "https://sweetslyrics.com/martina-sorbara/biography", "page_content": "When you pick up Martina Sorbara's April 9th release, 'The Cure For Bad Deeds', and you hear the elements of jazz, folk, pop and rock on the album, you really shouldn't be too surprised by the musical variety heard there. After all, we're talking about a multi-talented artist who takes the time to make her own guitars and her own clothes, as well as her own music, which is her primary focus.\n\nMartina has very quickly gained the attention and admiration of many involved in the Canadian music industry. The 'Cure...,' produced by Jian Ghomeshi (of the successful Toronto group, Moxy Fruvous), is a fresh musical adventure ranging from the dark and beat-driven 'Bonnie & Clyde II' to the effervescent pop of 'Claudia' to the touching folk ballad of 'Cherry Rd.'.\n\nAs Martina's popularity continues to grow while performing regular dates in Canada and the United States, her album is one of those musical gems you want to treat like a secret. It's so good that part of you wants to keep it to yourself, and part of you wants to tell the world.\n\nMost artists aspire to have talents that make them special--a quality about them that forces an audience to take notice. And some artists are special without ever trying to be. Martina Sorbara is such an artist. When one first catches a glimpse of Martina singing on stage it is only the beginning of the connection between the artist and the fan. Aside from her natural, intense beauty and effervescent personality, her voice is angelic with an amazing range, and her passion obvious and proud. Her wise and poetic lyrics are enveloped in an expressive and original style.\n\nAlthough some would find it difficult to categorize the young Torontonian's music, Martina is becoming more comfortable calling it pop. \"It took me a while to accept that I write pop music. That's what it is though. Well, maybe jazzy-rocky folk-pop,\" she states with a smile.\n\nPerforming on stage with only the accompaniment of a drummer, Martina plays both piano and guitar, switching from one instrument to the next throughout her set.\n\nAfter her vocals, the piano is her primary instrument. She is a self-taught guitarist with a captivating and highly original style. Her interest in the guitar began at age 11. At 15 she began writing her own music and performing it for others. She has already played at numerous festivals, including SXSW in Austin, Texas, The Edmonton Folk Festival, and has opened for such acts as Sarah Harmer, The Be Good Tanyas, Hawksley Workman and Bill Bragg.\n\nAs a songwriter, she says, \"I feel very satisfied with myself, and my songs, when a listener tells me they understand exactly what I mean. Ideally, I want people to just enjoy the melody and relate to my sentiments.\"\n\nOne of the many outstanding talents that Martina possesses, and that she remains very modest about, is the construction of her own guitars. \"Building my own guitars has given me an intimate relationship with my instrument. I don't know if it sounds better than other guitars, but I sure love it more than other guitars.\" She also enjoys spending her time sketching and focusing on visual art. \"I consider art as important to me as my music.\"\n\nMartina's music appeals to all ages and genders. Perhaps the fact that Martina is influenced by a wide range of artists, from Sarah Vaughan to John Prine to Cyndi Lauper, explains the diverse array of listeners. Her hero, in musical terms, is Tom Waits. \"Tom Waits has been on the top of my 'hero-list' for a long time as a result of his unparalleled individualism.\"\n\nMartina's passion for life is evident and infectious. The songs on \"The Cure For Bad Deeds\" clearly illustrate that passion.\n\nSource: http://www.martinasorbara.com/martina.html"}, {"url": "https://nowtoronto.com/news/martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "MARTINA SORBARA with SID SIX at Ted\u2019s Wrecking Yard (549 College), Monday (December 18), $7. 928-5012. Rating: NNNNN\n\nmartina sorbara\u2019s wildly colour-ful, whimsically decorated loft in downtown Toronto is a bit like Pee- wee\u2019s Playhouse. There\u2019s the orange drum kit and two pianos. There are two guitars crafted from scratch by Sorbara herself, each bearing intricate designs matching tattoos on her neck and right hip.\n\nAdd a vintage mint-green Singer her grandma gave her, her sketches, photography and clothing \u00ad\u2013 yes, also created by Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 and you get the sense that this is an artist with uncommon range.\n\nBut at the moment, it\u2019s the rainy-day pop on her charmingly understated second disc, The Cure For Bad Deeds, that\u2019s generating attention. And that\u2019s because Sorbara \u00ad\u2013 when teamed with percussionist sidekick Adam Hay \u00ad\u2013 holds a funny sway over people.\n\nA recent Rivoli showcase, stuffed to brimming with habitually blabby agents, publicists, record company reps and other industry types, was a marvel of good behaviour. Sorbara, moving between guitar and keyboard, silenced the room and kept it silenced until the end.\n\nSorbara\u2019s upper-register voice, even when breezily relaying everyday scenarios, carries the pathos of a torch singer six bourbons into her night.\n\nYet the 22-year-old insists, \u201cI don\u2019t know where that sadness comes from, because I have such a satisfying career and life. I don\u2019t mean to write sad songs. They just seem to come out that way.\u201d\n\nSigning a record deal, then endlessly touring and promoting herself \u00ad\u2013 the obvious next step \u00ad\u2013 isn\u2019t a notion Sorbara is entirely comfortable with.\n\nSinger sewing machines and Sorbara\u2019s much-loved fuchsia couch (where visitors to her pad must sit for a photograph while wearing a matching pink coat) don\u2019t travel well in the back of a U-haul.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the road, I just think about going home,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut then as soon as I get home, I want to play for more people.\n\n\u201cI have this faith that everything I\u2019m doing, whether it\u2019s sewing or making a lamp, feeds the songwriting, even if it just provides a form of meditation,\u201d Sorbara says, curling up in her kitchen chair.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be able to support myself doing something I love. That way I can continue to do other things that won\u2019t bring in money, like guitar-making,\u201d which she says she does not so much to achieve a unique sound but because she grooves on sculpting mahogany.\n\nThanks to her progressive parents, Sorbara has been immersed in music and art literally forever. She, her twin brother and four other siblings attended the Waldorf alternative school in Thornhill from kindergarten on. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most well-rounded school,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I would definitely send a kid of mine there. What they teach is what I consider most important \u00ad\u2013 art.\u201d\n\nHer launch into professional music happened coincidentally enough. According to Sorbara, her dad \u00ad\u2013 an MPP with no connections to the music world but a passing acquaintance through his political office with TV hosts Paula Todd and Steve Paikin \u00ad\u2013 asked for their recommendation of someone \u201cnot too weaselly\u201d in the business to forward an early demo tape to. The Studio 2 hosts suggested Sony A&R senior VP Mike Roth.\n\n\u201cAround three or four years ago, I met with Mike Roth and he said he liked my stuff and mentioned a development deal, but nothing ever happened,\u201d Sorbara says.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw Martina perform,\u201d Roth recalls, \u201cshe played guitar like Bruce Cockburn, sang like Kate Bush and then she told me she had built the guitar she was playing. I was, like, \u201cOh, my god.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut she wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to be a musician. She was going to spend a year in Europe, and so my attitude was \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m here.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wake of that,\u201d Sorbara continues, \u201cI made Unplaceables (her now-unavailable debut) just to have something on hand and to get a sense of what\u2019s involved in making records. It was very low-key, just me and my guitar and piano.\u201d\n\nFollowing the development deal, signed in 98, Sorbara, at Sony\u2019s request, paired with several producers \u00ad\u2013 Philosopher King Jon Levine, Matt DeMatteo and Dave Martin \u00ad\u2013 to lay down demos. Sorbara recalls the experience as enlightening, saying she especially enjoyed the sessions cut with DeMatteo, which included a cover of Madonna\u2019s Like A Virgin.\n\n\u201cI learned that the stuff I write can go in a million different places,\u201d Sorbara says. But both Roth and Sorbara agree the results weren\u2019t electrifying. Roth says a Sony-Sorbara pact \u201cmight still develop. I\u2019m keeping close tabs on what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Sorbara says maybe, maybe not.\n\nSorbara\u2019s fast track might have paused there had it not been for the 99 Blue Skies Folk Festival just outside Kingston, which both Sorbara and Moxy Fr\u00fcvous singer/percussionist Jian Ghomeshi were playing. At that moment, Sorbara was ready to get serious with another record while Ghomeshi, already a veteran performer, was looking to explore other areas of the business.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s unique about my relationship with Martina,\u201d says Ghomeshi, who also manages the singer, \u201cis that before it became more formal, we had a chance to interact as performers, so it was very organic. And even though I was interested in getting into other sides of the business, it had to be a labour of love to keep me interested.\u201d\n\nGhomeshi\u2019s impact has been two-fold. As a producer, he focused on Sorbara\u2019s vocal performance while keeping effects to a minimum in order to showcase her guitar and piano playing. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t take my music to some big production level I wasn\u2019t comfortable with,\u201d Sorbara confirms. \u201cThat was my fear with Sony, that I\u2019d just take this big jump and there would be no logical progression that anyone could see.\u201d\n\nAnd as a manager, Ghomeshi has provided Sorbara with a realistic portrait of how the business functions and a point of entry into the local scene.\n\nArtists such as Andy Stochansky, Danny Michel and Maury LaFoy, ex-posed to Sorbara through Ghomeshi\u2019s considerable cheerleading, have helped by teaming up for gigs or guesting on the album. All the songs on Cure For Bad Deeds, however, were authored by Sorbara alone. Which makes people\u2019s response really matter to her.\n\n\u201cOne of the most meaningful compliments I ever got came from a man who used to visit the cafe I used to work at, the Little York on King East, every morning. My CD was for sale there, and one day I pointed it out to him. He said, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll buy it\u2019 \u00ad\u2013 you know, sort of to support the little coffee-house chick.\n\n\u201cShortly after that, I got an e-mail from him that said something like, \u201cI thought I was doing you a favour by buying your CD, but in fact it was you who did me the favour.'\u201dMARTINA SORBARA with SID SIX at Ted\u2019s Wrecking Yard (549 College), Monday (December 18), $7. 928-5012."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Martina-Sorbara", "page_content": "Martina Sorbara (born November 13, 1978) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and frontwoman of the band Dragonette.
