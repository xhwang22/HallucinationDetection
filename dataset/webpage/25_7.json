Despite his initial refusal, he later accepted his proposal, and bassist Gunnar Thomsen was soon added to the two.\n\nThe band\u2019s name derives from T\u00fdr, a Norse deity (the equivalent of Mars for Roman mythology). Before T\u00fdr Joensen and Thomsen played together at seventeen in a band called Cruiser, as well as the same Stremoy, even if the latter only for a short time. This band then changed its name to Wolfgang and according to some rumors Joensen is still active and ready to publish new records\n\nAt the beginning of his career the band made use of the Faroese label Tutl for the production of their own CDs, including the debut How Far to Asgaard, but, after six years on tour for Europe, between F\u00e6r \u00d8er, Iceland, Denmark, Russia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Germany and Poland and some television appearances, their album Eric the Red, dedicated to Erik the Red, becomes the best-selling Faroese album, thanks to a particular sound that will become their trademark, attracting the attention of the record label Napalm Records who decided to redistribute it in 2006 and spread it all over the world. From this moment on the Austrian label decided to take care of all the albums of the group, thus renewing the graphics of the covers and re-proposing the first CDs of the group.\n\nIn the same year comes Ragnarok, the best album of the band under the creative and compositional point of view. The tracks are divided among them by short interludes (sound and / or effects) that guarantee the identification of the listener in the epic war scenario \u2013 the Ragnar\u01ebk, in fact \u2013 proposed by the group, and the pieces (thanks to the union of singular sounds folk with powerful prog trends) with a very distinctive sound of their kind.\n\nAfter the release of the album Land in early 2008, which continues in the sounds of the previous albums, the group began its tour in Europe and the United States for the Paganfest, along with Ensiferum, Eluveitie, Turisas, Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani bands, and during 2009 he will return to the United States first and then to Europe.\n\nAt the end of 2008 the band was voted band of the year by the TV and the Faroese National radio, through online voting procedure.\n\nThe following year, the By the Light of the Northern Star album was released. As usual, the Faroese re-propose key national viking metal melodies, but here the songs become engaging hymns; examples of this musical translation are presented in anthemic pieces such as Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu, By the Sword in My Hand and Turi\u00f0 Torkilsd\u00f3ttir.\n\nIn May 2011 comes The Lay of Thrym, an album in which the epic / progressive sounds of the first works and the recent viking / heavy breakthrough were merged. This process can be detected by listening to songs like Evening Star, almost a Viking ballad, and others like Take Your Tyrant and Fields of the Fallen, simpler, direct and in-your-face.\n\nIn September 2012, during the American tour with Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani, they signed a contract with the label Metal Blade Records.\n\nIn September 2013 Valkyrja comes out, the first album recorded under the US label. The plot of the concept album revolves around a Viking warrior, who abandons homeland and wife to join a battle in which he eventually perishes. The reward for his sacrifice comes with the Valkyries that accompany him at the F\u00f3lkvangr, or the home of the goddess Freyja, associated with love, beauty, fertility, gold, magic, war and death. The last two tracks are the cover of \u201cWhere eagles give\u201d by Iron Maiden and \u201cCemetery Gates\u201d by the Pantera. Both great inspirations of T\u00fdr, the songs are performed with the characteristic sound of the Faroese band."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/movies/amandla-stenberg-the-hate-u-give.html", "page_content": "WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 There are roles certain actors seem born to play \u2014 an echo of facial symmetry, a rhyming of demeanor \u2014 and then there is Starr Carter, the high school junior of \u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d and Amandla Stenberg, the young actress who seems to embody her almost from sense memory, as if the performance is actually self portraiture.\n\nIn a way, it is. Both Ms. Stenberg and her fictional counterpart shuttled between a lower-income black neighborhood and a wealthy white private school, beginning at the age of 10. Both were shaped by the mental gymnastics of traversing the two worlds, each of which seemed to require a distinct conception of self.

She is a leading interpreter of contemporary chamber music having premiered over a hundred works, including pieces incorporating multi-media and improvisation. As a \"Bay Area new-music luminary\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) Stenberg has commissioned, recorded and premiered new works by Tania Leon, Jack Body, Peter Sculthorpe, Chinary Ung, Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd, Kui Dong and many others. Stenberg\u2019s CD Scenes from a New Music S\u00e9ance with virtuoso pianist Eva-Maria Zimmermann has received special notice and features groundbreaking, innovative works by Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, Ruth Crawford Seeger and George Antheil. Composers who have dedicated work to her include Charles Amirkhanian, Robert Honstein, Amy X Neuburg, Aaron Gervais and Ronald Bruce Smith.\n\nKate Stenberg developed and commissioned new chamber music as co-founder of the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble (1993-1998) and Real Vocal String Quartet (2004-2006) and from 1995-2015 she served as the first violinist of the award winning Del Sol String Quartet - where she fostered the string quartet repertoire through collaboration and the commissioning of established and emerging composers. She worked closely with many composers including Joan Tower, Mason Bates, Mohammed Fairouz and Gabriela Lena Frank performing at such prestigious venues as the Kennedy Center, Library of Congress, Symphony Space, National Gallery of Art and on KQED public television. Hailed by Gramophone Magazine as \u201cmasters of all musical things they survey\u201d, Del Sol Quartet was a two time top winner of the Chamber Music America/ASCAP Award for Adventurous Programming. The quartet expanded its outreach to numerous educational institutions including the Manhattan School of Music, Dartmouth, MIT, Chapman University, University of California Berkeley and Santa Cruz, and the San Francisco and Peabody Conservatories of Music.\n\nStenberg has recorded work primarily by 20th and 21st century composers, including John Cage, Marc Bliztstein, Robert Erickson, Lou Harrison, Gabriela Lena Frank, Reza Vali and Kui Dong. During her two decade tenure with Del Sol String Quartet, she recorded numerous world premieres as well as established contemporary works. On the CD The Complete String Quartets with Didjeridu by Peter Sculthorpe, the quartet was hailed for their \u201cluminous performance\u201d and \u201csumptuous sound\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle). Stenberg can also be heard on recordings with the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, New Music Works, Stratos and with tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain and the late sarod master, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.\n\nStenberg\u2019s festival performances include Other Minds, Opera Santa Fe, Chautauqua, Ojai, Cabrillo, Nirmita Composer\u2019s Institute (Cambodia), Davos Festival (Switzerland), Tanglewood, Music Academy of the West, Centre Acanthes (France), Banff (Canada), and the Chengdu Contemporary Music Festival (China).

But before anyone can accuse them of slacking, the band returns today with not just one, but two full-length studio efforts, imaginatively titled Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. Of course, Deer Tick aren\u2019t the only act to have inadvertently burned a hole in their most ardent fans\u2019 pockets. From cult drone rockers to chart-topping rappers, here\u2019s a look at 10 acts who released two entirely separate records on the very same day.\n\n10. Islands, Should I Remain, Here at Sea? and Taste\n\nTen years after first showcasing their hook-laden brand of indie-rock on Return to the Sea, Canadian outfit Islands did indeed do just that for a spiritual, and questioning, sequel. It perhaps explains why Should I Remain, Here at Sea? sounds strangely familiar, something which even frontman Nick Thorburn appears to acknowledge on opener \u201cBack Into It\u201d (Those songs we used to sing / We haven\u2019t sung them in so long / I\u2019ll sing one with you now\u201d). Also released through their own Manqu\u00e9 label on May 13, 2016, Taste is a much more adventurous listen, adding space age synths and electronic bleeps into the mix on twelve vibrant tracks which drew comparisons with French dance-rock maestros Phoenix.\n\n9. Juliana Hatfield, Juliana\u2019s Pony: Total System Failure and Beautiful Creature\n\nAround the time of its release in 2000, Juliana Hatfield described Juliana\u2019s Pony: Total System Failure (by far the most abrasive of the two records she put out) as, \u201cA not-at-all attractive reaction to the ugly side of humanity, specifically American culture.\u201d Tune-free, aimless and entirely unnecessary were just some of the more succinct terms other less charitable listeners used instead. Formerly of Blake Babies, Some Girls and The Lemonheads, the alt-rock journeywoman has always been a rather contradictory figure, and nowhere was this more apparent than on these dual releases. While Juliana\u2019s Pony appeared designed to confuse and confront, Beautiful Creature was a relatively simple, introspective and melodic affair which gained some of the most glowing reviews of Hatfield\u2019s career.\n\nCheck out Juliana Hatfield\u2019s Paste Studio Session from April 2017 here.\n\n8. Bright Eyes, I\u2019m Wide Awake, It\u2019s Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn\n\nBright Eyes\u2019 Conor Oberst certainly took full advantage of the two albums/same day concept. Home to his signature hit (\u201cThe First Day of My Life\u201d), I\u2019m Wide Away, It\u2019s Morning saw the singer-songwriter embrace his more typical country-folk sound to enchanting effect, with none other than Emmylou Harris providing harmonies on three tracks. The electronic noodlings of Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, meanwhile, were more akin to Kid A-era Radiohead, with Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 Nick Zinner, Azure Ray\u2019s Maria Taylor and Tilly and the Wall\u2019s Nick White just some of the hipster-friendly providing support. Of course, it was the more conventional record which elevated Oberst to cult hero status, but its wonderfully weird companion remains the more intriguing.\n\n7. Elvis Costello, The Delivery Man and Il Sogno\n\nThe Delivery Man is credited to Elvis Costello and The Imposters, while Il Sogno sees Costello take sole billing. But for all intents and purposes, both records are the work of the same bespectacled singer-songwriter. Based on a conceptual story intended for Johnny Cash, The Delivery Man is an impassioned blend of alt-country and roots rock featuring guest appearances from the seemingly ubiquitous Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams. Il Sogno, meanwhile, is an ambitious ballet score composed for an Italian dance company\u2019s loose adaptation of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Thankfully Costello proved to be far more convincing than fellow pop icon-turned-occasional composer Paul McCartney, but it\u2019s The Delivery Man which is widely regarded as the late-Costello classic.\n\n6. Bruce Springsteen, Human Touch and Lucky Town\n\nBruce Springsteen had put out a double album, The River, in 1980, but opted for a different approach in 1992, separating the folksier, more reflective output of Lucky Town from the relatively generic love songs of Human Touch. His first new material since the E Street Band disbanded was met with contrasting responses. The former was widely praised for its personal outlook, with songs exploring his life-post divorce (\u201cBetter Days\u201d) and the birth of his son (\u201cLiving Proof\u201d). However, in a 2012 poll the latter was voted fans\u2019 least favourite Springsteen album, and The Boss himself has admitted that writing such happy songs wasn\u2019t his forte. Nevertheless, both records still managed to peak at No. 2 and 3, respectively, in the U.S., while Human Touch\u2019s title track remains one of his final few Top 20 hits.\n\n5. Guns N\u2019 Roses, Use Your Illusion and Use Your Illusion II\n\nHaving conquered the world with the unashamedly sleazy glam rock of Appetite for Destruction, Guns N\u2019 Roses subscribed to the bigger-is-better theory for its follow-up. Sunset Strip\u2019s finest didn\u2019t just drop two single discs on September 17, 1991\u2014they also ensured that each one ran as close as possible to their maximum playing time. Indeed, fans who bought both Use Your Illusion volumes had a whopping 30 tracks to get through, with songs like \u201cEstranged\u201d and \u201cNovember Rain\u201d approaching the 10-minute mark. Despite spawning the bigger hit (\u201cNovember Rain\u201d), Vol.1 had to settle for second place on the Billboard 200 behind Vol.2, although both records eventually achieved sales of more than five million copies. In contrast to this prolific phase, it then took another 17 years for Axl Rose and co. to record another album of original material.\n\n4. Nelly, Suit and Sweat\n\nSt. Louis\u2019s finest hip-hop export, Nelly, also achieved an impressive 1-2 on the U.S. album charts with Suit and Sweat in 2005. Featuring samples of New Romantics Spandau Ballet, doo-wop veterans The Del-Vikings and classic girl group LaBelle, not to mention a strangely pioneering country/hip-hop collaboration with Tim McGraw, the former record proved to be the unlikely victor. Indeed, even guest appearances from Missy Elliott and Christina Aguilera couldn\u2019t save the latter more energetic and uptempo affair from finishing a distant second. However, the only No. 1 hit from the whole project (\u201cGrillz\u201d) came from Sweatsuit, a compilation of the two releases featuring four new tracks.\n\n3. Tom Waits, Blood Money and Alice\n\nForget the double whammy of Guns N\u2019 Roses and Nelly, Tom Waits achieved a far trickier feat of reaching No. 32 and No. 33 in the same week with two brand new albums back in May 2002. And these were no ordinary albums either: Both were co-written with wife Kathleen Brennan specifically for stage productions by dramatist Robert Wilson. The suitably grim Blood Money provided the soundtrack to Woyzeck, the influential Georg B\u00fcchner play about a soldier driven to lunacy by various bizarre army experiments. While the equally macabre Alice\u2014which first appeared in bootleg form thanks to some opportunistic car thieves \u2014was penned for a brand-new tale based on Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland. The former charted higher, by the narrowest of margins, although both are considered his finest latter-day work.\n\n2. Boris, Urban Dance and Warpath and Asia\n\nJapanese sludge metal outfit Boris might not be the most familiar name on this list, but it would be impossible not to include them The experimental trio released two albums on the same day in 2006 (the second and third volumes of The Thing Which Overlooked Solomon) before going one better and dropping three on May 2, 2015. Renowned for their ridiculously long song structures\u20141996 debut Absolutego consists of just one 65-minute track\u2014the band\u2019s triple-pronged attack only features twelve numbers in total, but still clocks in well over the two-hour mark. Only two feature any vocals or drums (\u201cSurrender,\u201d \u201cEndless\u201d), with the rest of Urban Dance, Warpath and Asia serving up more of the instrumental drone music for which Atsuo, Wata and Takeshi are known."}, {"url": "https://stacker.com/music/ranking-beatles-solo-albums", "page_content": "Already one of history's greatest rock bands, The Beatles were even more than the sum of their parts. In the wake of the band's legendary 1960s run came a number of high-profile solo releases from each individual member. That includes Ringo, whose eponymous 1973 album peaked at #2 on the U.S. charts and yielded two #1 singles \u2026 with a little help from his friends, of course.\n\nWhat's no less striking than the substantial output of each respective Beatle is the evolution of their signature sounds and styles. From George Harrison's idiosyncratic slide guitar to John Lennon's raw candor, certain albums were nearly as groundbreaking as the group efforts that preceded them. Acclaimed releases such as \"All Things Must Pass\" and \"Plastic Ono Band\" also helped redefine the personas of their creators.\n\nThen there's Paul McCartney, or Macca, which is his English nickname, who arguably carried the torch of Beatles-style melodies into each of the subsequent decades. At the same time, he tirelessly explored an assortment of production styles and peripheral genres, including classical and electronic.

But her recording career started in 1967, and despite 17 years when she made no recordings at all, her solo albums actually out-number ABBA\u2019s studio albums.\n\nShe was so in love\n\nAgnetha F\u00e4ltskog became a recording artist in 1967, when she was only 17 years old. A prolific songwriter for many years even at that tender age, her d\u00e9but single featured one of her own songs, \u2018Jag var s\u00e5 k\u00e4r\u2019 (\u201cI Was So In Love\u201d). The single shot to number one on the Swedish sales chart in early 1968, kicking off Agnetha\u2019s recording career with a bang. Four years later, when ABBA recorded their first single in the spring of 1972, Agnetha had four albums and a slew of hit singles to her credit, all of them released on the Cupol label; for the first few years of ABBA\u2019s career, Agnetha would remain signed to that label. Her fifth album \u2013 Elva kvinnor i ett hus (\u201cEleven Women In One House\u201d), released in 1975 \u2013 was the only of her albums to consist only of tunes she had written herself (except for her Swedish-language version of ABBA\u2019s \u2018SOS\u2019), and seemed to usher in a new phase in her career: the female singer/songwriter, firmly in control of her recorded output. However, by the time of the album\u2019s release ABBA had exploded on the international scene, so instead Elva kvinnor i ett hus constituted Agnetha\u2019s farewell to the Cupol label. After that she became a full-time Polar Music recording artist and the remainder of the decade was almost exclusively devoted to her work with ABBA.\n\nHer first release as a solo artist on the Polar label came towards the end of the ABBA era, in October 1981, and the album in question was no straightforward pop creation either. Agnetha had wanted to record something with her and Bj\u00f6rn\u2019s daughter, Linda, for a long time. In November 1980, mother and child finally entered Polar Music Studio in Stockholm, Sweden to record a collection of Swedish-language Christmas songs. Linda was seven years old at the time. The original intention was that the album should be rush-released in time for Christmas in 1980, but it was soon realised that the deadline wouldn\u2019t be met. Therefore, Nu t\u00e4ndas tusen juleljus (\u201cNow A Thousand Christmas Candles Are Being Lit\u201d), as the album was entitled, wasn\u2019t issued until October 1981. Upon release it reached number 6 on the Swedish album chart and has remained a consistent seller each Christmas since then.\n\nWrap your arms around her\n\nThe next time Agnetha had the opportunity to release an album under her own name was in May 1983. The previous year had seen the ABBA era grinding to a halt, with the group making what turned out to be their very last recordings. At the time, the intention was merely to take a break, so that Bj\u00f6rn and Benny would have the time to collaborate with Tim Rice on writing and recording the musical Chess. In the meantime, Frida and Agnetha would concentrate on their solo careers. Frida had released her first English-language album, Something\u2019s Going On, in 1982, and now it was Agnetha\u2019s turn to make her d\u00e9but solo album for an international market.\n\nHer choice of producer was Mike Chapman, who\u2019d enjoyed a highly successful career during the 1970s as songwriter and producer for the likes of The Sweet, Mud, Smokie and Suzi Quatro, and producer for acts such as Blondie and The Knack. After Agnetha had trawled through hundreds of demo tracks in late 1982, she and Chapman met up at Polar Music Studio in January 1983 to record the best of those songs. She also asked singer Tomas Ledin \u2013 a very popular artist in Sweden, who had been afforded a solo spot on ABBA\u2019s 1979 tour \u2013 to write something for her album, the resulting track being the reggae-flavoured \u2018Take Good Care Of Your Children\u2019. Mike Chapman collaborated with Holly Knight on what ultimately became the title track of the album, the seductive \u2018Wrap Your Arms Around Me\u2019. However, the most popular song to emerge from the recording sessions was the jubilant, calypso-styled \u2018The Heat Is On\u2019. It was the first single from the album and reached number one on the Swedish chart. The track was indicative of Agnetha\u2019s overall intention for the album. \u201cWe wanted good songs with strong melodies, a positive spirit. Not just tragic ballads about someone having left you, or that life is difficult,\u201d she explained in an interview.\n\nWhen the Wrap Your Arms Around Me album was released it shot to number one on the Swedish album chart, becoming one of the biggest albums of 1983. In international terms, alongside Frida\u2019s Something\u2019s Going On, it is the most successful solo album ever released by an ABBA member, reaching quite respectable chart positions and selling a reported 1.2 million copies worldwide. Agnetha herself has said that it\u2019s her favourite among her 1980s output. Another major single from the album was \u2018Can\u2019t Shake Loose\u2019, written by Russ Ballard who\u2019d penned the previous year\u2019s Frida hit \u2018I Know There\u2019s Something Going On\u2019. \u2018Can\u2019t Shake Loose\u2019 gave Agnetha her biggest solo success in the United States, where it reached the Top 30.\n\nStewarded by Stewart\n\nThe period 1982\u20131986 was a highly prolific period for Agnetha as a recording artist, mirrored by the slew of bonus tracks included on the 2005 CD version of Wrap Your Arms Around Me. For example, her 1982 duet with Tomas Ledin on \u2018Never Again\u2019 was also recorded in a Spanish version, \u2018Ya Nunca M\u00e1s\u2019, while the songs on her 1983 hit single \u2018It\u2019s So Nice To Be Rich\u2019/\u2019P&B\u2019 \u2013 released shortly after Wrap Your Arms Around Me \u2013 were taken from the Swedish movie P&B.\n\nAgnetha\u2019s final album for Polar Music, Eyes Of A Woman, originally released in 1985, was also re-released with bonus tracks in 2005. Recorded in Stockholm in the autumn of 1984, with Eric Stewart of 10cc in the producer\u2019s chair, the album project is notable for producing the last two Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog compositions to be made public for almost three decades. One of them, \u2018You\u2019re There\u2019, was not included on the album, but used for a single B-side (it is one of the bonus tracks on the Eyes Of A Woman CD). However, the second tune, \u2018I Won\u2019t Let You Go\u2019, was not only included on the album but was also released as the incredibly catchy first single from the project. For Agnetha, though, this artistic triumph came at a price, as she found that it had become a battle for her to write songs. \u201cI was struggling alone with \u2019I Won\u2019t Let You Go\u2019 for the whole of last summer,\u201d she told a reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of hard work, no glamour at all.\u201d The pressure she placed on herself to come up with high-quality tunes probably explains why she gave up songwriting altogether soon afterwards.\n\nThe way she is\n\nThe Eyes Of A Woman album was released in March 1985, reaching number two on the Swedish album chart and achieving respectable positions on other European charts. The album contained two tracks written by Eric Stewart, and also a contribution from Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues. The second major single release from the album, \u2018One Way Love\u2019, had been written by Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra. However, the next time Agnetha achieved a significant single hit in her home country was in 1986, when she teamed up with singer Ola H\u00e5kansson for the duet single \u2018The Way You Are\u2019 / \u2018Fly Like The Eagle\u2019. Both sides of this single are bonus features on the Eyes Of A Woman CD.\n\nIn 1987, Agnetha signed with Warner Music and released two more solo albums, the first of which was a children\u2019s album with her son Christian, entitled Kom f\u00f6lj med i v\u00e5r karusell (\u201cCome Join Us In Our Carousel\u201d). That was followed by the international pop LP I Stand Alone, recorded in Los Angeles and produced by former Chicago member Peter Cetera, entering the Swedish charts at number one. But after that, Agnetha\u2019s motivation at remaining in the music business sank drastically. She had been a recording artist for 20 years and had barely stopped to take a stock of her life after ABBA\u2019s final recordings. As she admitted recently, \u201cI was so tired \u2026 and just wanted to be calm and be with my children.\u201d It would be 17 years before she released another album. My Colouring Book, issued in 2004, featured a selection of covers of favourite songs, most of them from the 1960s. However, all soon went quiet again and most people, including Agnetha herself, concluded that this was probably her final album.\n\nBack on our radios\n\nBut Agnetha also likes saying that she\u2019s the kind of person that never closes any doors, and she did indeed prove true to her word when she was approached by the team of songwriter/producer J\u00f6rgen Elofsson, who\u2019d written hits for artists such as Britney Spears, Westlife and Kelly Clarkson, and arranger/producer Peter Nordahl. Presented with a handful of songs that Elofsson and Nordahl thought might suit her and which might constitute the first step towards a new album, her reaction was instant and positive. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t say no,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI really loved the songs from the beginning.\u201d The team were soon ensconced in the recording studio, working out a brand new album, which even featured a newly written tune from Agnetha, \u2018I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed\u2019 (with lyrics by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson). Released by Universal Music in May 2013, A has become Agnetha\u2019s most successful solo album, featuring in the higher regions of the charts in many countries.\n\nWhether this success will be followed by further albums remains to be seen. But at the very least one more chapter has been written in the story of Agnetha\u2019s solo career, enabling us to yet again enjoy her voice in a context quite different from ABBA: Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog on her own."}]}
