Former Silver Fern Leana de Bruin wishes she\u2019d learnt it a little earlier in life, with the stunning netballer admitting there have been a few instances where a bit of trusting her first instincts would have come in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt a few lessons along the way,\u201d Leana says with a wry smile. So when it came to making the decision to move across the Tasman for a one-year contract with the Adelaide Thunderbirds, Leana (40) knew what she had to do \u2013 and three months later, the star defender knows her gut was 100% spot on. While it\u2019s a big call to leave New Zealand \u2013 pulling her seven-year-old son Caleb out of his school and leaving her partner behind \u2013 Leana says she wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave netball behind. Plus, she knew if she turned down this opportunity to play in Australia\u2019s netball league, she\u2019d always wonder, \u2018what if?\u2019. \u201cI was definitely at a bit of a crossroads,\u201d says Leana, who last year captained new team the Northern Stars in New Zealand\u2019s new ANZ Premiership.\n\nCaleb is heading to Adelaide with Leana.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018 Do I retire? Do I go one more year?\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, this came up. So I figured if they thought I was still good enough to be there, then I\u2019d give it one more year. Plus, I still have a lot of fire in my belly.\u201d She continues, \u201cI did get a little overwhelmed making the decision. I did feel responsible for the Stars in some way \u2013 we didn\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped this year and I know there\u2019s huge potential. \u201cBut, at the same time, I\u2019d reached the stage in my career where, and it sounds so horrible, I had to be a little bit selfish and do what I wanted.\u201d So Leana and Caleb are preparing to make the move to Adelaide in the New Year, with the duo both very excited to experience a new city, culture and in Leana\u2019s case, some of South Australia\u2019s famous wine! \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be able to enjoy it too much during the season, but after the season is a different story!\u201d she laughs.\n\nThe star represented New Zealand 104 times before retiring from international netball in 2016.\n\n\u201cBut we are really looking forward to it. I asked Caleb about it, because this would mean spending less time with his dad [Leana\u2019s ex-husband Quinton]. But, as Caleb pointed out, it\u2019s not forever and he said to me, \u2018Mum, we\u2019ll just FaceTime him!\u2019 I video call my parents every Sunday in South Africa, it\u2019s a bit of a tradition, so Caleb said, \u2018If you do that with your mum and dad, I\u2019ll do it with mine.\u2019 It was very cute.\u201d Leana, who describes herself as a farm girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of love for big cities, is adamant that this is a one-year move \u2013 home for both her and Caleb is their farmhouse in the Waikato. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t see myself living in Australia,\u201d she tells. \u201cI have a partner here. He was very supportive as well. He said if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d regret it one day. It\u2019s better to know than wonder! And Adelaide is only a flight away.\u201d She acknowledges that playing for an Australian team for the first time in her career was a big decision. Leana, who has represented New Zealand 104 times and her native South Africa in 34 tests, feels a huge loyalty to Aotearoa and the people here who gave her the opportunities that have led her to this point."}, {"url": "https://netballmagic.co.nz/silver-ferns/news/latest-news/de-bruin-announces-retirement-from-international-netball.html", "page_content": "News\n\nDe Bruin announces retirement from international Netball\n\nSilver Ferns defender Leana de Bruin has announced her retirement from international Netball.\n\n\n\nShe leaves the international arena having played 138 Test Matches - 104 for New Zealand and 34 for her country of birth, South Africa, and in the World 7 team in 2000 - in a career that has spanned nearly twenty years at the elite level.\n\n\n\nA world champion and Commonwealth Games gold medallist, de Bruin played at three Commonwealth Games (2006, 2010, 2014) and a record five Netball World Cups (1999 \u2013 RSA, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015).\n\n\n\nAfter a strong season with the Cold Power Magic in the ANZ Championship, which saw her lead her team to back-to-back New Zealand Conference titles, de Bruin said she felt the time was right.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have had a fantastic season with the Magic and an incredible career with the Silver Ferns.

After retiring from international netball last month, even Leana\u2019s a little surprised at how happy she is post-Ferns. After all, it\u2019s a team she was a part of for a staggering 14 years, notching up 104 test caps in the black dress, and before that, 34 for her native South Africa. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s given her everything \u2013 a career as a professional sportswoman, her closest friends and a new home in New Zealand. And apart from being Mum to the very energetic and vivacious Caleb, netball remains her greatest passion. Leana\u2019s decision to hang up her now well-worn bib was incredibly tough but, as the 1.90m defender concedes, it was time.\n\n\u201cMy body couldn\u2019t take it any more,\u201d the no-nonsense netball stalwart says. \u201cI went into the Silver Fern trials with an open mind, but my ankle was giving me grief the whole season. The Ferns environment is tough and I was battling. I couldn\u2019t give 100 per cent, so I said to [Silver Ferns coach] Janine [Southby] before she made the final decision, I think it\u2019s time. And it was. I was always going to be playing in pain and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more.\u201d Still, it was hard to let go of a 14-year tenure that\u2019s seen her win a world championship, two Commonwealth Games and an ANZ Championship title. \u201cPart of me still wanted to be a part of it,\u201d she admits. \u201cI wanted to finish on a game, rather than just randomly like I had to. But, unfortunately, you know, life takes funny turns. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d And fate was the reason a 22-year-old Leana ended up in Aotearoa in the first place. After the 1999 World Championships, a World Seven invitational team was formed to play against the Silver Ferns in New Zealand, and Leana jumped at the chance to be a part of it.\n\n\u201cThe manager of that team was from Invercargill. I was chatting with her and I mentioned how cool it would be to come over and play in New Zealand, and then she asked me!\u201d Three years later, Leana was a surprise selection for the Silver Ferns and lined up for her debut in 2003. Soon, she found herself up against her former team. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe hardest part was hearing the South African national anthem. I couldn\u2019t sing that, I had to sing the New Zealand one. That got the heartstrings, for sure. But for some reason, it also felt right, as hard as it was. I was immensely proud to be wearing that black dress.\u201d Now Leana\u2019s a true blue Kiwi \u2013 a fact reinforced by her New Zealand-born and All Black fanatic son Caleb, whom she\u2019s thrilled to be spending more time with.\n\nLeana played for the Silver Ferns for the past 14 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loving the fact I\u2019m home a bit more now. Every afternoon, we\u2019ll have a bit of a rugby game or a kicking contest in the backyard,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows everything there is to know about the All Blacks, he has the same birthday as Kieran Read, which he just thinks is the coolest thing ever. He\u2019s playing rippa at the moment, but moves onto tackle rugby next year. \u201cHe does understand that I\u2019m not playing with the Ferns any more, but he does keep asking when we\u2019re going away again, because we\u2019ve been used to travelling a lot! It is a little weird to him that all of a sudden, Mum\u2019s home every weekend.\u201d As far as a new plan goes, spending time with her son is at the top of Leana\u2019s list, as well as being \u201ca good tenant\u201d and helping her landlords, Laurie and Jo, look after the farm and the animals. But Leana has found she\u2019s been unable to let go of netball completely. While she currently can\u2019t confirm if she is playing in either the new South Auckland-based team for the inaugural New Zealand elite league or is seeking an Australian contract, Leana reckons she might have one more year of domestic netball in her.\n\nAnd she\u2019s also scored coaching gigs overseas, as well as ambassador work for Netball New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in netball world!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think I would have been totally depressed if I had to ask myself,\n\n\u2018What next?\u2019, but the transition from player to ambassador has been quite easy. Netball New Zealand has been great.\u201d Along with moving into a more mentor-based netball role, where she\u2019s keen to share her experience and wisdom, she also has a very important event to plan \u2013 Caleb\u2019s upcoming seventh birthday party. \u201cI had planned to still be playing netball at the end of October, when his birthday is, so now that I\u2019m not, we get to organise the party together, which is really exciting. This will only be the second time in his life that I\u2019m home for his birthday because we\u2019ve always been playing overseas.\u201d She\u2019s also looking forward to spending some more time with her new partner, who lives in South Auckland. \u201cYup, there\u2019s a bit of a dude hanging around. It\u2019s quite nice,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice \u2013 well, it sounds horrible \u2013 but we\u2019re not in each other\u2019s face all the time! So the distance thing works. But it does help when you\u2019re not playing; you have a bit more time to fit everything in and the headspace too.\u201d\n\nWith her Silver Fern team mates.\n\nCaleb is keen on a caravan trip around the North Island too, but Leana admits she isn\u2019t so sure about that plan. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to attempt it!\u201d Still, Leana says she can\u2019t quite shake a few old habits, such as keeping up with the gym sessions. \u201cI know that sounds a bit weird, but I love training!\u201d she tells. \u201cThough now I can just cruise on the bike, instead of going a million miles an hour, and then afterwards, I have time to catch up with friends, have a coffee and go for a walk.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s blissfully happy with her new, less structured and more relaxed life, Leana knows netball will always be in her blood, and the woman her Silver Fern team-mates know as Vlooi will always be somewhere in the background, coaching, mentoring or simply as a fan. \u201cEveryone needs a nickname in the team and mine was Vlooi,\u201d explains Leana. \u201cIt actually means flea in Afrikaans... but I\u2019m not tiny and I can\u2019t jump that high. When Casey [Kopua] found that out, she started calling me fleabag.\u201d Shaking her head, she continues, \"My maiden name is du Plooy and someone at my high school gave me that nickname because it rhymed. Irene [van Dyk] is probably the reason why it\u2019s stuck!\u201d It\u2019s the friendships in the team that Leana will miss the most, especially with Irene, Maria Tutaia, Cathrine Latu, Grace Rasmussen and Anna Harrison."}, {"url": "https://central.rookieme.com/netball/players-that-got-away-leana-de-bruin/", "page_content": "THERE are a number of netballers in the world that have pulled on the international dress for more than one country throughout the career. With netball on hold due to the outbreak of COVID-19 Draft Central has decided to take a look at those players and their international careers and what could have been. Next in line is former Silver Ferns and Spar Proteas defender Leana de Bruin.\n\nStarting off her career with South Africa, de Bruin played 34 international caps for the Proteas before transitioning to the Silver Ferns in 2000 where she racked up a whopping 104 international caps in the black dress. She was as consistent as they came for the Spar Proteas acting as a real wall down in defence and using her smothering style of pressure to halt any easy movement into the attacking third. De Bruin was a commanding influence for South Africa throughout her time able to lead her side on court with her impressive vision and ball handling skills.\n\nA member of the New Zealand Silver Ferns, de Bruin was a key cog in the defensive circle with her hands over pressure, speed off the mark and tagging style of defence. She was hardly ever beaten in a one on one given her strength and general netball nous to work around the body of her opponent. Renowned for her physical pressure and aerial ability de Bruin was a constant pain in any goalers side, able to ruffle their feathers and create turnovers.\n\nHer connection with the likes of Katrina Rore and Casey Kopua was electric with the trio able to cause all sorts of havoc down back. Their zone style of defence was what made them such a formidable unit able to transition well and continue that high pressure intensity. She well and truly cemented herself in the squad becoming the fifth player to notch up over 100 tests with her hard-working mentality constantly on display. While her defensive pressure was a clear asset for the Ferns it was her ability to bring the ball down the court and provide attacking options that also made her a force to be reckoned with.\n\nShe has had a decorated career, with the highly touted defender lucky enough to feature in five Netball World Cups \u2013 one for South Africa in 1999 and the next four in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 with New Zealand. Her dominance did not stop there with de Bruin also playing in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games for the Ferns. Throughout her time, she tasted plenty of success filling the trophy cabinet with gold and silver medals.\n\nAfter switching to the Silver Ferns, it is fair to say that de Bruin\u2019s services were well and truly missed for the Spar Proteas who at times lacked that X-factor she possessed. Her ability to read the flight of the ball and inject herself into the game was second to none able to make something out of nothing more times than not given her long reaching arms and footwork."}, {"url": "https://www.starsnetball.co.nz/stars/news/stars-captain-confirmed.html", "page_content": "STARS CAPTAIN CONFIRMED\n\nLeana de Bruin will lead the Northern Stars for the inaugural season of the ANZ Premiership, named as the first captain of New Zealand\u2019s newest professional sports team.\n\n\n\nWhile de Bruin says the news may not come as a huge surprise for some, coach Julie Hoornweg involved the rest of the team before making the decision. \u201cAlthough it may be expected, you don\u2019t know for sure how the other players feel\u201d she said, \u201cobviously I\u2019m not getting any younger and Julie may have wanted to look to the future, so it\u2019s a real privilege.\u201d\n\n\n\nSenior midcourter Courtney Tairi and young defender Holly Fowler will support de Bruin as part of a leadership group.\n\n\n\nThe Silver Ferns centurion, who has now retired from international netball, is relishing the chance to lend her experience, tactical nous and professional attitude to the Stars, and is excited by the young talent in the team. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see how they take on board what you tell them\u201d de Bruin said, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing how they continue to grow.\u201d\n\n\n\nde Bruin is eager to see how it all comes together on court when the Stars join the other five ANZ Premiership teams for the pre-season tournament at Te W\u0101nanga o Raukawa in Otaki. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played together at all, so I have no idea what to expect, but every week we\u2019ve become fitter, more agile and used to the way Julie trains.

Her last game on the domestic scene was the Northern Stars' ANZ Premiership grand final loss to the Central Pulse in June last year.\n\nMARTY MELVILLE/PHOTOSPORT Last year's ANZ Premiership grand final loss with the Northern Stars was Leana de Bruin's final domestic netball game.\n\nAnd then came the stark realisation - 'I need to find a job'.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* 'Holiday's over' for Barrett\n\n* Fatialofa's surgery success\n\n* Sopoaga deal 'a clumsy mistake'\n\n* Carbery in doubt for Ireland\n\nDe Bruin told Stuff that when an opportunity she had eyed up fell through, things became \"a bit of a panic\", with a CV not featuring much aside from 'netball player'.\n\nShe had completed a degree in communications in 2007, but in being a single mum (to now 10-year-old son Caleb) living on a farm, and with plenty of sporting commitments, never really felt the time, or need, to put it into action.\n\nGETTY IMAGES Leana de Bruin played 104 tests for the Silver Ferns, after 34 for South Africa.\n\n\"That was probably the biggest thing for me, realising that you can have a degree but if you don't have the experience, it's quite hard to get in a role to get your income at a level that you're used to,\" de Bruin said.\n\n\"So that was a big shock for me.\"\n\nNow she's just thankful the Chiefs handed her a debut in August last year.\n\nAdvertising for the new role, the club didn't get a desired candidate in the first round of recruitment, before Judy Clement - the Chiefs' previous personal development manager - suggested de Bruin, who she had connections with, might be a good fit.

Leana de Bruin, a former Silver Fern who will play for Adelaide next year, is a commentator for this month's Constellation Cup.\n\nLEANA: I must confess I had to put a brave face on, being the new kid on the block from South Africa. My English wasn't the greatest and I was quite shy. I didn't feel very well on our little boat trip over there, but I had to be brave because I didn't want to come across as a bit of a wuss. We went for a few runs in the Stewart Island bush, which was pretty cool, because not many people go there.\n\nIn 1999, the World Champs was played in Christchurch and I played for South Africa then. They chose a world sevens team to come and play against New Zealand in 2000.\n\nSUPPLIED Leana De Bruin is pictured with Bernice Mene, on a Stewart Island beach, during a team photo shoot in 2003.\n\nOur manager for that team was one of the ladies down in Invercargill.

I was like, \"Oh why not?\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Leana de Bruin links with Adelaid Thunderbirds\n\n* In my beauty bag: Silver Fern Leana de Bruin\n\nI had no idea what Invercargill was like. My brother's a pilot in South Africa and one of his co-workers was from New Zealand. When I told him I was going to Invercargill, he looked at me like, \"What have you done!\"\n\nNetball in South Africa wasn't very good and I thought it was a great opportunity to come and learn from the Kiwis. I was pretty nervous, I'm not going to lie about that, especially as my English wasn't great. I knew the basics to help myself but certainly didn't back myself to hold a conversation. Being put into a team with legends like Bernice (Mene) and Lesley Nicol, and Donna Loffhagen, and Adine Wilson - those are big names I'd looked up to and all of a sudden I was in their team.\n\nThey'd come through the ranks together and they'd been there for a while, but they were awesome - Kiwis are just so amazing making you feel welcome.\n\nI find Kiwis talk really fast. (Now I'm one of those who talks really fast when I get excited.) So I had to listen really carefully. But it wasn't so bad because at the end of the day all I needed to understand in English on the netball court is netball terms, which wasn't a problem. It was more in the day-to-day conversations, the confidence thing was a barrier.\n\nWe only played one season together and then she stopped but what I do really remember about Bernice is her laugh - she's got a really contagious laugh. She was real down-to-earth; she was an idol for lots of people and an amazing player but she didn't let that go to her head, she was humble and easy to talk to. She was the one who really explained stuff to me. She didn't get frustrated, she was willing to help.\n\nThe challenging thing for me last year when I did commentating for the first time was, I'd just got out of the team, and I had to talk about my teammates. It does make it challenging to commentate when things aren't going right. But at the end of the day, I've got a different hat on now and that's kind of how I see it.

Former Silver Fern Leana de Bruin wishes she\u2019d learnt it a little earlier in life, with the stunning netballer admitting there have been a few instances where a bit of trusting her first instincts would have come in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt a few lessons along the way,\u201d Leana says with a wry smile. So when it came to making the decision to move across the Tasman for a one-year contract with the Adelaide Thunderbirds, Leana (40) knew what she had to do \u2013 and three months later, the star defender knows her gut was 100% spot on. While it\u2019s a big call to leave New Zealand \u2013 pulling her seven-year-old son Caleb out of his school and leaving her partner behind \u2013 Leana says she wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave netball behind. Plus, she knew if she turned down this opportunity to play in Australia\u2019s netball league, she\u2019d always wonder, \u2018what if?\u2019. \u201cI was definitely at a bit of a crossroads,\u201d says Leana, who last year captained new team the Northern Stars in New Zealand\u2019s new ANZ Premiership.\n\nCaleb is heading to Adelaide with Leana.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018 Do I retire? Do I go one more year?\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, this came up. So I figured if they thought I was still good enough to be there, then I\u2019d give it one more year. Plus, I still have a lot of fire in my belly.\u201d She continues, \u201cI did get a little overwhelmed making the decision. I did feel responsible for the Stars in some way \u2013 we didn\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped this year and I know there\u2019s huge potential. \u201cBut, at the same time, I\u2019d reached the stage in my career where, and it sounds so horrible, I had to be a little bit selfish and do what I wanted.\u201d So Leana and Caleb are preparing to make the move to Adelaide in the New Year, with the duo both very excited to experience a new city, culture and in Leana\u2019s case, some of South Australia\u2019s famous wine! \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be able to enjoy it too much during the season, but after the season is a different story!\u201d she laughs.\n\nThe star represented New Zealand 104 times before retiring from international netball in 2016.\n\n\u201cBut we are really looking forward to it. I asked Caleb about it, because this would mean spending less time with his dad [Leana\u2019s ex-husband Quinton]. But, as Caleb pointed out, it\u2019s not forever and he said to me, \u2018Mum, we\u2019ll just FaceTime him!\u2019 I video call my parents every Sunday in South Africa, it\u2019s a bit of a tradition, so Caleb said, \u2018If you do that with your mum and dad, I\u2019ll do it with mine.\u2019 It was very cute.\u201d Leana, who describes herself as a farm girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of love for big cities, is adamant that this is a one-year move \u2013 home for both her and Caleb is their farmhouse in the Waikato. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t see myself living in Australia,\u201d she tells. \u201cI have a partner here. He was very supportive as well. He said if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d regret it one day. It\u2019s better to know than wonder! And Adelaide is only a flight away.\u201d She acknowledges that playing for an Australian team for the first time in her career was a big decision.
