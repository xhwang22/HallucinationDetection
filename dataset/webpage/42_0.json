At the age of 12, he obtained his first prize in drawing at the Junior Seminary of Coll\u00e8ge St-Martial in 1966.\n\nHis parents, Georgette B and \u00c9tienne L Dodard, introduced him to painting and drawing at an early age. At the age of 15, he joined the \u201cPoto Mitan\u201d, a free art school directed by Jean Claude \u201cTiga\u201d Garoute, Patrick Vilaire, and Wilfrid \u201cFrido\u201d Casimir. They were all three famous painters of the twentieth century in the Haitian artistic sector.\n\nA brilliant start to a career\n\nAlthough he began painting at a very early age, his career only really took off in 1981. Thanks to the support of Mich\u00e8le Frisch (director of the MUPANAH at the time), the Marassa gallery in P\u00e9tion-Ville hosted his first major exhibition. An exhibition that takes place around the theme \u201cAquatism\u201d. And since then, his success has been undeniable.\n\nHis paintings, exhibited in many museums abroad, will be the subject of aesthetic debates on the modernity of Haitian contemporary art. He immediately attracted the attention of many art critics, notably in Haiti, Brazil, France, the United States, and the Caribbean.\n\nHis itinerary\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that he was an accountant by training. After these studies, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts (now called ENARTS), then the National School of Bordeaux, to study plastic arts. He ended up specializing in educational graphics.\n\nOn his return from Bordeaux, he was appointed head of the graphic department of the Deschamps publishing house. For 10 years, he was the artistic director of the ironwork company \u201cMulti-ad\u201d. This company was created in collaboration with Monique Gard\u00e8re.\n\nIn the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, he studied at the Kripalu yoga center. This approach will propel him towards the learning of the being, the spiritual, and the samurai and martial arts. He was even led to the practice of Kundo. He then studied the science of Reiki (initiation to alternative medicine).\n\nPhilippe Dodard, current director of the National Superior School of Art (ENARTS), intends to fulfill the mission that this entity has given itself since its creation in the 1980s: to maintain the reputation of the Haitian culture and the influence of its art.\n\n\u201c\u2026Improve the quality of training, upgrade the various departments and offer students the best opportunities to promote the development of their talents, refound the school in perdition, renovate the foundry (to become again at the service of the Haitian nation) and restore the monument of the Indian are, among others, the objectives set,\u201d he noted in an interview with the local newspaper.\n\nCommitted artist and entrepreneur\n\nThe cultural advisor for Elisabeth D. Pr\u00e9val (former First Lady of the Republic of Haiti), he will install on the Place Saint-Pierre and the Champ de Mars \u201cPlas timoun\u201d, an art therapy center that focuses on rehabilitating street children through the arts.\n\nAs head of the ironworks site in the reconstruction project of the iron market, destroyed in the January 12 earthquake, he is saving the pride of Port-au-Prince, this historic site classified as a national heritage. This unique reconstruction was inaugurated in January 2011. \u201cIt was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of ironwork and design,\u201d says Dodard.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Dimitry and Evelyne Craan on this restoration project, I had the pleasure of training many workers. And I am happy that the project has achieved its triple dimension: to give back, through citizen involvement, life to the city; to succeed in this challenge of human management (about 400 workers were at work) and to put in place one of the symbolic monuments of the identity of Port-au-Prince, much visited by tourists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cDodard of the Year\u201d prize is awarded each year to a personality of the artistic milieu who has distinguished himself or herself in an artistic or sporting field. The first winner, Philippe Dodard recalls, was Madeline Paill\u00e8re, an art critic.\n\nFranck\u00e9tienne (painter and writer), Aubelin Jolicoeur and Nancy Roc (journalists), Lionnel Abelard (Karateka), Beethova Obas (musician), the former Haitian president Michel Martelly, Edwidge Danticat, more recently, have all been awarded.\n\nDodard\u2019s work : criticism\n\nHis work sparked a debate in 2006 on the issue of Haitian art and modernism, drawing on such notables as Michel Philippe Lelebourg, Michel Frisch, Franketienne, Bob Corbett, Greg Thomas, Babacard Embou, Nkil Negou, and Legrace Benson. A large-scale exhibition of his work at the Broward Library Museum in 2006 led to the publication of the book: Dodard\u2019s Work.\n\n\u201cThis book demystifies Picasso and his authority in contemporary art. The contributors look at my African, Native American, and European-inspired work. This document reflects my very spiritual bent for art, my interest in voodoo.\u201d he says. His paintings, acrylics on fabric reflect Tiga\u2019s influence, holding the \u201cArtistic Rotation\u201d method (which \u201cPotan Mitan\u201d advocated) that goes through four stages: art, craft, technicality, and science.\n\n\u201cThe use by an artist of sensitive media: earth, clay, ceramics, paper and all disciplines of art is a source of enrichment and can push his creative sense,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nIn short\n\nWith his captivating, deep, and rebellious style, he has made his mark on the postmodern art scene. His art has given soul to the Spring \u2013 2012 collection (inspired by the painter\u2019s black and white inks) of American fashion designer Donna Karan. The two will collaborate to launch a project to develop Haitian handicrafts to bring them to an international level.\n\nIn collaboration with Mich\u00e8le Frish and Roger Jaar, he created the company \u201cJivan\u201d for the collection of jewelry inspired by Haitian culture. In 1980, he received a Rotary International Foundation grant, which allowed him to continue his work.\n\nPhilippe Dodard has certainly accomplished more than many of his contemporaries. A proven entrepreneur, his worth is now estimated at over $102 million.\n\nConsidered an ace of Haitian painting, Philipe Dodard knew how to mark his time. He is one of the few entrepreneurs to have reached this level in the Haitian artistic field."}, {"url": "https://haitianartsociety.org/dodard-philippe-haitian-b-1954", "page_content": "Photo by Ian Willms\n\nPhilippe Dodard, often called the Picasso of Haiti, is a Haitian graphic artist and painter.

Many of them are inspired by Alex Webb\u2019s seminal work Under a Grudging Sun, which continues, to this day, to influence their aesthetics.\n\nWebb\u2019s first trip to Haiti, back in 1975, transformed him\u2014both as a photographer and as a human being. \u201cI photographed a kind of world I had never experienced before, a world of emotional vibrancy and intensity: raw, disjointed, sometimes beautiful, often tragic,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cI encountered a world that kept drawing me back, again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have this idea that Haiti chooses you,\u201d echoes photographer Maggie Steber, who first visited the country 35 years ago. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want you there, she will do everything in her power to make you run screaming for the next plane out of there. But if she likes you, if she recognizes in you a kindred spirit, she doesn\u2019t let you go and she wrings your heart out every day. She uses you up.\u201d Steber\u2019s first experience with Haiti came when she moved to New York after living in Africa; she was missing living abroad and Sipa\u2019s director G\u00f6k\u015fin Sipahio\u011flu suggested that Haiti might satisfy that craving. She arrived just when President Jean-Claude Duvalier fell in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\u201cThen, everything exploded. It was thrilling. It was exciting. There was so much happening,\u201d she recalls. \u201cFor the first time, people could really speak their mind. It was a country finally letting go after taking this deep breath. To me, that\u2019s when the story really started to unfold. That\u2019s when I was spellbound by it.\u201d\n\nWhen Bruce Gilden first landed in Haiti in 1984, he rented a car with his first wife and, as he was driving to the hotel, he turned to her and said: \u201cWhere have I been my whole life?\u201d Since then, Gilden has made 22 visits to the country. \u201cEvery time I\u2019d go, I\u2019d find something else to photograph,\u201d he says. The stunning light hooked him first, but the reason he returned so often was all about the people. \u201cThey love me and I love them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are my people.\u201d\n\nTogether, these photographers and many of their contemporaries have shot, published and exhibited thousands of images of Haiti\u2014many of them with the stated goal of contributing to the dialogue about this \u201ccomplicated country that has had such a difficult and tragic history,\u201d says Webb. And yet, five years after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake destroyed large parts of Haiti and brought unprecedented attention to the country with billions of dollars of aid pledged and hundreds of NGOs setting up operations there, the situation remains grim, calling into question the photographers\u2019 roles.\n\nSee how Haitian photographer Daniel Morel, one of the first photographers on the scene, covered the 2010 earthquake.\n\nThe deep connection many photographers feel when they first visit Haiti battles against the frustration many of them feel for a country that doesn\u2019t seem to be able to escape its cruel fate.\n\n\u201cI do feel a frustration because every time Haitians try to take a step forward, something happens that sends them back two steps,\u201d Steber tells TIME. \u201cI think it\u2019s frustrating for a lot of photographers.\u201d For the Miami-based photographer, Haiti\u2019s troubled situation can be traced back to the country\u2019s slave revolt in the early 1800s. \u201cHaiti had the only successful slave uprising at a time when the whole world\u2019s economy was rotating around slaves, so the world turned its back on Haiti,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a way, Haiti seems to have been punished by fate.\u201d\n\nIn the last five years, the number of photographers visiting the small Caribbean country has surged, coinciding with the flock of NGOs pledging to help Haitians recover from the earthquake. While the organizations \u201care absolutely vital in moments of crisis or natural disaster,\u201d says Institute photographer Paolo Woods, the situation in 2015 tends to show that in the long-term, NGOs\u2019 impact on the country remains ambiguous. \u201cI\u2019m often asked what\u2019s the difference between before and after the earthquake,\u201d Gilden adds. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. Haiti is poor and nobody cares.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a problem that hits home with photographers too. Though their goal is not the same as NGOs\u2019, the nation\u2019s poverty is ostensibly on display in their work, and they wrestle with how to show that world without harming the people in it. Photography that is not carefully considered can contribute, at times, to the reinforcement of stereotypes frequently applied to developing countries across the globe, from Africa to Latin America to Asia.\n\n\u201cAs photographers, we tend to go to places with our eyes and brains already full of images, and very often, unfortunately, we try to confirm those images,\u201d says Paolo Woods, who moved to Haiti five years ago to work on his book State. The photographer doesn\u2019t deny that Haiti is crippled by its unstable political situation and deep-rooted poverty, but, he says, that\u2019s only one side of the story. \u201cWhen you look at images from Haiti, you get this impression of a country that\u2019s very far away from what it actually is,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was just a matter of looking around [to find other stories to tell.]\u201d\n\nWoods only had to look around his hotel, where he stayed during his first month in Haiti, to find his story\u2014one that centers on Haiti\u2019s rich, upper-class population. \u201cIt was in December 2010, and we were getting close to the one-year anniversary of the earthquake, so a lot of journalists had come back to Haiti to do a story,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time, I was still living in a hotel in Port-au-Prince where a lot of media people gathered. What astonished me was that in this nice hotel, with working wifi and a swimming pool, you\u2019d have all these photographers getting on motorbikes in the morning to go to Cit\u00e9 Soleil [one of the country\u2019s poorest slums], take hundreds of images, and then come back to the hotel without ever looking at anything else.\u201d\n\nIn the same hotel, in its lobby, restaurant and swimming pool, rich Haitians would come to wine and dine. \u201cI thought this was interesting,\u201d says Woods. \u201cWho are these people? How did they make their money? How do they spend it? That became one of the multiple stories that built my book State.\u201d\n\nIn his photographs, Gilden has tried to steer clear of the conflicts and the political mess, focusing, instead, on the everyday life of Haitians, whom, he says, he cares deeply about. Yet, his goal was never to change their lives. \u201cI know [photographers] can\u2019t change the world. If [we could], things would not be the same as they were 10 years ago, 20 years ago or 50 years ago.\u201d\n\nSome photographers\u2014Steber and Woods included\u2014have started looking for ways to give back to Haitians, often through photographic workshops. \u201cI teach photography with the goal of encouraging education and to empower Haitians,\u201d says Steber. \u201cWe leave the cameras behind and we come back to teach them again and again. It\u2019s about training them to re-seize their country, to appreciate it and to see the possibilities for themselves.\u201d\n\nFor Woods, it\u2019s also a way to allow Haiti to be defined, photographically, by its own people. \u201cI often get calls from NGOs, and I always try to refer them to Haitian photographers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes a lot more sense. I think a country is healthy when its own citizens can tell its story.\u201d\n\nCertainly, Haiti, which is just a two-hour, $200 flight away from Florida, will continue to charm, attract and inspire photographers to produce \u201csignificant and deeply committed work, ranging from classical photojournalism to highly interpretive photography,\u201d says Webb. And not just because \u201cthe country is poor, or has horrific political violence,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is something about the intense sense of life intertwined with the perpetual presence of death that courses through the society; something about the vibrancy of the people alongside the tragedy of their circumstances; something about a kind of beauty that co-exists with pain and sorrow. Trying to somehow come to terms with such paradoxes may well be a clue as to why the country has inspired\u2014and continues to inspire\u2014photographers as well as writers.\u201d\n\nOlivier Laurent is the editor of TIME LightBox.

It literally envelopes and pampers every part of my being, soothing whatever muscles or nerves that may have been stressed throughout the day.)\n\nInventive and exclusive cocktails from new friends like Oldy help too.\n\nMore than anything else, though, I\u2019m always struck by the great lengths that the Marriott Port-au-Prince goes to bring the best aspects of the authentic Haitian experience in through those same magical front doors for guests to enjoy.\n\nYou taste it in the cuisine at the fabulous on-site La Sirene Restaurant. Chefs here go beyond the few cursory local dishes you might find on restaurant menus in similarly styled U.S.-flagged city hotels in other parts of the Caribbean. Soup Joumou, Beef Kibby, Griot, Lambi Creole \u2013 the local culinary delights at La Sirene are worth stopping in and savoring, whether you\u2019re staying here or not.\n\nYou also see and experience the best of authentic Haiti in the expansive and exceptional art collection at the Marriott Port-au-Prince. Expertly curated by Philippe Dodard, a renowned Haitian artisan whose work inspired Donna Karan\u2019s Spring 2012 collection, the hotel\u2019s treasure trove of art celebrates the works of 22 different local artists.\n\nThe works are moving, inventive, and uniquely Haitian, oftentimes employing upcycled materials (like the metal used here) to create indelible representations of Haitian history, culture, daily life, and national pride. I routinely spend a portion of each stay here simply strolling around and enjoying the art, always seeing and discovering something new; sometimes about the property, sometimes about myself, always about how special Haiti really is.\n\nNot content to simply showcase the wonders of Haiti, the Marriott Port-au-Prince was also specially designed to help preserve the country\u2019s natural resources.\n\nFully 60% of the hotel\u2019s hot water demands are met by thermo solar panels stretching across the roof. A one-megawatt solar farm located nearby further minimizes the hotel\u2019s carbon footprint, a big deal in a burgeoning city largely choked most afternoons by excessive auto emissions and the smoke that comes from cooking with coal (the most common cooking fuel in Haiti).\n\nYou\u2019d never know of the smoke or the general chaos in the surrounding streets while sitting poolside at the Marriott Port-au-Prince, though\u2026\n\nPeace, calm, and sweet serenity in sophisticated surroundings that speak to the magic of Haiti\u2019s past and the great potential of her future \u2013 indeed, the Marriott Port-au-Prince is anything but ordinary.\n\nFor reservations and more information, visit the Marriott Port-au-Prince online.\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nRelated Posts"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/Port-au-Prince", "page_content": "Port-au-Prince, capital, chief port, and commercial centre of the West Indian republic of Haiti. It is situated on a magnificent bay at the apex of the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve (Gona\u00efves), which is protected from the open sea by the island of La Gon\u00e2ve. The city was laid out in a grid pattern in 1749 by the French and called L\u2019H\u00f4pital. It has suffered frequently from fires, civil strife, and earthquakes. Quakes in 1751 and 1770 destroyed much of the city. In January 2010 another powerful earthquake, of magnitude 7.0, struck; its epicentre was southwest of the city, and it devastated Port-au-Prince and the surrounding region. Hundreds of thousands were killed or injured, and large swathes of the city were reduced to rubble.\n\nPort-au-Prince replaced Cap-Ha\u00eftien as the capital of the old French colony Saint-Domingue in 1770 and was retained as the capital of the newly independent country of Haiti in 1804. In 1807 its port was opened to foreign commerce. Sanitary conditions were improved during U.S. occupation (1915\u201334). The city\u2019s bicentennial was commemorated in 1949 by an international exposition, the site of which is a palm-fronted promenade, now neglected and run-down.\n\nBritannica Quiz 39 of the Most Challenging World Capitals Across History\n\nUnemployment is extremely high. There are some foreign-owned factories and assembly plants in the vicinity of the airport, but, otherwise, employment is mostly to be found in the informal sector, in such activities as cooking, shelling peanuts, and selling paintings and other handicrafts. There is air service to the United States, Canada, and France as well as to other Caribbean islands; however, the area surrounding the capital\u2019s international airport has been the site of violence, some of it caused by United Nations peacekeeping force conflicts with armed gang members. The level of tourism fluctuates with political conditions and has been in decline since the civil unrest and economic crisis of the 1980s. Tourism was also affected by the AIDS scare of the early 1980s, in which Haiti was erroneously identified as the place of origin for the disease. By the late 1980s AIDS researchers had found that tourists had brought the disease to Haiti in the 1970s, though extreme poverty and lack of education still contribute to the spread of HIV in Port-au-Prince and throughout Haiti.\n\nThe Place du Champ-de-Mars\u2014the site of a number of historically notable structures in the centre of the city\u2014was hit hard by the 2010 earthquake. The National Palace (rebuilt in 1918) collapsed. Other notable landmarks include the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the adjacent colonial cathedral, both of which also collapsed in the 2010 earthquake, and the National Archives, National Library, and National Museum.\n\nPort-au-Prince is the centre of the political and intellectual life of the country and is the seat of the State University of Haiti (established in 1920). A traditionally picturesque site has been the brash and bustling Iron Market, with its mostly female vendors. Recreation for the privileged centres around European-style social clubs, but the house of the local voodoo priest is still the heart of the urban poor community.\n\nMost of the Haitian elite (nearly all mulatto or nonblacks) live in the suburb of P\u00e9tionville in the 1,000\u20131,500-foot- (300\u2013450-metre-) high hills southeast of Port-au-Prince. Haiti\u2019s small but politically important Black middle class is also concentrated around Port-au-Prince. Squalor and neglect surround most of the Black urban working class even more than it does the subsistence farmer, and constant migration from the countryside continues to exacerbate their misery. Slums such as Cit\u00e9 Soleil are among the largest and most deprived in the Americas. Pop.

When he arrived, he observed the sprawling amounts of local art\u2014adorning everything from walls and sidewalks to the local taxi buses called \"tap-taps.\" The Indigenist movement was in full swing in Haiti; local artists were making both a name for themselves in the country and helping establish the nation's identity as separate from the United States' occupation through the art they created.\n\nAt the time, though, Haitian artists hadn\u2019t considered that they could make money from their art. The small nation didn't even have its own art museum yet, so Peters opened Le Centre d'Art, an art gallery and school to encourage and promote local untrained artists, in 1944. Artists already popular in Haiti, including Hector Hyppolite, the Voodoo artist colloquially known as the \"grandfather of Haitian art,\" made their way to the center and took up residence there; the center provided government-funded equipment and materials many artists couldn't afford.\n\nLocally, the work produced at the center became well known, bringing in more students, most of whom were low-income locals. The government paid salaries to all the teachers, among them Peters and other accomplished Haitian artists of the time. And internationally, Haitian art took hold thanks to tourists visiting the small nation, spreading the word and bringing work back home. New York's Museum of Modern Art was the first major museum to acquire a piece of Haitian art: Ren\u00e9 Vincent\u2019s 1940 painting Le combat des coqs (Cock Fight). The museum bought it in 1944 through Peters' work as an art dealer in Haiti; the purchase was made just before he opened the center. One of the first major Haitian art collectors was U.S. poet Selden Rodman. Since then, international leaders and celebrities, including the Kennedys (who collected paintings by Prefete Duffaut) and the Clintons (who collect Haitian paintings and metalwork), and thousands of others have collected Haitian art created by Laurent Casimir, Jean-Ren\u00e9 J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Edouard Duval-Carri\u00e9, Hector Hyppolite, Philom\u00e9 Obin, and more.\n\nWhen a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, museums, cathedrals, art galleries, even Le Centre d'Art crumbled to the ground, destroying valuable art. Haitians began to work around the rubble, rebuilding and even creating art pieces out of crumbled walls. (An exhibition called \"P\u00d2TOPRENS: The Urban Artists of Port-au-Prince\" is currently on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami, highlighting a group of artists that make sculptures out of earthquake debris.) The Smithsonian Institution offered assistance as well, by way of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, which not only rescued Haitian artworks, but also helped to rebuild Le Centre d'Art.\n\nNow, nearly a decade later, the art scene is thriving, particularly in Port-au-Prince, just 16 miles west of the historic quake's epicenter. According to Lorraine Mangones, the executive director of FOKAL, Haiti\u2019s main cultural and educational foundation, Le Centre d'Art recently received an investment to construct a new art center and next year will begin having Caribbean artists-in-residence. Plus, repairs are underway to reopen the Museum of Haitian Art of St. Pierre College, which had about 9,000 visitors per year before the earthquake; a single room has reopened to display prized Haitian art for now.\n\nThese six spots in the capital area will show you the best of Haitian art.\n\nLe Centre d\u2019Art\n\nLe Centre d\u2019Art was the first art gallery in Haiti, opening more than 70 years ago as an art school and display place for art of all types. When the earthquake hit in 2010, the building was completely destroyed. An art school and gallery, with sculptures throughout the grounds, took its place in 2014, and with the Smithsonian's help, the school was able to save more than 5,000 pieces of art. Le Centre d\u2019Art has a close relationship with the Louvre as well, and even sent its archivists to be trained at the French institution. The Louvre maintains a collection assessment of the artwork at Le Centre d'Art and runs a three-year internship program in conjunction with the school to continue the assessment and help with communications.\n\nGalerie Monnin\n\nA Swiss couple\u2014Freda and Roger Monnin, who actively participated in the Port-au-Prince art scene since they settled in the city in 1947\u2014opened Galerie Monnin downtown with European art in 1956. The gallery began to build a collection of sacred voodoo art in the late 60s, when the second generation signed on to help run the business. Since then, the gallery has opened in a new location in P\u00e9tionville and runs an art school as well. The collection has grown to include a consistent high-end exhibition of voodoo art, in addition to showcasing both Haitian art and artwork from artists-in-residence, including Greek painter Lilika Papagrigoriou and British artist Sally Leonard.\n\nGalerie D\u2019Art Nader\n\nThis isn\u2019t only the largest art gallery in the Caribbean, but also one of the largest Haitian art collections in the world. The Galerie D\u2019Art Nader in P\u00e9tionville is owned by Georges Nader, Jr., who took over when his father, Georges S. Nader, retired as an art dealer. Nader the elder opened the original gallery in downtown Port-au-Prince in 1966, but it crumbled with the earthquake. Everything that could be salvaged (about 3,000 paintings, 1,800 of them damaged, of nearly 15,000) moved to the P\u00e9tionville location. Now the gallery's collection has more than 17,000 pieces of mostly modern art from the 1940s on. The family is planning to build a national art museum where they will exhibit 1,000 hand-picked pieces, painted by the most renowned Haitian artists\u2014though as of yet the art list and timeline are still undisclosed.\n\nEl-Saieh Gallery\n\nThis gallery was originally opened by Issa el Saieh, a prominent musician that introduced big band music to Haiti in the 1940s and '50s. In the 1960s, el Saieh was imprisoned by Haitian president Papa Doc\u2019s regime; according to his son\u2014who runs the gallery now\u2014el Saieh was held in a cell for 22 days without the ability to stand up straight or sit down fully. Once he was released (the exact reason behind his imprisonment is unclear), he opened El-Saieh Gallery, which was the second art gallery to open in the country. It instantly became a gathering space for the artistic luminaries of the time. Now, the gallery overlooks the port and boasts a large cross-section of traditional and modern Haitian art, including Vodoo sculpture by local woodcarver and artist Guyodo and colorful paintings by Andr\u00e9 Normil, an influential Haitian artist who created depictions of Noah's Ark, paradise and Carnival.\n\nGhetto Biennale\n\nThis isn\u2019t an art gallery, but rather an event. Since 2009, the Ghetto Biennale has run every two years, hosted by the artists collective Atis Rezistans. The next installment is this year, from November 29 to December 20, with works focusing on the Haitian Revolution. The Biennale is a chance for urban untrained artists to showcase the artwork they\u2019ve created, and for local artists to collaborate with international ones\u2014for example, for the 2017 Biennale, local artist Love Leonce worked together with Chicago-based artist and curator Sabrina Greig on a collaborative printmaking workshop for locals and visitors. Other collaborations have included a California-based tattoo artist creating tattoos drawn by local artists, a music composition by British musician Bill Drummond performed by 100 local Haitians, and two European artists enlisting the help of Port-au-Prince residents to create a building from trash. The event is held in two different neighborhoods, Lakou Cheri and Ghetto Leanne. Themes for the event revolve around migration and freedom, and past participants have included filmmakers, lecturers, musicians, writers, architects, photographers and other artists.\n\nMarriott Port-au-Prince\n\nHotels throughout Port-au-Prince often tend to double as art galleries, with local artists creating many of the pieces on display. The Marriott Port-au-Prince was one of the first. The hotel hired local artist and art curator Philippe Dodard to stock the property with art. \u201cI took art from both modern artists in Haiti and street artists,\u201d says Dodard. \u201cThe art scene suffered after the earthquake, but it allowed street art to rise up again. Now I\u2019m concerned that Haiti will be rebuilt with large buildings with no character reflecting Haitian culture.\u201d For his part, he\u2019s doing his best to avoid that fate with the Marriott. Pieces on display include everything from decorated vases and wall tiles to voodoo flags and fiber art. Dodard himself designed the massive iron panels in the lobby.\n\nGet the latest Travel & Culture stories in your inbox."}], "Philippe Dodard is an artist, sculptor, and painter.": [{"url": "https://expressionsgaleriedart.com/artist/philippe-dodard/", "page_content": "Biography\n\nPhilippe Dodard (born 1954) is a Haitian graphic artist and painter.

At the age of 12, he obtained his first prize in drawing at the Junior Seminary of Coll\u00e8ge St-Martial in 1966.\n\nHis parents, Georgette B and \u00c9tienne L Dodard, introduced him to painting and drawing at an early age. At the age of 15, he joined the \u201cPoto Mitan\u201d, a free art school directed by Jean Claude \u201cTiga\u201d Garoute, Patrick Vilaire, and Wilfrid \u201cFrido\u201d Casimir. They were all three famous painters of the twentieth century in the Haitian artistic sector.\n\nA brilliant start to a career\n\nAlthough he began painting at a very early age, his career only really took off in 1981. Thanks to the support of Mich\u00e8le Frisch (director of the MUPANAH at the time), the Marassa gallery in P\u00e9tion-Ville hosted his first major exhibition. An exhibition that takes place around the theme \u201cAquatism\u201d. And since then, his success has been undeniable.\n\nHis paintings, exhibited in many museums abroad, will be the subject of aesthetic debates on the modernity of Haitian contemporary art. He immediately attracted the attention of many art critics, notably in Haiti, Brazil, France, the United States, and the Caribbean.\n\nHis itinerary\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that he was an accountant by training. After these studies, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts (now called ENARTS), then the National School of Bordeaux, to study plastic arts. He ended up specializing in educational graphics.\n\nOn his return from Bordeaux, he was appointed head of the graphic department of the Deschamps publishing house. For 10 years, he was the artistic director of the ironwork company \u201cMulti-ad\u201d. This company was created in collaboration with Monique Gard\u00e8re.\n\nIn the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, he studied at the Kripalu yoga center. This approach will propel him towards the learning of the being, the spiritual, and the samurai and martial arts. He was even led to the practice of Kundo. He then studied the science of Reiki (initiation to alternative medicine).\n\nPhilippe Dodard, current director of the National Superior School of Art (ENARTS), intends to fulfill the mission that this entity has given itself since its creation in the 1980s: to maintain the reputation of the Haitian culture and the influence of its art.\n\n\u201c\u2026Improve the quality of training, upgrade the various departments and offer students the best opportunities to promote the development of their talents, refound the school in perdition, renovate the foundry (to become again at the service of the Haitian nation) and restore the monument of the Indian are, among others, the objectives set,\u201d he noted in an interview with the local newspaper.\n\nCommitted artist and entrepreneur\n\nThe cultural advisor for Elisabeth D. Pr\u00e9val (former First Lady of the Republic of Haiti), he will install on the Place Saint-Pierre and the Champ de Mars \u201cPlas timoun\u201d, an art therapy center that focuses on rehabilitating street children through the arts.\n\nAs head of the ironworks site in the reconstruction project of the iron market, destroyed in the January 12 earthquake, he is saving the pride of Port-au-Prince, this historic site classified as a national heritage. This unique reconstruction was inaugurated in January 2011. \u201cIt was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of ironwork and design,\u201d says Dodard.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Dimitry and Evelyne Craan on this restoration project, I had the pleasure of training many workers. And I am happy that the project has achieved its triple dimension: to give back, through citizen involvement, life to the city; to succeed in this challenge of human management (about 400 workers were at work) and to put in place one of the symbolic monuments of the identity of Port-au-Prince, much visited by tourists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cDodard of the Year\u201d prize is awarded each year to a personality of the artistic milieu who has distinguished himself or herself in an artistic or sporting field. The first winner, Philippe Dodard recalls, was Madeline Paill\u00e8re, an art critic.\n\nFranck\u00e9tienne (painter and writer), Aubelin Jolicoeur and Nancy Roc (journalists), Lionnel Abelard (Karateka), Beethova Obas (musician), the former Haitian president Michel Martelly, Edwidge Danticat, more recently, have all been awarded.\n\nDodard\u2019s work : criticism\n\nHis work sparked a debate in 2006 on the issue of Haitian art and modernism, drawing on such notables as Michel Philippe Lelebourg, Michel Frisch, Franketienne, Bob Corbett, Greg Thomas, Babacard Embou, Nkil Negou, and Legrace Benson. A large-scale exhibition of his work at the Broward Library Museum in 2006 led to the publication of the book: Dodard\u2019s Work.\n\n\u201cThis book demystifies Picasso and his authority in contemporary art. The contributors look at my African, Native American, and European-inspired work. This document reflects my very spiritual bent for art, my interest in voodoo.\u201d he says. His paintings, acrylics on fabric reflect Tiga\u2019s influence, holding the \u201cArtistic Rotation\u201d method (which \u201cPotan Mitan\u201d advocated) that goes through four stages: art, craft, technicality, and science.\n\n\u201cThe use by an artist of sensitive media: earth, clay, ceramics, paper and all disciplines of art is a source of enrichment and can push his creative sense,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nIn short\n\nWith his captivating, deep, and rebellious style, he has made his mark on the postmodern art scene. His art has given soul to the Spring \u2013 2012 collection (inspired by the painter\u2019s black and white inks) of American fashion designer Donna Karan. The two will collaborate to launch a project to develop Haitian handicrafts to bring them to an international level.\n\nIn collaboration with Mich\u00e8le Frish and Roger Jaar, he created the company \u201cJivan\u201d for the collection of jewelry inspired by Haitian culture. In 1980, he received a Rotary International Foundation grant, which allowed him to continue his work.\n\nPhilippe Dodard has certainly accomplished more than many of his contemporaries. A proven entrepreneur, his worth is now estimated at over $102 million.\n\nConsidered an ace of Haitian painting, Philipe Dodard knew how to mark his time.
