The talented guard was selected by the World Champion Detroit Pistons in the second round with the 54th pick. Detroit just happens to be Paulding's home town. Paulding will also join former Missouri Associate Head Coach and current Pistons' Vice President of Basketball Operations John Hammond in the ranks of the Mizzou basketball family who have reached the NBA.\n\n\"Detroit is a great team and organization and I want to contribute in any way I can,\" Paulding said from his home in Detroit. \"It has always been a dream to play in my home town with the Pistons and be apart of their great tradition. It's a really good opportunity and I am looking forward to proving myself in the coming months.\"\n\nPaulding is the third player to be drafted to the NBA during head coach Quin Snyder's five-year tenure at Mizzou. Keyon Dooling was the 10th pick in the 2000 draft by the Orlando Magic (who then traded Dooling to the Los Angeles Clippers the same night) and Kareem Rush was the 20th pick in the 2002 draft by the Toronto Raptors (who then traded Rush to the Los Angeles Lakers on the night of the draft).\n\n\"We are very excited for Rickey and I think he has a good chance to be successful in Detroit,\" Missouri Head Coach Quin Snyder said. \"He's entering a great situation and he will be around a lot of familiar faces in his home town. Rickey needs to attack this chance to play at the next level with the same competitive fire he has shown during his time at Mizzou.\"\n\nPaulding wrapped up a tremendous career at Mizzou with a crowning achievement in May as he received his degree. He finished his basketball career as the eighth leading scorer in Mizzou history (1,673 points) and finished fifth in three point field goals made with 187. Paulding seemed to especially love NCAA Tournament time, as he finished his career as Mizzou's all-time leader in points scored in the tourney with 145 (18.1 per game) in eight games played. The two-time second team All-Big 12 selection was one of six players from Big 12 Conference schools taken in the draft."}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Ricky-Paulding/Summary/418", "page_content": "The Improbable, Inevitable Miami Heat by John Wilmes It was not foreseeable Miami would defeat the most talented teams in the sport, flaring an unusual ability to find and corner the frightened child within some of the NBA's biggest stars.\n\nNBA Draft Report: Cason Wallace Of Kentucky by Zachary Cohen Cason Wallace is a plus defender with an NBA ready jumper that can immediately help a lot of basketball teams, and he's going to be a chameleon in the league when it comes to fit.\n\nFor The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10076308-pistons-mocked-by-twitter-after-falling-to-no-5-pick-in-2023-nba-draft-lottery", "page_content": "Christian Liewig - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe ping pong balls don't care about the NBA standings.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons finished with the league's worst record at 17-65, which seemingly put them in ideal position to land the No. 1 overall pick in Tuesday's NBA draft lottery.

That said, Pistons general manager Troy Weaver and Detroit's stakeholders are believed to be weighing all of their options, which means the draft's other potentially transformational stars are also in play -- as is trading the pick. What would a Pistons trade look like? What kind of haul could Detroit hope to receive in return? Our team of NBA experts offered some proposals for that scenario, breaking down the terms and the potential trade partners.\n\nA two-for-one special in H-Town\n\nCade Cunningham will likely be the No. 1 pick in the 2021 NBA draft, but which team will end up selecting him? Marc Lebryk-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: The No. 2 pick, the No. 24 pick, return of their protected 2022 first-round pick\n\nHouston Rockets receive: The No. 1 pick, the No. 37 pick\n\nKevin Pelton: Although we've seen teams move up from No. 3 to No. 1, there has never been a swap of the top two picks in the same NBA draft like I'm proposing here. Part of the issue, I'm sure, is agreeing to the right compensation. After all, if the Pistons really prefer Jalen Green (or Evan Mobley) while the Rockets think Texas native Cunningham is the clear top prospect, why move up at all? Houston would in that scenario assure Detroit doesn't trade the pick to someone else, and I think there's a reasonable package to be found.\n\nMy trade would start by giving the Pistons back the protected first-round pick (from this year, when it didn't convey, anywhere out to 2027) they sent to the Rockets last year to get the No. 16 pick and draft Isaiah Stewart. Based on the protections, this will probably be a non-lottery pick, so Detroit could reasonably ask for a bit more. Swapping the second of Houston's back-to-back picks later in the first round for the Pistons' top second-round pick manages to balance out where both teams are drafting after the top two.\n\nGolden State goes big for No. 1?\n\nCould James Wiseman be the new man in the middle for Detroit next season? Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: James Wiseman, No. 7, No. 14 and 2022 unprotected first\n\nGolden State Warriors receive: The No. 1 pick, No. 37, Rodney McGruder and Jahlil Okafor\n\nBobby Marks: This is a type of trade that the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions would make the night of the NFL draft, not the Pistons and Warriors in late July. The cost to move up to No. 1 is rich for the Warriors. Last year's no. 2 pick, Wiseman, both lottery selections (7 and 14) and an unprotected 2022 first are sent to Detroit. The Warriors are pushing all their draft assets to the middle of the table (an unprecedented four first-round picks if you include Wiseman) with the belief that the selection of Cunningham fits the roster timeline of Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. The thought of trading out of the top spot is not an easy decision for Detroit, especially with the ability to select between Cunningham, Green, Mobley and Jalen Suggs. However, the temptation to add last year's second pick in Wiseman, two potential starters and a future asset is an offer that Pistons GM Weaver could not turn down.\n\nThis trade can be done the night of the draft, but because Wiseman has an $8.7 million cap hit and the Pistons do not have a big enough trade exception to take on his salary, Detroit will need to add the salaries of Rodney McGruder and Jahlil Okafor. Because McGruder's contract for 2021-22 is non-guaranteed, the Pistons will need to protect the full amount to make the money work. Okafor has an expiring $2.1 million salary for next season. Both first-round picks the Warriors are sending out do not have trade value as it relates to outgoing salary.\n\nSGA to Motown?\n\nDoes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander fit into the Thunder's rebuilding plan? Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: The No. 6 pick, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nOklahoma City Thunder receive: The No. 1 pick\n\nTim Bontemps: The Thunder have put themselves in a situation in which Gilgeous-Alexander, one of the better young guards in the NBA, doesn't quite fit with their timeline, given they have a thousand picks in the future and the young players they have are far from their potential future peaks. That means they can go in one of two directions: try to speed up the talent acquisition process around SGA, or use him to try to find talent that fits the organization's timeline.\n\nIn this situation, Oklahoma City would take the latter path, using the sixth pick and Gilgeous-Alexander to move up to the top spot in the draft -- where the Thunder could then take Cunningham. Detroit, meanwhile, would still get a high lottery pick to continue its rebuilding process, while also getting SGA to become the focal point of the team's rebuild under Weaver. He'd be a great fit alongside breakout rookies Saddiq Bey and Stewart and would fit nicely alongside last year's No. 7 overall pick, Killian Hayes, who would have some of the playmaking burden taken off of him as a result.\n\nCavs gets a franchise-changing No. 1 pick, again\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: The No. 3 pick, Darius Garland\n\nCleveland Cavaliers receive: The No. 1 pick, McGruder and Okafor\n\nAndre Snellings: The Pistons would be adding two young cornerstones to build around. Garland, the fifth pick in the 2019 draft, is fresh off a breakout sophomore campaign and is still only 21 years old. He is a strong floor general who can score and might be able to play next to the 6-foot-5 Hayes as the nucleus of their backcourt of the future. And with the third pick, the Pistons would still be assured of getting one of the elite prospects in this draft in Mobley or Green as potentially their next franchise centerpiece.\n\nThe Cavaliers, meanwhile, would be able to bring in Cunningham as an uber-talented 6-foot-8 point forward to build their team around, a scenario that seemed to work out well for them previously. Cunningham's skill set would seem to mesh perfectly with Collin Sexton, who is proving to be one of the better young scorers in the NBA and also has some lead guard ability to take some of the ballhandling pressure off Cunningham. This trade would also require McGruder's non-guaranteed contract for 2021-22 to be protected at the full amount to make the money work, along with Okafor's expiring deal.\n\nPenny 2.0 to the Magic?\n\nCould Chuma Okeke be on the move ahead of the 2021 NBA draft? AP Photo/David Zalubowski\n\nDetroit Pistons receive: The No. 5 pick, the No. 8 pick, Chuma Okeke\n\nOrlando Magic receive: The No. 1 pick, Okafor\n\nJonathan Givony: The Magic consolidate three strong assets into the No. 1 pick in the draft, helping to find some hierarchy in their roster among their plethora of young players and hopefully landing a franchise player in Cunningham, who can bring it all together with his outstanding combination of size, defensive versatility, shot-making, ballhandling, passing and winning intangibles. Cunningham would be a natural fit at small forward alongside 2020 first-rounders Cole Anthony and R.J. Hampton, both of whom are scoring-minded guards, while also being able to seamlessly play in lineups with stalwarts Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Isaac. This trade is obviously a home run for the Magic.\n\nFor the Pistons, this probably makes less sense and is only logical if they are indeed not as high on Cunningham as many around the NBA suspect, particularly in terms of his fit with last year's No. 7 pick, Hayes, whose value could plummet even further if Detroit picks Cunningham to usurp him. Instead, the Pistons can look to take several swings at players with star power, such as Jonathan Kuminga or Suggs (one of whom will certainly be available at No. 5), along with a young guard such as James Bouknight, Keon Johnson or Josh Giddey -- whichever prospect Weaver is highest on. Adding a versatile 22-year-old in Okeke, who has already shown promise as a 3-and-D wing/forward, would bring value as well."}, {"url": "https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Pistons-top-pick-visits-Midland-7059880.php", "page_content": "Paulding, who starred at Detroit Renaissance High School, was the Pistons' draft pick back in June. The second-round pick hopes to help the Pistons win a second straight NBA title.\n\nBy Chris Marchand\n\n\n\nDaily News photos/DAN CHALK\n\nThe Detroit Pistons' top draft pick, Rickey Paulding, signs autographs at the end of the Pistons' basketball camp Thursday at Northwood University. About 165 youths attended the camp from Monday through Thursday.\n\nAs a youngster growing up in Highland Park, Rickey Paulding was a huge Detroit Pistons' fan. Now he'll get a chance to play with them.\n\nPaulding, who starred at Detroit Renaissance High School, was the Pistons' draft pick back in June. The second-round pick hopes to help the Pistons win a second straight NBA title.\n\n\"It feels good to be a Piston,\" Paulding said. \"It's something you always dream about. I'm very excited. I remember when they won their championships. I've always been a fan.\"\n\nPaulding was in Midland on Thursday as a guest speaker at the Pistons' annual youth basketball camp.\n\nAfter starring at Renaissance, Paulding was a standout at the University of Missouri. He led the Tigers to two NCAA Tournament appearances and holds the school record for most points in tournament play (145). His last appearance in a Missouri uniform came at Michigan where he and his Tigers lost in the first round of the NIT to the Wolverines.\n\nPaulding ranks ninth on Missouri's all-time scoring list with 1,673 points. He was a Big 12 Second Team pick in both his junior and senior seasons.\n\nPaulding's offensive prowess may be just what the Pistons need considering some times they have problems creating consistent offense.\n\n\"I think it's a pretty good system,\" Paulding said. \"They do have guys that can put the ball in the hole. I think I might want to focus on other things like playing defense first. If they need me to score, then I can do that.\"\n\nPaulding averaged 12.8 points in 131 career games at Missouri. As a junior, he scored 17.4 points per game. With a solid nucleus back, the Tigers were a preseason top 10 team. But a host of early-season losses, including a 71-67 home loss to Division 1 newcomer Belmont, left the Tigers out of the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\"You have to learn from situations like that,\" Paulding said. \"It was a tough situation to go through. We made it through it and it only made us stronger players as far as handling adversity.\"\n\nWhile in college, Paulding gained the reputation of stepping up his game against tough competition. As a sophomore, he was named to the NCAA Tournament West Region team after averaging 18.3 points.\n\nAs a sophomore, he scored a career-high 36 points against a Marquette team that reached the Final Four. In his junior year, he had 35 points against nationally ranked Oklahoma State.\n\nCampers wait in line to meet Rickey Paulding at the end of the Pistons' basketball camp Thursday at Northwood University.\n\nOn draft day, Paulding was the 54th overall pick. He watched as scores of high school players were drafted in the first round. Paulding was finally picked late in the second - and final - round.\n\n\"I didn't know where I was going to go,\" Paulding said. \"It was a little nerve-racking but it was also exciting. It was exciting just to have the opportunity to be drafted.\"\n\nThe Pistons have high hopes for Paulding, who still needs to make the team. He'll compete for a spot at shooting guard.\n\nPaulding and the rest of the Pistons open training camp in early October.\n\nThe Pistons are still basking in the benefits of winning an NBA title. Their camp in Midland this week drew a record 165 participants.\n\n\"We had a record year here,\" Pistons camp director Steve Moreland said. \"We've had unbelievable support from the community. Obviously we've built that over the past eight years. But the championship really helped us build a special camp here in Midland.\"\n\nAccording to Moreland, several of the participants in the camp drove upwards of 90 minutes each day for the camp.\n\n\"They came and played their hearts out,\" Moreland said. \"The sportsmanship and the competition all week long was just unbelievable.\""}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31689250/detroit-pistons-win-top-pick-2021-nba-draft-lottery-houston-rockets-get-no-2", "page_content": "The year 2021 has been big for Ben Wallace. First, he was named to the Hall of Fame. Then, Tuesday night, he was the good-luck charm for his former franchise, the Detroit Pistons, in the NBA's annual draft lottery.\n\nDetroit claimed the top spot in a loaded 2021 NBA draft, followed by the Houston Rockets, Cleveland Cavaliers and Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe rest of the top 10 includes Orlando; Oklahoma City; Golden State, which gets Minnesota's selection; Orlando, which gets Chicago's selection; Sacramento; and New Orleans.\n\nCharlotte, San Antonio, Indiana, and Golden State -- with its own selection -- round out the lottery picks. The Magic and Warriors each landed two picks in the lottery.\n\nDetroit, after taking three players in the first round of last year's draft -- Killian Hayes (seventh), Isaiah Stewart (16th) and Saddiq Bey (19th) -- will now get a chance to add a high-end talent to its mix. It will be the Pistons' first top-five selection since they took Darko Milicic second overall in 2003, and their third in the past 40 years. They also took Grant Hill third overall in 1994.\n\nDetroit has the top overall pick for the first time since drafting Hall of Fame center Bob Lanier out of St. Bonaventure in 1970.\n\n\"Obviously we get to add another wing player to the restoration process,\" said Pistons general manager Troy Weaver, who was hired to run Detroit's basketball operations last year. \"We're excited to be in this position. But it means that we've got a lot of work to do, and we're going to be diligent about it. But it always helps to be able to add the No. 1 pick.\"\n\nOklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham is projected by many to the be No. 1 overall pick. Sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski on Tuesday night that the plan for Cunningham will be to visit only one team before the draft: the Pistons.\n\nThe Rockets, after making the playoffs the past eight seasons, saw things go in an entirely different direction this season after trading James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets for a bevy of draft picks in January. But after finishing with the NBA's worst record, Houston got a bit of luck Tuesday, allowing it a chance to immediately begin to restock its coffers around center Christian Wood with an elite young talent.\n\nCleveland, after picking fifth the past two seasons, got a dose of lottery luck this time around. The Cavaliers hope to break back into the playoff mix in the Eastern Conference next season around whomever they pick to join young guards Collin Sexton and Darius Garland, forward Isaac Okoro and center Jarrett Allen.\n\nCavs general manager Koby Altman said he feels this draft has more quality at the top than in previous years, saying, \"Even beyond the top five, there could be potential All-Stars.\"\n\nIt was a miserable season for the Raptors, who saw what easily was the most successful stretch in franchise history -- seven straight playoff appearances, including the 2019 NBA title -- come to a screeching halt. Playing in Tampa, Florida, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors endured a stretch of close losses to begin the season, then a massive bout of COVID cases among players and coaches just as the team got itself back to .500 midway through, sinking its chances at a return to the postseason.\n\nTuesday night, however, the Raptors got some reward for that ugly season as they leaped into the top four for a chance to add a premium young player to a team that is ready to win right now around its core of guard Fred VanVleet and forwards Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby.\n\nThe Magic shifted into rebuilding mode this year, trading Nikola Vucevic to Chicago, Evan Fournier to Boston and Aaron Gordon to Denver. Now, they will get two cracks at adding young talent to their core thanks to their own pick, the fifth overall selection, and that of the Bulls, which they got as a result of the Vucevic trade when it didn't jump into the top four selections.\n\nNo team had more to gain in this draft than Oklahoma City. The Thunder were the only team that had a chance to land two top-five selections if they received Houston's pick, which would have happened if the Rockets didn't move up in the draft.\n\nUltimately, Houston got lucky, leaving the Thunder with their own pick -- sixth overall -- in addition to Boston's 16th overall selection, which they picked up in last week's trade that sent Al Horford back to the Celtics for Kemba Walker, and Miami's 18th overall selection, as they continue to rebuild around emerging star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nThe Timberwolves knew they would be giving up their pick either this year -- if they stayed outside the top three picks -- or an unprotected pick next season if they did not.\n\nThey wound up paying that debt this season, meaning Golden State will have two lottery picks this year -- the seventh overall selection from Minnesota, plus its own pick at 14th overall. Along with center James Wiseman, last year's second overall selection, the Warriors will hope they can either get a couple of players to help build a long-term bridge to a future beyond Golden State's Big Three of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, or potentially give them the ammunition to make immediate upgrades after missing the playoffs the past two seasons.\n\nWarriors general manager Bob Myers said he believes Curry, Thompson and Green would be comfortable with the possibility of adding two rookies to the roster, citing former Warriors forward Harrison Barnes' contributions as a rookie after being the team's seventh pick in 2012.\n\n\"I hope they trust that we have a sense of what we are doing. ... We'll look at it. They will be involved. They will, I'm sure, weigh in on their thoughts and we'll welcome those, we always do, and if there's something that makes sense for them and for us, we'll do it,\" Myers said. \"But again, it depends. You don't really know what those picks are worth, at least trade-wise, until it gets probably at least a week out, maybe two from the draft, and if we can do so, we will, and hopefully those guys will help us whoever we end up with.\"\n\nEvery year, the teams that jump into the top four feel lucky on lottery night. This year, however, that feeling will only be intensified by the top-end talent available in this draft. With just over a month before the July 29 draft, the consensus top four players available, in some order, are Cunningham, Gonzaga guard Jalen Suggs, USC big man Evan Mobley and guard Jalen Green, who was an inaugural member of the NBA's G League Ignite program.\n\nThe combination of that talent, as well as the fact that three picks within the top eight were up for grabs due to prior trades, made this year's lottery one of the most anticipated in years.\n\n\"We'll look at everything,\" Weaver said when asked how many options Detroit will look at for the top pick. \"We'll uncover every stone and exhaust it and put ourselves in the best position to make the right choice for the Pistons.\"\n\nTwenty percent of the league found itself on pins and needles entering Tuesday night's festivities as a result of those prior deals. The Rockets, because of the Russell Westbrook trade with Oklahoma City two years ago, would either keep their pick if it fell within the top four or send the fifth pick in the draft to the Thunder. The Bulls, meanwhile, either would keep their pick if it fell in the top four or give up a mid-lottery pick to the Orlando Magic after trading for center Vucevic at this year's trade deadline. And the Timberwolves would either keep their pick if it landed in the top three -- or an unprotected pick next year -- because of the Russell trade.\n\nUltimately, it was Houston, Orlando and Golden State that managed to have things break their way Tuesday night. As a result, six teams -- Oklahoma City (3), Houston (3), Golden State (2), Orlando (2) and New York (2) -- have control over 12 of the 30 first-round picks in this year's draft."}, {"url": "https://www.wikizero.com/en/Rickey_Paulding", "page_content": "From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia\n\nAmerican professional basketball player (born 1982)\n\nRickey Paulding (born October 23, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player.
