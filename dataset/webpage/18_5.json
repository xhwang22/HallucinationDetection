{"Nigel Milsom has been a finalist in the Wynne Prize, the Blake Prize, and the Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/17/archibald-prize-2015-exhibition-review", "page_content": "There are always upsets and curveballs in the Archibald prize. Most of the time, the art world debate concerns itself with the perennial questions of deserving winners or overlooked finalists or cruel exclusions. But it\u2019s not often a genuine surprise comes along, as with Nigel Milsom, who has won the 2015 prize for his portrait of criminal barrister Charles Waterstreet.\n\nTo catch you up on their joint story, Milsom was jailed for an armed robbery committed shortly after he won the Sulman prize in 2012. Waterstreet defended Milsom and the artist was eventually released in 2014. While in jail, Milsom also won the 2013 Doug Moran prize. His return to the Art Gallery of New South Wales as the winner of the $100,000 Archibald isn\u2019t so much a tale of personal redemption for Milsom, but the success story of an incredibly talented artist.\n\nThe crop of finalists for 2015 was eclectic, with a few very strong contenders for winner. Milsom\u2019s work, easily the largest and most commanding picture with the sepulchral figure of Waterstreet looming from the dark shadows like Nosfertau, towers over the rest of the works, including Mitch Cairns\u2019s more modest portrait of artist Peter Powditch, hung alongside Milsom\u2019s work and awarded the runner-up sticker of \u201chighly commended\u201d by the gallery trustees.\n\n\n\nOf the rest of the 47 finalists, there are some interesting pictures including Sally Ross\u2019s graphic and precise portrait of Eva Orner, Marc Etherington\u2019s faux na\u00efve portrait of artist Del Kathryn Barton and Tony Curran\u2019s portrait adapted from an iPad sketch of businessman Luke Grealy.\n\nThe wooden spoon is once again hotly contested with Bruno Jean Grasswill\u2019s frankly ghastly image of actor Michael Caton taking the Packing Room prize, thus disqualifying it from further shame, but the real winner of worst in show goes to Shaun Gladwell for his portrait of Mark Donaldson VC. Gladwell, who is better known as a video artist, made his initial reputation as a painter but this picture, a faint reprise of German neo-expressionism, is hugely unconvincing.\n\nThe Archibald is a curious beast, with seemingly little rhyme or reason to the ebb and flow of quality in its paintings and subjects. It\u2019s something I always wondered about: why this selection? Why this winner?\n\nIn 2014, I was invited to take part in the selection of the Salon des Refuses, the SH Ervin Gallery\u2019s show of Archibald and Wynne prize rejects. The insight I gleaned from the experience is that of the 1,000 plus works that are usually entered, the vast majority have no chance \u2013 Sunday painters, protest works, amateurs and others just having a go.\n\nWhen it gets down to the business of real contenders, the Archibald is a competition between about 60 paintings and, for all the hoopla and storied history, the prize is no different to any in your local community hall \u2013 it\u2019s all down to who enters.\n\nThe Wynne winner, Natasha Bieniek\u2019s Biophilia, measuring just 9cm by 9cm. Photograph: Mim Stirling/AGNSW\n\nThe companion prizes to the Archibald are the Wynne prize for landscape or figure sculpture and the Sulman prize for genre painting or mural art, a pair of awards always fascinating for the oddities they throw up, both in finalists and winners.\n\nThe miniature landscape and eventual Wynne winner, Biophilia, by Natasha Bieniek is a gem, literally as smallest work in the category, too easily obscured by some commanding paintings by Kate Shaw, Ildiko Kovacs, Angus Nivison and Aaron Kinnane.\n\nSome of the more eccentric works steal more attention, such as Theo Papathomas\u2019s Constructed Landscape \u2013 a strange and intriguing picture of paint runs and crazed surfaces \u2013 and Neil Haddon\u2019s The First Time Again, a meta-landscape mash up of samples from John Glover and Paul Gaugin and the reflectiveness of your granny\u2019s ornamental biscuit tins.\n\nThe 2015 Sulman has been won by Jason Phu for his Chinese ink and paper work, I was at yum cha when in rolled the three severed heads of Buddha: Fear, Malice and Death. Like much of Phu\u2019s recent art , it\u2019s a funny, gentle and autobiographical work, part manic poet, hungover cartoonist.\n\nJason Phu\u2019s Sulman-winning artwork. Photograph: Mim Stirling/AGNSW\n\nSelected by artist and former AGNSW trustee, Lindy Lee, this year\u2019s Sulman is dominated by other graphic works such as David Egan\u2019s Strolling beyond Infinity, Kate Beynon\u2019s Gaveyard Scene and Dapeng Liu\u2019s The Temple, the Sailing Boat and the Trolleybus \u2012 a surrealistic mountain scape. But for me, the greatest interest is always with the \u201cring-ins\u201d, such as Stephen Ormandy\u2019s gorgeous and playful Attention Seeker and Tom Carment\u2019s quietly beautiful series of miniatures Sydney Structures."}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/nigel-milsom-wins-the-archibald-our-most-fun-festival-of-faces-44717", "page_content": "When announcing this year\u2019s Archibald Prize, the President of Trustees at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Guido Belgiorno-Nettis, said that judging the annual competitions was \u201cabsolutely the most fun thing you can do as a trustee\u201d. This year\u2019s prize exhibitions are an indication that they are all having a lot of fun.\n\nThe guide to winning\n\nThe choice of winner for the Archibald, Nigel Milsom\u2019s Judo House Part 6 (The White Bird) \u2013 main image \u2013 is a portrait of the showman barrister, Charles Waterstreet was widely predicted, as was the runner-up Mitch Cairns\u2019 angular portrait of artist Peter Powditch. There were several reasons for this.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nFirst, the Archibald is \u2013 in essence \u2013 not an art prize but a celebration of the personalities who define Australia, and especially Sydney. Waterstreet, the flamboyant inspiration for the ABC television series Rake, has to be a front runner on those grounds alone.\n\nIn addition, Milsom was the winner of the 2013 Moran Prize \u2013 and a convicted criminal \u2013 all of which makes good copy. The Archibald is, above all things, about media coverage.\n\nThe other guide to the winner comes from the hanging. In the 1950s and 60s the Gallery director, Hal Missingham, used to write the telegrams for the winner before the judging. The Trustees were furious with him, but he had their measure.\n\nFor the 33 years of Edmund Capon\u2019s directorship it became very easy to work out which work was most likely to win. For well over a week before the final judging, the winner would be hanging in the central court on one of the long walls \u2013 either opposite where the announcement would be made, or adjacent to it.\n\nThe Director always chose the location.\n\nUnder the terms of JF Archibald\u2019s will, the prize must be judged by the Trustees. Since the rise of curators and professional gallery directors, only a few trustees are artists, but the current crop include some extremely knowledgeable collectors and art patrons.\n\nThe lighter and livelier exhibition is a reflection of their broad understanding that the Archibald exists to celebrate portraiture and people, not to elevate the status of the artists.\n\n\u00a9 the artist. Photograph courtesy of AGSNW, Mim Sterling\n\nFor me, the most impressive painting that was hung in the \u201cwinning room\u201d this year is still Kerry McInnis\u2019s Omar Musa, the poetry of unease \u2013 a muted study of one of this coming generation\u2019s most interesting writers.\n\nThe Archibald rules\n\nOne of the unspoken rules for hanging the Archibald, and the reason for the primacy of the central room, is the need to create a space for television cameras to film from a relative distance before zooming on the detail, the artist and the subject.\n\nJust outside the favoured room the curator has installed what is probably the most unusual painting to enter the Archibald.\n\nPaul Ryan has previously been exhibited, but this year\u2019s Thirteen Noahs easily outdoes his previous efforts.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nIt is a compilation of paintings of the character actor Noah Taylor, based on different images, some distorted, each superimposed on discarded artworks \u2013 including a tapestry and ping pong bats. Taylor has inserted himself in such a wide range of characters on film and television that it makes sense for him to appear as a part of the scenery with kitsch naked ladies, landscapes and a dog. It might not have been awarded the prize, but it is easily the most exciting work in the show.\n\nThe dead and the famous\n\nThere are sub-themes in the exhibition.\n\nTwo portraits of the recently dead could not provide a greater contrast.\n\nJohn Beard has painted Bill Wright, the much loved curator, director and artist as pale ghost seen through a veil of striped primary colours. It is a celebration of his life and his values.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPeter Churcher has painted his mother, Betty Churcher, on her deathbed as a slack jawed empty shell with just a flicker of life in one eye. I can understand the impulse that led the artist to paint her as she faded from life, but this work needs a more sensitive context than the boisterous Archibald.\n\nMore than almost anyone I knew, Betty Churcher was very conscious of her public image.\n\nIn her last interview with Leigh Sales she went to an enormous effort to look immaculate, because she was speaking to her legacy.\n\nAnother surprising disappointment is Shaun Gladwell\u2019s monochrome portrait of Mark Donaldson VC, where a skull crashes onto the subject\u2019s helmeted head.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nGladwell\u2019s style here is deliberately reminiscent of action hero comic books, and it does not quite work in this context.\n\nTianli Zu also uses monochrome (plus a burst of lurid green shoes) for his portrait of Edmund Capon, \u201cEdmund, your Twomblys are behind you\u201d, a reference to Capon\u2019s most distinguished acquisition for the Gallery\u2019s collection.\n\nHe has chosen to give the former director an especially gnarled face, which contrasts with the stylishly painted building.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Mim Sterling\n\nIf it were dependant on subject matter, the clear winners would have been portraits of artists and people working in the arts.\n\nFilippa Buttitta has painted the much loved Judy Cassab while Tom Carment has a self portrait of his own ageing face.\n\nRodney Pople, an Archibald regular, has painted Frannie Hopkirk, Brett Whiteley\u2019s sister looking bug-eyed, while former National Portrait Gallery director Andrew Sayers has a portrait of Tim Bonyhady but manages to give him an expression that looks a bit like Sayers himself.\n\n\u00a9 the artist - photograph courtesy of \u00a9 AGNSW, Felicity Jenkins\n\nPerhaps the selection of so many people from the arts is a retreat from the current abysmal state of Australian politics \u2013 the only politicians included are those mad mavericks, Bob Katter and Cory Bernardi \u2013 neither with works that are especially memorable.\n\nThere is a sign of a better world with Sally Ross\u2019s very sweet portrait of documentary film maker Eva Orner, which hangs adjacent to Guy Morgan\u2019s portrait of Louise Voigt, the CEO of Barnardo\u2019s Australia.\n\nThe Wynne Prize, also judged by the Trustees, is often overlooked in the annual festival of faces. Mostly that neglect is justified, but this year the Trustees have reached out and given the prize to a young Melbourne artist Natasha Bieniek.\n\nI get the impression that, having done their duty by the public and paid homage to the sheer exuberant sensationalism of the Archibald, the Trustees have collectively released their inner aesthete and indulged in supporting both quality and the coming generation. As Guido Belgiorno-Nettis says, judging these prizes is \u201cabsolutely the most fun thing\u201d.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nCongratulations Natasha Bieniek, but the Wynne Prize is deeply flawed\n\n\n\nThe Archibald Prize exhibition will show at the Art Gallery of NSW from July 18 - September 27.

Image supplied.\n\nWho: Lewis Miller\n\nWhat: Deborah Conway\n\nWhy: I was really torn on this one between Lewis Miller\u2019s painting of Deborah Conway and Robert Hannaford\u2019s stunning self portrait Hirsute self-portrait. Hannaford has been an Archibald finalist on 26 previous occasions \u2013 eight of those self-portraits \u2013 and winning the People\u2019s Choice three times. Is this his time?\n\nPerhaps due, but I think the collective mindset at the moment globally is not for celebrating a white male of Hannaford\u2019s generation (b.1944) \u2013 despite how good his painting might be.\n\nThis is not said to discredit Miller\u2019s painting in any way (who, we might also add, is a male of the same vintage b.1959); the difference here is the celebration of the strength and resilience of a female performer.\n\nThe last two years performing artists have had a hell of a time, thanks to the pandemic, and it is also a time that the sector has reframed gender balance. It is laudable that despite the difficulties of the time, the two worked on this piece only with live sittings. There is a confidence that comes across in its casual pose, sketchy style and framing, that only veterans like Conway and Miller can muster with ease. It is gracefully uncomplicated.\n\nMiller has been an Archibald finalist on 17 previous occasions, and won the prize in 1998 with a portrait of artist Allan Mitelman.\n\nArtsHub Highly Commends:\n\nOther portraits delivered this year that we feel were worthy of mention \u2013 and have a serious go at the running \u2013 are: Ann Cape\u2019s painting of artist Euan Macleod titled, Walking a tightrope; Robert Malherbe\u2019s painting of his wife, an award-winning motion graphics designer, titled Dana, head in hands, which he says was influenced by Edvard Munch\u2019s 1893 painting The scream; and Laura Jones\u2019 painting of Brooke Boney, a Gamilaroi woman from Muswellbrook, NSW, and the first Indigenous presenter in the history of Australian breakfast television, with her dog Jimmy.\n\nPast Archibald winner Fiona Lowry (who won with a portrait of Penelope Seidler in 2014) returns with another architectural connection, and a solid painting with a portrait of Glenn Murcutt, but our guess not 2022\u2019s winner.\n\nAnd, we also want to pay a nod to Natasha Walsh\u2019s self-portrait that riffs off Brett Whiteley\u2019s much loved 1976 Archibald-winning work Self-portrait in the studio; she won the 2018 Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship at the age of 24. Perhaps a runner for the People\u2019s Choice?\n\nThe past winners have been:\n\nPeter Wegner\u2019s portrait of Guy Warren at 100 (2021);\n\nWestern Arrernte artist, Vincent Namatjira with his painting, Stand strong for who you are, a portrait of Adam Goodes, and first Aboriginal artist to win (2020);\n\nTony Costa with a portrait of former Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW) Trustee Lindy Lee (2019);\n\nYvette Coppersmith with Self-portrait, after George Lambert (2018);\n\nMitch with a portrait of artist wife Agatha Gothe-Snape (2017);\n\nLouise Hearman with a portrait of Barry [Humphries] (2016) \u2013 a first time entrant;\n\nNigel Milsom\u2019s painting Judo house part 6 (the white bird) \u2013 a portrait of Milsom\u2019s barrister Charles Waterstreet (2015);\n\nFiona Lowry\u2019s portrait of art patron Penelope Seidler (2014);\n\nView the Archibald Prize 2022 finalists.\n\nJuz Kitson, An unwavering truth.

In memory of the wildfires\n\nWhy: For me the Wynne felt a natural pick this year. For the past six years we have witnessed the prize being awarded to First Nations artists. While it has been important to rebalance the prize with this Indigenous lens, a short stand out this year is a new work by ceramic-based artist Juz Kitson.\n\nKitson has a built a reputation for extending the medium, her technically exquisite pieces also offering a strong conceptual foundation, drawing our reactions and emotions of the viewer when encountering her work.\n\nThis work (with its very long title) \u2018reflects on the opposing themes of vulnerability and strength, and an undeniable tension after raging wildfires devastated the south coast of Australia and the landscape around my home and studio,\u2019 Kitson explained.\n\nIt captures \u2018the beauty of the dark trees vitrified by fire, despite the charred remains that lay like ruins,\u2019 adding that the porcelain elements appear \u2018to bristle as if in fight or flight, prompting the audience to acknowledge the entanglements between humans and nature.\u2019\n\nArtsHub Highly Commends:\n\nA super smart work by hyper-real artist Sam Leach, titled Machine-assisted memory of Harewood Farm, Meadows, blends family history and childhood memories with artificial intelligence modelling, geology and thoughts on how we contruct notions of place.\n\nA further standout work, also taking its cue from the bushfires and legacies of wilderness protection and activism, is a collaborative work by Wona Bae and Charlie Lawler, titled Franklin River valley, lutruwita/Tasmania (topographic relief).\n\nWe also want to give a nod to Dean Cross\u2019 Untitled (landscape painting in the 21st century) and the inclusion of two further ceramics pieces this year by Judith Pungarta and Hayley Panangka.\n\nThe past winners have been:\n\nNyapanyapa Yunupi\u014bu, Garak \u2013 night sky (2021);\n\nHubert Pareroultja for his painting Tjoritja (West MacDonnell Rangers, NT) (2020);\n\nSylvia Ken with her painting Seven Sisters (2019);\n\nYukultji Napangati in 2018;\n\nBetty Kuntiwa Pumani won the prize in 2017;\n\nThe Ken Family Collaborative (which also included Sylvia Ken) and their painting Seven Sisters in 2016;\n\nNatasha Bieniek\u2019s tiny hyper-real painting won in 2015;\n\nMichael Johnson\u2019s expansive abstraction in 2014;\n\nAnd for two years running, the Wynne was awarded to Imants Tillers (2013 and 2012).\n\nView the Wynne Prize 2022 finalists.\n\nOur prediction for the 2022 Sulman Prize\n\nSophie Victoria, The spectacle, 2022 Sulman Prize Finalist, AGNSW. Image supplied.\n\nWho: Sophie Victoria\n\nWhat: The spectacle\n\nWhy: Always a funky one due to its broad category (awarded for the best subject painting, genre painting or mural project), we feel that Sophie Victoria\u2019s The spectacle is a great fit \u2013 ambitious, fresh, and materially engaged.\n\nVictoria explains that the title, The spectacle, references Guy Debord\u2019s 1967 book La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du spectacle (The society of the spectacle), in which he offers a critique of contemporary consumerism and commodity fetishism.\n\nShe has wrapped the painting with iridescent material used for fashion items, such as bags, clothes and shoes \u2013 luscious eye candy that snags the viewer. It transforms the work into a hyperreal object that sits somewhere between the history of painting and the history of consumerism. One is deliciously caught in its theatrics and light play, and in doing so questions the \u2018idealised filters that permeate our image culture.\u2019\n\nArtsHub Highly Commends:\n\nIt was a tough call on the Sulman this year with an incredible work by Danie Mellor vying for the accolade. In After the end of the world, two men carry ancestral remains past the watchful eyes of colonial settlers. When you think of the Sulman as a prize that speaks to subject and genre painting this is a smart entry.\n\nThe painting is located against a backdrop of Rainforest Country in North Queensland, where Mellor\u2019s Aboriginal family comes from. In the painting the men persist with ceremony and ritual despite the desecration around them \u2013 a message for our times. It is a moving narrative and strong painting to boot!\n\nAlso deserving of a nod this year is Will Cooke with the digital print, As one door closes, another opens \u2013 a twist pairing an actual site-specific public artwork with its concept abstraction; and Brodie Cullen\u2019s A gronk\u2019s grace for its desire to \u2018interfere with traditional frameworks of painting\u2019, by stretching an old salvaged mattress.\n\nThe past winners have been:\n\nGeorgia Spain\u2019s fleshy painting Getting down or falling up (2021);\n\nFilipino-Australian Marikit Santiago won with a family portrait The divine (2020);\n\nMcLean Edwards with his quirky painting The first girl that knocked on his door (2019);\n\nAboriginal artist Kaylene Whiskey (2018);\n\nJoan Ross\u2019 Oh history, you lied to me (2017);\n\nA domestic interior by Esther Stewart (2016);\n\nJason Phu\u2019s ink on paper which looked at his Chinese heritage (2015);\n\nAndrew Sullivan\u2019s quirky hyper-real fantasy T-rex (tyrant lizard king) (2014)\n\nView the Sulman Prize 2022 finalists.\n\nThe winners of the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will be announced Friday, 13 May.\n\nFinalists in all Prizes will be exhibited at the Art Gallery of NSW from 14 May to 28 August 2022."}, {"url": "https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/art-architecture-design/unsw-graduate-nigel-milsom-wins-archibald-prize", "page_content": "Nigel Milsom\u2019s gothic portrait of Sydney barrister Charles Waterstreet has won the 2015 Archibald prize, the third consecutive year of success for UNSW Art & Design in one of Australia\u2019s most prestigious portrait competitions.\n\nNigel Milsom\u2019s gothic portrait of Sydney barrister Charles Waterstreet has won the 2015 Archibald prize, the third consecutive year of success for UNSW Art & Design in one of Australia\u2019s most prestigious portrait competitions.\n\nMilsom, who graduated from UNSW with a Bachelor and Master of Fine Arts, said he was shocked to receive the $100,000 prize for his work of Waterstreet, who represented him in court and became what he described as a \u201cmythical kind of saviour\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo much hinged on what he had to say and do, and it\u2019s a painting that\u2019s really sort of showing him as a giant in my life at the time,\u201d said Milsom of the winning work Judo house pt 6 (the white bird).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a picture that to me represents a kind of dependence.\u201d\n\nMilsom said he was drawn to Waterstreet\u2019s complexity and otherworldly feel, likening the features of the iconic co-creator and inspiration behind the ABC series Rake to those of a scarecrow or insect.\n\nIt is the third year in a row that a UNSW Art & Design student or graduate has been successful in the Archibald.\n\nMaster of Fine Arts student Fiona Lowry won in 2014 for her ethereal portrait of the architect Penelope Seidler, and graduate Del Kathryn Barton received the prize in 2013 for her painting of actor Hugo Weaving \u2013 her second Archibald nod.\n\nDean of UNSW Art & Design Professor Ross Harley congratulated Milsom on the honour.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled for Nigel.

It is therefore well worth a visit to see the full range of entries in the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s annual festival of prizes.\n\nNot all appreciate this liberation of landscape. In 2017, the veteran Australian artist John Olsen attacked the awarding of the Wynne Prize to Betty Kuntiwa Pumani for Antara, a painting of her mother\u2019s Country.\n\nHe claimed the \u201creal\u201d Australian landscape tradition was represented by artists such as Elioth Gruner and Brett Whiteley, while Pumani\u2019s painting was of \u201ca cloud cuckoo land\u201d.\n\nFrom memory this may have been the year that the gallery changed the design of the exhibition spaces so that the most exciting Wynne entries \u2013 almost all by Indigenous artists \u2013 filled the large central court.\n\nAs a young man in the 1950s, Olsen had demonstrated against the reactionary conservatism of the Trustees of the Art Gallery of NSW; in his old age he objected to their openness to new ideas.\n\nBoth Olsen\u2019s pomposity and the dreariness of an Australian landscape tradition that colonises the land was mocked by Abdul Abdullah in his painting A Terrible Burden, a Wynne finalist in 2019.\n\nCourtesy of the Artist and Yavuz Gallery\u2019\n\nAbdullah has expressed surprise at Olsen\u2019s strident defence of the conservative tradition of Australian landscape as his own paintings are so abstract, although he tells me \u201chis cultural contribution doesn\u2019t hold a flame to Ken Done, who is very good at painting \u2018place\u2019.\u201d\n\nRead more: 'I think Archie would be pleased': 100 years of our most famous portrait prize and my almost 50 years watching it evolve\n\nOrigins of the prize\n\nAs with its more famous partner competition, the Archibald Prize, the Wynne is not quite what its benefactor envisaged.\n\nRichard Wynne\u2019s will originally designated the Art Society of NSW as the body to administer the prize, not the Art Gallery of NSW. In 1895, shortly after Wynne\u2019s death, the Art Society experienced an acrimonious split when a number of artists led by Tom Roberts and Julian Ashton established a rival body, The Society of Artists.\n\nBy the time the prize was first awarded in 1897 the executors, Perpetual Trustees, decided it was more prudent to have it administered by the Art Gallery than a group of squabbling artists.\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales\n\nThe tensions between artists is perhaps one reason why for many years there was no formal exhibition of entries. Walter Withers was awarded the first prize in 1897 for a painting that had already been bought by the Art Gallery. As he wrote to the Argus:\n\nI was unaware that such a prize existed until I read the telegram in your issue of November 24, announcing the honour that had been done to my work.\n\nA search through both the National Library\u2019s Trove and the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s digital archive shows that, as with all art prizes judged by a committee, on many occasions considerations other than merit influenced the judges\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn 1898 the Trustees began the practice of both visiting Art Society exhibitions and inviting interested artists to deposit their offerings for consideration. This was also the first year the prize was awarded to William Lister Lister, a stalwart of the Art Society (later renamed the Royal Art Society of NSW). He was awarded the prize a total of seven times.\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales\n\nWith the exception of the 1898 award, Lister Lister was a trustee and therefore a judge on each of the other six times he won. He was not alone in this.\n\nSydney Long, a fellow trustee and fellow member of the Royal Art Society, was awarded the Wynne in 1938 and 1940. The only artist to be awarded the Wynne more often than Lister Lister was the South Australian, Hans Heysen, who was awarded the prize eight times. Heysen, from South Australia, exhibited with the Society of Artists.\n\n\u00a9 C Heysen\n\nFor many years, it is fair to say many of the decisions governing the Art Gallery of NSW were a fine balance between two competing factions, with each taking it in turn to award the various prizes to their members and supporters.\n\nIn 1899, the young George Lambert, associated with the Society of Artists, was awarded the Wynne for his heroic painting of horses ploughing through mud, Across the Black Soil Plains. He was also awarded the NSW Government\u2019s newly established Travelling Art Scholarship, a recognition of his precocious talent.\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales\n\nThe eccentric nature of the management of the prize led to the situation in 1921 when the Trustees commissioned Elioth Gruner to paint The Valley of the Tweed, with the prize as a part of the commission.\n\nThe cosy duopoly of the art societies was challenged in 1943 after William Lister Lister\u2019s sudden death.\n\nInstead of replacing him with another representative of the Royal Art Society, the minister for education, Clive Evatt, appointed his sister-in-law, the collector and painter of modern art, Mary Alice Evatt, to be the first woman trustee in the gallery\u2019s history.\n\nIn January 1944, Evatt advocated for William Dobell\u2019s portrait of Joshua Smith to win the Archibald Prize. The following year she voted for the Wynne to go to Sali Herman\u2019s urban landscape, McElhone Stairs, a painting with a complete absence of gum trees, painted by a Jewish immigrant who exhibited with the Contemporary Art Society.\n\nThe Wynne continued to reward interesting paintings when Russell Drysdale won with Sofala (1947), and Lloyd Rees for The Harbour from McMahon\u2019s Point(1950).\n\nA changeable landscape\n\nBy the early 1960s, the old exhibiting societies were less relevant to artists trying to establish a career. But the new dealer galleries understood the value of prizes to their artists\u2019 profiles.\n\nThe new superstars of Australian art, John Olsen, Fred Williams and Brett Whiteley, began to be listed as prize winners.\n\nThe Wynne was still very much a \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d, as if the Australian landscape could only be captured by one gender. Lorna Nimmo had won in 1941, but her watercolours did not appeal to the Trustees.\n\nIt took until 1971 for Margaret Woodward to be the next woman winner, with her painting, Karri Country.\n\nShe was followed in 1994 with Suzanne Archer\u2019s Waratah Wedderburn.\n\n(While the prize is most well known for its landscapes, figurative sculptures can also enter, and Rosemary Madigan had won with her classic stone torso in 1986.)\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nAnn Thomson was awarded the 1998 prize with her abstract painting, Yellow Sound, which may have encouraged the Trustees to cast their net wider. For the following year the Wynne Prize was awarded to Gloria Tamerre Petyarre.\n\nThis bastion of the Australian landscape tradition was never the same again.\n\nEasily the most memorable painting to be awarded the Wynne in recent years was in 2016, when the Ken family collaborative painted Seven Sisters, the grand narrative of protecting country.\n\nCourtesy of the Artists, Tjala Arts and Jan Murphy Gallery\n\nAlthough some non-Aboriginal artists have won this century, Aboriginal art continues to dominate. The gallery now also hosts the Roberts Family prize, specifically for work by Indigenous artists.\n\nWhat we are seeing here in this oldest, and potentially crustiest of art prizes, is concrete evidence of a whole new tradition of Australian art \u2013 or rather evidence that the oldest tradition is using art as a means to reclaim the land.\n\nRead more: Australians' favourites show Aboriginal art can transcend social divisions and art boundaries"}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/europe/topics/archibald-prize-2696", "page_content": "\u00a9 the artist, image \u00a9 Art Gallery of New South Wales, Jenni Carter April 28, 2023 From joyous celebration to the depths of grief: the new orthodoxy of the Archibald prize is there is no orthodoxy The Archibald Prize and the Royal Easter Show have a great deal in common.
