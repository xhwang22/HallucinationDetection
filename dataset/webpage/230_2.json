A combined aggregation of hundreds of article databases, with millions of articles in total. All the articles may be read online or download and save as eDocuments.

World Heritage Encyclopedia has aligned itself with the Common Core and State Standards to ensure all of the nonfiction STEM content needed by any student could be found, all in one place.\n\n\n\nEvery month thousands of new articles, images, and multimedia elements are added.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Encyclopedias\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia includes the great general encyclopedias of the past and the present but all types of works that claim to provide in an orderly arrangement the essence of \"all that is known\" on a subject or a group of subjects, translated from the Koine Greek enkyklios paideia, which literally means \"complete knowledge\". As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world. With modern technology we have the extra advantage of information being portable as well."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Gu%C3%B0laugur_%C3%9E%C3%B3r_%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson", "page_content": "What we do.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.

Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions.

Mr. Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation of Iceland\n\nMr President, Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\n\n\nLet me start by thanking the UN Secretary-General, for his leadership in these difficult times. I also express gratitude to the dedicated staff of this organization, often working in very challenging circumstances, for their commitment and courage.\n\n\n\nThe international community comes together for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations under exceptional circumstances - amid a global crisis.\n\n\n\nIceland is fully committed to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have contributed to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to the UN Response and Recovery Fund and to several other initiatives, including the development, distribution, and fair and equal access to a possible vaccine for every country.\n\n\n\nThis crisis will have long-term implications for our economies and societies, pushing millions of peoples further behind, not least the most vulnerable. We must, therefore, redouble our collective efforts and pursue the Sustainable Development Goals with vigour.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has revealed that our fate is interlinked with the successes and failures of others. This very same revelation brought the founders of this great organisation together in 1945, after having lived through the horrors of two world wars. They understood then, as we must now, that we are stronger together than apart.\n\n\n\nThis notion is evident to a small state like Iceland, but larger states also gain from a well-functioning international rules-based order: peace, prosperity and partnerships for our people and planet. For the gravest challenges we face today can only be addressed collectively.\n\n\n\nThe current situation provides us with a perspective. Even if we still have a long way to go, we have witnessed significant achievements over the past 75 years. States have gained their independence, women have gained agency, more parents see their children grow up to become healthy adults, and millions have risen from poverty. Wild polio has recently been eradicated in Africa, a welcome sign of hope in the context of today\u2019s challenges. By most measures, we have been living in times of unprecedented prosperity, something we now know, should not be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nIt is critical that we fight to maintain and improve the multilateral system and oppose/question those who seek to undermine it. We must ensure that our institutions, actions and tools are fit for purpose \u2013 so that the system can continue to serve all of us. The Secretary-General's ongoing reform agenda has our full support.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe greatest challenge of our time can only be addressed through joint efforts. Climate action needs to be at the heart of our efforts as we build back better and greener after the pandemic. The Paris Agreement is the global baseline, and Iceland is fully committed to its implementation. To build back greener, we need to make full use of science, innovation, and positive financial stimulus for the full participation of the private sector.\n\n\n\nIceland's new climate action plan, released earlier this summer, goes even further than was agreed in Paris. Our goal is to achieve 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and full carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\n\n\nSustainable management of natural resources and the use of renewable energy will be instrumental if we are to combat climate change. That includes the sustainable use of our oceans, a major carbon sink, continuously threatened by climate change, pollution, and mismanagement. Here, international law, namely the Law of the Sea, provides the foundation for action that should be based firmly in science. Iceland will continue to share its expertise in these fields through our development cooperation, public-private partnerships and our capacity-building programs, run under the auspices of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nAs we embark on a Decade of Action, we need to be firmly focused on advancing gender equality - not only as a fundamental human right - but also as critical for accelerated progress so that individuals and nations can prosper and reach their full potential. The slow progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality is therefore deeply worrying, not least as we risk losing a generation or more of gains due to the current crisis.\n\n\n\nWe must act now to ensure the full and equal participation of women in economic and political life, access to education, essential health services, and fight against sexual and gender-based violence. Iceland is therefore committed to contributing in a meaningful way as a co-leader of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on gender-based violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nGrowing nationalism, racism, religious intolerance, and homophobia will continue to undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms if we do not fight to reverse this trend. It is of major concern when the most powerful are ambivalent, even hostile, to the enjoyment of universal human rights by all. UN Members States must speak up and act when human rights are set aside or violated, and not hesitate to use the legal, economic, and political tools we have at our disposal.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, I have had the honour to meet many brave women and men who risk their life and freedom to call out their governments for violation of human rights and fundamental freedom. It is our duty to support and protect these human rights defenders and allow their voices to be heard. We must also protect media freedom, which has come under grave threat in too many countries around the world. Human rights underpin democratic and prosperous societies \u2013 which in turn are the fundamental basis for international stability and peace.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2018 and 2019, Iceland made an effort to demonstrate that all nations, also the smallest among us, can use their voice effectively to speak out for those suppressed or silenced. The experience was both encouraging and empowering, since most UN Member States belong to that group of smaller or mid-size countries.\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is not without faults and shortcomings. We have been critical of the Council\u2019s membership, and the apparent desire by those with less than stellar human rights records to consistently undermine the integrity of the Council. We have also pushed for reform of the council and its working methods.\n\n\n\nMember States serving on the Council should never lose sight of its main mission and purpose \u2013 to protect and promote universal human rights. They should call out violators and hold them accountable and be open to constructive criticism and cooperation, rather than seek refuge behind rhetoric of politicization.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, and on the basis of the experience of our recent membership of the Human Rights Council, Iceland has decided to run for a seat on the Council for the term 2025-2027.\n\n\n\nMr President\n\n\n\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in calling for a global ceasefire; a call which all nations should support, not least those that hold power to influence the situation on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe ongoing efforts to find political and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Syria, Yemen, and Libya must continue with full backing of those involved. The Middle East Peace Process also needs to be reinvigorated as the current stagnation on both sides only serves to deepen existing disagreements, moving us further away from the two-state solution.\n\n\n\nCloser to my own place of home, in Europe, the persistent unlawful violation by Russia of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia continues to undermine peace and stability, and recent developments in Belarus give cause for major concern.\n\n\n\nThe Security Council carries special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security on behalf of the wider UN membership. The Council, not least some of its permanent members, need to act in accordance with the UN charter, instead of being motivated by narrow political gains in a zero-sum game, undermining the credibility of this vital body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr President,\n\n\n\n\"The UN was not created to take mankind into paradise but rather to save humanity from hell\", former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld famously once said.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we should be mindful that this organization has been a catalyst for human development and progress. And it is the most significant peace project of our times.\n\n\n\nThe UN remains the only international body equipped to bring together different nationalities, political ideologies, and religions, for the common good.\n\n\n\nIts shortcomings can neither serve as an excuse for disengagement nor for the promotion of national interests above the pursuit of our common wellbeing and prosperity.\n\n\n\nToo many seek to apply the principles and values of the UN Charter selectively, tilting the balance between rights and responsibilities \u2013 in international trade, rule of law, human rights, disarmament and in preventing conflicts and atrocities.\n\n\n\nOur organisations and institutions should never serve or shelter those who seek to undermine the basic principles of the international rule-based order, which we have all subscribed to, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\n\nIt remains, that what we see is our own making. That is why, we need to use the current crisis and the 75th anniversary to reinvigorate our cooperation, build trust and make our institutions more effective and resilient, for today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\nWe should reconfirm our commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, international law, and the liberal international order.\n\n\n\nWe should stand up for these principles when they are being pushed aside.\n\n\n\nWe should make our institutions more open, transparent, and inclusive.\n\n\n\nWe should reform, not rewrite or retreat.\n\nFor only together we can build the future we want, and the UN we need.\n\nPre-recorded statement"}, {"url": "https://www.icelandreview.com/news/chinese-authorities-blacklist-icelander-in-response-to-sanctions/", "page_content": "An Icelandic lawyer has been blacklisted by Chinese authorities over his vocal critique of China-related matters, mbl.is reports.

Among the repercussions are a China travel ban and financial assets in China, if any, are frozen.\n\nIceland\u2019s ambassador in Beijing Gunnar Snorri Gunnarsson was notified of the Chinese authorities\u2019 decision yesterday. Sveinn H. Gu\u00f0marsson, a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told mbl.is that Icelandic authorities objected to the decision. The Icelandic ambassador in Beijing objected to the representative of the Chinese Ministry for foreign affairs when he received the news and the Chinese ambassador to Iceland had a meeting in the ministry of foreign affairs where the objections were repeated. \u201cIt was also pointed out that Icelanders have full freedom of expression. This individual is in no way responsible for any Icelandic government actions that authorities in China might disagree with, Sveinn told mbl.is.\n\nThe blacklisted individual is J\u00f3nas Haraldsson. He told mbl.is that he was notified that the action against him was due to his criticism of the Chinese embassy, China\u2019s part in the COVID-19 pandemic and Chinese tourists. J\u00f3nas added that he was proud of being the only Icelander who was on the Chinese list. He also told R\u00daV that the blacklist wasn\u2019t likely to affect him as he had no assets in China and no plans to travel there.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson stated that Chinese government tactics to punish people for using exercising their freedom of expression in countries where is unacceptable. \u201cI think the polite word to use is that it\u2019s completely unacceptable to apply this to an Icelandic citizen just for using their freedom of expression. We made the very clear to Chinese authorities both here in Reykjav\u00edk as well as in Beijing.\u201d Despite Iceland\u2019s protests, Gu\u00f0laugur does not believe that Chinese authorities will change their minds.\n\nLast month, Iceland agreed to participate in sanctions against China along with nations such as the US, the UK, Canada, Norway and the nations of the EU. Iceland has criticised China\u2019s behaviour towards the Uighurs both in the united nation\u2019s human rights Commission and in communication with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy posted a statement on their website last Friday, confirming that the blacklisting was a response to Iceland\u2019s participation in the sanctions:\n\n\u201cBased on nothing but lies and disinformation, Iceland follows EU\u2019s unilateral sanctions on relevant Chinese individuals and entity, citing the so-called human rights issues in Xinjiang. This move breaches international law and basic norms of international relations, and severely undermines China-Iceland relations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has summoned Icelandic Ambassador to China to lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation. China has decided to impose reciprocal sanctions on one individual on the Icelandic side who seriously harms China\u2019s sovereignty and interests by maliciously spreading lies and disinformation.\n\nChina is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests.

Foreign Minister \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson has held his current government post since 2017, having previously served as minister of Health and Social Security from 2007-2009. He was formerly chairman of Iceland's Independence Party parliamentary group and has served in Iceland's parliament, the Al\u00deingi, as a representative of Reykjavik's northern and southern constituencies and as a member of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, Trade, Health, Environment and Budget.\n\nThe following is a brief excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nInvestable Universe: Mr. Foreign Minister, earlier this year, you addressed the UN General Assembly remotely and remarked on the parallels of the covid-19 crisis with the aftermath of World War Two, when the U.N. was created. And you pointed to the precedent of nations working cooperatively to emerge stronger from crisis. How is Iceland currently contributing to the global recovery effort from covid?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: First of all, I think this is a perfect example of how we need to work together. It makes no difference even [if] part of the world [were to be] very successful [at controlling the virus]\u2026And what we have done [is to] take part in humanitarian cooperation [at the] multilateral level, [such as] the U.N. and other forums, saying that when it comes to the vaccine, we are contributing because we know it needs to go everywhere. It doesn't need only to be in Iceland even though, of course, we try to protect our people. And of course we are looking [toward] the future. There will be a time after covid. And it's really important [to] emphasize with our Nordic friends and other countries\u2026that we build back better and greener. At the same time, we are totally aware\u2026[that] unfortunately, this is an actual [economic as well as health] crisis\u2026.We are going to see people hungry, we will see serious crisis and we need to address that. At the same time, we are doing everything we can, fighting it in our own country, and using the U.N. organizations and all the multilateral organizations to work with them, to do what we can to build for the future to address this acute crisis. And we are totally aware we are that we need to do this with others. We can't do it alone.\n\nInvestable Universe: Many have talked about the post covid recovery period as a great reset, and that this is an opportunity to make sweeping, more radical or fundamental changes specifically in the area of environmental sustainability. So what does that entail from Iceland's perspective?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: Regardless of covid, we would have needed to take on that task. Maybe we'll look back and see [that there was on] opportunity in this crisis that we used\u2026Iceland has a story to tell [about experience with] geothermal heating. If everyone would use the opportunity for geothermal heating, then the climate problem would be out of the way. And we did this [back] in the [19]30s and 40s. If you come to Iceland, then you will see that when it comes electricity, all the heating of the houses, is 100 percent renewable. And we are helping others. And for example, [Iceland] used to have the largest geothermal heating in the world; it\u2019s now China.\n\nInvestable Universe: Wow.\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: But most important is sustainability when it comes to nature, and [specifically] fisheries. Iceland is all about sustainability\u2026We are a fishing nation, an island, and if we are not sustainable when it comes to our natural resources, then it would be very tough to live in Iceland\u2026We have made a lot of mistakes and it's important that that people learn from others' mistakes\u2026[During] my childhood, [commercial fishing] was all about the fish filet, and it was about catching as much fish as quickly as possible. I'm not saying the filet is a byproduct now, but we have gone from only using the fish filet into total utilization of the fish. It means that, for example, that the fish skins are used for healing burn wounds.\n\nInvestable Universe: That's right. One of your key startups [Kerecis] is exactly that.\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: What used to be pollution, like the shells of the ships which are poured into the harbors and the total nuisance and the pollution, it's now used for making pharmaceuticals and food supplements. And the same with the bones and other parts of fish. And I'm not talking down fishing--it's a very important [industry]. It's also a high tech industry and the R&D is definitely a driving factor. So this is something that we realized long time ago that we have been quite successful with. And there are enormous opportunities all around the world when it comes to this.\n\nInvestable Universe: Commercial fishing is a major employer in Iceland. Do you see any tension between those two objectives: being sustainable as possible and protecting or creating as many jobs for Icelandic citizens as possible?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson No, no, not really. What has happened in the last few decades, I mean, in the 70s, probably 20, 30 percent of the workforce was working for the fisheries and aquaculture, four percent now. Is it a bad thing? No, it's not a bad thing. It means that you have other jobs. And I think, of course, people are different. And I respect everything that more people will want to do. But I think that at least for the young people, it's more attractive working with R&D when it comes to utilizing and getting more valuable products from the fish, than these traditional jobs which are more or less no longer there.\n\nInvestable Universe: Are there any new and investable technologies that Iceland is currently exporting that you can share with us or any particularly promising technologies where Iceland is looking for international partners?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: We're making sure we have opportunities when it comes to hydrogen and other things. When it comes to energy, we do not have what people usually think [of] when they think about energy as a fossil fuel. We do not have that. We have geothermal. We have hydro\u2026We are made for data centers [ed: which require energy for cooling]. Sometimes it's good to be cold. We are called Iceland for a reason.\n\nInvestable Universe: Have how many data centers does Iceland currently have? Not enough?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: I cannot tell the numbers. But, you know, when you have the renewable energy, well-educated workforce and then you have the cold, so you don't need as much energy because it's quite a lot about keeping it [data centers] cooled down.\n\nInvestable Universe: And you have submarine cables, right?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: Oh, yes. We actually are going to make the connections better\u2026In a couple of years, we will have even more and safer and secure connections. So this is one of the opportunities. But when it comes to energy, when you think about the R&D, the opportunities are endless\u2026The same goes with fisheries. If you just look at what we've been doing, then I can assure you that cooperating with Icelandic companies in that field is a great opportunity.\n\nInvestable Universe: So Iceland is a seafaring nation. It's a country that depends heavily on its maritime exposure for its economic growth. What role does Iceland play in safeguarding the [maritime] legal framework?What challenges do you see possibly emerging in the coming years?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson: Well, there's a lot of challenges. We look at ourselves as a guardian of the sea. We know the importance [of the] sea [remaining] unpolluted, see the importance of sustainable use. Understand [that for] every day that you overfish and you're not using a sustainable way, [at some point], you can never go back\u2026So the UNCLOS (U.N. Charter on the International Law of the Sea) is essential. But we face a lot of challenges. We are going to see [fishing] stocks move because of climate change. We also see new technologies [emerging] that we can harness in more places that we do now. And if we do not do it in a proper way, we will see very harsh results, which will affect all of us.\n\nInvestable Universe: Iceland is currently chairing the Arctic Council, and that's a region that is increasingly assuming geopolitical strategic importance. There's a lot of speculation that that the Arctic region is going to be opening up more and that's going to be contested by multiple large countries. Can you discuss Icelandic policy initiatives on the council and what challenges, whether these are investment challenges or simply geopolitical challenges or opportunities may arise?\n\nGudlaugur Thor Thordarsson: The Arctic has, so far, been a low tension area. And we want to keep it that way. But then again, sustainability is the key. It's not only sustainability when it comes to the environment or the nature. It\u2019s also [to do] with social sustainability and economic sustainability. We have four million people living in the Arctic, and it's very important that no action or decisions are taken without their support, or that they should be the ones who are taking the decision.\n\nInvestable Universe: There's a very clear legislation in place that will affect Russia, China, the United States, all the players with an interest.\n\nGudlaugur Thor Thordarsson: Yes, it's UNCLOS\u2026And that's important that we we also have an international system...I think it's very important that we, the ones who are agree on common values, [on] which we based our international and multilateral system on, that we try to guard it, because we will have problems if that is not the cornerstone of international cooperation."}, {"url": "https://consulate-iceland-otm.com/government-of-iceland", "page_content": "GUDNI TH.
