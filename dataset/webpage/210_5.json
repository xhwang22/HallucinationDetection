Ricketts ranks second in batting average (.357), tied for first in home runs (11) and sixth in RBI (41) among WCC leaders.

BYU head coach Jeff Judkins was tabbed Coach of the Year, while Ali Bamberger from Saint Mary\u2019s won Newcomer of the Year, Gonzaga\u2019s Yvonne Ejim won Sixth Woman of the Year and San Diego\u2019s Jordyn Edwards won Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\n\nAll five major individual awards \u2013 along with the All-West Coast Conference Teams and the All-Freshman Team \u2013 were voted on solely by the league\u2019s 10 head coaches.\n\n\n\nAn All-WCC guard, Gonzales is averaging 22.0 points over the past five games, including a career-high 35 vs. Saint Mary\u2019s. Overall this season, Gonzales paces her squad and ranks third in the league in scoring at 18.8 ppg. This is the seventh time a BYU player has earned WCC Player of the Year accolades. Prior to Gonzales\u2019 shared award last year, the last time a Cougar won it outright was Cassie Broadhead in 2017. Gonzales previously won the 2018-19 WCC Newcomer of the Year and was an All-WCC first-team honoree.\n\n\n\nJudkins earned his 450th career victory earlier this season. This is the third WCC Coach of the Year honor for Judkins who previously earned the recognition last season and in 2015-16. Under Judkins\u2019 guidance, BYU won the 2021-22 WCC regular season title and the Cougars currently boast a No. 17 ranking in the latest Associated Press poll. BYU boasts the four-highest scoring totals this season among WCC teams (104, 103, 101, 99). BYU ranks first in the league in scoring (79.2) and second in defense (58.0 ppg).\n\n\n\nBamberger ended the regular season ranked sixth in the WCC in scoring (15.6 ppg). She also boasts nine double-doubles this season with a 9.4 rebounding average that ranks second in the WCC. She has led her Gaels to the No. 5 seed in the WCC Tournament and a winning record this season at 15-14. A redshirt sophomore, Bamberger transferred to Saint Mary\u2019s from Washington.\n\n\n\nEjim is part of a stingy Gonzaga defense that propelled the Bulldogs to the No. 2 seed in the UCU WCC Basketball Tournament thanks to owning the league\u2019s top defense at 55.7 ppg allowed. Ejim is averaging 9.9 ppg, fourth on her team, but it\u2019s defense where she really made her mark off the bench for the Zags. She paces the team in steals with 44 and she is third among the Bulldogs in rebounds with her 5.4 average. She was named to last year\u2019s WCC All-Tournament Team.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of defense and steals, no team has done it better this season than San Diego, and Edwards was the best at that. She currently leads the WCC in steals with an average of 2.6 per game. A fifth-year senior who transferred to USD from Colorado State prior to her junior year, Edwards was previously tabbed to the All-WCC First Team last year and the All-WCC Second Team the season before.\n\n\n\nBYU led the way with three All-WCC First Team selections: Gonzales, Paisley Harding and Lauren Gustin.

All six individual awards and the All-WCC teams were voted on solely by the Conference\u2019s 10 coaches.New this year is a specific position format for the All-WCC First Team, and specific only to the first team. The first team format is as follows: (3 forwards, 4 midfielders, 3 defenders, 1 goalkeeper).After Santa Clara came from behind to beat Pepperdine last Saturday, 2-1, the Broncos won their third straight WCC title. Head Coach Jerry Smith was tabbed the WCC Coach of the Year and Izzy D'Aquila was named WCC Offenisve Player of the Year, and selected to the All-WCC First Team. Annie Karich for the Broncos was also named the WCC Freshman of the Year, and selected to the All-WCC First Team and All-WCC Freshman Team, as well.For BYU, Laveni Vaka earned WCC Defender of the Year honors, while Jamie Shepherd was tabbed the WCC Midfielder of the Year. Both Cougars were also named to the All-WCC First Team.The lone major award that did not go to Santa Clara or BYU was Gonzaga's Lyza Bosselmann winning WCC Goalkeeper of the Year.Izzy D\u2019Aquila ranks fourth in the nation averaging 2.29 points per game. She is also fourth in goals with 18, a career best. She led the charge for the Broncos to take over in Conference play this season, as SCU went unbeaten through the nine-game WCC slate. D'Aquila netted the game winner in Santa Clara's victory to clinch the WCC title last Saturday. She picked up all-conference honors for the fourth time in her career, and it was her third straight season being named to the first team.D'Aquila's teammate, Karich, appeared in 18 contests with 17 starts. Her seven assists rank second on the team and tied for third in the WCC. She made an impact when it mattered most, assisting on both goals in the season-finale victory at Pepperdine. She also secured two assists in a 4-0 win over San Francisco.Smith guided his Broncos to an unbeaten Conference season after dealing with multiple injuries to key players at the start of the season. The WCC title won in 2022 marked three in a row for Smith and SCU, and it was also Smith's 13th WCC title during his tenure. Smith looks to guide his Broncos back to the College Cup in 2022 after they fell to BYU in the national semifinals last season. Smith has now been named WCC Coach of the Year nine times and in two of the last three years.Bosselmann was named the West Coast Conference Defensive Player of the Week twice this season, and boasts four in her career. She recorded her 19th and 20th career shutouts in the final week of the regular season, and the standout ends her collegiate career second all-time in shutouts in school history. She ended the regular season tied with Santa Clara's Marlee Nicolos for the WCC lead in goals-against average at 0.72.Shepherd and Vaka propelled the Cougars to go unbeaten in Conference play, and BYU only lost twice during the entire season. Shepherd ranked fifth in the WCC with 18 points, third on her team. Her seven goals ranked tied for third among the Cougars. Their efforts helped BYU secure seven shutouts during the campaign, including two 6-0 victories over WCC foes. BYU finished the regular season ranking 11th in the nation in scoring offense while battling a strength of schedule that ranked 28th in the nation. The Cougars fell to Florida State in the national championship game a year ago, and look for another deep run in this year's NCAA Tournament."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/24/archives/holland-of-cornell-on-alleast-eleven-pittsburgh-end-named.html", "page_content": "Joe Holland played only a year of high school football before going to Michigan, where Coach Bo Schembechier had cornered the market on outstanding running backs in 1974. But Holland, second son of Jerome (Brud) Holland, wanted to play regularly so he switched to his father's alma mater, Cornell, and sat out the 1975 season as required of transfer students.\n\nThen the National Collegiate Athletic Association enacted a rule that permits some graduate students to play one year of a varsity sport at the college where they get their bachelor's degree. After two seasons at fullback in 1976 and 1977, Holland was graduated, then became the Cornell tailback while working for a master's degree this year. He came close to achieving the success Brud Holland gained as an allAmerica end at Cornell in 1937 and 1938.\n\nJoe Holland finished No. 2 in the nation in rushing and scoring behind Billy Sims, the Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma. That is certainly good enough to place him on this department's all\u2010East football team, a group of 39 players selected from major and small\u2010college teams.\n\nHolland, whose father became the United States Ambassador to Sweden and then president of Hampton Institute, is not the only son of a famous father to make this squad although he is the first graduate student ever picked. Dave Shula, Dartmouth's sophomore split end, qualifies because of an ability for making catches that won games.

Oklahoma City Thunder - Chet Holmgren (Gonzaga)\n\nWith the second pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, Oklahoma City selected former No. 1 high school prospect Chet Holmgren \u2014 the 2021-22 WCC Rookie and Defensive Player of the Year. In just one season for the Bulldogs, the 7-foot center averaged 14.1 PPG, 9.9 RPG, 1.9 APG, and was a consensus top-three pick among scouts and analysts after a great year in Spokane.\n\n12, Oklahoma City Thunder - Jalen Williams (Santa Clara)\n\nJoining fellow mid-major and WCC product Chet Holmgren with the No. 12 pick in the draft, Santa Clara\u2019s Jalen Williams is heading to Oklahoma City following a season in which he averaged 18 PPG, 4.4 RPG, and 4.2 APG earning a 2021-22 All-WCC selection. At 6-foot-6, Williams brings to the Thunder an offensive threat who uses his length well, is a dynamic passer, and can play exceptionally off the pick and roll.\n\n13. Traded to Detroit Pistons - Jalen Duren (Memphis)\n\nInitially selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the pick, Memphis\u2019 Jalen Duren will be heading to Detroit in a three-team trade deal which sees Duren land in an excellent spot given his talents. A 6-foot-11 center, Duren averaged 12 PPG and 8.1 RPG for the Tigers as a freshman earning the 2021-22 AAC Rookie of the Year as a dominate defensive force with 2.1 BKPG.\n\n17. Houston Rockets - Tari Eason (LSU, Cincinnati)\n\nWhile Tari Eason finished his collegiate career at LSU, the former top-100 prospect first played under coach John Brannen at Cincinnati during his freshman season. On his way to a 2021-22 SEC first-team selection, Eason averaged 16.9 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 1 APG but previously earned an AAC All-Freshman selection with 7.3 PPG and 5.9 RPG for the Bearcats.\n\n19. Traded to Memphis Grizzlies - Jake LaRavia (Wake Forest, Indiana State)\n\nA former Missouri Valley Conference standout, Jake LaRavia was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves before a subsequent trade sent him to Memphis. After being selected as a MVC All-Freshman for the Sycamores, LaRavia would see a huge uptick in production under head coach Steve Forbes averaging 14.6 PPG, 6.6 RPG, and 3.7 APG as a 2021-22 All-ACC honoree.\n\n23. Traded to Memphis Grizzlies - David Roddy (Colorado State)\n\nJoining LaRavia in Memphis following a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers is 2021-22 MWC Player of the Year David Roddy after carrying the Rams to a No. 6 seed in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. A 6-foot-5 guard/forward, \u2018Big Body\u201d Roddy averaged 19.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG, AND 2.9 APG as a junior last season and can provide the Grizzlies with some depth at the ball-hander position and is a defensive mismatch against almost any guard.\n\n28. Golden State Warriors - Patrick Baldwin Jr. (Milwaukee)\n\nThe 2022 NBA Champions selected Milwaukee product and former top-five prospect Patrick Baldwin Jr. who missed most of the 2021-22 season with a reaggravated ankle injury. While his health has been the main question, the Warriors see a long-term project in Baldwin with tons of potential and if given the time to heal and develop properly will pay dividends a few years down the line.\n\nRound Two:\n\n31. Indiana Pacers - Andrew Nembhard (Gonzaga, Florida)\n\nAndrew Nembhard, who began his career at Florida but spent the last two seasons with Gonzaga as a two-time All-WCC selection, was the first selection of the second round. Nembhard was named the WCC Tournament MVP as the 6-foot-5 guard averaged 11.8 PPG, 3.4 RPG, and 5.8 APG during his senior season while leading the Bulldogs to a 23rd consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance.\n\n44. Traded to Golden State Warriors - Ryan Rollins (Toledo)\n\nDrafted by Atlanta with the forty-fourth pick but traded to the Warriors was Toledo\u2019s 2021-22 All-MAC selection Ryan Rollins who averaged 18.9 PPG, 6 RPG, and 3.6 APG for the Rockets as a sophomore. Rollins spent two seasons in Ohio also earning the conference 2020-21 Rookie of the Year as a 30-game starter and will bring to Golden State an athletic scorer who is versatile with the ball in his hands.\n\n45. Traded to Minnesota Timberwolves - Josh Minott (Memphis)\n\nAnother former top-50 prospect went off the board as the Charlotte Hornets selected Memphis freshman Josh Minott before trading him to the Timberwolves minutes after the selection. In 33 appearances for the Tigers, Minott averaged just 6.6 PPG, 3.8 RPG, and .9 APG, but the 6-foot-8 forward is a raw talent and has all the intangibles to become a solid NBA forward.\n\n47. Memphis Grizzlies - Vince Williams Jr. (VCU)\n\nWith the forty-seventh pick in the Draft, Memphis selected VCU guard Vince Williams to pair with the earlier trade additions of Jake LaRavia and David Roddy. A two-time All-A-10 selection, Williams averaged 14.1 PPG, 6 RPG, and 3 APG during his senior season as the Rams leading scorer and rebounder despite listing at just 6-foot-6 and 210lbs.\n\n51. Traded to Atlanta Hawks - Tyrese Martin (UConn, Rhode Island)\n\nAs the final former mid-major prospect to be selected in the NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors selected UConn standout Tyrese Martin with the fifty-first pick before trading him away to the Atlanta Hawks. While Martin spent the last two seasons with the Huskies earning a 2022 All-Big East Tournament selection, the Allentown, PA native played at Rhode Island averaging 12.8 PPG, 7 RPG, and 1.1 APG as a sophomore before joining former Rhode Island head coach Dan Hurley in Connecticut."}, {"url": "https://wccsports.com/news/2021/6/15/cross-country-wcc-announces-2020-21-year-end-major-honors.aspx", "page_content": "2021 WCC YEAR-END MAJOR HONORS\n\nMIKE GILLERAN SCHOLAR-ATHLETES OF THE YEAR\n\nWCC POSTGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nWCC STUDENT-ATHLETE SPORTSMANSHIP AWARDS\n\n#WCCREPRESENT AWARD\n\nAt the conclusion of each academic year, the West Coast Conference announces its major individual year-end honors as a celebration of the best and brightest to represent the Conference and its member institutions.Today, the West Coast Conference is pleased to announce the 2021and the #.

After struggling in round two of the NCAA Regionals and with the Toreros very much in contention for a trip to the national tournament, Bisharat approached the coaching staff and asked to be substituted in the final round. His replacement performed well and the Toreros advanced due in no small part to the selflessness displayed by Bisharat.After learning she would be unable to compete as a senior due to career-ending medical issues, Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir remained involved by dedicating her senior season to assisting the program in a myriad of ways.

In 2006-07, he served as the head coach of the San Francisco-based California Victory, the first European-owned professional soccer team in the United Soccer Leagues.\n\nLaid a foundation for national prominence\n\nImage Haley Carroll One of volleyball\u2019s top all-time defensive players, Carroll\u2019s 2,089 digs rank first on USF\u2019s all-time career list, nearly 400 more than her closest competition. She was a three-time All-WCC player who made the first team in 2007 and 2009. Carroll played on USF\u2019s 2008 NCAA Tournament team, which finished 22-8 overall and 11-3 in the WCC. In 2007, she was named the WCC\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nHartford was the first NCAA Championship qualifier for USF Women\u2019s Track and Field, racing in the 5,000-meters competition in 2008.

Hartford was also a two-time WCC All-Academic selection in 2004 and 2007.\n\nShe was an inaugural member of USF\u2019s Cross Country team and helped to lay the foundation for the program\u2019s rise to national prominence. She was selected team MVP three times and set school records in the 5,000-meters and 10,000-meters competitions\n\nAll the way to NCAA sweet 16\n\nImage Bill Nepfel Nepfel and his wife Mary Hile-Nepfel, co-coached some of the most successful women\u2019s basketball teams in USF history. During a 13-year stretch from 1987 to 2000, the Dons compiled a 196-166 (.541) record, winning outright or sharing three WCC titles and taking home three WCC Tournament titles. Nepfel\u2019s Dons were especially dominant from 1994 to 1997, compiling a superb 73-19 (.793) record and making three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nIn 1995-96, Nepfel and the Dons made a Cinderella run into the NCAA Tournament\u2019s top 16 teams, with upsets over No. 16-ranked Florida and No. 13-ranked North Carolina. A two-time WCC Coach of the Year (1989-90; 1994-95), Nepfel was also named the National Association of Basketball Coaches District VIII Coach of the Year in 1994-95 and was a finalist for national coach of the year honors.\n\nNepfel continued to serve USF as associate athletic director for compliance and academic services from 2000 to 2007, after retiring from coaching.\n\nKnow someone with a powerful USF story?

Rutherford, who says he has always been a writer, has played a major role in theater at Gonzaga on campus. During his sophomore year, he attended a Gonzaga University Theater Sports (GUTS) practice and discovered his passion for the arts. He teamed with classmate Michael Barfield to develop \u201cBoone Street Hooligans,\u201d a sketch comedy that sold out its first show in fall 2012 and remains popular. In September, the group performed at the Sketchfest Seattle Competition. Rutherford\u2019s first full-length play was \u201cFrozen Dinner,\u201d staged in fall 2013. With the support of seven actors and the Gonzaga community, the play became a campus hit. \u201cPeople were endlessly supportive, and I was brought to tears after one of the shows because I was overwhelmed by the power of love and people\u2019s generosity of spirit,\u201d he said. Finally, Rutherford wrote and directed the short film \u201cWhat They Bought\u201d last month, shot by classmate and broadcast major Andy Bayley. Rutherford plans to continue writing and creating stories through words and film. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled by the idea of telling stories, making movies, and collaborating with other artists for the rest of my life, but I\u2019m equally thrilled by the prospect of my life being pulled in a direction I\u2019ve yet to imagine,\u201d he said.\n\nMariel Rodriguez: Person for Others\n\nMariel Rodriguez is a triple major, Gates Scholar, and a first-generation college student, and the achievements for her are just beginning. This fall, she will attend graduate school at Columbia University to pursue a master\u2019s degree in sociomedical sciences, a discipline that focuses on the social determinants of disease and health, including factors such as discrimination, stigma, and poverty. It\u2019s a career path much different than what she had envisioned as a freshman. \u201cI always dreamed of being a doctor when I was young. Probably midway through my second year at Gonzaga I realized that I didn\u2019t know if that was the right thing for me, even though I knew I was super passionate about health,\u201d said Rodriguez, from Moses Lake, Wash. This realization led Rodriguez to the study abroad experience of a lifetime \u2014 studying public health Southern India, Argentina, and South Africa through the prestigious International Honors Program. The program teaches students about the influence of culture, community, and globalization on people\u2019s health. The program also will allow Rodriguez to continue her passion for studying abroad and a certificate in global health. She will spend six months abroad in a Third World country looking at some determinants of health. Rodriguez says Gonzaga has truly taught her how to be a person for others.\n\nAmy Doneen: First Graduate of Gonzaga\u2019s Doctor of Nursing Practice Program\n\nAmy Doneen, an international thought leader in cardiovascular disease risk assessment and treatment with a focus on women\u2019s heart health, is the first graduate of Gonzaga\u2019s Doctor of Nursing Practice program. She is the owner and medical director of the Heart Attack & Stroke Prevention Center in Spokane, and co-founder of the Bale/Doneen Method of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes prevention. Doneen has given more than 600 presentations to medical groups worldwide since 2002. She previously earned from Gonzaga a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, a Master\u2019s of Science in Nursing, and an Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner degree (summa cum laude). Amy returned to Gonzaga upon the opening of the Doctor of Nursing Practice Program in 2012.\n\nThe Doctor of Nursing Practice Program aims to deliver clinical practice leaders who practice and live as people for others. The program, part of the nursing department in Gonzaga\u2019s School of Nursing and Human Physiology, develops students who serve as champions of change within complex healthcare systems. Doneen is a shining example of someone who lives out this mission and affects the healthcare industry for the better.\n\nThe program offers a Post-Master\u2019s DNP pathway and a new Post-Baccalaureate DNP pathway, which has Family Nurse Practitioner, Adult/Geriatric Nurse Practitioner, and Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner tracks.\n\nROTC Officer to Commission Wife\n\nZach Ogorek, a 2013 Gonzaga honors alumnus and commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, had the honor of commissioning wife Briana Ogorek as an officer during the ROTC Commissioning Ceremony. Zach met Briana, an international relations major, in Gonzaga\u2019s ROTC program in the first week of her freshman year. \u201cThe first time we talked was after a 10K ruck march and I just remember thinking \u2018OK, if he\u2019s talking to me when I\u2019m like this, then he\u2019s a pretty cool guy,\u2019 \u201d Briana said. They started dating a month later and backpacked together through Eastern Europe in the summer after her freshman year. Zach visited Briana in Paris during her sophomore study abroad experience. He proposed in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris and they were married May 18, 2013 at St. Aloysius Church \u2014 where Zach commissioned Briana an officer on May 9. Now they will take a late honeymoon in Greece. Then Briana will train in South Carolina before joining Zach in Fairbanks, Alaska where they will both be in the U.S. Army Finance Corps. Briana\u2019s ROTC experience also took her to Tunisia where she spent a month teaching English to members of the Tunisian military. \u201cBeing in ROTC at Gonzaga has definitely shaped who I am today,\u201d she said. \u201cI have made amazing friends over the past four years that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll stay in touch with.\u201d\n\nHonors Student Tucker Keuter Finds Harmony in Math, Music\n\nTucker Keuter has accepted a full scholarship to the Ph.D. program in biostatistics at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee.\n\nTucker Keuter, who conducted Gonzaga\u2019s band during men\u2019s basketball games and played trombone for the women\u2019s games, has always had an affinity for mathematics and music. The twin pursuits have brought success and personal harmony to the senior honors student from Albany, Ore., who has accepted a scholarship to the Ph.D. program in biostatistics at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee. \u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a full ride with a stipend for living expenses.\u201d When Keuter came to Gonzaga four years ago, he began a double major in biology and music composition \u2014 planning to go to medical school and become a physician. Instead, his love for math led him toward a double major in math and economics.\n\nTo satisfy his musical passion, he has played in Gonzaga\u2019s band for four years. In addition, he played in Gonzaga\u2019s Jazz Combos and Jazz Ensembles, which offered an ideal performance outlet for math, science and engineering majors (students of all majors are welcome) who love music.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of people coming in (to Gonzaga) who had success in math and physics in high school so they are becoming engineers or quantitative scientists, but they are still wanting to continue music because it\u2019s fun and they get a lot of pleasure out of it,\u201d Keuter said. \u201cThey want to keep playing but they don\u2019t want to do it as a career \u2014 they want to do, for example, math or engineering as a career.\u201d Music, he said, is both an art and a science. \u201cThere\u2019s this correlation between doing music and being good at math,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are studies out there that say success in both goes hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nKeuter aims to eventually teach in college. First, however, he wants to gain experience in the real-world application of biostatistics. Doing so, he believes, will make the material he teaches far more accessible to students.\n\nLauren Ferguson Develops Original Research\n\nLauren Ferguson\u2019s presentation of original research at the Spokane Intercollegiate Research Conference last month was the product of a year\u2019s work.\n\nA sociology major, Ferguson presented her research findings on the children of divorced parents in a presentation titled, \u201cTwo Negatives Equal a Positive: Exploring How Middle-Class Young Adult Children of Divorce Benefit in Relationships.\u201d Her study focused on how children of divorce use their experiences to improve their own intimate relationships.\n\n\u201cThe typical lessons came down to seeing the relationships they wanted to avoid,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThey learned that they wanted more time before marriage and moving in together, less time at work, more family time, better communication and honesty.\u201d\n\nFerguson, who began working on the project almost a year ago, interviewed 10 women and four men between ages 18-22. She found that a family\u2019s financial strength plays a major role in how children move forward from a divorce. The majority of her subjects came from middle- to upper-middle-class backgrounds that allowed them to grow up in environments where they could learn from divorce. She found that a key benefit of children living in dual households was they understood both parents\u2019 perspectives.\n\nFerguson plans to earn a master\u2019s in sociology at Portland State University and will continue to conduct research and possibly teach.\n\nAlanna Archer Found Her Passion in Classical Studies\n\nAlanna Archer, a double major in classical civilizations and political science with a minor in international relations, will combine her three degree disciplines to pursue a master\u2019s degree in ancient history at the University of St. Andrew\u2019s in Scotland \u2014 one of Britain\u2019s top universities. The native of Issaquah, Wash., who has completed two theses this year, aims to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in either ancient history or museum studies. \u201cI plan to either become a college professor or a museum curator, though I have a preference for teaching,\u201d she said. Archer took part in the 2012 Gonzaga-in-Turkey study abroad program and found her passion at Gonzaga, the story of the ancient world, said Andrew Goldman, associate professor of history and chair of classical civilizations. Archer was involved in many clubs at Gonzaga, including GEO, Boundless and the Residence Hall Association, and served on the executive board for both GEO and RHA. In addition, she taught ballroom dance through Boundless for a year and a half.\n\nStudent-Athletes Achieve\n\nMen\u2019s soccer player Nick Hamer and women\u2019s basketball player Haiden Palmer were honored April 28 as Gonzaga\u2019s Male and Female Senior Athletes of the Year, respectively, at the annual Evening of Excellence awards ceremony. Basketball player Drew Barham and rower Naseeb Bhangal are the Male and Female Scholar Athletes of the year, respectively. Baseball pitcher Karl Myers earned the Leadership Award, and baseball and women\u2019s soccer teams share the championship of P.R.I.D.E., a friendly competition among Gonzaga\u2019s 16 varsity athletic teams to promote fellowship, community service, and academic achievement.\n\nAlso, 20 student-athletes were inducted into Gonzaga\u2019s chapter of Chi Alpha Sigma, the national college athlete honor society. The following seniors inducted into Chi Alpha Sigma have maintained a minimum 3.4 cumulative grade-point-average while earning a varsity letter: Sarah Atkins, rowing; Drew Barham, basketball; Krista Beyer, cross-country and track; Naseeb Bhangal, rowing; Brian Bhaskar, basketball; Meghan Blanchet, cross-country and track; Michelle Davis, cross-country, track; Scott Davis, cross-country, track; Emily Eckmann, soccer; Brent Felnagle, cross-country, track; Muzeen Ismath, tennis; Madison Keaty, rowing; Joe LaMontagne, cross-country, track; Malori McGill, rowing; Pablo Mosquera-Perez, tennis; Karl Myers, baseball; Ali Ohashi, soccer; Andrew Owenson, soccer; Jordan Schroeder, rowing; Jennifer Wheeler, cross-country, track.\n\nHamer was named the West Coast Conference men\u2019s soccer Player of the Year this past season for leading the Bulldogs to a third-place WCC finish, their highest since 2008. A two-time All-WCC first-team selection, he was a second-team pick as a sophomore and was named to the WCC All-Freshman team in 2010.\n\nPalmer was named an Associated Press All-America honorable mention this year, ending her career as a three-time All-WCC selection. She was named the 2012 WCC Newcomer of the Year and the 2013 WCC Tournament Most Outstanding Player. She was the 29th overall pick in the 2014 WNBA Draft, selected by the Indiana Fever.\n\nBarham joined the Gonzaga men\u2019s basketball team in 2012 as a University of Memphis graduate. He volunteered at numerous events and attained a perfect 4.0 GPA twice in his four semesters at GU while earning a master\u2019s degree in organizational leadership. He appeared in all 35 games for the Bulldogs this past season. Known for his 3-point ability, he went on three goodwill tours with Athletes in Action, including last summer\u2019s tour to Lithuania. He was nominated for the Lowe\u2019s Senior Class Award and the 2014 Allstate NABC and WBCA Good Works Teams for his efforts on and off the court.\n\nBhangal, a double major in psychology and political science, earned a 3.95 GPA and received President\u2019s List honors every semester. She was inducted into the Gonzaga chapters of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit Honor Society, and the Gonzaga Multi-Cultural Honor Society, and completed Gonzaga\u2019s Comprehensive Leadership program.\n\nMyers graduates with a degree in physical education and a 3.46 GPA. He has been on the Dean\u2019s List three times and the President\u2019s List twice. During his five years on Gonzaga\u2019s baseball team, Myers pitched 33 innings and spent countless hours supporting community outreach initiatives. He exemplifies the Jesuit philosophy of service.\n\nWomen\u2019s basketball seniors Jazmine Redmon, Stephanie Golden and Danielle Walter earned their degrees and walked in the Undergraduate Commencement May 11 at the Spokane Arena. Their junior teammates Sunny Greinacher and Lindsay Sherbert also earned their undergraduate degrees and took part in the ceremony.\n\nKevin Downs to Deliver Law School Student Response\n\nKevin Downs, the student speaker at the Gonzaga Law School commencement on Saturday, May 10, has accepted a judicial clerkship with the Montana Supreme Court starting in August. A native of Helena, Mont., and graduate of Carroll College, Downs spent nearly two years in Belfast, Northern Ireland, managing a L\u2019Arche community for adults with disabilities. He then moved to Trujillo, Honduras, where he worked for nearly three years as an adolescent program coordinator for a Catholic orphanage run by the Franciscan Sisters of Central American. He returned to Montana in 2008 and worked for the Montana Department of Justice before choosing to attend Gonzaga Law School as a Thomas More Scholar. During law school, he was a member of the Gonzaga Law Review and participated on the Phillip C. Jessup Cup Moot Court Team in his second year and the National Moot Court team this past fall; both teams were regional semifinalists. Downs also worked for two years as a law clerk at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Spokane. He spent two months last summer working for the International Institute of the Bay Area in Oakland, Calif., where he helped crime victims. In addition, he worked as a graduate assistant for the Gonzaga University Institute for Hate Studies, and has completed five ultra-marathons \u2014 among many other accomplishments.\n\nEngineering Graduates Receive Cheers\n\nGonzaga cheerleaders Becca Ryan, from Denver, and Cat Truong, from Spokane, were in the somewhat unusual position of receiving cheers instead of leading them when they graduated. Truong received an electrical engineering degree while Ryan earned a degree in civil engineering. They have heard all the clich\u00e9s about cheerleaders, but these Zags \u2014 outstanding students \u2014 smash that stereotype. \u201cWe\u2019re as intellectual as anybody else,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cBy no means do we have a stereotypical \u2018dumb cheerleader,\u2019\u201d said Sam Wyss, a junior cheerleader and philosophy major from Denver. \u201cWe have a lot of really intelligent girls and guys.\u201d Truong and Ryan say cheerleading has provided a welcome complement to the rigors of their studies, and opportunities to engage with students with diverse academic pursuits and interests. For students to get the most from Gonzaga, they must take advantage of the many rich experiences beyond academics that add so much texture to their lives, they say. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about academics,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou are coming here to find out who you are. I wouldn\u2019t be the person that I am without this team.\u201d\n\nMore Power to Suriname\n\nThe Gonzaga School of Engineering and Applied Science is improving the Suriname power grid. Several engineers from Suriname Energy, the national power utility in Suriname, South America, have taken courses in Gonzaga\u2019s online power engineering program. Four of the Suriname engineers completed their master\u2019s of engineering in transmission and distribution degrees and took part in the ceremony. The graduates \u2014 Shung Tak Chan, Claudia Veldkamp, Robert Pancham and Fornelio Forster \u2014 say Gonzaga\u2019s program has had a significant impact on the Suriname power grid and will help them plan better for the country\u2019s future power needs. The Suriname engineers are the first international students to graduate from the program, which also includes engineers from Europe, Africa and Asia. Gonzaga\u2019s online courses have allowed international students to build networking relationships with engineers throughout North America."}, {"url": "https://pepperdinewaves.com/news/2023/4/26/mens-tennis-de-jonge-named-co-player-of-the-year-four-waves-make-the-all-wcc-team", "page_content": "MALIBU, Calif. \u2014 Highlighted by senior Daniel De Jonge winning the co-West Coast Conference's Player of the Year Award, the #37 Pepperdine men's tennis team was well-represented in the all-conference awards, which were announced by the league office on Wednesday.\n\nDe Jonge (Vlissingen, Netherlands) earned not one, but three awards from the conference: He split the co-WCC's Player of the Year award with Portland's Sema Pankin, yet he also earned first-team honors in singles and first-team honors in doubles with fellow senior Tim Zeitvogel (Baden-Baden, Germany). Aside from De Jonge, Zeitvogel made the first team in singles, Eero Vasa (Turku, Finland) made the second team, Maxi Homberg (Freising, Germany) was an all-conference honorable mention in singles, plus Homberg and Vasa earned honorable mention honors in doubles.\n\nDe Jonge is the 12th Wave to earn the WCC Player of the Year award and the first since Alex Sarkissian earned the award in 2014. The senior, currently ranked 64th in the latest ITA national polls had a perfect 6-0 record in WCC singles play, with only two of those matches needing a third set. Additionally, he and fellow senior Tim Zeitvogel teamed up to be the highest-ranked doubles team in the conference all season. The duo currently ranks 54th in the nation.\n\nZeitvogel's first-team all-WCC selection is the second time he has earned that honor and the fourth all-conference award of his career. The graduate student from Baden-Baden, Germany, who ranks 122nd in the latest ITA polls, earned WCC Player of the Week honors in singles once and doubles three times this season.\n\nVasa's all-conference second-team nod was an improvement over his honorable mention selection last season. The senior was a mainstay for the Waves on the third line, where he picked up three wins in conference play.\n\nWinning the first all-conference award of his career, Homberg had a 7-1 record in WCC play while playing anywhere from courts three through five. The freshman from Freising, Germany enters the conference tournament on a five-match win streak.\n\nVasa and Homberg also earned honorable mention honors for their efforts in doubles. The duo notched four victories as Pepperdine's number two team during conference play.\n\nSan Diego swept the other major awards, as head coach Ryan Keckley was named Coach of the Year and Ollie Tarvet earned Freshman of the Year honors.\n\nNEXT UP: As the 2-seed in the West Coast Conference tournament, Pepperdine has a first-round bye and will play either 3-seed Santa Clara or 6-seed Saint Mary's on Friday, April 28 at 1 p.m. This year, the conference tournament is held at the Aztec Tennis Center in San Diego, Calif.\n\nFollow @PeppTennis on Facebook and Twitter for immediate updates, results and more.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nKhalil Shabazz tried to stay positive when he signed with Central Washington University in spring 2017. The Division II Wildcats weren\u2019t the Pac-12 program he had daydreamed about, but at least they were covering most of his tuition and giving him a chance to play college basketball.\n\n\u201cI figured I was going to get my degree from there,\u201d said Shabazz, who enrolled at CWU for a simple reason: It was his only scholarship offer at any level. \u201cI was going to be there for the next four years, try to play as well as possible and get my jersey retired there. That was the goal.\u201d\n\nA half-decade later, Shabazz is poised to graduate with a communications degree from USF. With a quick first step, sound defense and smooth shooting stroke, Shabazz has helped bring excitement back to the Hilltop not seen since the Dons terminated the program in the early 1980s for rules violations. That shutdown lasted just three years, but the aftershocks yielded a lack of banners at the Sobrato Center since.\n\nThursday night\u2019s first-round matchup against No. 7 seed Murray State in Indianapolis marks USF\u2019s first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1998. If the 10th-seeded Dons beat a Racers team that hasn\u2019t lost in almost three months, they will reach the second round for the first time in 43 years.\n\nHad a Division II school in a rural area 100 miles southeast of Seattle just kept its head coach in 2018, USF might not be in this position. Shabazz didn\u2019t decide to leave CWU until the Wildcats fired Greg Sparling \u2014 the man who had kept Shabazz\u2019s basketball career alive \u2014 after 24 seasons, 385 wins and five conference championships.\n\nCaleb Dunlop, Central Washington athletics\n\nBy subsequently blossoming into a two-time Second Team All-WCC selection at USF, Shabazz unintentionally sent an important message to anyone who didn\u2019t land a Division I offer out of high school: Division II can be just as much of a springboard as any junior college.\n\nAccording to the NCAA, no more than 12 players had transferred from Division II to Division I in a year as of 2017. With 50 Division II players transferring up a level this season, schools like CWU are viable options for anyone not ready to give up on their big-time college basketball dreams.\n\nShabazz isn\u2019t the only such player in this year\u2019s tournament. Creighton forward Ryan Hawkins \u2014 a grad transfer from Division II Northwest Missouri State \u2014 enters Thursday\u2019s first-round game against San Diego State averaging a team-high 13.9 points and 7.8 rebounds. They join a growing list of Division II success stories that includes Miami Heat guard Max Strus (Lewis, DePaul) and Boston Celtics guard Derrick White (Colorado-Colorado Springs, Colorado).\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t give DII much love, but it\u2019s a high level of basketball,\u201d said Shabazz, averaging a team-high 19.8 points over his past eight games. \u201cThere were probably five guys on my team at Central who could\u2019ve played Division I if things had just gone a bit differently for them.\u201d\n\nSantiago Mejia / The Chronicle\n\nUnlike many other overqualified Division II players who suffered from a lack of prep recruiting interest, Shabazz played at a powerhouse high school program. The Rainier Beach (Wash.) Vikings tout more than a half-dozen current or former NBA players as alums. Almost every year, they vie for a state title as Power-5 coaches sit courtside.\n\nNCAA Tournament First Round Who: 10th-seeded USF (24-9) vs. 7th-seeded Murray State (30-2) When: 6:40 p.m. Thursday TV:Channel: 5Channel: 13Channel: 46 Radio: 1050 See More Collapse\n\nShabazz\u2019s time there was no exception. Rainier Beach reached the state championship in each of his four varsity seasons, winning it all his freshman and junior years. As a senior, Shabazz averaged 15 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals per game, earning second-team honors in one of the nation\u2019s most loaded prep leagues.\n\nSeveral Division I coaches were in the stands when he scored 47 points \u2014 the second-most in Vikings history behind NBA All-Star Dejounte Murray \u2014 in an overtime win over rival O\u2019Dea. Even then, Shabazz received almost no interest.\n\nWhy? He was a 5-foot-11, 160-pound guard with a limited vertical leap. Even coaches from such mid-major conferences as the Big Sky and WAC were reluctant to offer someone who didn\u2019t look the part of a Division I player. But Division II and Division III programs also barely contacted Shabazz; many assumed he was bound for a higher level.\n\nMany nights, he struggled to sleep as fears raced through his mind: What if he didn\u2019t get any offers? What would life look like without basketball?\n\nMaking matters even more frustrating was that a lot of his friends had offers from big-name programs. Shabazz, who spent his summers with AAU blueblood Seattle Rotary, estimated that more than two dozen teammates earned Division I scholarships during his time at Rainier Beach.\n\n\u201cIt was a total size thing,\u201d said Sparling, who now coaches Khalil\u2019s older brother, Shadeed, at Alaska-Fairbanks. \u201cEveryone wants the longer, leaner guys. If he had been two or three inches taller, we wouldn\u2019t have been in the equation.\u201d\n\nCWU\u2019s program isn\u2019t fully funded, which meant Sparling had to get creative \u2014 some financial aid here, a merit scholarship there \u2014 just to cover three-fourths of Shabazz\u2019s tuition. But even if he had to take out student loans, Shabazz intended to build a lasting legacy in Ellensburg, Wash.\n\nCaleb Dunlop, Central Washington athletics\n\nFor a while, he was well on his way. That March, after averaging a team-high 15.3 points per game and being named the Great Northwest Athletic Conference\u2019s Freshman of the Year, Shabazz ignored buddies\u2019 pleas for him to gauge interest from Division I teams.\n\nOnly after Sparling\u2019s firing did Shabazz finally enter the transfer portal. In Shabazz, the Dons\u2019 analytics-driven staff saw someone whose playing style \u2014 relentless one-on-one defense, efficient shooting, vocal leadership \u2014 hinted at rotation potential in the WCC.\n\nWhat they soon realized when Shabazz started practicing, however, was that his upside was higher still. He ranks third in USF history in 3-pointers (203) and fourth in steals (162). Head coach Todd Golden called him the team\u2019s heartbeat. Shabazz\u2019s backcourt partner, Jamaree Bouyea, goes further: \u201cKhalil is this team\u2019s identity in a lot of ways. He makes sure we play with that chip on our shoulder.\u201d\n\nShabazz must decide whether to return for another year of eligibility the NCAA granted players because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should he opt to leave, he would garner attention from higher-profile programs and overseas teams.\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking me, \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019\u201d Shabazz said. \u201cBut, honestly, that\u2019s not even on my mind right now. A few years ago, I was at a DII. Now I\u2019m about to play in March Madness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned to just appreciate the journey. You never know what can happen.\u201d\n\nConnor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

In 1978, he ranked in the top-10 nationally and first in the Ivy League in rush attempts (273), rushing yards (1,396), yards per attempt (5.1), rushing touchdowns (16), plays from scrimmage (283) and yards from scrimmage (1,427). The team leader in rushing yards and scoring in 1978, Holland joined Hall of Famer Ed Marinaro as the only running back with multiple 200-yard, four-touchdown games in school history. Holland\u2019s 263-yard performance in a 35-17 win over Penn ranks fourth in Cornell\u2019s record book. A Third Team All-America and First Team All-Ivy selection, he set a school record for rushing attempts in a game (55) and ranks eighth in school history in career rushing yards (1,755) and career rushing touchdowns (18). Holland was inducted into the Cornell Athletics Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Academic All-America Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\n\n\nA two-time First Team Academic All-American, Holland compiled a 3.67 GPA in history and English and was a member of Phi Eta Sigma and Quill and Dagger. A member of the Dean\u2019s List for five semesters, he was given the Victor Grohmann Scholar-Athlete Award as the team\u2019s most outstanding scholar-athlete. Holland was the founding member and chairman of the Black Athletic Association and served as a student representative for the Committee for International Student Affairs and the Committee on Special Education Projects.\n\n\n\nHolland is a real estate developer, ordained minister, Harlem-based attorney and civic leader with 25 years of experience working in prominent organizations in law, business and government. As President of Holland Horizon Group, a developer of mixed-use, church-affiliated real estate projects, he will soon complete The Lenox, the first large, unsubsidized, residential condominium in Harlem. After earning his J.D. from Harvard, Holland relocated to Harlem where he established a real estate law practice and a holistic outreach ministry. He became legal counsel to Christ Community Church of Harlem and was ordained by its pastor, the late Rev. Linnette Williamson. He served as co-pastor and started Harkhomes, a shelter for homeless men. Stemming from his work with the homeless, Holland conceived Holistic Hardware, a life and job skills program for restoring lives in crisis.\n\n\n\nHolland also served in government, beginning as Director and General Counsel to the New York State Senate Committee on Housing and Community Development. He was subsequently New York State Housing Commissioner, where he managed more than 1,500 employees and orchestrated the planning and funding of thousands of units of affordable housing in various locations across New York State. Holland has been active as a spokesman for the Verizon's Life's Playbook program, speaking at high schools, business forums and educational conferences across the United States about success strategies for today's youth.\n\n\n\nHolland served on Cornell's Board of Trustees for 12 years before being appointed Trustee Emeritus. He has received awards and honors for both his business and social service accomplishments. In 2006, he was recognized by the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce with its annual Community Service Award. In 1993, President Bill Clinton recognized Holland in a White House ceremony for his community-building initiatives. In 1992, the United States Small Business Administration named him Minority Small Business Advocate of the Year for New York State. In 1991, Holland was honored with President George Bush's Volunteer Action Award and with New York City's Entrepreneur of the Year Award.

Though Cameron Indoor Stadium was closed on that summer afternoon in 2006, Jamaree saw enough on campus to promise himself he would play big-time college basketball.\n\nThe University of San Francisco, where he landed after it was the only Division I school to offer him a scholarship, hasn\u2019t qualified as a blueblood program like Duke in almost half a century. But thanks to Bouyea\u2019s decision to return for a fifth and final year of eligibility, the Dons are on the cusp of their first NCAA Tournament berth since 1998.\n\nWith a top-20 defense, a KenPom ranking of 23 and a 10-6 record in WCC play, USF is well-positioned for an at-large bid. A win Saturday night in the conference tournament quarterfinals might be all it needs to solidify its resum\u00e9.\n\nThis is no small feat for a program that has toiled in relative anonymity since the Dons brought back men\u2019s basketball in 1985 after a three-year, self-imposed shutdown because of rampant rules violations. Even when USF secured its last March Madness berth by upsetting Gonzaga in the 1998 WCC tournament championship game, it was only .500 in conference play.\n\nBy helping restore the once-proud program on the Hilltop to national relevance, Bouyea has earned a place in Dons lore alongside such all-time greats as Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Phil Smith and Bill Cartwright. A two-time first-team All-WCC selection, Bouyea, 22, ranks first in program history in wins (97) and games played (157), second in made 3-pointers (242), third in steals (200) and assists (413), and eighth in points (1,659).\n\nNearly four months from now, he should become USF\u2019s first NBA draft pick since Guy Williams in 1983. With deep shooting range, deceptive speed and solid body control, Bouyea is projected to go anywhere between the late first and mid-second round.\n\n\u201cHe just looks like a different player to me,\u201d said Aran Smith, founder of NBAdraft.net. \u201cBefore this season, he never really stood out as an NBA-level guy. And then all of a sudden, this year it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow, he really jumps off the screen with his quickness, 3-point shooting and confidence to run the team.\u2019\u201d\n\nMid-major standouts tend to move on to bigger programs, but Bouyea is a case study in the value of returning to school for the fifth season of eligibility the NCAA granted players because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA year ago, after blossoming into the Dons\u2019 go-to option, Bouyea could have joined more than 1,700 players in the transfer portal. Almost any Power Five school would have relished the chance to add a point guard of his caliber.\n\nBut as Bouyea mulled over his options with his parents at their Salinas-area home, he didn\u2019t even mention transferring. The Dons were the lone Division I school to gamble on a 5-foot-11, 155-pound 17-year-old from an area more known for John Steinbeck novels than basketball. If Bouyea were to leave the Hilltop, it would only be for pro opportunities.\n\nAnd those were limited. After a COVID-19 outbreak forced USF to pause all team-related activities for two weeks midway through last season, it went 1-6 the rest of the way, finishing three games below .500 and torpedoing Bouyea\u2019s draft stock.\n\nScouts took issue with his inconsistent jumper and lack of athleticism. Without more college film for NBA teams to study, Bouyea would likely be bound for the G League or overseas.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think coming back to college was probably the best decision I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said Bouyea, who is averaging 17 points per game on 47.9% shooting (39.2% from 3-point range), 4.1 assists and 5.0 rebounds. \u201cNot only did I give myself a chance to experience March Madness, but I grew a lot as a player and as a person.\u201d\n\nBouyea also gave prospective teammates more incentive to sign with USF. After he told coach Todd Golden last spring that he was returning, the Dons lured five transfers to the Hilltop with a simple pitch: play with one of the conference\u2019s best guards and compete for an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nOne of those new arrivals, forward Yauhen Massalski, was honored alongside Bouyea this week as a First Team All-WCC selection. When Massalski \u2014 a former starter at WCC rival San Diego \u2014 first got on campus last summer, he noticed how Bouyea arrived to the Sobrato Center early in the morning to get up shots, then returned late at night to get up more.\n\nThis offered Massalski and the rest of the Dons\u2019 newcomers a sort of blueprint. When players couldn\u2019t get into the gym because another USF team had reserved it, they often texted Bouyea for help finding a free court.\n\nThree weeks ago, after the Dons surrendered a late 7-0 run to fall at home to Portland by one point, teammates saw Bouyea sitting at his locker stall in silence. For several minutes, he reflected on all that had gone wrong. Then, Bouyea stood up and told several players, \u201cWe can\u2019t have any more bad losses like this if we want to make the Tournament. Things need to change.\u201d\n\nHis message resonated. Since then, USF\u2019s only losses have been to No. 19 Saint Mary\u2019s and No. 1 Gonzaga.\n\n\u201cJamaree\u2019s always been a lead-by-example guy,\u201d guard Khalil Shabazz said. \u201cBut over the past year or so, he\u2019s definitely become more of a vocal leader. When he talks, people listen.\u201d\n\nA half-decade ago, the notion Bouyea might lead an NCAA Tournament contender might have surprised. His only college scholarship offers when he finished his senior season at Palma High School in Salinas were from Division II Cal State East Bay and Fresno Pacific. Even nearby Cal State Monterey Bay, where his father worked and his older brother played, didn\u2019t offer him a spot.\n\nTo get Division I coaches\u2019 attention, Bouyea emailed highlight reels and participated in pickup games at Stanford, Fresno State, UC Davis \u2014 any runs he could find. Nothing worked. Emotionally drained, Bouyea thought about giving up basketball for good and enrolling at Arizona State or USC as a student.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of questions about whether he would ever be strong enough to compete at a high level in Division I,\u201d Golden \u2014 a Dons assistant at the time \u2014 said of Bouyea, who has since grown three inches and added 25 pounds. \u201cHe was a very productive player who won a lot, but he definitely didn\u2019t look the part.\u201d\n\nAbout a month before high school graduation, Bouyea finished a workout and saw he had a missed call from then-USF coach Kyle Smith. The Dons\u2019 staff had heard about Bouyea from the father of E.J. Rowland \u2014 a Palma alum who played under Smith at Saint Mary\u2019s \u2014 and been tracking the skinny sharpshooter for about eight months.\n\nAs soon as Bouyea got Smith on the phone and received a scholarship offer, he verbally committed. When Bouyea started practicing on the Hilltop months later, he learned that his new program had a storied history: two national titles in the mid-1950s; an alumni list headlined by two Hall of Famers; a 27-year run with 15 NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nBut as Bouyea gazed up at the Sobrato Center rafters, he noticed that all the Dons\u2019 March Madness appearances came before he was born.\n\n\u201cComing back for an additional year gave Jamaree a chance to leave a lasting legacy,\u201d Janine Bouyea said. \u201cI think that 7-year-old kid who was walking around Duke would be pretty happy with how everything worked out.\u201d\n\nConnor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Prior to her arrival, the Bulldogs had one WCC title and one NCAA/WNIT appearance to their name. When she departed, Gonzaga had advanced to a pair of WNITs (2004 first round, 2005 second round), earned a berth in the 2007 NCAA Tournament, won three consecutive WCC Championships (2005-07) and tied the school record with 28 victories in 2004-05. Over the course of her career, she was a 2007 Associated Press Honorable Mention All-American, the 2007 WCC Player of the Year, a two-time all-WCC first-team and all-academic team selection (2006-07), and a 2007 CoSIDA Academic All-District choice. Finishing with 1,231 points, she entered the 2022-23 campaign ranked 16th all-time in scoring in the Gonzaga record book.\n\n\n\n2020 - Heather Bowman, Gonzaga University\n\nHeather Bowman, a Spokane native, who starred at Lewis and Clark High School near the Gonzaga campus was recruited heavily by numerous Pac-12 programs. But, she didn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to continue her playing career for her hometown team. And what a career it was. Just months into her freshman season, Bowman helped the fledgling program start its ascent, scoring 11 points to help GU win its first game against a ranked opponent, beating No. 21 UCLA in the Rainbow Wahine Classic in Hawaii early in the year. From there it was nothing but history making for the Zags. During her time, GU knocked over more firsts with its first NCAA Tournament berth, first NCAA Tournament victory and first Sweet Sixteen appearance. Known for her consistency at all levels of basketball, Bowman concluded her four-year playing career as Gonzaga\u2019s all-time scoring leader with 2,165 career points. Among both men and women, Bowman ranks second in Gonzaga history in career points, trailing only Frank Burgess who scored 2,196 points nearly sixty years ago. The four-time First Team All-WCC selection not only broke the GU scoring record but was once the all-time leading scorer in West Coast Conference women\u2019s basketball history. Bowman ranks in the top-three all-time among Zags in games played, field goals made, field goal percentage, free throws made and rebounds.\n\n\n\nAs a freshman in 2006-07, she was named the WCC Newcomer of the Year as the Bulldogs reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history. Bowman followed up a strong first year campaign by being named the league\u2019s Player of the Year as a sophomore in 2008, where she averaged 20.1 points per game. As a senior in 2010, Bowman helped to lead the Bulldogs to their sixth-straight West Coast Conference regular-season title, and GU\u2019s first appearance in the Sweet Sixteen.\n\n\n\nAfter her playing career, Bowman was an assistant coach at Whitworth University from 2011- 2014 before returning back to Gonzaga where she served as the Video Coordinator from 2014- 16.\n\n\n\n2019 - Adam Morrison, Gonzaga University\n\nAdam Morrison\u2019s name was synonymous with college basketball in 2006. He adorned the front of magazines and had the country talking about his mane, mustache and Gonzaga basketball. He led the Bulldogs to a 29-4 overall record and a No. 5 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. For the eighth-straight year the Zags earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament - this time a third seed, after posting a perfect 14-0 record in the West Coast Conference regular-season and winning the WCC Tournament. Morrison led the nation in scoring in his last year, averaging 28.1 ppg, becoming only the second Gonzaga player ever to do so. Morrison was also Gonzaga\u2019s seventh John R. Wooden Award Player of the Year candidate and the fourth player to earn Wooden Award All-America honors. He was named Gonzaga\u2019s inaugural Associated Press preseason selection as a junior, and was a consensus Associated Press All-America First Team pick. Morrison also earned National Association of Basketball Coaches Co-Player of the Year and USBWA Oscar Robertson Trophy Co-Player of the Year accolades during 2006. A star player nationally, Morrison also dominated the West Coast Conference. He earned back-to-back WCC Tournament Most Valuable Player honors (2005, 2006) and was a two-time WCC First Team honoree. Morrison was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Year in 2006 after averaging 28.1 ppg and 5.5 rpg, along with a 49.6 field goal percentage, 77.2 free throw percentage and a 42.8 three-point percentage. Morrison was also a member of 2004 USA World Championship For Young Men Qualifying Team that earned a gold medal at the World Championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the summer of 2004. He averaged 8.2 ppg and 1.7 rpg in three games, missing the gold medal game because of a sore knee. Morrison, a childhood diabetic since age 12, has developed into a role model for children with diabetes to show they, too, can live a normal life. His father, John, organized an annual H-O-R-S-E Tournament in Spokane as a benefit for the American Diabetes Association. Morrison finished his career as the third-leading scorer in Gonzaga history with 1,867 points. He also ended his time at GU third in the career rankings for field goals made (659), fourth in free throws made (398) and ninth in three-point field goals made (127). Morrison\u2019s name is also scattered throughout the GU single-season rankings. He is first in single-season points (926 in 2006), field goals made (306 in 2006) and free throws made (240 in 2006). Morrison was drafted by the Charlotte Bobcats as the third pick overall in the 2006 draft; the highest selection ever for a Gonzaga player.\n\n\n\n2018 - Ronny Turiaf, Gonzaga University\n\nRonny Turiaf became one of the most beloved Zags of all-time not only because of his production, but for his love for Zag Nation, on-court passion, acrobatic dunks and many different hairstyles. A native of Martinique, by way of Paris, France, Turiaf became the face of the Gonzaga Bulldogs program during his four-year stay on the Spokane campus. In addition to his friendly smile and talk-to-everyone attitude, Turiaf helped the Bulldogs win 107 games and finish with three Top 10 national rankings in the final Associated Press poll during his four years. On the national scene, Turiaf was a two-time honorable mention Associated Press All-American. He also finished as a Top 30 Wooden Award Candidate as a junior and senior. Turiaf earned first-team All-West Coast Conference honors three times and was named the WCC Player of the Year in 2005 after averaging 15.9 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. He finished his career ranking fourth at Gonzaga with 1,723 points and 859 rebounds, including a career-high of 40 points (a McCarthey Athletic Center record at the time) in 2004. Turiaf shined on the biggest stages, averaging 16.7 points and 7.6 rebounds in seven NCAA tournament games, and 18.8 points and 7.8 rebounds in nine WCC Tournament games, along with being named the 2005 WCC Tournament Most Valuable Player. His marks on the Gonzaga record books go even deeper. Turiaf was the best Zag ever at not only getting to the free throw line, but making them count. He finished as the career leader with 643 free throws breaking the 44-year-old record of Frank Burgess, as well as free throws attempted at 899. Turiaf owns three of the top six marks for free throws made in a season, and the top mark for free throw made in a regular season game and free throws made in an NCAA Tournament game. After his prestigious career at GU, in June of 2005, Turiaf was selected in the second round of the NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. But, he had to place his NBA dreams on hold as he underwent surgery for a heart condition on July 26, 2005. The operation was successful and Turiaf rejoined the Lakers organization only six months later. He went on to have a 10-year NBA career, spending time with the Warriors, Knicks, Wizards, Clippers, Timberwolves and Heat, where helped win the 2012 NBA Championship.\n\n2017 - John Stockton, Gonzaga University\n\nSince taking the hardwood at Gonzaga more than 30 years ago, John Stockton and the small Jesuit University in Spokane have been linked. Stockton remains the player most closely related to the program as he has become one of the National Basketball Association's 50 Greatest Players of all-time, a James H. Naismith Hall of Fame selection and the NBA all-time leader in assists and steals. Stockton, a product of Spokane's Gonzaga Prep, played for the Bulldogs from the 1980-81 season through the 1983-84 season and finished his GU career as the first player to surpass the 1,000-point and 500-assist marks during their career. He was named the West Coast Athletic Conference Player of the Year after leading the league in scoring, assists and steals during his senior season of 1984. He also earned Associated Press All-America Honorable Mention accolades and was named a CoSIDA Academic All-American. Stockton is still prominent on Gonzaga's career lists ranking 22nd on the all-time scoring list with 1,340 points, fourth in assists with 554 and first in steals with 262. On the Bulldogs single-season charts Stockton is 11th in field goals made (229 in 1984), third in assists (201 in 1984) and holds the top three spots in steals with 109 in 1984, and 68 in both 1982 and '83. In his senior season of 1984, he scored double figures in all 28 games and averaged 20.9 points per game. Stockton then became Gonzaga's first player drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft as the Utah Jazz selected the point guard with the 16th overall pick. A 10-time NBA All-Star and five-time NBA All-Defensive Second Team selection, he played all 19 seasons of his professional career with the Jazz. Stockton was also a member of the men's basketball \"Dream Team\" that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the 1992 squad marking the first time players from the NBA participated in the Olympic Games.\n\n2016 - Mike Redmond, Gonzaga University\n\nSpokane native Mike Redmond quickly became one of the best catchers to ever call a game for the Bulldogs. After sharing time behind the plate as a freshman, Redmond moved into the starting role his second season and immediately produced great results. In 1991, he led the team and was fifth in the Pac-10 North with a .371 average, collecting 59 hits and 34 RBIs for the Zags as well as posting a fielding percentage of .983. The standout season earned Redmond his first of two First Team All-Pac-10 North designations, and he also earned an invitation to USA Baseball's Olympic Trials that summer, where he hit .571 to tie for the camp lead. During his junior year, Redmond hit .333 in league play, collecting 53 more hits and 36 RBIs throughout the entire year. Behind the plate, however, 1992 was his best year yet with a .989 fielding percentage overall and a perfect 1.000 mark against Pac-10 North competition. He picked up his second All-Conference honor that season, his last in college baseball. Redmond went pro in August 1992, signing as a free agent with the Florida Marlins. He went on to make his major league debut with the Marlins in 1998, hitting .331 and fielding .992 in 37 games that season. He earned a World Series ring with the Marlins in 2003 and went onto better his career marks in later years, hitting .341 in 2006 for Minnesota and going without an error from 2005 to 2009. Throughout his career, Redmond hit a solid .287, but his fielding percentage of .996 as a catcher is the second highest in major league history. After his playing career was done, Redmond moved down the bench into managing. In 2011, he took over the Lansing Lugnuts, leading the squad to its best record in history and earning Midwest League Coach of the Year. A year later, in November 2012, he was hired to manage the Miami Marlins, a role he held until 2015.\n\n2015 - Jason Bay, Gonzaga University\n\nA junior transfer from North Idaho College, Jason Bay needed just two years to leave his mark on the Gonzaga baseball program. The outfielder provided much-needed pop to the Bulldog lineup, tallying a .374 career batting average and 35 home runs in 1999 and 2000. Both marks are among the Zags' top-10 career totals, and many of Bay's other numbers still hold up 15 years later. The slugger still owns two of the highest season home run totals in program history, ranking third and fifth in the category. During his first year in school, he tallied 74 RBIs - second-most in GU history - and as a senior, he led the entire West Coast Conference with a .388 batting average. Due to his impressive slugging numbers, Bay became the first Zag to earn consecutive First Team All-WCC honors, and in 2007 he was one of three Zags named to the conference's 40th Anniversary Baseball Team. With the deceptively speedy Bay manning centerfield, the Zags went on to win 27 and 28 games in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the squad finished second in the conference during both of Bay's years, at that point the highest conference finish since 1989. After his time at Gonzaga, Bay went onto have a prolific MLB career. He made his big-league debut in 2003 and earned National League Rookie of the Year honors a year later.
