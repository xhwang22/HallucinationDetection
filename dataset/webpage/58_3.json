{"Harry S. Kennedy defeated Republican incumbent George Cabot Lodge, Jr. in the 1962 Senate election.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1960", "page_content": "United States presidential election of 1960 , American presidential election held on November 8, 1960, in which Democrat John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Vice Pres. Richard M. Nixon . Kennedy thus became the first Roman Catholic and the youngest person ever elected president . Kennedy was also the first president born in the 20th century.\n\nKennedy and Humphrey were the only major Democratic contenders to enter presidential primaries in 1960. Their first significant primary was in Wisconsin in April. Both Humphrey and Kennedy campaigned energetically in that state, which borders Humphrey\u2019s home state of Minnesota. Kennedy won easily and was especially strong in Milwaukee and other areas where there were large numbers of Catholic voters. A month later Kennedy all but eliminated Humphrey from consideration by defeating him in West Virginia, a heavily Protestant state, proving that he could win in a state with few Catholics.\n\nThroughout the primaries and the fall campaign, Kennedy\u2019s religion was a dominant issue. He would become only the second Roman Catholic ever to be nominated for president by a major party (the first was Democratic Gov. Al Smith of New York, who lost to Herbert Hoover in 1928 ). Some Protestant ministers and prominent laymen expressed fears that a Catholic president would be under the domination of the pope and would not always be free to act in the best interests of the country, charges which Kennedy denied.\n\nOn the Republican side there was little doubt that their nominee would be Nixon. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York , who had indicated late in 1959 that he might seek the Republican nomination , withdrew in late December in the face of almost total opposition by Republican Party leaders. Nixon entered some of the primaries, but only to demonstrate his vote-getting abilities. He never faced any serious opposition.\n\nThe Republican platform promised to continue and to improve upon the programs of the Eisenhower administration. Although there were some signs of dissatisfaction with the administration because of its failure to pursue aggressive action in such as areas as military programs, aid to depressed areas, and space exploration , it was generally agreed that Eisenhower\u2019s prestige was as high as it had ever been and that the president\u2019s support was a distinct advantage to Nixon.\n\nKennedy went to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles , held July 11\u201315, 1960, as the front-runner for the nomination, with some 600 delegates of the 761 needed for nomination secured. Johnson, however, hoped to wrest the nomination from Kennedy. Nevertheless, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot, with 806 votes. Kennedy then surprised most of his supporters by picking Johnson as his vice presidential running mate. The selection was generally interpreted as a move to hold the South, where opposition to Kennedy\u2019s religion was strong and where the traditional Democratic leanings of the voters were changing. The party platform adopted at Los Angeles promised to expand the country\u2019s defense and foreign aid programs. It also committed the Democratic Party, controversially, to civil rights . In his acceptance speech, Kennedy said the American people needed to be prepared to sacrifice in the years ahead. There were, he said, stimulating \u201cnew frontiers\u201d to be crossed by the United States .\n\nThe general election campaign\n\nPresidential posturing began in earnest when the U.S. Congress reconvened in August, after the political conventions had been concluded. Both nominees were principal figures in the session, which was held in a politically charged atmosphere. As vice president, Nixon presided over the Senate. He also was a key figure in determining Republican strategy in a Congress that was controlled by the Democrats. As a senator from Massachusetts and as an author of the minimum-wage bill that was one of the principal measures to be acted upon during the session, Kennedy had an important stake in seeing to it that the achievements of the session were substantial.\n\nThe legislative achievements of Congress were mixed, but, by the time the traditional presidential campaign season kicked off on Labor Day in September, Nixon\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s responsibilities in Congress were all but forgotten. At the time, the presidential campaign was the longest and the most intensive ever held in the United States. Crisscrossing the country on planes, trains, automobiles, and buses, Nixon and Kennedy were speaking, shaking hands, and conferring with politicians from coast to coast for most of September, for all of October, and for the seven days of November preceding the election.\n\nKennedy tackled the election issue of his Catholicism in a speech to a group of Protestant ministers in Houston. In that speech, on September 12, he declared:\n\nI believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish\u2014where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source\u2014where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials\u2014and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.\n\nAn unprecedented series of four television debates between the two nominees constituted the highlight of the campaign. A provision of the Federal Communications Act had been suspended by Congress earlier in the year to permit the networks to broadcast the debates without having to provide equal time for candidates of minor parties. Although the debates were sometimes compared to the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas (see also Lincoln-Douglas debates), they were more in the nature of joint press conferences, with reporters asking questions. They did, however, provide voters with an opportunity to compare the two candidates. Although Nixon showed a mastery of the issues, it is generally agreed that Kennedy, with his relaxed and self-confident manner, as well as his good looks (in contrast to Nixon\u2019s \u201cfive o\u2019clock shadow\u201d), benefited the most from the exchanges. An estimated 85\u2013120 million Americans watched one or more of the debates.\n\nKennedy and Nixon both used set speeches in their public appearances. Kennedy said that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union in the race for world supremacy and that the United States must \u201cdo better.\u201d He pointed to the regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba\u2014\u201cjust ten minutes by jet from the United States.\u201d Kennedy also stressed the need for programs to deal with unemployment in chronically depressed areas and for more rapid U.S. economic growth. Nixon, the first presidential nominee to campaign in every state, emphasized that he would carry on the basic policies of the Eisenhower administration, but he also indicated that he would improve upon them in such areas as welfare programs, foreign aid, and defense. Eisenhower, who went on a \u201cnonpolitical\u201d inspection tour of the country in mid-October, took an active part in the last week of the campaign, when Eisenhower and Nixon appeared together in New York City. Until then, however, the president had seemed to stay in the background.\n\nWhen voters went to cast their ballots on November 7, the contest was close. In the electoral college, Kennedy captured 303 votes (34 more than was required to win), while Nixon won 219. The 14 unpledged electors in Alabama and Mississippi and 1 pledged elector in Oklahoma cast their votes for Sen. Harry F. Byrd, a Democrat from Virginia. Kennedy eked out a narrow victory in the popular vote, defeating Nixon by just under 117,000 votes. Overall, Kennedy won 49.7 percent to Nixon\u2019s 49.5 percent. Kennedy thus became the third person elected president in the 20th century without winning a majority of the popular vote (joining Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and Harry S. Truman in 1948; in 1968 Nixon would become the fourth person in the 20th century to win the presidency without a majority). The popular vote was the closest since 1884, when Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Republican James G. Blaine by only about 24,000 votes.\n\nCiting voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas, many observers questioned whether Kennedy had legally won those states, and some prominent Republicans\u2014including Eisenhower\u2014even urged Nixon to contest the results. He chose not to, however, declaring:\n\nI could think of no worse example for nations abroad, who for the first time were trying to put free electoral procedures into effect, than that of the United States wrangling over the results of our presidential election, and even suggesting that the presidency itself could be stolen by thievery at the ballot box.\n\nNixon\u2019s supporters and critics alike, both then and later, praised him for the dignity and unselfishness with which he handled defeat and the suspicion that vote fraud had cost him the presidency.\n\nFor the results of the previous election, see United States presidential election of 1956.

At the time, only white men who owned property could vote, but the 15th, 19th and 26th Amendments to the Constitution have since expanded the right of suffrage to all citizens over 18. Taking place every four years, presidential campaigns and elections have evolved into a series of fiercely fought, and sometimes controversial, contests now played out in the 24-hour news cycle. The stories behind each election\u2014some ending in landslide victories, others decided by the narrowest of margins\u2014provide a roadmap to the events of U.S. history.\n\nDeparting from the monarchical tradition of Britain, the founding fathers of the United States created a system in which the American people had the power and responsibility to select their leader. Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution establishes the Executive Branch of the U.S. government.\n\n1789: George Washington \u2013 unopposed\n\nThe first presidential election was held on the first Wednesday of January in 1789. No one contested the election of George Washington, but he remained reluctant to run until the last minute, in part because he believed seeking the office would be dishonorable. Only when Alexander Hamilton and others convinced him that it would be dishonorable to refuse did he agree to run.\n\nBefore the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, there was no separate ballot for president and vice president. Each elector cast two votes for president. The candidate with the largest number of electoral votes won the presidency, and the runner-up became vice president.\n\nMost Federalists agreed that John Adams should be vice president. But Hamilton feared that if Adams was the unanimous choice, he would end in a tie with Washington and might even become president, an outcome that would be highly embarrassing for both Washington and the new electoral system. Hamilton, therefore, arranged that a number of votes are deflected, so that Adams was elected by less than half the number of Washington\u2019s expected unanimous vote. The final results were Washington, 69 electoral votes; Adams, 34; John Jay, nine; John Hancock, four and others, 22.\n\nThe Constitution allowed each state to decide how to choose its presidential electors. In 1789, only Pennsylvania and Maryland held elections for this purpose; elsewhere, the state legislatures chose the electors. This method caused some problems in New York, which was so divided between Federalists who supported the new Constitution and Antifederalists who opposed it that the legislature failed to choose either presidential electors or U.S. senators.\n\nVCG Wilson/Corbis/Getty Images George Washington was the first president of the United States.\n\n1792: George Washington \u2013 unopposed\n\nAs in 1789, persuading George Washington to run was the major difficulty in selecting a president in 1792. Washington complained of old age, sickness and the increasing hostility of the Republican press toward his administration. The press attacks were symptomatic of the increasing split within the government between Federalists, who were coalescing around Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, and Republicans, forming around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. James Madison, among others, convinced Washington to continue as president by arguing that only he could hold the government together.\n\nSpeculation then shifted to the vice presidency. Hamilton and the Federalists supported the reelection of John Adams. Republicans favored New York governor George Clinton, but Federalists feared him partly because of a widespread belief that his recent election to the governorship was fraudulent. In addition, the Federalists feared that Clinton would belittle the importance of the federal government by retaining his governorship while serving as vice president.\n\nAdams won relatively easily with support from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, except New York. Only electoral votes are recorded here because most states still did not select presidential electors by popular vote. Nor was there a separate vote for president and vice president until the Twelfth Amendment took effect in 1804. The results were Washington, 132 electoral votes (unanimous); Adams, 77; Clinton, 50; Jefferson, four and Aaron Burr, one.\n\n1796: John Adams vs. Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe 1796 election, which took place against a background of increasingly harsh partisanship between Federalists and Republicans, was the first contested presidential race.\n\nThe Republicans called for more democratic practices and accused the Federalists of monarchism. The Federalists branded the Republicans \u201cJacobins\u201d after Maximilien Robespierre\u2019s faction in France. (The Republicans sympathized with revolutionary France, but not necessarily with the Jacobins.) The Republicans opposed John Jay\u2019s recently negotiated accommodationist treaty with Great Britain, whereas the Federalists believed its terms represented the only way to avoid a potentially ruinous war with Britain. Republicans favored a decentralized agrarian republic; Federalists called for the development of commerce and industry.\n\nState legislatures still chose electors in most states, and there was no separate vote for vice president. Each elector cast two votes for president, with the runner-up becoming vice president.\n\nThe Federalists nominated Vice President John Adams and tried to attract southern support by running Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina for the second post. Thomas Jefferson was the Republican standard-bearer, with Aaron Burr as his running mate. Alexander Hamilton, always intriguing against Adams, tried to throw some votes to Jefferson in order to elect Pinckney president. Instead, Adams won with 71 votes; Jefferson became vice president, with 68; Pinckney came in third with 59; Burr received only 30 and 48 votes went to various other candidates.\n\n1800: Thomas Jefferson vs. John Adams\n\nThe significance of the 1800 election lay in the fact that it entailed the first peaceful transfer of power between parties under the U.S. Constitution. Republican Thomas Jefferson succeeded Federalist John Adams. This peaceful transfer occurred despite defects in the Constitution that caused a breakdown of the electoral system.\n\nDuring the campaign, Federalists attacked Jefferson as an un-Christian deist, tainted by his sympathy for the increasingly bloody French Revolution. Republicans (1) criticized the Adams administration\u2019s foreign, defense and internal security policies; (2) opposed the Federalist naval buildup and the creation of a standing army under Alexander Hamilton; (3) sounded a call for freedom of speech, Republican editors having been targeted for prosecution under the Alien and Sedition Acts and (4) denounced deficit spending by the federal government as a backhanded method of taxation without representation.\n\nUnfortunately, the system still provided no separate votes for president and vice president, and Republican managers failed to deflect votes from their vice-presidential candidate, Aaron Burr. Therefore, Jefferson and Burr tied with 73 votes each; Adams received 65 votes, and his vice-presidential candidate, Charles C. Pinckney, 64. John Jay received one. This result threw the election into the House of Representatives, where each state had one vote, to be decided by the majority of its delegation. Left to choose between Jefferson and Burr, most Federalists supported Burr. Burr for his part disclaimed any intention to run for the presidency, but he never withdrew, which would have ended the contest.\n\nAlthough the Republicans in the same election had won a decisive majority of 65 to 39 in the House, the election of the president fell to the outgoing House, which had a Federalist majority. But despite this majority, two state delegations split evenly, leading to another deadlock between Burr and Jefferson.\n\nAfter the House cast 19 identical tie ballots on February 11, 1801, Governor James Monroe of Virginia assured Jefferson that if a usurpation was attempted, he would call the Virginia Assembly into session, implying that they would discard any such result. After six days of uncertainty, Federalists in the tied delegations of Vermont and Maryland abstained, electing Jefferson, but without giving him open Federalist support.\n\n1804: Thomas Jefferson vs. Charles Pinckney\n\nThe 1804 election was a landslide victory for the incumbent Thomas Jefferson and vice-presidential candidate George Clinton (Republicans) over the Federalist candidates, Charles C. Pinckney and Rufus King. The vote was 162-14. The election was the first held under the Twelfth Amendment, which separated Electoral College balloting for president and vice president.\n\nThe Federalists alienated many voters by refusing to commit their electors to any particular candidate prior to the election. Jefferson was also helped by the popularity of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and his reduction of federal spending. The repeal of the excise tax on whiskey was especially popular in the West.\n\n1808: James Madison vs. Charles Pinckney\n\nRepublican James Madison was elevated to the presidency in the election of 1808. Madison won 122 electoral votes cast to Federalist Charles C. Pinckney\u2019s 47 votes cast. Vice President George Clinton received six electoral votes for president from his native New York, but easily defeated Federalist Rufus King for vice president, 113-47, with scattered vice-presidential votes for Madison, James Monroe and John Langdon of New Hampshire. In the early stages of the election campaign, Madison also faced challenges from within his own party by Monroe and Clinton.\n\nThe main issue of the election was the Embargo Act of 1807. The banning of exports had hurt merchants and other commercial interests, although ironically it encouraged domestic manufactures. These economic difficulties revived the Federalist opposition, especially in trade-dependent New England.\n\n1812: James Madison vs. DeWitt Clinton\n\nIn the 1812 contest, James Madison was reelected president by the narrowest margin of any election since the Republican Party had come to power in 1800. He received 128 electoral votes to 89 for his Federalist opponent DeWitt Clinton, the lieutenant governor of New York. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts won the vice presidency with 131 votes to Jared Ingersoll\u2019s 86.\n\nThe War of 1812, which had begun five months earlier, was the dominant issue. Opposition to the war was concentrated in the northeastern Federalist states. Clinton\u2019s supporters also made an issue of Virginia\u2019s almost unbroken control of the White House, which they charged favored agricultural states over commercial ones. Clintonians also accused Madison of slighting the defense of the New York frontier against the British in Canada.\n\nIn the Northeast, Madison carried only Pennsylvania and Vermont, but Clinton received no votes south of Maryland. The election proved to be the last one of significance for the Federalist Party, largely owing to anti-British American nationalism engendered by the war.\n\n1816: James Monroe vs. Rufus King\n\nIn this election, Republican James Monroe won the presidency with 183 electoral votes, carrying every state except Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware. Federalist Rufus King received the votes of the 34 Federalist electors. Daniel D. Tompkins of New York was elected vice president with 183 electoral votes, his opposition scattered among several candidates.\n\nAfter the bitter partisanship of the Jefferson and Madison administrations, Monroe came to symbolize the \u201cEra of Good Feelings.\u201d Monroe was not elected easily, however; he barely won the nomination in the Republican congressional caucus over Secretary of War William Crawford of Georgia. Many Republicans objected to the succession of Virginia presidents and believed Crawford a superior choice to Monroe. The caucus vote was 65-54. The narrowness of Monroe\u2019s victory was surprising because Crawford had already renounced the nomination, perhaps in return for a promise of Monroe\u2019s future support.\n\nIn the general election, opposition to Monroe was disorganized. The Hartford Convention of 1814 (growing out of opposition to the War of 1812) had discredited the Federalists outside their strongholds and they did not put forth a candidate. To some extent, Republicans had siphoned off Federalist support with nationalist programs like the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n1820: James Monroe \u2013 unopposed\n\nDuring James Monroe\u2019s first term, the country had suffered an economic depression. In addition, the extension of slavery into the territories became a political issue when Missouri sought admission as a slave state. Also causing controversy were Supreme Court decisions in the Dartmouth College case and McCulloch v. Maryland, which expanded the power of Congress and of private corporations at the expense of the states. But despite these problems, Monroe faced no organized opposition for reelection in 1820. The opposition party, the Federalists, ceased to exist.\n\nVoters, as John Randolph put it, displayed \u201cthe unanimity of indifference, and not of approbation.\u201d Monroe won by an electoral vote of 231-1. William Plumer of New Hampshire, the one elector who voted against Monroe, did so because he thought Monroe was incompetent. He cast his ballot for John Quincy Adams. Later in the century, the fable arose that Plumer had cast his dissenting vote so that only George Washington would have the honor of unanimous election. Plumer never mentioned Washington in his speech explaining his vote to the other New Hampshire electors.\n\n1824: John Quincy Adams vs. Henry Clay vs. Andrew Jackson vs. William Crawford\n\nThe Republican Party broke apart in the 1824 election. A large majority of the states now chose electors by popular vote, and the people\u2019s vote was considered sufficiently important to record. The nomination of candidates by the congressional caucus was discredited. Groups in each state nominated candidates for the presidency, resulting in a multiplicity of favorite son candidacies.\n\nBy the fall of 1824, four candidates remained in the running. William Crawford of Georgia, the secretary of the treasury, had been the early front-runner, but severe illness hampered his candidacy. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts had a brilliant record of government service, but his Federalist background, his cosmopolitanism and his cold New England manner cost him support outside his own region. Henry Clay of Kentucky, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, who owed his popularity to his 1815 victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans, were the other candidates.\n\nWith four candidates, none received a majority. Jackson received 99 electoral votes with 152,901 popular votes (42.34 percent); Adams, 84 electoral votes with 114,023 popular votes (31.57 percent); Crawford, 41 electoral votes and 47,217 popular votes (13.08 percent) and Clay, 37 electoral votes and 46,979 popular votes (13.01 percent). The choice of president, therefore, fell to the House of Representatives.\n\nMany politicians assumed that House Speaker Henry Clay had the power to choose the next president but not to elect himself. Clay threw his support to Adams, who was then elected. When Adams subsequently named Clay secretary of state, the Jacksonians charged that the two men had made a \u201ccorrupt bargain.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral College chose John C. Calhoun as vice president by a majority of 182 votes.\n\n1828: Andrew Jackson vs. John Quincy Adams\n\nAndrew Jackson won the presidency in 1828 by a landslide, receiving a record 647,292 popular votes (56 percent) to 507,730 (44 percent) for the incumbent John Quincy Adams. John C. Calhoun won the vice presidency with 171 electoral votes to 83 for Richard Rush and seven for William Smith.\n\nThe emergence of two parties promoted popular interest in the election. Jackson\u2019s party sometimes called the Democratic-Republicans or simply Democrats developed the first sophisticated national network of party organizations. Local party groups sponsored parades, barbecues, tree plantings and other popular events designed to promote Jackson and the local slate. The National-Republicans, the party of Adams and Henry Clay, lacked the local organizations of the Democrats, but they did have a clear platform: high tariffs, federal funding of roads, canals and other internal improvements, aid to domestic manufactures and development of cultural institutions.\n\nThe 1828 election campaign was one of the dirtiest in America\u2019s history. Both parties spread false and exaggerated rumors about the opposition. Jackson men charged that Adams obtained the presidency in 1824 through a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d with Clay. And they painted the incumbent president as a decadent aristocrat who had procured prostitutes for the czar while serving as U.S. minister to Russia and spent taxpayer money on \u201cgambling\u201d equipment for the White House (actually a chess set and a billiard table).\n\nThe National-Republicans portrayed Jackson as a violent frontier ruffian, the son, some said, of a prostitute married to a mulatto. When Jackson and his wife, Rachel, married, the couple believed that her first husband had obtained a divorce. After learning the divorce had not yet been made final, the couple held a second, valid wedding. Now the Adams men claimed Jackson was a bigamist and an adulterer.\n\nMore justifiably, administration partisans questioned Jackson\u2019s sometimes violent discipline of the army in the War of 1812 and the brutality of his invasion of Florida in the Seminole War. Ironically, Secretary of State Adams had defended Jackson at the time of the Seminole War, taking advantage of Jackson\u2019s unauthorized incursion to obtain Florida for the United States from Spain.\n\n1832: Andrew Jackson vs. Henry Clay vs. William Wirt\n\nDemocratic-Republican Andrew Jackson was reelected in 1832 with 688,242 popular votes (54.5 percent) to 473,462 (37.5 percent) for National-Republican Henry Clay and 101,051 (eight percent) for Anti-Masonic candidate William Wirt. Jackson easily carried the Electoral College with 219 votes. Clay received only 49, and Wirt won the seven votes of Vermont. Martin Van Buren won the vice presidency with 189 votes against 97 for various other candidates.\n\nThe spoils system of political patronage, the tariff, and federal funding of internal improvements were major issues, but the most important was Jackson\u2019s veto of the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. National-Republicans attacked the veto, arguing that the Bank was needed to maintain a stable currency and economy. \u201cKing Andrew\u2019s\u201d veto, they asserted, was an abuse of executive power.\n\nIn defense of Jackson\u2019s veto, Democratic-Republicans labeled the Bank an aristocratic institution\u2013a \u201cmonster.\u201d Suspicious of banking and of paper money, Jacksonians opposed the Bank for giving special privileges to private investors at government expense and charged that it fostered British control of the American economy.\n\nFor the first time in American politics, a third party, the Anti-Masons, challenged the two major parties. Many politicians of note participated, including Thaddeus Stevens, William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed. The Anti-Masonic Party was formed in reaction to the murder of William Morgan, a former upstate New York Freemason. Allegedly, some Masons murdered Morgan when he threatened to publish some of the order\u2019s secrets. The Anti-Masons protested Masonic secrecy. They feared a conspiracy to control American political institutions, a fear fed by the fact that both the major party candidates, Jackson and Clay, were prominent Masons.\n\nThe Anti-Masons convened the first national presidential nominating convention in Baltimore on September 26, 1831. The other parties soon followed suit, and the convention replaced the discredited caucus system of nomination.\n\n1836: Martin Van Buren vs. Daniel Webster vs. Hugh White\n\nThe election of 1836 was largely a referendum on Andrew Jackson, but it also helped shape what is known as the second party system. The Democrats nominated Vice President Martin Van Buren to lead the ticket. His running mate, Col. Richard M. Johnson, claimed to have killed Indian chief Tecumseh. (Johnson was controversial because he lived openly with a black woman.)\n\nDisdaining the organized politics of the Democrats, the new Whig Party ran three candidates, each strong in a different region: Hugh White of Tennessee, Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Gen. William Henry Harrison of Indiana. Besides endorsing internal improvements and a national bank, the Whigs tried to tie Democrats to abolitionism and sectional tension, and attacked Jackson for \u201cacts of aggression and usurpation of power.\u201d Democrats depended on Jackson\u2019s popularity, trying to maintain his coalition.\n\nVan Buren won the election with 764,198 popular votes, only 50.9 percent of the total, and 170 electoral votes. Harrison led the Whigs with 73 electoral votes, White receiving 26 and Webster 14. Willie P. Mangum of South Carolina received his state\u2019s 11 electoral votes. Johnson, who failed to win an electoral majority, was elected vice president by the Democratic Senate.\n\n1840: William Henry Harrison vs. Martin Van Buren\n\nAware that Van Buren\u2019s problems gave them a good chance for victory, the Whigs rejected the candidacy of Henry Clay, their most prominent leader, because of his support for the unpopular Second Bank of the United States. Instead, stealing a page from the Democratic emphasis on Andrew Jackson\u2019s military exploits, they chose William Henry Harrison, a hero of early Indian wars and the War of 1812. The Whig vice-presidential nominee was John Tyler, a onetime Democrat who had broken with Jackson over his veto of the bill rechartering the Second Bank.\n\nStudiously avoiding divisive issues like the Bank and internal improvements, the Whigs depicted Harrison as living in a \u201clog cabin\u201d and drinking \u201chard cider.\u201d They used slogans like \u201cTippecanoe and Tyler too,\u201d and \u201cVan, Van, Van/Van is a used-up man,\u201d to stir voters. Harrison won by a popular vote of 1,275,612 to 1,130,033, and an electoral margin of 234 to 60. But the victory proved to be a hollow one because Harrison died one month after his inauguration. Tyler, his successor, would not accept Whig economic doctrine, and the change in presidential politics had little effect on presidential policy.\n\n1844: James K. Polk vs. Henry Clay vs. James Birney\n\nThe election of 1844 introduced expansion and slavery as important political issues and contributed to the westward and southern growth and sectionalism. Southerners of both parties sought to annex Texas and expand slavery. Martin Van Buren angered southern Democrats by opposing annexation for that reason, and the Democratic convention cast aside the ex-president and front-runner for the first dark horse, Tennessee\u2019s James K. Polk.\n\nAfter almost silently breaking with Van Buren over Texas, Pennsylvania\u2019s George M. Dallas was nominated for vice president to appease Van Burenites, and the party backed annexation and settling the Oregon boundary dispute with England. The abolitionist Liberty Party nominated Michigan\u2019s James G. Birney. Trying to avoid controversy, the Whigs nominated anti-annexationist Henry Clay of Kentucky and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. But, pressured by southerners, Clay endorsed annexation even though he was concerned it might cause war with Mexico and disunion, thereby losing support among antislavery Whigs.\n\nEnough New Yorkers voted for Birney to throw 36 electoral votes and the election to Polk, who won the Electoral College 170-105 and a slim popular victory. John Tyler signed a joint congressional resolution admitting Texas, but Polk pursued Oregon and then northern Mexico in the Mexican-American War, aggravating tension over slavery and sectional balance and leading to the Compromise of 1850.\n\n1848: Zachary Taylor vs. Martin Van Buren vs. Lewis Cass\n\nThe election of 1848 underscored the increasingly important role of slavery in national politics. Democratic president James K. Polk did not seek reelection. His party nominated Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan, who created the concept of squatter, or popular, sovereignty (letting the settlers of a territory decide whether to permit slavery), with Gen. William O. Butler of Kentucky for vice president.\n\nAntislavery groups formed the Free-Soil Party, whose platform promised to prohibit the spread of slavery, and chose former president Martin Van Buren of New York for president and Charles Francis Adams, the son of President John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts for vice president. The Whig nominee was the Mexican War hero Gen. Zachary Taylor, a slave owner. His running mate was Millard Fillmore, a member of New York\u2019s proslavery Whig faction.\n\nDemocrats and Free-Soilers stressed their views on slavery and Whigs celebrated Taylor\u2019s victories in the recent war, although many Whigs had opposed it. For his part, Taylor professed moderation on slavery, and he and the Whigs were successful. Taylor defeated Cass, 1,360,099 to 1,220,544 in popular votes and 163 to 127 in electoral votes. Van Buren received 291,263 popular votes and no electoral votes, but he drew enough support away from Cass to swing New York and Massachusetts to Taylor, assuring the Whigs\u2019 victory.\n\nWith the Taylor-Fillmore ticket elected, the forces had been set in motion for the events surrounding the Compromise of 1850. But Van Buren\u2019s campaign was a stepping-stone toward the creation of the Republican Party in the 1850s, also committed to the principle of \u201cFree Soil.\u201d\n\n1852: Franklin Pierce vs. Winfield Scott vs. John Pitale\n\nThe 1852 election rang a death knell for the Whig Party. Both parties split over their nominee and the issue of slavery. After forty-nine ballots of jockeying among Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan, former secretary of state James Buchanan of Pennsylvania and Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the Democrats nominated a compromise choice, Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, a former congressman and senator, with Senator William R. King of Alabama as his running mate. T\n\nhe Whigs rejected Millard Fillmore, who had become president when Taylor died in 1850, and Secretary of State Daniel Webster and instead nominated Gen. Winfield Scott of Virginia, with Senator William A. Graham of New Jersey for vice president. When Scott endorsed the party platform, which approved of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Free-Soil Whigs bolted. They nominated Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire for president and former congressman George Washington Julian of Indiana for vice president. Southern Whigs were suspicious of Scott, whom they saw as a tool of antislavery senator William H. Seward of New York.\n\nDemocratic unity, Whig disunity and Scott\u2019s political ineptitude combined to elect Pierce. \u201cYoung Hickory of the Granite Hills\u201d outpolled \u201cOld Fuss and Feathers\u201d in the electoral college, 254 to 42, and in the popular vote, 1,601,474 to 1,386,578.\n\n1856: James Buchanan vs. Millard Fillmore vs. John C. Freemont\n\nThe 1856 election was waged by new political coalitions and was the first to directly confront the issue of slavery. The violence that followed the Kansas-Nebraska Act destroyed the old political system and past formulas of compromises. The Whig Party was dead. Know-Nothings nominated Millard Fillmore to head their nativist American Party and chose Andrew J. Donelson for vice president.\n\nThe Democratic Party, portraying itself as the national party, nominated James Buchanan for president and John C. Breckinridge for vice president. Its platform supported the Kansas-Nebraska Act and noninterference with slavery. This election saw the emergence of a new, sectional party composed of ex-Whigs, Free-Soil Democrats and antislavery groups. The Republican Party opposed the extension of slavery and promised a free-labor society with expanded opportunities for white workers. It nominated military hero John C. Fr\u00e9mont of California for president and William L. Dayton for vice president.\n\nThe campaign centered around \u201cBleeding Kansas.\u201d The battle over the concept of popular sovereignty sharpened northern fears about the spread of slavery and southern worries about northern interference. The physical assault by Congressman Preston S. Brooks of South Carolina on Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the floor of the Senate heightened northern resentment of southern aggressiveness.\n\nAlthough the Democratic candidate, Buchanan, won with 174 electoral votes and 1,838,169 votes, the divided opposition gained more popular votes. The Republican Party captured 1,335,264 votes and 114 in the Electoral College, and the American Party received 874,534 popular and 8 electoral votes. The Republicans\u2019 impressive showing\u2013carrying eleven of sixteen free states and 45 percent of northern ballots\u2013left the South feeling vulnerable to attacks on slavery and fearful the Republicans would soon capture the government.\n\n1860: Abraham Lincoln vs. Stephen Douglas vs. John C. Breckenridge vs. John Bell\n\nAt the Republican convention, front-runner William H. Seward of New York faced insurmountable obstacles: conservatives feared his radical statements about an \u201cirrepressible conflict\u201d over slavery and a \u201chigher law\u201d than the Constitution, and radicals doubted his moral scruples. Hoping to carry moderate states like Illinois and Pennsylvania, the party nominated Abraham Lincoln of Illinois for president and Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine for vice president. The Republican platform called for a ban on slavery in the territories, internal improvements, a homestead act, a Pacific railroad and a tariff.\n\nThe Democratic convention, which met at Charleston, could not agree on a candidate, and most of the southern delegates bolted. Reconvening in Baltimore, the convention nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president and Senator Herschel Johnson of Georgia for vice president. Southern Democrats then met separately and chose Vice President John Breckinridge of Kentucky and Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon as their candidates. Former Whigs and Know-Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party, nominating Senator John Bell of Tennessee and Edward Everett of Massachusetts. Their only platform was \u201cthe Constitution as it is and the Union as it is.\u201d\n\nBy carrying almost the entire North, Lincoln won in the Electoral College with 180 votes to 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell and 12 for Douglas. Lincoln won a popular plurality of about 40 percent, leading the popular vote with 1,766,452 to 1,376,957 for Douglas, 849,781 for Breckinridge and 588,879 for Bell. With the election of a sectional northern candidate, the Deep South seceded from the Union, followed within a few months by several states of the Upper South.\n\n1864: Abraham Lincoln vs. George B. McClellan\n\nThe contest in the midst of the Civil War pitted President Abraham Lincoln against Democrat George B. McClellan, the general who had commanded the Army of the Potomac until his indecision and delays caused Lincoln to remove him. The vice-presidential candidates were Andrew Johnson, Tennessee\u2019s military governor who had refused to acknowledge his state\u2019s secession, and Representative George Pendleton of Ohio. At first, Radical Republicans, fearing defeat, talked of ousting Lincoln in favor of the more ardently antislavery secretary of the treasury Salmon P. Chase, or Generals John C. Fr\u00e9mont or Benjamin F. Butler. But in the end, they fell in behind the president.\n\nThe Republicans attracted Democratic support by running as the Union party and putting Johnson, a pro-war Democrat, on the ticket. McClellan repudiated the Democratic platform\u2019s call for peace, but he attacked Lincoln\u2019s handling of the war.\n\nLincoln won in a landslide, owing partly to a policy of letting soldiers go home to vote. But the military successes of Generals Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia and William T. Sherman in the Deep South were probably more important. He received 2,206,938 votes to McClellan\u2019s 1,803,787. The electoral vote was 212 to 21. Democrats did better in state elections.\n\nLincoln would not live to complete his second term, however. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, who fatally shot him inside Ford\u2019s Theater on April 14, 1865. The President died of his wounds the next day. Vice President Andrew Johnson served out the remainder of Lincoln\u2019s term.\n\n1868: Ulysses S. Grant vs. Horace Seymour\n\nIn this contest, Republican Ulysses S. Grant opposed Horace Seymour, the Democratic governor of New York. Their respective running mates were Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax of Indiana and Francis P. Blair of Missouri. The Democrats attacked the Republican management of Reconstruction and black suffrage.\n\nGrant, a moderate on Reconstruction, was accused of military despotism and anti-Semitism, and Colfax of nativism and possible corruption. Besides criticizing Seymour\u2019s support for inflationary greenback currency and Blair\u2019s reputed drunkenness and his opposition to Reconstruction, the Republicans questioned the wartime patriotism of all Democrats.\n\nGrant won the popular vote, 3,012,833 to 2,703,249, and carried the Electoral College by 214 to 80. Seymour carried only eight states, but ran fairly well in many others, especially in the South. The election showed that despite his popularity as a military hero, Grant was not invincible. His margin of victory came from newly enfranchised southern freedmen, who supplied him with about 450,000 votes. The Democrats had named a weak ticket and attacked Reconstruction rather than pursuing economic issues, but revealed surprising strength.\n\n1872: Ulysses S. Grant vs. Horace Greeley\n\nPresident Ulysses S. Grant ran against New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley in 1872. Greeley headed an uneasy coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans. Despite Greeley\u2019s history of attacking Democrats, that party endorsed him for the sake of expediency. The vice-presidential candidates were Republican senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts and Governor B. Gratz Brown of Missouri.\n\nDisaffected by Grant administration corruption and the controversy over Reconstruction, Greeley ran on a platform of civil service reform, laissez-faire liberalism and an end to Reconstruction. The Republicans came out for civil service reform and the protection of black rights. They attacked Greeley\u2019s inconsistent record and his support of utopian socialism and Sylvester Graham\u2019s dietary restrictions. Thomas Nast\u2019s anti-Greeley cartoons in Harper\u2019s Weekly attracted wide attention.\n\nGrant won the century\u2019s biggest Republican popular majority, 3,597,132 to 2,834,125. The Electoral College vote was 286 to 66. Actually, the result was more anti-Greeley than pro-Grant.\n\n1876: Rutherford B. Hayes vs. Samuel Tilden\n\nIn 1876 the Republican Party nominated Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio for president and William A. Wheeler of New York for vice president. The Democratic candidates were Samuel J. Tilden of New York for president and Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana for vice president. Several minor parties, including the Prohibition Party and the Greenback Party, also ran candidates.\n\nThe country was growing weary of Reconstruction policies, which kept federal troops stationed in several southern states. Moreover, the Grant administration was tainted by numerous scandals, which caused disaffection for the party among voters. In 1874 the House of Representatives had gone Democratic. Political change was in the air.\n\nSamuel Tilden won the popular vote, receiving 4,284,020 votes to 4,036,572 for Hayes. In the Electoral College, Tilden was also ahead 184 to 165; both parties claimed the remaining 20 votes. The Democrats needed only one more vote to capture the presidency, but the Republicans needed all 20 contested electoral votes. Nineteen of them came from South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida\u2013states that the Republicans still controlled. Protesting Democratic treatment of black voters, Republicans insisted that Hayes had carried those states but that Democratic electors had voted for Tilden.\n\nTwo sets of election returns existed\u2013one from the Democrats, one from the Republicans. Congress had to determine the authenticity of the disputed returns. Unable to decide, legislators established a fifteen-member commission composed of ten congressmen and five Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe commission was supposed to be nonpartisan, but ultimately it consisted of eight Republicans and seven Democrats. The final decision was to be rendered by the commission unless both the Senate and the House rejected it. The commission accepted the Republican vote in each state. The House disagreed, but the Senate concurred, and Hayes and Wheeler were declared president and vice president.\n\nIn the aftermath of the commission\u2019s decision, the federal troops that remained in the South were withdrawn, and southern leaders made vague promises regarding the rights of the four million African-Americans living in the region.\n\n1880: James A. Garfield vs. Winfield Scott Hancock\n\nThe election of 1880 was as rich in partisan wrangling as it was lacking in major issues. Factional rivalry in the Republican Party between New York senator Roscoe Conkling\u2019s Stalwarts and Half-Breed followers of James G. Blaine resulted in a convention in which neither Blaine nor the Stalwart choice, former president Ulysses S. Grant, could gain the nomination.\n\nOn the thirty-sixth ballot, a compromise choice, Senator James A. Garfield of Ohio, was nominated. Stalwart Chester A. Arthur of New York was chosen as his running mate to mollify Conkling\u2019s followers. The Democrats selected Civil War general Winfield Scott Hancock, a man of modest abilities because he was less controversial than party leaders like Samuel Tilden, Senator Thomas Bayard or Speaker of the House Samuel Randall. Former Indiana congressman William English served as Hancock\u2019s running mate.\n\nIn their platforms, both parties equivocated on the currency issue and unenthusiastically endorsed civil service reform while supporting generous pensions for veterans and the exclusion of Chinese immigrants. The Republicans called for protective tariffs; the Democrats favored tariffs \u201cfor revenue only.\u201d\n\nIn the campaign, Republicans \u201cwaved the bloody shirt,\u201d ridiculed Hancock for referring to the tariff as a \u201clocal question,\u201d and quite possibly purchased their narrow but crucial victory in Indiana. Democrats attacked Garfield\u2019s ties to the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal and circulated the forged \u201cMorey Letter\u201d that \u201cproved\u201d he was soft on Chinese exclusion. Turnout was high on election day (78.4 percent), but the result was one of the closest in history. Garfield carried the Electoral College, 214-155, but his popular majority was less than 10,000 (4,454,416 to Hancock\u2019s 4,444,952). Greenback-Labor candidate James Weaver garnered 308,578 votes. Outside the southern and border states, Hancock carried only New Jersey, Nevada, and 5 of 6 California electoral votes.\n\n1884: Grover Cleveland vs. James G. Blaine\n\nThis race, marred by negative campaigning and corruption, ended in the election of the first Democratic president since 1856. The Republicans split into three camps: dissident reformers, called the Mugwumps, who were opposed to party and government graft; Stalwarts, Ulysses S. Grant supporters who had fought civil service reform and Half-Breeds, moderate reformers and high-tariff men loyal to the party.\n\nThe Republicans nominated James G. Blaine of Maine, a charismatic former congressman and secretary of state popular for his protectionism, but of doubtful honesty because of his role in the scandal of the \u201cMulligan letters\u201d in the 1870s. His running mate was one of his opponents, Senator John Logan of Illinois. This gave Democrats a chance to name a ticket popular in New York, where Stalwart senator Roscoe Conkling had a long-running feud with Blaine, and they took advantage of it. They chose New York governor Grover Cleveland, a fiscal conservative and civil service reformer, for president and Senator Thomas Hendricks of Indiana for vice president.\n\nThe campaign was vicious. The Republican reformers and the traditionally Republican New York Times opposed Blaine. When it became known that Cleveland, a bachelor, had fathered a child out of wedlock, Republicans chanted \u201cMa! Ma! Where\u2019s my pa? Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!\u201d But the furor died down when Cleveland acknowledged his paternity and showed that he contributed to the child\u2019s support.\n\nBlaine alienated a huge bloc of votes by not repudiating the Reverend Samuel Burchard, who, with Blaine in attendance, called the Democrats the party of \u201cRum, Romanism, and Rebellion.\u201d Cleveland defeated Blaine by a very close margin, 4,911,017 to 4,848,334; the vote in the Electoral College was 219 to 182, with New York\u2019s 36 votes turning the tide.\n\n1888: Benjamin Harrison vs. Grover Cleveland\n\nIn 1888 the Democratic Party nominated President Grover Cleveland and chose Allen G. Thurman of Ohio as his running mate, replacing Vice President Thomas Hendricks who had died in office.\n\nAfter eight ballots, the Republican Party chose Benjamin Harrison, former senator from Indiana and the grandson of President William Henry Harrison. Levi P. Morton of New York was the vice-presidential nominee.\n\nIn the popular vote for president, Cleveland won with 5,540,050 votes to Harrison\u2019s 5,444,337. But Harrison received more votes in the Electoral College, 233 to Cleveland\u2019s 168, and was therefore elected. The Republicans carried New York, President Cleveland\u2019s political base.\n\nThe campaign of 1888 helped establish the Republicans as the party of high tariffs, which most Democrats, heavily supported by southern farmers, opposed. But memories of the Civil War also figured heavily in the election.\n\nNorthern veterans, organized in the Grand Army of the Republic, had been angered by Cleveland\u2019s veto of pension legislation and his decision to return Confederate battle flags.\n\n1892: Grover Cleveland vs. Benjamin Harrison vs. James B. Weaver\n\nThe Republican party in 1892 nominated President Benjamin Harrison and replaced Vice President Levi P. Morton with Whitelaw Reid of New York. The Democrats also selected the familiar: former president Grover Cleveland and Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. The Populist, or People\u2019s party, fielding candidates for the first time, nominated Gen. James B. Weaver of Iowa and James G. Field of Virginia.\n\nThe main difference between the Republicans and the Democrats in 1892 was their position on the tariff. The Republicans supported ever-increasing rates, whereas a substantial wing of the Democratic party pushed through a platform plank that demanded import taxes for revenue only. The Populists called for government ownership of the railroads and monetary reform, confronting these issues in a way the two major parties did not.\n\nCleveland, avenging his defeat of 1888, won the presidency, receiving 5,554,414 popular votes to Harrison\u2019s 5,190,801. Weaver and the Populists received 1,027,329. In the electoral college Cleveland, carrying the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana, garnered 277 votes to Harrison\u2019s 145.\n\n1896: William McKinley vs. William Jennings Bryan vs. Thomas Watson vs. John Palmer\n\nIn 1896 the Republican nominee for president was Representative William McKinley of Ohio, a \u201csound money\u201d man and a strong supporter of high tariffs. His running mate was Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey. The party\u2019s platform stressed adherence to the gold standard; western delegates bolted, forming the Silver Republican party.\n\nThe Democratic party platform was critical of President Grover Cleveland and endorsed the coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen to one. William Jennings Bryan, a former congressman from Nebraska, spoke at the convention in support of the platform, proclaiming, \u201cYou shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold.\u201d The enthusiastic response of the convention to Bryan\u2019s Cross of Gold speech secured his hold on the presidential nomination. His running mate was Arthur Sewall of Maine.\n\nThe Populists supported Bryan but nominated Thomas Watson of Georgia for vice president. Silver Republicans supported the Democratic nominee, and the newly formed Gold Democrats nominated John M. Palmer of Illinois for president and Simon B. Buckner of Kentucky for vice president.\n\nBryan toured the country, stressing his support for silver coinage as a solution for economically disadvantaged American farmers and calling for a relaxation of credit and regulation of the railroads. McKinley remained at home and underscored the Republican commitment to the gold standard and protectionism. The Republican campaign, heavily financed by corporate interests, successfully portrayed Bryan and the Populists as radicals.\n\nWilliam McKinley won, receiving 7,102,246 popular votes to Bryan\u2019s 6,502,925. The electoral college votes were 271 to 176. Bryan did not carry any northern industrial states, and the agricultural states of Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota also went Republican.\n\n1900: William McKinley vs. William Jennings Bryan\n\nIn 1900 the Republicans nominated President William McKinley. Since Vice President Garret A. Hobart had died in office, Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York received the vice-presidential nomination. The Democratic candidates were William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska for president and Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois for vice president.\n\nBryan campaigned as an anti-imperialist, denouncing the country\u2019s involvement in the Philippines. Delivering over six hundred speeches in twenty-four states, he also persisted in his crusade for the free coinage of silver. McKinley did not actively campaign, relying on the revival of the economy that had occurred during his first term.\n\nIn the election, McKinley won wide support from business interests. Bryan was unable to expand his agrarian base to include northern labor, which approved of McKinley\u2019s commitment to protective tariffs. Foreign policy questions proved unimportant to most voters. McKinley was elected, receiving 7,219,530 popular votes to Bryan\u2019s 6,358,071. In the Electoral College, the vote was 292 to 155.\n\n1904: Theodore Roosevelt vs. Alton Parker\n\nThis race confirmed the popularity of Theodore Roosevelt, who had become president when McKinley was assassinated and moved Democrats away from bimetallism and toward progressivism.\n\nSome Republicans deemed Roosevelt too liberal and flirted with nominating Marcus A. Hanna of Ohio, who had been William McKinley\u2019s closest political adviser. But the party easily nominated Roosevelt for a term in his own right and Senator Charles Fairbanks of Indiana for vice president. Democrats divided again over gold and silver, but this time gold won out. The party nominated conservative, colorless New York Court of Appeals judge Alton Parker for president and former senator Henry Davis of West Virginia for vice president.\n\nParker and his campaign attacked Roosevelt for his antitrust policies and for accepting contributions from big business. His having invited Booker T. Washington for a meal at the White House was also used against him. William Jennings Bryan overcame his distaste for Parker and his supporters and campaigned in the Midwest and West for the ticket. Playing down bimetallism, he stressed moving the party toward more progressive stances.\n\nParker gained some support from the South, but Roosevelt won 7,628,461 popular votes to Parker\u2019s 5,084,223. He carried the Electoral College, 336 to 140, with only the South going Democratic.\n\n1908: William Howard Taft vs. William Jennings Bryan\n\nAfter Theodore Roosevelt declined to run for reelection in 1908, the Republican convention nominated Secretary of War William Howard Taft for president and Representative James Schoolcraft Sherman of New York as his running mate. The Democrats chose William Jennings Bryan for president for the third time; his running mate was John Kern of Indiana.\n\nThe predominant campaign issue was Roosevelt. His record as a reformer countered Bryan\u2019s reformist reputation, and Taft promised to carry on Roosevelt\u2019s policies. Business leaders campaigned for Taft.\n\nIn the election, Taft received 7,679,006 popular votes to Bryan\u2019s 6,409,106. Taft\u2019s margin in the Electoral College was 321 to 162.\n\n1912: Woodrow Wilson vs. William Howard Taft vs. Theodore Roosevelt vs. Eugene V. Debs\n\nIn 1912, angered over what he felt was the betrayal of his policies by his hand-picked successor, President William Howard Taft, former president Theodore Roosevelt sought the Republican nomination. When the party chose Taft and Vice President James Sherman at the convention, Roosevelt bolted and formed the Progressive Party, or Bull Moose party. His running mate was Governor Hiram Johnson of California. After forty-six ballots the Democratic convention nominated New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson for president and Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana for vice president. For the fourth time, the Socialist party nominated Eugene V. Debs for president.\n\nDuring the campaign, Roosevelt and Wilson attracted most of the attention. They offered the voters two brands of progressivism. Wilson\u2019s New Freedom promoted antimonopoly policies and a return to small-scale business. Roosevelt\u2019s New Nationalism called for an interventionist state with strong regulatory powers.\n\nIn the election Wilson received 6,293,120 to Roosevelt\u2019s 4,119,582, Taft\u2019s 3,485,082, and nearly 900,000 for Debs. In the electoral college, Wilson\u2019s victory was lopsided: 435 to 88 for Roosevelt and 8 for Taft. The combined vote for Taft and Roosevelt indicated that if the Republican party had not split, they would have won the presidency; the total cast for Wilson, Roosevelt, and Debs spoke to the people\u2019s endorsement of progressive reform.\n\n1916: Woodrow Wilson vs. Charles Evans Hughs\n\nIn 1916 the Progressive party convention tried to nominate Theodore Roosevelt again, but Roosevelt, seeking to reunify the Republicans, convinced the convention to support the Republican choice, Associate Justice Charles Evans Hughes. The Republicans selected Charles Fairbanks of Indiana as Hughes\u2019s running mate, but the Progressives nominated John M. Parker of Louisiana for vice president. The Democrats renominated President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall.\n\nThe Democrats stressed the fact that Wilson had kept the nation out of the European war, but Wilson was ambiguous about his ability to continue to do so. The election was close. Wilson received 9,129,606 votes to Hughes\u2019s 8,538,221. Wilson also obtained a slim margin in the Electoral College, winning 277 to 254.\n\n1920: Warren G. Harding vs. James M. Cox vs. Eugene V. Debs\n\nAfter a generation of progressive insurgency within the Republican party, it returned in 1920 to a conservative stance. The party\u2019s choice for president was Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, a political insider. Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, best known for his tough handling of the Boston police strike of 1919, was the vice-presidential nominee.\n\nThe Democratic party nominated James M. Cox, governor of Ohio, and Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York, assistant secretary of the navy in the Wilson administration. Democratic chances were weakened by President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s having suffered a stroke in 1919 and his failure to obtain ratification of the League of Nations treaty. The Socialist party nominated Eugene V. Debs, imprisoned for his opposition to World War I, and Seymour Stedman of Ohio.\n\nA bedridden Wilson hoped the 1920 election would be a referendum on his League of Nations, but that issue was probably not decisive. If anything, the election was a strong rejection of President Wilson and an endorsement of the Republican candidate\u2019s call for a \u201creturn to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHarding\u2019s victory was decisive: 16,152,200 popular votes to Cox\u2019s 9,147,353. In the electoral college, only the South went for Cox. Harding won by 404 to 127. Although still in prison, Debs received more than 900,000 votes.\n\n1924: Calvin Coolidge vs. Robert M. LaFollette vs. Burton K. Wheeler vs. John W. Davis\n\nThe Republican nominees for president and vice president in 1924 were President Calvin Coolidge and Charles G. Dawes of Illinois. President Warren G. Harding had died in 1923.\n\nDisaffected progressive Republicans met under the auspices of the Conference for Progressive Political Action and nominated Robert M. La Follette for president. The new Progressive party chose Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana for vice president. The platform called for higher taxes on the wealthy, conservation, direct election of the president, and the ending of child labor.\n\nIn choosing their candidates the Democrats were faced with polar opposites. Alfred E. Smith of New York was the epitome of the urban machine politician, and he was also Catholic; William G. McAdoo was a Protestant popular in the South and West. A deadlock developed; on the 103rd ballot, the delegates finally settled on John W. Davis, a corporation lawyer, and Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska, the brother of William Jennings Bryan.\n\nThe Republicans won easily; Coolidge\u2019s popular vote, 15,725,016, was greater than that of Davis, 8,385,586, and La Follette, 4,822,856, combined. Coolidge received 382 electoral votes to Davis\u2019s 136. La Follette carried only his home state, Wisconsin, with 13 electoral votes.\n\n1928: Herbert Hoover vs. Alfred E. Smith\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee in 1928 was Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Charles Curtis of Kansas was his running mate. The Democrats nominated Alfred E. Smith, governor of New York, and Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas.\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition) and religion\u2013Al Smith was Catholic-dominated a campaign that was marked by anti-Catholicism. Hoover firmly supported Prohibition, whereas Smith, an avowed wet, favored repeal. Many Americans found the urban and cultural groups that the cigar-smoking Smith epitomized frightening; Hoover seemed to stand for old-fashioned rural values. The Republican campaign slogan promised the people \u201ca chicken for every pot and a car in every garage.\u201d\n\nThe election produced a high voter turnout. The Republicans swept the electoral college, 444 to 87, and Hoover\u2019s popular majority was substantial: 21,392,190 to Smith\u2019s 15,016,443. The Democrats, however, carried the country\u2019s twelve largest cities; the support for Smith in urban America heralded the major political shift to come.\n\n1932: Franklin D. Roosevelt vs. Herbert Hoover\n\nIn 1932, the third year of the Great Depression, the Republican party nominated President Herbert Hoover and Vice President Charles Curtis. Although Hoover had tried to respond to the crisis, his belief in voluntarism limited his options.\n\nThe Democratic party nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, the governor of New York, for president and Senator John Nance Garner of Texas for vice president. The platform called for the repeal of Prohibition and a reduction in federal spending.\n\nDuring the campaign, Hoover defended his record, his commitment to a balanced budget, and the gold standard\u2013a backward-looking stance, given that the number of unemployed stood at 13 million. Roosevelt made few specific proposals, but his tone and demeanor were positive and forward-looking.\n\nThe Democrats won the election in a landslide. Roosevelt received 22,809,638 popular votes to the president\u2019s 15,758,901 and took the electoral college by 472 votes to 59. The voters\u2019 rejection of Hoover and his party extended to both houses of Congress, which the Democrats now controlled.\n\n1936: Franklin D. Roosevelt vs. Alfred M. Landon\n\nIn 1936 the Democratic Party nominated President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner. The Republican Party, strongly opposed to the New Deal and \u201cbig government,\u201d chose Governor Alfred M. Landon of Kansas and Fred Knox of Illinois.\n\nThe 1936 presidential campaign focused on class to an unusual extent for American politics. Conservative Democrats such as Alfred E. Smith supported Landon. Eighty percent of newspapers endorsed the Republicans, accusing Roosevelt of imposing a centralized economy. Most businesspeople charged the New Deal with trying to destroy American individualism and threatening the nation\u2019s liberty. But Roosevelt appealed to a coalition of western and southern farmers, industrial workers, urban ethnic voters, and reform-minded intellectuals. African-American voters, historically Republican, switched to FDR in record numbers.\n\nIn a referendum on the emerging welfare state, the Democratic Party won in a landslide\u201327,751,612 popular votes for FDR to only 16,681,913 for Landon. The Republicans carried two states\u2013Maine and Vermont\u2013with eight electoral votes; Roosevelt received the remaining 523. The unprecedented success of FDR in 1936 marked the beginning of a long period of Democratic Party dominance.\n\n1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt vs. Wendall L. Wilkie\n\nIn 1940 President Franklin D. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term by a margin of nearly five million: 27,244,160 popular votes to Republican Wendell L. Willkie\u2019s 22,305,198. The president carried the Electoral College, 449 to 82. The new vice president was Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, chosen by the Democrats to replace the two-term vice president John Nance Garner who no longer agreed with Roosevelt about anything. Charles A. McNary was the Republican candidate for vice president.\n\nThe major issue facing the American people in 1940 was World War II. This fact had determined the Republican choice of Willkie, who was a liberal internationalist running as the candidate of a conservative isolationist party. Although Willkie did not disagree with Roosevelt on foreign policy, the country chose to stay with an experienced leader.\n\n1944: Franklin D. Roosevelt vs. Thomas E. Dewey\n\nBy the beginning of 1944, in the middle of World War II, it was clear that President Franklin D. Roosevelt planned to run for a fourth term, and this shaped the coming campaign. Democratic Party regulars disliked Vice President Henry A. Wallace; eventually, they persuaded Roosevelt to replace him with Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri. Although Wendell Willkie, the nominee in 1940, was initially the front-runner in the Republican race, the party returned to its traditional base, choosing conservative governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York. Republicans had hoped that Governor Earl Warren of California would accept the vice-presidential nomination, but he declined. The party then turned to John W. Bricker.\n\nThe president won reelection with results that were similar to those of 1940: 25,602,504 people voted for Roosevelt and Truman, and 22,006,285 voters gave their support to Dewey. The electoral vote was 432 to 99.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was the issue in 1944. His health\u2013the sixty-two-year-old suffered from heart disease and high blood pressure\u2013was a concern. His competence as an administrator and his stand on communism and the shape of the postwar world was questioned. Also at issue was whether any president should serve four terms. The Democrats and the President were vulnerable on all these points, but the American people once again chose the familiar in a time of crisis: \u201cDon\u2019t change horses in midstream,\u201d was a familiar slogan in the campaign.\n\n1948: Harry Truman vs. Thomas E. Dewey vs. Strom Thurmond vs. Henry Wallace\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman, who had succeeded President Roosevelt after his death in 1945, stood for reelection on the Democratic ticket with Alben Barkley of Kentucky as his running mate. When the Democratic convention adopted a strong civil rights plank, southern delegates walked out and formed the States\u2019 Rights Party. The Dixiecrats, as they were called, nominated Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for president and Fielding Wright for vice president. A new left-leaning Progressive Party nominated former vice president Henry A. Wallace of Iowa for president with Glen Taylor, a senator from Idaho, as his running mate. The Republican slate consisted of two prominent governors: Thomas E. Dewey of New York and Earl Warren of California.\n\nAlthough polls and conventional wisdom predicted a Dewey victory, Truman campaigned vigorously as the underdog, making a famous whistle-stop tour of the country aboard a special train. Results were uncertain to the last minute. A well-known photograph shows Truman the day after the election smiling broadly and holding aloft a newspaper with the headline, \u201cDewey Wins!\u201d The paper was wrong: Truman had received 24,105,812 popular votes or 49.5 percent of the total. Dewey received 21,970,065, or 45.1 percent. Thurmond and Wallace each received about 1.2 million votes. The Democratic victory in the Electoral College was more substantial: Truman beat Dewey 303 to 189; Thurmond received 39 votes and Wallace none.\n\n1952: Dwight D. Eisenhower vs. Adlai E. Stevenson\n\nWhen President Harry S. Truman declined to run for a third term, the Democratic convention nominated Governor Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois for president on the third ballot. Senator John Sparkman of Alabama was chosen as his running mate.\n\nThe Republican fight for the nomination was a conflict between the isolationists, represented by Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, and the more liberal internationalists, who backed World War II general Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University. Eisenhower won the nomination. Richard M. Nixon, an anticommunist senator from California, was the vice-presidential candidate.\n\nPopular discontent with Truman\u2019s handling of the Korean War, charges of corruption in his administration, an inflationary economy and a perceived communist threat worked against Stevenson. He was also confronted with Eisenhower\u2019s immense personal popularity\u2013\u201cI like Ike!\u201d the campaign buttons proclaimed\u2013and the voters\u2019 belief that he would swiftly end the war. A scandal regarding Nixon\u2019s campaign fund threatened briefly to cost him his place on the ticket. But an emotional speech he delivered on television featuring his wife\u2019s \u201cgood Republican cloth coat\u201d and his dog, Checkers, saved him.\n\nEisenhower\u2019s victory was the largest of any candidate\u2019s to that time: He received 33,936,234 popular votes and 442 electoral votes to Stevenson\u2019s 27,314,992 popular votes and 89 electoral votes.\n\n1956: Dwight D. Eisenhower vs. Adlai E. Stevenson\n\nDespite suffering a heart attack and abdominal surgery during his first term, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated by the Republicans for a second term without opposition. Although Richard M. Nixon had been a controversial vice president and many Republicans felt he was a liability, he was also renominated. For the second time, the Democrats chose former governor Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois; his running mate was Estes Kefauver of Tennessee.\n\nForeign policy dominated the campaign. Eisenhower claimed responsibility for the country\u2019s being prosperous and at peace; Stevenson proposed ending the draft and halting nuclear testing. The Suez Canal crisis, occurring in the final weeks of the campaign, created a sense of emergency, and the country responded by voting strongly against change.\n\nEisenhower won with 35,590,472 votes to Stevenson\u2019s 26,022,752. His margin was 457 to 73 in the Electoral College.\n\n1960: John F. Kennedy vs. Richard M. Nixon\n\nIn 1960 the Democratic Party nominated John F. Kennedy, a senator from Massachusetts, for president. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas was his running mate. The Republicans nominated Vice President Richard M. Nixon to succeed Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was prohibited from running for a third term by the recently adopted 22nd Amendment. The Republican nominee for vice president was Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., of Massachusetts.\n\nAlthough much of the campaign centered on style rather than substance, Kennedy stressed what he claimed was a \u201cmissile gap\u201d between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy was Catholic, and though religion was not a major issue, it had considerable influence on many voters.\n\nKennedy won the presidency by a popular margin of less than 120,000, receiving 34,227,096 votes to Nixon\u2019s 34,107,646. The race was not as close in the Electoral College, where Kennedy got 303 votes to Nixon\u2019s 219. Kennedy was the first Catholic and the youngest person to be elected president.\n\n1964: Lyndon B. Johnson vs. Barry Goldwater\n\nThe Democrats nominated Lyndon B. Johnson who had succeeded to the presidency upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson, the first president from the South since Andrew Johnson, had been Democratic leader of the Senate. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, a longtime liberal, was nominated as Johnson\u2019s running mate. The Republicans chose Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona for president and Congressman William E. Miller of New York for vice president.\n\nIn the campaign, conducted in the midst of the escalating Vietnam War, Goldwater, an ultraconservative, called for the bombing of North Vietnam and implied that the Social Security system should be dismantled. President Johnson campaigned on a platform of social reform that would incorporate Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier proposals. Despite the country\u2019s deepening involvement in Vietnam, the president also campaigned as the candidate of peace against the militaristic Goldwater.\n\nJohnson won a decisive victory, polling 43,128,958 popular votes to 27,176,873 for Goldwater. In the Electoral College, he received 486 votes to Goldwater\u2019s 52.\n\n1968: Richard M. Nixon vs. Hubert Humphrey vs. George Wallace\n\nThe Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and protests tied to both combined in a tumultuous year to cause a tight, unusual election closely linked to these issues. Opposition to the war moved Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota to enter the Democratic race, followed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, both with strong support from liberal constituencies. On March 31, 1968, in the wake of the Tet Offensive, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek reelection. This prompted Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey to announce his candidacy. Kennedy won the California primary, but immediately thereafter, he was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan.\n\nHumphrey then pulled ahead and was nominated for president with Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine for vice president. The party convention in Chicago was marred by bloody clashes between antiwar protesters and the local police. In comparison, the Republican race was less complicated. Former vice president Richard M. Nixon completed his political comeback by winning the presidential nomination. He chose Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as his running mate. The conservative American Independent Party nominated Governor George Wallace of Alabama, a segregationist, for president, and Air Force general Curtis LeMay of Ohio, who advocated using nuclear weapons in Vietnam, for vice president.\n\nNixon campaigned for law and order and said he had a \u201csecret plan\u201d to end the war. Wallace was highly critical of Supreme Court decisions that had broadened the Bill of Rights and of Great Society programs to rebuild the inner cities and enforce civil rights for blacks. Humphrey supported most of Johnson\u2019s policies, but late in the campaign, he announced he would seek to end American involvement in Vietnam. It was not quite enough to overcome Nixon\u2019s lead in the polls. Nixon received 31,710,470 popular votes to 30,898,055 for Humphrey and 9,466,167 for Wallace. Nixon\u2019s victory in the Electoral College was wider: 302 to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace, the latter from the South.\n\n1972: Richard M. Nixon vs. George McGovern\n\nIn 1972 the Republicans nominated President Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. The Democrats still split over the war in Vietnam chose a presidential candidate of liberal persuasion, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri was the vice-presidential choice, but after it was revealed that he had once received electric shock and other psychiatric treatments, he resigned from the ticket. McGovern named Sargent Shriver, director of the Peace Corps, as his replacement.\n\nThe campaign focused on the prospect of peace in Vietnam and an upsurge in the economy. Unemployment had leveled off and the inflation rate was declining. Two weeks before the November election, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted inaccurately that the war in Vietnam would soon be over. During the campaign, a break-in occurred at Democratic National Headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., but it had little impact until after the election.\n\nThe campaign ended in one of the greatest landslides in the nation\u2019s history. Nixon\u2019s popular vote was 47,169,911 to McGovern\u2019s 29,170,383, and the Republican victory in the Electoral College was even more lopsided at 520 to 17. Only Massachusetts gave its votes to McGovern.\n\n1976: Jimmy Carter vs. Gerald Ford\n\nIn 1976 the Democratic Party nominated former governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia for president and Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota for vice president. The Republicans chose President Gerald Ford and Senator Robert Dole of Kansas. Richard M. Nixon had appointed Ford, a congressman from Michigan, as vice president to replace Spiro Agnew, who had resigned amid charges of corruption. Ford became president when Nixon resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted three articles of impeachment because of his involvement in an attempted cover-up of the politically inspired Watergate break-in.\n\nIn the campaign, Carter ran as an outsider, independent of Washington, which was now in disrepute. Ford tried to justify his pardoning Nixon for any crimes he might have committed during the cover-up, as well as to overcome the disgrace many thought the Republicans had brought to the presidency.\n\nCarter and Mondale won a narrow victory, 40,828,587 popular votes to 39,147,613 and 297 electoral votes to 241. The Democratic victory ended eight years of divided government; the party now controlled both the White House and Congress.\n\n1980: Ronald Reagan vs. Jimmy Carter vs. John B. Anderson\n\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter was opposed for the Democratic nomination by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts in ten primaries. But Carter easily won the nomination at the Democratic convention. The party also renominated Walter Mondale for vice president.\n\nRonald Reagan, former governor of California, received the Republican nomination, and his chief challenger, George Bush, became the vice-presidential nominee. Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois, who had also sought the nomination, ran as an independent with Patrick J. Lucey, former Democratic governor of Wisconsin, as his running mate.\n\nThe two major issues of the campaign were the economy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. President Carter seemed unable to control inflation and had not succeeded in obtaining the release of American hostages in Tehran before the election.\n\nReagan won a landslide victory, and Republicans also gained control of the Senate for the first time in twenty-five years. Reagan received 43,904,153 popular votes in the election, and Carter, 35,483,883. Reagan won 489 votes in the Electoral College to Carter\u2019s 49. John Anderson won no electoral votes but got 5,720,060 popular votes.\n\n1984: Ronald Reagan vs. Walter Mondale\n\nIn 1984 the Republicans renominated Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Former vice president Walter Mondale was the Democratic choice, having turned aside challenges from Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Jackson, an African-American, sought to move the party to the left. Mondale chose Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York for his running mate. This was the first time a major party nominated a woman for one of the top offices.\n\nPeace and prosperity, despite massive budget deficits, ensured Reagan\u2019s victory. Gary Hart had portrayed Mondale as a candidate of the \u201cspecial interests,\u201d and the Republicans did so as well. Ferraro\u2019s nomination did not overcome a perceived gender gap, as 56 percent of voting women chose Reagan.\n\nReagan won a decisive victory, carrying all states except Minnesota, Mondale\u2019s home state, and the District of Columbia. He received 54,455,074 popular votes to Mondale\u2019s total of 37,577,185. In the Electoral College, the count was Reagan, 525, and Mondale, 13.\n\n1988: George H.W. Bush vs. Michael Dukakis\n\nAlthough Vice President George Bush faced some opposition in the primaries from Senator Robert Dole of Kansas in 1988, he won the Republican nomination by acclamation. He chose Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. The Democrats nominated Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, for president and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for vice president.\n\nDukakis had faced strong competition in the primaries, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson and Senator Gary Hart of Colorado. Hart withdrew from the race following revelations about an extramarital affair, and party regulars and political pundits perceived Jackson, a liberal and an African-American, as unlikely to win the general election.\n\nOnce again the Republicans were in the enviable situation of running during a time of relative tranquility and economic stability. After a campaign featuring controversial television ads, Bush and Quayle won 48,886,097 popular votes to 41,809,074 for Dukakis and Bentsen and carried the Electoral College, 426 to 111.\n\n1992: Bill Clinton vs. George H.W. Bush vs. H. Ross Perot\n\nIn 1991 incumbent President George H. W. Bush\u2019s approval ratings reached 88 percent, the highest in presidential history up to that point. But by 1992, his ratings had sunk, and Bush became the fourth sitting U.S. president to lose re-election.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Ross Perot led the polls with 39 percent of voter support. Although Perot came in a distant third, he was still the most successful third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.\n\nPopular Vote: 44,908,254 (Clinton) to 39,102,343 (Bush)Electoral College: 370 (Clinton) to 168 (Bush)\n\n1996: Bill Clinton vs. Robert Dole vs. H. Ross Perot vs. Ralph Nader\n\nAlthough Clinton won a decisive victory, he carried a mere four Southern states, signaling a decline in Southern support for Democrats who historically could count on the area as an electoral stronghold. Later, in the elections of 2000 and 2004, Democrats did not carry a single Southern state.\n\nThe 1996 election was the most lavishly funded up to that point. The combined amount spent by the two major parties for all federal candidates topped $2 billion, which was 33 percent more than what was spent in 1992.\n\nDuring this election, the Democratic National Committee was accused of accepting donations from Chinese contributors. Non-American citizens are forbidden by law from donating to U.S. politicians and 17 people were later convicted for the activity.\n\nPopular Vote: 45,590,703 (Clinton) to 37,816,307 (Dole). Electoral College: 379 (Clinton) to 159 (Dole)\n\nThe 2000 election was the fourth election in U.S. history in which the winner of the electoral votes did not carry the popular vote. It was the first such election since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison became president after winning more electoral votes but losing the popular vote to Grover Cleveland.\n\nGore conceded on election night but retracted his concession the next day when he learned that the vote in Florida was too close to call. Florida began a recount, but the U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled the recount unconstitutional.\n\nPolitical activist Ralph Nader ran on the Green Party ticket and captured 2.7 percent of the vote.\n\nPopular Vote: 50,996,582 (Gore) to 50,465,062 (Bush). Electoral College: 271 (Bush) to 266 (Gore)\n\n2004: George W. Bush vs. John Kerry\n\nTotal voter turnout for the 2004 presidential election numbered at about 120 million, an impressive 15 million increase from the 2000 vote.\n\nAfter the bitterly contested election of 2000, many were poised for a similar election battle in 2004. Although there were reported irregularities in Ohio, a recount confirmed the original vote counts with nominal differences that did not affect the final outcome.\n\nFormer Vermont governor Howard Dean was the expected Democratic candidate but lost support during the primaries. There was speculation that he sealed his fate when he let out a deep, guttural yell in front of a rally of supporters, which became known as the \u201cI Have a Scream\u201d speech because it was delivered on Martin Luther King Day.\n\nPopular Vote: 60,693,281 (Bush) to 57,355,978 (Kerry). Electoral College: 286 (Bush) to 251 (Kerry)\n\n2008: Barack Obama vs. John McCain\n\nIn this historic election, Barack Obama became the first African American to become president. With the Obama/Biden win, Biden became the first-ever Roman Catholic vice president.\n\nHad the McCain/Palin ticket won, John McCain would have been the oldest president in history, and Sarah Palin would have been the first woman vice president.\n\nPopular Vote: 69,297,997 (Obama) to 59,597,520 (McCain). Electoral College: 365 (Obama) to 173 (McCain).\n\n2012: Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney\n\nRomney, the first Mormon to receive a major party\u2019s nomination, fought off a number of Republican challengers in the primary, while the incumbent Obama faced no intra-party challenges.\n\nThe election, the first waged following the \u201cCitizens United\u201d Supreme Court decision that allowed for increased political contributions, cost more than $2.6 billion, with the two major-party candidates spending close to $1.12 billion that cycle.\n\nPopular Vote: 65,915,795 (Obama) to 60,933,504 (Romney). Electoral College: 332 (Obama) to 206 (Romney).\n\n2016: Donald J. Trump vs. Hillary R. Clinton\n\nThe 2016 election was unconventional in its level of divisiveness. Former first lady, New York Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first woman to be nominated by a major party in a U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump, a New York real estate baron and reality TV star, was quick to mock fellow Republicans running for the nomination as well as his Democratic opponent.\n\nIn what many political analysts considered a stunning upset, Trump, with his populist, nationalist campaign, lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College, becoming the nation's 45th president.\n\nPopular Vote: 65,853,516 (Clinton) to 62,984,825 (Trump). Electoral College: 306 (Trump) to 232 (Clinton).\n\n2020: Donald J. Trump vs. Joseph R. Biden\n\nThe 2020 election between incumbent Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden was historic in many ways. Voting took place in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which by November 2020 had claimed the lives of nearly 230,000 Americans. President Trump's handling of the public health crisis became a central issue in both campaigns. Trump, himself, became infected with COVID-19 in October and was briefly hospitalized.\n\nDespite taking place in the middle of a pandemic, more votes were cast in the 2020 election than any in U.S. presidential election history, and the voter turnout rate was the highest since 1900. Because so many ballots were cast by mail, Americans had to wait four days to learn which candidate they had elected as president.\n\nOn November 7, the Associated Press and major media outlets declared Biden the winner; his win was certified in the Electoral College on December 14 and by Congress on January 6, 2021. President Trump challenged the results through more than 50 legal challenges and refused to concede, insisting there was massive voter fraud, however no evidence of widespread fraud was determined.\n\nAt 78, Biden became the oldest-ever president-elect. Also historic: Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, became the first woman of color to be elected vice president.\n\nPopular Vote: 81,283,495 (Biden) to 74,223,753 (Trump). Electoral College: 306 (Biden) to 232 (Trump)."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Massachusetts,_1962", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nThe United States Senate special election of 1962 in Massachusetts was held on November 6, 1962.\n\nHistory\n\nSenator John F. Kennedy resigned the seat to become President of the United States after winning the presidential election in 1960. Benjamin A. Smith II, a Kennedy family friend, was appointed to succeed Kennedy, serving as a placeholder for Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy, who at the time was too young to be constitutionally eligible for the seat.[1]\n\nTed Kennedy first faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. \"Eddie\" McCormack, Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy's slogan was \"He can do more for Massachusetts\", the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier.[2] McCormack had the support of many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced (\"I back Jack but Teddy ain't ready\") and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which subsequently became public during the race.[3] Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, \"Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?\"[1] But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner.[1] In a televised debate, McCormack said \"The office of United States senator should be merited, and not inherited,\" and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore rather than Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy \"would be a joke.\"[3] Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing; combined with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin.[1]\n\nIn the Republican primary, George C. Lodge, a former member of the Eisenhower administration and the son of Henry Cabot Lodge, defeated Representative Laurence Curtis (MA-10). Harvard historian H. Stuart Hughes also ran for the Senate seat as an independent peace candidate. [4]\n\nIn the November special election, Kennedy defeated Lodge, whose father had lost this seat to then-Representative John F. Kennedy in 1952. In winning, Kennedy gained 55 percent of the vote.[1][5]\n\nResults\n\nPrimaries\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nDemocratic primary for the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1% Majority Turnout\n\nRepublican primary for the United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 [4] Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1%\n\nGeneral election\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962 Party Candidate Votes % \u00b1% Majority Turnout Democratic hold\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2012/10/09/kennedy-dynasty-whelan", "page_content": "If one is of a certain conservative Republican political bent, the name Kennedy evokes the same kind of emotional response that Boston sports fans usually reserve for the likes of Lebron James and Alex Rodriquez: intense hostility and irrational hatred. Yet, 60 years ago, Republican Party conservatives played a decisive role in creating the very thing they have since come to gnash their teeth over, the Kennedy family political dynasty.\n\nIn 1952, John F. Kennedy, then a brash and inexperienced Democratic congressman, defeated popular incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to become only the third Democrat in history to win a U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts. The victory paved the way for Kennedy\u2019s successful White House run in 1960, and opened the door for his brothers Robert and Edward to pursue future Senate seats and presidential campaigns. If he had lost in 1952, none of this would have been possible.\n\nSo how did Kennedy do it? According to many of his supporters, he won by outworking and outhustling his Republican opponent, by knocking on more doors, attending more political rallies, and generally ingratiating himself with the electorate.\n\nPresident John Kennedy and Henry Cabot Lodge pictured together on Dec. 12, 1961 in Washington. (AP File Photo)\n\nRetail politics aside, there is another, less well-known explanation for this political outcome. Heading into the 1952 election year, Lodge became deeply involved in efforts to see former World War II Supreme Allied Commander and Columbia University head Dwight D. Eisenhower become the Republican nominee for president. A moderate by nature and temperament, Lodge felt that the Republican Party had lurched too far to the right in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s during the liberal Democratic administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.\n\nHe believed the Republicans needed a credible middle-of-the-road alternative like Eisenhower to regain national prominence. Otherwise, it risked long term irrelevance, or worse. As he revealed in his 1973 memoir \"The Storm Has Many Eyes,\" Lodge feared the GOP would \u201ceither disintegrate completely or shrink into a small minority of extreme reactionaries and, in the South, a crew of patronage-hungry professionals.\u201d\n\nTo put Ike over the top, Lodge personally took charge of Eisenhower\u2019s campaign and engineered a stunning political upset at the Republican National Convention. He accused party conservatives backing the front runner, Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft, of \u201cstealing\u201d delegates. Taft, a prominent isolationist and leader of the GOP\u2019s right wing in Congress, had no effective political counter to this charge. Eisenhower easily chalked up a first ballot victory and went on to win the presidency in a landslide over Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson.\n\nGOP conservatives never forgave Lodge for what they regarded as his personal treachery against Taft. They sought political revenge, and the best way to deliver it was by abandoning him at the polls in Massachusetts and voting for Kennedy. \u201cIt seems likely,\u201d wrote a conservative to Lodge, \u201cthat a majority of Taft supporters will not help you, as your chief occupation for some years has been to destroy their interest\u2026You have fallen further than Lucifer.\u201d\n\nBasil Brewer, an influential New Bedford newspaper publisher and chairman of the Taft-for-President state committee, was equally vociferous in his condemnation. He publicly blasted Lodge for allegedly bolting his party with \u201chis votes for the Truman socialistic New Deal.\u201d Owing to the prevailing Red Scare attitudes of the day, he also unfairly accused Lodge of being soft on Communism. Kennedy, he wrote in the pages of his newspaper, \u201chas shown \u2026 a surer grasp of the problems and personalities involved in the nation\u2019s struggle for survival than his opponent, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.\u201d\n\nCome Election Day, the heavy hand of Brewer and his fellow state conservatives was felt at the ballot box. Lodge lost to Kennedy in a close race. \u201cYou see,\u201d Lodge later revealed in a JFK Library oral history, \u201cBrewer could make the difference of 35,000 votes. That\u2019s what he did. I was beaten by 70,000. If 35,000 had gone the other way, I\u2019d have been in the clear.\u201d\n\nA review of election results confirms this contention. When placed alongside the statewide vote of successful Republican gubernatorial candidate Christian Herter that year, Lodge\u2019s tally comes up 34,708 votes short. Add to this Lodge\u2019s under-performance in traditional conservative Republican strongholds and it\u2019s clear that he was adversely affected by these defections. \u201cI felt rather like a man who has just been hit by a truck,\u201d he wrote afterward.\n\nInterestingly, that has been a common reaction of conservatives running for office against a Kennedy in Massachusetts ever since."}, {"url": "https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2017/spring/jfk-congress", "page_content": "JFK in Congress\n\nKennedy Develops Expertise on National Issues as He Prepares to Seek Presidency\n\nSpring 2017, Vol. 49, No. 1\n\nBy David McMillen\n\nJohn F. Kennedy campaigns for the Presidency in Dayton, Ohio, in October 1960. (Sven Walnum Photograph Collection, Kennedy Library)\n\nThe year 1946 marked the closing of an era and the beginning of a new world order.\n\nWorld War II had ended just months before, and cities and towns were crowded with soldiers, sailors, and airmen returning from the European and Asian fronts. The world had witnessed the explosion of two atomic bombs to end the fighting. Rationing would soon end, and plants could turn from the manufacturing of war materials to washing machines, ovens, cars, and\u2014soon\u2014televisions.\n\nReturning veterans were eager to get back to work in civilian jobs and to enjoy a period of peace and security\u2014raise a family, buy a house, go to church, and know that tomorrow would be much like today. The nation, however, was still divided: internationalists vs. isolationists in the Republican party, and southerners vs. northerners in the Democratic party.\n\nInto this world stepped John F. Kennedy, a Navy war hero who stood out among the freshman class in the House of Representatives elected in November 1946. This class also included another former Navy man whose career arc would eventually intersect with Kennedy\u2019s\u2014Richard M. Nixon.\n\nBorn in 1917, Kennedy came from a wealthy Boston Irish family that had a long history in politics. His mother\u2019s father had been mayor of Boston and served in the U.S. House of Representatives. His father, following a successful business career, was the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission before his posting as the American ambassador to the United Kingdom and a brief flirtation with the idea of running for President himself in 1940.\n\nIn John Kennedy\u2019s campaign for the House seat from Boston, he voiced views that resonated with a public that had just suffered through a bloody world war. He called for better housing for veterans, better health care for all, and support for organized labor\u2019s campaign for reasonable work hours, a healthy workplace, and the right to organize, bargain, and strike. And he campaigned for peace through the United Nations and strong opposition to the Soviet Union.\n\nJFK Joins Battle Over Taft-Hartley\n\nJohn Kennedy (back row second from left) and Richard Nixon (far left) participate in a radio broadcast as 1947 freshmen House members. (Nixon Library)\n\nDuring his first term in the House, the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive housing bill (Taft-Wagner-Ellender Bill) that was blocked by conservatives in the House Banking Committee. Their proposal: a study. Kennedy supported the Senate bill, went to the House floor, and railed against this failure to act. However, as a freshman in the minority and not a member of any of the committees of jurisdiction, there was little else he could do. It would be the end of his second term before Congress finally passed a major housing bill. Even then Kennedy bemoaned that veterans suffered because of Congress\u2019s neglectful delay.\n\nLabor issues also gave Kennedy ample opportunity to stake out his position, although he had little sway over the Republican drafted legislation. Republicans, who controlled Congress, saw this as their opportunity to roll back many of the pro-union provisions that had been adopted during the Roosevelt era. The House passed an anti-union bill early in the 1947\u20131948 Congress championed by the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, Fred Hartley from New Jersey.\n\nKennedy argued against the Hartley bill, saying that it would make unions impotent in bargaining with management. While acknowledging that there was need for curtailing some union power, he argued that the Hartley bill went too far.\n\nAs with housing, Kennedy was more comfortable with the labor bill coming out of the Senate under the leadership of the moderate Ohio Republican, Robert Taft. However, the compromise Taft-Hartley bill went too far. Kennedy opposed it. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley bill, but his veto was overwhelmingly overridden.\n\nShortly after the Taft-Hartley Act became law, Kennedy travelled to McKeesport, Pennsylvania, about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, to debate the merits of the bill. His opponent in the debate was fellow freshman and fellow member of the Education and Labor Committee, Richard Nixon. They shared a meal after the debate and rode together in a berth on the train back to Washington. It is unclear who won the debate, but Nixon won the coin toss for the lower berth.\n\nKennedy\u2019s Statewide Machine Wins Him a U.S. Senate Seat\n\nBy the end of his first term in the House, Kennedy was already looking toward the Senate. However, he was not yet ready for a statewide race.\n\nFollowing his reelection to the House, he set a goal of speaking in every city and town in Massachusetts. Today, members of Congress travel to their home district nearly every weekend; however, that was not the case in 1948. Then, members traveled home only once every four to six weeks. Kennedy was the exception. He would leave Washington every Thursday evening and spend the next three days at any political event to which he could secure an invitation.\n\nAny political club, fraternal organization, veterans group, or business association that was looking for a speaker was on his list. As a congressman and war hero, he was welcome everywhere. While these speaking events gave Kennedy wider name recognition and the opportunity to meet people face to face, Kennedy also began compiling a list of names of individuals who could be tapped for campaign work in the future.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and Henry Cabot Lodge exchange greetings during the 1952 U.S. Senate campaign. (Kennedy Library)\n\nThat future began arriving in 1952. Kennedy ran for the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., and won.\n\nKennedy\u2019s victory over Lodge was neither a sure thing nor an easy one. Lodge was first elected to the Senate in 1936 and took a leave of absence to serve in World War II. When, in 1944, the secretary of war barred members of Congress from active duty, Lodge resigned his Senate seat to serve.\n\nLodge, too, was a war hero, just as Kennedy became when he rescued his crew after the Japanese destroyed his PT-109 in the Pacific. Fighting in Europe, Lodge single-handedly captured a four-man German patrol. Both men received high military honors.\n\nAfter the war, Lodge, a well-known moderate Republican, returned to Massachusetts and was reelected to the Senate in 1946. In 1952 Lodge spearheaded the effort to persuade Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the presidency and, following a hard-fought convention battle against Taft, became Eisenhower\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kennedy\u2019s Senate campaign got off to a slow start. It was his first statewide election, and he was still a relative newcomer to politics. However, before long, the Kennedy campaign began to take advantage of those thousands of names and contacts Kennedy had collected in his four-year barnstorming of the state. The women in the Kennedy family, his sisters and cousins, hosted teas across the state. Shaw reports that \u201cabout 75,000 women\u201d attended the Kennedy teas.\n\nThe Eisenhower campaign, however, may have been Lodge\u2019s undoing. By the time he turned his attention to his own campaign, Kennedy had a substantial campaign machine in operation. Kennedy won the election with 51.5 percent of the vote.\n\n(Elections with a Kennedy facing a Lodge have not been unusual in Massachusetts. In 1916, Lodge Sr. defeated Kennedy\u2019s grandfather for the same Senate seat, and in 1962 Edward Kennedy defeated Lodge\u2019s son George for the seat\u2019s unexpired term vacated when John Kennedy was elected President.)\n\nKennedy in the Senate: Now a National Figure\n\nPolitically, the 1950s are defined by the Eisenhower/Nixon administration. Kennedy\u2019s defeat of Lodge came in the midst of a Republican landslide. In 1952, Eisenhower captured 55 percent of the popular vote and 81 percent of the Electoral College. The Republicans took control of the House with a 42-seat swing. The Senate was more closely divided with 48 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 1 Independent; however, nine deaths and one resignation during the 1953\u20131954 Congress resulted in control of the Senate shifting from Republican to Democrat to Republican again.\n\nThe 1950s are often characterized as an idyllic time. Television shows like Leave it to Beaver and Father Knows Best showed family harmony and a time of little stress. Eisenhower governed as a modern Republican in contrast to the frenzied pace of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.\n\nIn fact, the 1950s was a period of rapid social change.\n\nThe baby boom encompassed the entire decade, and rapid population growth spurred economic demand. Housing adopted the automobile\u2019s mass production techniques, which made homes affordable and made the suburbs possible. Families were more mobile, thanks to the automobile, the interstate highway system, the rise of fast food restaurants, and motel chains to serve those exploring America by car.\n\nThis rapid transformation of the social background was accompanied by an equally rapid transformation in Kennedy. He had progressed quickly during his six years in the House. He developed a potent campaign machine and defeated a popular incumbent. Now in the Senate, he set his sights on expanding his political skills and his attention to foreign affairs.\n\nKennedy\u2019s first committee assignments in the Senate were the Labor and Public Welfare Committee and the Government Operations Committee. His office was on the third floor of the Russell Senate Office Building, at the time the only Senate office building. Across the hall was the office of the President of the Senate, Vice President Richard Nixon.\n\nBreaking with New Englanders Over St. Lawrence Seaway\n\nIn late spring 1953, Kennedy gave three speeches on the Senate floor outlining his New England economic plan\u2014a plan he argued was good for both New England and the nation. Kennedy argued for a diversified economic base for New England with job training and technical assistance for the workers and relief from harmful tax provisions for the firms. He called for increasing the minimum wage and stronger enforcement of the child labor laws.\n\nKennedy argued that his economic plan would also strengthen the country\u2019s fight against communism. Federal and state programs that supported workers both on the job and when unemployed would challenge some of the allure of the communist program pitched to the unemployed and the poorly paid workers.\n\nFellow senators from New England and beyond, the press, and even the White House praised the young senator for addressing real problems and offering concrete solutions.\n\nKennedy distinguished himself again as a national figure in the debate and vote on building the St. Lawrence Seaway. Congress had discussed the seaway for more than 30 years without action, but in the 1953\u20131954 Congress it appeared that would change. In the first term, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a bill authorizing American participation in the construction of the seaway. The House Public Works Committee held hearings on the seaway but did not report a bill.\n\nAs a member of the House, Kennedy, like all members of the New England delegation, opposed the seaway. Conventional wisdom was that the seaway would harm both the Port of Boston and the entire New England economy. Now in the Senate, he took a broader perspective.\n\nAt the beginning of the second session of the 1953\u20131954 Congress, Kennedy announced his support for the seaway. It will be built, he argued, and thus the only question is whether it was better for the United States to participate in the construction and administration of the seaway. Both national security and the national economy would benefit from U.S. participation. The seaway was authorized later that year with Kennedy voting in support of the bill. No Massachusetts senator or representative had ever supported the seaway project.\n\nKennedy\u2019s vote was criticized in the New England press, but he was praised nationally for his willingness to put the interests of the country above parochial concerns. Kennedy positioned himself as a national statesman.\n\nCampaign paths crossed for Adlai Stevenson (left) and Estes Kefauver in Tampa, Florida. (National Archives, 306-PS-56-7877)\n\nA Chance to Burnish A Scholarly Reputation\n\nKennedy was also making his mark as the scholar senator. Kennedy\u2019s Harvard senior thesis had been published in 1940 as Why England Slept and quickly became a bestseller. In 1956, he published Profiles in Courage, which spent months on the New York Times bestseller list and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1957. His reputation as a scholar led Vice President Nixon to appoint Kennedy chair of a committee to select the five most outstanding senators to appear in a Senate Hall of Fame. The chairmanship was destined to produce considerable publicity, and his name also appeared each week on the bestseller list.\n\nNow Kennedy\u2019s name began to appear on lists of potential running mates for Adlai Stevenson to challenge the Eisenhower/Nixon ticket in the 1956 election.\n\nKennedy was a star at the August 1956 Democratic convention. He narrated the introductory film about the Democratic Party, The Pursuit of Happiness. Stevenson asked Kennedy to place his name in nomination. Kennedy responded with a glowing defense of Stevenson and the party and a tough critique of the Eisenhower/Nixon record.\n\nTurning Point in 1956: A Loss Becomes a Win\n\nSenator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee was the favorite for the vice-presidential nomination, which Stevenson threw open to the convention. Kefauver had led a special committee investigation into organized crime that was one of the first televised Senate hearings, and the publicity made him a well-known name. Despite Kefauver\u2019s advantage, Kennedy made a strong showing at the convention. No candidate was selected on the first ballot, and Kennedy had the lead on the second ballot, but not enough votes to secure the nomination. When Kefauver ultimately won the nomination, Kennedy called on the convention to make the nomination unanimous. Even in defeat, his star rose.\n\nKennedy campaigned relentlessly for the Stevenson/Kefauver ticket. According to John T. Shaw in JFK in the Senate: Pathway to the Presidency, Kennedy traveled more than 30,000 miles, gave more than 150 speeches, and covered 24 states in the weeks leading up to the election. Stevenson and Kefauver lost the election, and by Thanksgiving, Kennedy had decided to run for President.\n\nKennedy negotiated the Senate Hall of Fame committee with political skill. What could have been a minefield with everyone pushing their own agenda turned into unanimous support for the committee\u2019s selections. Kennedy established rigorous evaluation criteria, consulted with noted historians, and recognized both the context of the Senate and the times in which the senators served. The five senators honored were Henry Clay of Kentucky (Whig 1831\u20131842, 1849\u20131852), Daniel Webster of Massachusetts (Whig, 1827\u20131841, 1845\u20131850), John C. Calhoun of South Carolina (Democrat, 1832\u20131843, 1845\u20131850), Robert M. LaFollette, Sr., of Wisconsin (Republican, 1906\u20131925), and Robert Taft of Ohio (Republican, 1939\u20131953).\n\nWhile planning a run for the presidency, Kennedy made good use of his time in the Senate.\n\nHe used his position on the Senate Labor Committee to push for an increase in the minimum wage and to protect union rights in an environment where Congress was trying to strip unions of any power to bargain effectively.\n\nKennedy joined the Foreign Relations Committee in 1957. There he supported Algerian independence from France and sponsored an amendment that would provide aid to Russian satellite nations. Kennedy also introduced an amendment to the National Defense Education Act to eliminate the requirement that aid recipients sign a loyalty oath and provide supporting affidavits. Service on the Foreign Relations committee strengthened candidate Kennedy\u2019s international credentials.\n\nThe McClellan Committee Gets a National TV Audience\n\nRobert and John Kennedy confer during a session of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management. (Kennedy Library)\n\nKennedy\u2019s role on the McClellan Committee, chaired by Arkansas Democrat John McClellan, also bolstered his credentials as a candidate. The McClellan Committee was established in 1957 to investigate labor management relations in the postwar environment of organized labor. When the time came to write legislation, the committee turned to Kennedy, who drafted and managed the labor bill through the Senate and managed the conference committee with the House.\n\nThe formal title of the committee was the Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management. McClellan had been investigating organized labor through his subcommittee in the Government Operations Committee. The unions objected, arguing that the appropriate place for such investigations was in the Senate Labor Committee, where Kennedy chaired the Labor Subcommittee. McClellan resisted transferring jurisdiction because he feared Kennedy was too pro-union. To resolve this jurisdictional conflict, the Senate created the Select Committee; Robert Kennedy, the senator\u2019s brother, was selected as chief counsel.\n\nThe growth of television in the 1950s changed the political landscape in Congress. The broadcast of the McClellan Committee hearings provided an opportunity for senators to be seen by voters across the country. Kennedy took full advantage of the hearings to be seen as a fair and intelligent senator. Earlier in the decade, gavel-to-gavel telecasts of the Army-McCarthy hearings were a significant factor in the decline of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican who had been riding an anticommunist wave since the beginning of the decade.\n\nCorruption in the Teamsters Union was a continuing focus of the select committee. After repeatedly invoking the Fifth Amendment before the committee, Dave Beck was forced out as president of the union. That led to repeated clashes between Kennedy and James Hoffa, who succeeded Beck. While the committee repeatedly uncovered evidence of corruption in the Teamsters Union, it was unsuccessful in removing Hoffa. However, Hoffa\u2019s reputation was tarnished enough that the Teamsters were expelled from the AFL-CIO.\n\nWhen it came time to draft legislation based on the findings of the McClellan Committee investigation, the committee turned to Kennedy. He consulted widely with political and legal experts, held 15 hearings, and worked with his Republican counterpart, Senator Irving Ives of New York, to craft the bill. The Kennedy-Ives bill contained a number of provisions to constrain both management and union activity. The bill passed the Senate 88 to 1; however, the House refused to act on it before Congress adjourned. Early in his career, Kennedy had gone to the House floor to scold his colleagues for failing to act on economic reform. He took to the Senate floor to do the same when the House failed to act on the Kennedy-Ives bill.\n\nIves retired at the end of the 1957\u20131958 Congress, and Kennedy, reelected easily in 1958, turned to fellow Democrat Sam Ervin from North Carolina for support. The Kennedy-Ervin bill passed the Senate early in the 1959\u20131960 Congress with added provisions to garner stronger support from labor. The House responded by passing a strong anti-labor bill, and Kennedy presided over the House-Senate conference to resolve the differences.\n\nKennedy saw the compromise bill as deeply flawed because it contained too many of the anti-union provisions from the House; however, it was the only bill possible. Despite the disappointing content of the bill, Kennedy won high praise from several of his Senate colleagues for his command of the subject matter and his political skills in managing the bill to conclusion.\n\nOn January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for President of the United States. From that point forward, he was no longer Senator Kennedy but Candidate Kennedy, and he rarely attended committee hearings or Senate votes.\n\nHe put together a careful plan for winning the nomination and in the process defeated more experienced politicians like Hubert Humphrey, Stuart Symington, and Lyndon Johnson. He then built a skillful general election campaign for the presidency, defeating his freshman colleague, Richard Nixon.\n\nNote on Sources\n\nFor information about John F.

He also led a renewed drive for public service and eventually provided federal support for the growing civil rights movement. His assassination on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, sent shockwaves around the world and turned the all-too-human Kennedy into a larger-than-life heroic figure. To this day, historians continue to rank him among the best-loved presidents in American history.\n\nElected in 1960 as the 35th president of the United States, 43-year-old John F. Kennedy became one of the youngest U.S. presidents, as well as the first Roman Catholic to hold the office. Born into one of America\u2019s wealthiest families, he parlayed an elite education and a reputation as a military hero into a successful run for Congress in 1946 and for the Senate in 1952.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy\u2019s Early Life\n\nBorn on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy (known as Jack) was the second of nine children. His parents, Joseph and Rose Kennedy, hailed from two of Boston\u2019s most prominent Irish Catholic political families. Despite persistent health problems throughout his childhood and teenage years (he would later be diagnosed with a rare endocrine disorder called Addison\u2019s disease), Jack led a privileged youth. He attended private schools such as Canterbury and Choate and spent summers in Hyannis Port on Cape Cod. Joe Kennedy, a hugely successful businessman and an early supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 and named U.S. ambassador to Great Britain in 1937. As a student at Harvard University, Jack traveled in Europe as his father\u2019s secretary. His senior thesis about Britain\u2019s unpreparedness for war was later published as an acclaimed book, Why England Slept (1940).\n\nDid you know? John F. Kennedy's Senate career got off to a rocky start when he refused to condemn Senator Joseph McCarthy, a personal friend of the Kennedy family whom the Senate voted to censure in 1954 for his relentless pursuit of suspected communists. In the end, though he planned to vote against McCarthy, Kennedy missed the vote when he was hospitalized after back surgery.\n\nJack joined the U.S. Navy in 1941 and two years later was sent to the South Pacific, where he was given command of a Patrol-Torpedo (PT) boat. In August 1943, a Japanese destroyer struck the craft, PT-109, in the Solomon Islands. Kennedy helped some of his marooned crew back to safety and was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism. His older brother, Joe Jr., was not so fortunate: He was killed in August 1944 when his Navy airplane exploded on a secret mission against a German rocket-launching site. A grieving Joe Sr. told Jack it was his duty to fulfill the destiny once intended for Joe Jr.\u2014to become the first Catholic president of the United States.\n\nJFK\u2019s Beginnings in Politics\n\nAbandoning plans to be a journalist, Jack left the Navy by the end of 1944. Less than a year later, he returned to Boston, preparing a run for Congress in 1946. As a moderately conservative Democrat, and backed by his father\u2019s fortune, Jack won his party\u2019s nomination handily and carried the mostly working-class Eleventh District by nearly three to one over his Republican opponent in the general election. He entered the 80th Congress in January 1947, at the age of 29, and immediately attracted attention (as well as some criticism from older members of the Washington establishment) for his youthful appearance and relaxed, informal style.\n\nKennedy won reelection to the House of Representatives in 1948 and 1950, and in 1952 ran successfully for the Senate, defeating the popular Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. On September 12, 1953, Kennedy married the beautiful socialite and journalist Jacqueline (Jackie) Lee Bouvier. Two years later, he was forced to undergo a painful operation on his back. While recovering from the surgery, Jack wrote another best-selling book, Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957. (The book was later revealed to be mostly the work of Kennedy\u2019s longtime aide, Theodore Sorenson.)\n\nKennedy\u2019s Road to Presidency\n\nAfter nearly earning his party\u2019s nomination for vice president (under Adlai Stevenson) in 1956, Kennedy announced his candidacy for president on January 2, 1960. He defeated a primary challenge from the more liberal Hubert Humphrey and chose the Senate majority leader, Lyndon Johnson of Texas, as his running mate. In the general election, Kennedy faced a difficult battle against his Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, a two-term vice president under the popular Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nOffering a young, energetic alternative to Nixon and the status quo, Kennedy benefited from his performance (and telegenic appearance) in the first-ever televised presidential debates, watched by millions of viewers. In November\u2019s election, Kennedy won by a narrow margin\u2014fewer than 120,000 out of some 70 million votes cast\u2014becoming the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic to be elected president of the United States.\n\nWith his beautiful young wife and their two small children (Caroline, born in 1957, and John Jr., born just weeks after the election), Kennedy lent an unmistakable aura of youth and glamour to the White House. In his inaugural address, given on January 20, 1961, the new president called on his fellow Americans to work together in the pursuit of progress and the elimination of poverty, but also in the battle to win the ongoing Cold War against communism around the world. Kennedy\u2019s famous closing words expressed the need for cooperation and sacrifice on the part of the American people: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s Foreign Policy Challenges\n\nAn early crisis in the foreign affairs arena occurred in April 1961, when Kennedy approved the plan to send 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles in an amphibious landing at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. Intended to spur a rebellion that would overthrow the communist leader Fidel Castro, the mission ended in failure, with nearly all of the exiles captured or killed.\n\nThat June, Kennedy met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna to discuss the city of Berlin, which had been divided after World War II between Allied and Soviet control. Two months later, East German troops began erecting a wall to divide the city. Kennedy sent an army convoy to reassure West Berliners of U.S. support, and would deliver one of his most famous speeches in West Berlin in June 1963.\n\nKennedy clashed again with Khrushchev in October 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. After learning that the Soviet Union was constructing a number of nuclear and long-range missile sites in Cuba that could pose a threat to the continental United States, Kennedy announced a naval blockade of Cuba.\n\nThe tense standoff lasted nearly two weeks before Khrushchev agreed to dismantle Soviet missile sites in Cuba in return for America\u2019s promise not to invade the island and the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey and other sites close to Soviet borders. In July 1963, Kennedy won his greatest foreign affairs victory when Khrushchev agreed to join him and Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in signing a nuclear test ban treaty. In Southeast Asia, however, Kennedy\u2019s desire to curb the spread of communism led him to escalate U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, even as privately he expressed his dismay over the situation.\n\nKennedy\u2019s Leadership at Home\n\nDuring his first year in office, Kennedy oversaw the launch of the Peace Corps, which would send young volunteers to underdeveloped countries all over the world. Otherwise, he was unable to achieve much of his proposed legislation during his lifetime, including two of his biggest priorities: income tax cuts and a civil rights bill. Slow to commit himself to the civil rights cause, events forced Kennedy into action, spurring him to send federal troops to support the desegregation of the University of Mississippi after riots there left two dead and many others injured. The following summer, Kennedy announced his intention to propose a comprehensive civil rights bill and endorsed the massive March on Washington that took place that August.\n\nKennedy held enormous popularity, both at home and abroad, and his family drew famous comparisons to King Arthur\u2019s court at Camelot. His brother Bobby served as his attorney general, while the youngest Kennedy son, Edward (Ted), was elected to Jack\u2019s former Senate seat in 1962. Jackie Kennedy became an international icon of style, beauty and sophistication, though stories of her husband\u2019s numerous marital infidelities (and his personal association with members of organized crime) would later emerge to complicate the Kennedys\u2019 idyllic image.\n\nJFK\u2019s Assassination\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president and his wife landed in Dallas; he had spoken in San Antonio, Austin and Fort Worth the day before. From the airfield, the party then traveled in a motorcade to the Dallas Trade Mart, the site of Jack\u2019s next speaking engagement. Shortly after 12:30 p.m., as the motorcade passed through downtown Dallas, shots rang out. Bullets struck Kennedy twice, in the neck and head; he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at a nearby hospital.\n\nAuthorities arrested 24-old Lee Harvey Oswald, known to have Communist sympathies, for the killing. But he was shot and fatally wounded two days later by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby while being led to jail. Almost immediately, alternative theories of Kennedy\u2019s assassination emerged\u2014including conspiracies allegedly run by the KGB, the Mafia and the U.S. military-industrial complex, among others.

Joseph Patrick Kennedy III lost his presumptuous race for the U.S. Senate all by himself.\n\nA promising but impatient young man\u2019s sense of entitlement took a drubbing, not the Kennedy legacy, when Senator Ed Markey beat back his Democratic challenger on Tuesday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for waiting, for sitting on the sidelines,\u201d Kennedy said when he launched his upstart campaign a year ago, leaving mystified voters wondering when a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives had become \u201cthe sidelines.\u201d\n\nThat certainly was not Kennedy\u2019s pitch in 2012 when he defeated a crowded field to replace Barney Frank, the retiring Democratic congressman from the much-amended district once represented by his father Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, his great uncle John Fitzgerald Kennedy, his great-great grandfather John \u201cHoney Fitz\u201d Fitzgerald. Joe\u2019s reputation then, born of a stellar academic record at Stanford and the Harvard Law School, was of a charming but sober Kennedy, more interested in issues than in the spotlight his family name invariably attracts.\n\nIn this December, 1960, file photo, then President-elect John F.

(AP)\n\nBy most measures, he fulfilled those expectations during four terms in the House, doing yeoman\u2019s work on health care, immigration, disability rights and a host of fields first plowed by previous generations of Kennedys in public service. He was the antithesis of a showboat, attracting fewer comments about his charisma than about his melting lip balm and awkward delivery when he offered the Democrats\u2019 rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech in 2018.\n\nHe made that speech from Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School in Fall River, underscoring the Kennedy scion\u2019s commitment to the hardscrabble corners of his district. Like his grandfather, Robert Francis Kennedy, he championed the poor and the working poor, people with struggles he would never encounter in his own cosseted life or in the lives of most of those he knew at Harvard and Stanford or in Hyannis Port.\n\nHe overreached when he tried in this race to paint himself as the true man of Massachusetts and the incumbent a creature of Washington, based on where they spent the most time in residence. It was an odd argument, given that RFK launched his own bid for the Senate from New York in a Long Island house he had only just purchased. Markey does, indeed, own a home in suburban Washington, as did Ted Kennedy during his long tenure in the Senate, but Markey lives, as well, in the small house in Malden in which he was reared in modest circumstances."}, {"url": "https://www.senate.gov/states/MA/timeline.htm", "page_content": "June 26 From a number of competing proposals, the Constitutional Convention members selected the recommendation of Massachusetts delegate Nathaniel Gorham of Charlestown that U.S. senators serve a six-year term.\n\nFebruary 6 Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nMarch 4 The Senate convened for the first time at Federal Hall in New York City.

He challenged the South's seeming willingness to subvert the Union for regional economic gain and its assertion that a state could defy any act of Congress that conflicted with its interests. Webster broadened a debate on tariffs, slavery, and land into a consideration of national sovereignty. This debate established Webster as a major statesman and confirmed the brilliance of his oratorical skills.\n\nFebruary 22 Daniel Webster resigned from the Senate to become U.S. secretary of state.

Addressing the Senate in support of the Compromise of 1850, he spoke the famous opening lines: \"I wish to speak today not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a northern man, but as an American\u2026I speak today for the preservation of the Union. Hear me for my cause.\" The speech ultimately led to his resignation from the Senate, on July 22, 1850.\n\nJuly 20 The Senate confirmed the nomination of Daniel Webster as secretary of state under President Millard Fillmore. Webster first served as secretary of state from 1841 to 1843, under Presidents Harrison and Tyler.

Hoar delivered a two-day speech opposing a constitutional amendment providing for direct popular election of U.S. senators. He argued that such a change would promote electoral corruption and produce senators of inferior quality. His remarks became legendary in his time and served to block active consideration of such an amendment for another decade.\n\nThe Senate acquired a portrait bust of Charles Sumner, sculpted by Martin Milmore. The Massachusetts state legislature had presented the bust to George Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, in appreciation of the eulogy of Sumner Curtis had delivered before that body. Curtis's widow subsequently gifted the bust to the Senate.\n\nGeorge F.

Weeks had served in the Senate from 1913 to 1919.\n\nMarch 4 Frederick H. Gillett of Westfield took his Senate oath following a 32-year career in the U.S. House of Representatives. During his last six years in the House, Gillett served as Speaker.

Walsh became chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor (precursor to today's Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions), at the beginning of the New Deal era.\n\nJanuary 17 The Senate confirmed the nomination of Felix Frankfurter of Boston as associate justice to the Supreme Court.\n\nFebruary 4 Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., resigned from the Senate to resume military service during World War II. Two years earlier, as an incumbent senator, he had served with American tank crews in Libya. A subsequent order by the War Department prohibiting members of Congress from active duty in the armed forces prompted his definite conclusion that, \"Given my age [42] and military training, I must henceforth serve my country as a combat soldier in the Army overseas.\" In 1946, following his tour of duty in Europe, Lodge won reelection to the Senate.\n\nJanuary 3 Senate Republicans elected Leverett Saltonstall of Dover as their party's whip, a post he held until 1957.\n\nJanuary 13 Leverett Saltonstall became chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and served until the close of the 83rd Congress in 1955.\n\nJanuary 20 The Senate confirmed the nomination of former senator Sinclair Weeks as secretary of commerce.

Two years later, Kennedy lost the whip's job to Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV). Despite the bitterness of that moment, the two senators later became close personal friends.\n\nNovember 7 Paul Tsongas of Lowell defeated incumbent senator Edward Brooke. Diagnosed in 1983 with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, he chose not to seek a second term in 1984.

Both parents hailed from wealthy Boston families with long political histories. His maternal grandfather had been mayor of Boston. Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, had made a fortune in the stock market, entertainment, and other business, managing to take his money out of the stock market just before the crash of 1929. Though the ensuing Great Depression gripped the nation, \u201cJack\u201d and his eight siblings enjoyed a privileged childhood of elite private schools, sailboats, servants, and summer homes. Kennedy later claimed that his only experience of the Great Depression came from what he read in books while attending Harvard University.\n\nFor John, this privileged childhood was interrupted repeatedly by chronic bouts of illness. Afflicted with an almost constant stream of ailments, several of which went undiagnosed, Kennedy spent much of his time recuperating.\n\nIn 1938, on the eve of the Second World War, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Joseph P. Kennedy, John's father, to the key post of ambassador to the United Kingdom. The new ambassador was unsympathetic to British preparedness policies and found a cool reception in London. That year, Jack inherited $1 million dollars from his family, but his ambition remained strong. While in England with his father, he wrote his senior essay for Harvard University on England's lack of readiness for the Second World War. It was published and was well received by critics, becoming a bestseller under the title, Why England Slept.\n\nWorld War II Military Service\n\nAfter Kennedy graduated from Harvard, the United States entered World War II. His efforts to join the US Navy were initially thwarted by his ill-health, but after his father invervened, he was eventually admitted and assigned to serve in the South Pacific, commanding a small motor-torpedo boat, or \u201cPT boat.\u201d Kennedy and his crew participated in the campaign to wrest thousands of islands from Japanese control.\n\nIn August 1943, as the sailors were sleeping without posting a watch (in violation of naval regulations), a Japanese destroyer rammed his boat, PT 109. Towing a badly burned crewmate by a life-jacket strap clenched in his teeth, Kennedy led the crew's ten survivors on a three-mile swim to refuge on a tiny island. The crew hid on the island from the enemy for days until Kennedy managed to summon help.\n\nWidely credited with the rescue of his crew, Kennedy received the US Navy and Marine Corps Medal for Valor and a Purple Heart for injuries he sustained. Nevertheless, he returned home to a naval inquiry on the sinking. Although a board found evidence of poor seamanship, the Navy needed heroes more than it needed scapegoats, and Kennedy was cast as the former to build public morale, and recruited to go on speaking tours.\n\nThe war ended in 1945, but not without a deep cost to the Kennedy family: the oldest son, Joseph Jr., a pilot, was killed on a bombing mission in Europe. Handsome and outgoing, Joseph had been the one tapped by his father to become president one day. Upon his death, his father's aspirations fell on John.\n\nThe Political Climb\n\nAfter being discharged from the Navy, John Kennedy worked briefly as a reporter for the Hearst newspapers, and in 1946, the twenty-nine-year-old Kennedy won election to the US Congress representing a working-class Boston district. He served three terms in the US House of Representatives, earning a reputation as a somewhat conservative Democrat. He was re-elected in 1948 and again in 1950. In 1952, he ran for the US Senate and defeated the Republican incumbent from another Massachusetts family with a long political history, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. That same year, he met Jacqueline Bouvier at a dinner party, and, as he later put it, \u201cleaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date.\u201d The two were married a year later and had three children, one of whom died in infancy in August 1963.\n\nKennedy continued to be dogged by poor health. Left thin and sallow by malaria brought home from the war in the Pacific, he also suffered from Addison's disease, which many doctors considered terminal. He relied on a steady stream of painkillers and steroids to treat the symptoms of his many ailments. Constant back pain prevented him from lifting even his own small children. Ironically, though, Kennedy's public image was one of youth, health, and vigor.\n\nKennedy put one period of enforced convalescence from back surgery to productive use by writing Profiles in Courage, a book about eight American senators who had taken unpopular but admirable moral stands. Benefiting also from the handiwork of Senate staffer Theodore Sorensen, the book won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957.\n\nDue to his continuing poor health, Kennedy had one of the worst attendance records in Congress. His real achievements in the Senate were few, but almost immediately after election he began angling for even higher office. In 1956, he mounted a serious quest for the vice presidential spot alongside presidential hopeful Adlai Stevenson. He narrowly lost the bid to Estes Kefauver, a senator from Tennessee.\n\nUltimately, though, this defeat proved a blessing. The Republican incumbents, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard M. Nixon, soundly beat Stevenson and Kefauver that fall; neither Democrat would ever be a real contender for the office again. Kennedy, however, remained untarnished by Stevenson's defeat, and the exposure he got at the 1956 national Democratic convention made him a serious contender for the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nReelected to the Senate in 1958, Kennedy became a member of its influential Foreign Relations Committee, which he used as a platform to attack President Eisenhower's diplomatic and military policies, claiming that the United States was on the wrong side of a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union. Kennedy continued to press these themes as he began maneuvering to get the Democratic nomination for the 1960 presidential election."}, {"url": "https://millercenter.org/president/kennedy/campaigns-and-elections", "page_content": "The Campaign and Election of 1960\n\nThe election of 1960 brought to the forefront a generation of politicians born in the twentieth century, pitting the 47-year-old Republican vice president Richard M. Nixon against the 43-year-old Democratic challenger John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy's chief rival for the nomination was Hubert H. Humphrey from Minnesota, whose steadfast liberalism played well with many in the Midwest. The two fought it out in thirteen primaries. Humphrey's best hope rested on winning in his \u201cback yard\u201d of neighboring Wisconsin, and then painting himself as the new favorite. But Kennedy's superior planning, financing, and political instincts won out, and he beat Humphrey in his own region.\n\nThe nomination's turning point occurred in the West Virginia primary. A working-class, heavily Protestant state, West Virginia was critical for Kennedy, who had to show that a wealthy Catholic was electable there. Humphrey desperately threw all his remaining resources into the fray, even tapping a savings fund for his daughter's upcoming wedding. But the Kennedy machine overwhelmed him with money and savvy. In West Virginia, the only state in which it was legal for a campaign to pay workers and voters money for showing up at the polls, Kennedy's financing gave him a distinct advantage. Dispirited and broke, Humphrey abandoned the race.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention held in Los Angeles in early July, Kennedy defeated his nearest rival, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, the Senate majority leader, on the first ballot. Kennedy then invited Johnson to become his running mate, a controversial move made ostensibly to placate the South, bypassing other party leaders such as Humphrey and Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy pledged to \u201cget the country moving again.\u201d Americans, he said, stood \u201con the edge of New Frontier\u2014of the 1960s\u2014a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils\u2014a frontier of unfilled hopes and threats.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans, meeting a few weeks later in Chicago, nominated Nixon, making him the first vice president in the history of the modern two-party system to win the presidential nomination in his own right. Nixon chose Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., the chief US delegate to the United Nations, as his running mate.\n\nOnce he had won the nomination of his party, Kennedy undertook the task of convincing American voters that he would make a better president than his rival. Kennedy cast himself as a Cold War liberal and promised to lead America out of what he called the \u201cconservative rut\u201d into which he accused Eisenhower, and by implication Nixon, of running the country. It was apparent throughout the campaign that the election would be close. A Gallup poll in late August put Nixon and Kennedy tied at 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecided.\n\nKennedy faced two great hurdles in his quest for the White House: his youth and his religion. Polls revealed that many Americans balked at the prospect of such a young man, untested on the world stage, leading the nation at a time of threatening Cold War peril, especially after Dwight Eisenhower, who projected a comforting grandfatherly image. For Nixon, although he was only four years older than Kennedy, this issue was less acute since he had the advantage of having served as vice president for the duration of Eisenhower's two terms and was therefore a more familiar face.\n\nEven more unsettling to many Protestants was the prospect of a Roman Catholic, whom the Catholic Church might \u201ccontrol,\u201d as the nation's president. Kennedy chose to tackle the religious issue openly and directly, giving a series of speeches designed to address any misgivings about his faith and voluntarily subjecting himself to a round of questioning about his views on church-state relations by leading Protestant clergy in Houston. The group's conclusion that they were satisfied with his answers provided a degree of comfort for many non-Catholic voters.\n\nTelevised Debates\n\nIn order to overcome Nixon's advantage in public recognition, Kennedy challenged Nixon to a series of televised debates. Nixon, an experienced debater, accepted. The series of debates between the two candidates became the first extensive use of what would thereafter become a staple medium of American political campaigns\u2014television. Broadcast live on national television in late September and early October, the four debates ultimately provided the Kennedy campaign with a huge boost.\n\nSeventy million people watched the first debate. The Richard Nixon that viewers saw on their black-and-white television sets appeared pallid, tense, and uncomfortable. Just out of the hospital for the treatment of an infected cut, he wore a light-colored suit that blended into the gray background; in combination with the harsh studio lighting that left Nixon perspiring, he offered a less-than commanding presence. By contrast, Kennedy appeared relaxed, tanned, and telegenic.\n\nA mythology has taken root about post-debate opinion polls and their revelations about popular perceptions of the two candidates. Allegedly, those who had listened to the debates on the radio thought that Nixon had won, with the larger television audience being generally more impressed with Kennedy. No such comparative polls exist, however, and the market research on which those conclusions rest incorporated too few radio listeners to be statistically valid.\n\nBoth candidates traveled extensively and spent freely. Nixon, however, was hamstrung by an unfortunate early pledge to campaign in every state of the union. The trips to vote-poor states took precious time and money, while Kennedy focused his resources and time on the states with the most electoral college votes.\n\nOn Election Day, November 8, Kennedy won the popular vote by less than 120,000 votes out of a record 68.8 million ballots cast. Kennedy won the electoral college vote more clearly, winning 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (with Virginia's Harry F. Byrd winning 15). The closeness of the election naturally fueled speculation of tampering on both sides. In Chicago, Democratic mayor Richard Daley delivered an unusually good result for Kennedy\u2014a result that came under scrutiny when Kennedy won Illinois by less than 9,000 votes. Citing voting irregularities, the Republican National Committee unsuccessfully challenged the Illinois vote in federal court, although Nixon carefully distanced himself from the various legal challenges presented by his party and his supporters. Suspicious results also emerged in Texas and elsewhere. Kennedy was initially believed to have won California, but after absentee ballots had been counted, that state's electors declared for Nixon.\n\nInauguration and Transition\n\nOn a cold January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy took the oath of office. After such a close campaign, Kennedy knew his inaugural address would have to reach out to his opponents. In the days and weeks before it was to be delivered, he carefully studied famous American speeches, such as the Gettysburg Address, and copied their terse, vivid style. Departing from the pattern of many inaugural addresses, Kennedy pulled few punches and focused almost exclusively on matters outside the nation's borders. In addition, he claimed that his election signaled a fundamental generational shift in America:\n\n\u201cWe observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom\u2014symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning\u2014signifying renewal, as well as change . . . Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans\u2014born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage\u2014and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\u201d\n\nAnd he recalled the nation's revolutionary origins: \u201cLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear in burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.\u201d In forming his administration, Kennedy surrounded himself with liberal intellectuals and, in light of the close popular vote, moderate conservatives espousing strong executive governance, rational planning, and a belief in the virtues of social science. An elite group of young, rich professionals, dubbed the \u201cNew Frontiersmen,\u201d poured into Washington, adding to the tone of a White House seeking counsel from the nation's best and brightest."}]}
