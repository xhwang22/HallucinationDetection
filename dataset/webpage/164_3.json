His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the g\u00e9nero chico, the zarzuela and the grotesque, came to dominate the Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century.\n\nAfter starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, Casa editorial. Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music.\n\nArniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, often a scathing critic of contemporary Spanish theatre, as 'more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment'.\n\nFollowing the end of the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/arniches-carlos-1866-1943", "page_content": "Arniches, Carlos 1866\u20131943\n\n(Carlos Jorge German Arniches Barrera)\n\nPERSONAL: Surname is pronounced \"ar-nee-chez\"; born October 11, 1866, in Alicante, Spain; died following a heart attack, April 16, 1943, in Madrid, Spain; son of Carlos Arniches (a paymaster at a tobacco factory) and Maria Antonia Barrera (a homemaker); married Pilar Molt\u00f3 Campo-Redondo, July 12, 1894; children: Carlos, Jos\u00e9, Maria, Fernando, Rosario.\n\nCAREER: Playwright.\n\nMEMBER: Society of Spanish Authors (president, 1922).\n\nAWARDS, HONORS: Named \"Alicante's Favorite Son,\" 1921, and \"Madrid's Favorite Adpoted Son,\" 1931; inductee, Ateneo Iberoamericano, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nWRITINGS:\n\nPLAYS\n\nCasa editorial (title means \"Publishing House\"; one-act play), music by Rafael Taboada, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1888.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) La verdad desnuda (title means \"The Naked Truth\"; one-act play), music by Apolinar Brull, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1888.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) Las manias (title means \"Manias\"; one-act play), music by Ruperto Chap\u00ed, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1888.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) Ortograf\u00eda (title means \"Orthography\"; one-act play), music by Ruperto Chap\u00ed, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1888.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) El fuego de San Telmo (title means \"St. Elmo's Fire\"; one-act play), music by Apolinar Brull, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1889.\n\n(With Celso Lucio) Panorama nacional (title means \"National Panorama\"; one-act play), music by Apolinar Brull, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1889.\n\n(With Sinesio Delgado, Celso Lucio, and Fern\u00e1ndez Manzano) Sociedad secreta (title means \"Secret Society\"; one-act play), music by Apolinar Brull, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1889.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) Las guardillas (title means \"The Garrets\"; one-act play), produced in Madrid, Spain, 1890.\n\n(With Celso Lucio) Calder\u00f3n (one-act play), music by Manuel Nieto, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1890.\n\nNuestra se\u00f1ora (title means \"Our Lady\"; one-act play), produced in Madrid, Spain, 1890.\n\n(With Gonzalo Cant\u00f3) La leyenda del monje (title means \"The Legend of the Monk\"; one-act play), music by Ruperto Chap\u00ed, produced in Madrid, Spain, 1890.\n\n(With Manuel Labra) Victoria!

A prolific writer, Arniches collaborated in the creation of nearly two hundred sainettes (one-act plays), zarzuelas (musical comedies), and grotesque tragedies (full-length dramas). Early in his career, Arniches established himself as a master of the Spanish theatrical form gen\u00e9ro chico (brief theatrical works), which includes the forms of the sainete and zarzuela. Arniches's brief theatrical pieces provided the residents of Madrid with a unique reflection of their own customs and conventions, popularly called costumbrismo. Arniches brings the vibrant colors, sounds, and pageantry of Spanish\u2014and particularly, Madrilenian\u2014folk tradition onto the stage. In his biography Carlos Arniches, Douglas R. McKay commented that in Arniches's early writing: \"He perfected the classical Spanish sainete and became its most distinguished architect; late in life he added a new and exciting genre to the tradition of full-length drama: the grotesque tragedy.\"\n\nArniches, the fifth child and only son in a family of seven, was born in the Mediterranean coastal town of Alicante in 1866. During his secondary school years, Arniches showed evidence of his later talent by producing short plays with the help of his fellow students. Arniches's father lost his job at a tobacco factory through political manipulation. Because a yellow fever epidemic and several political insurrections occurred around the same time, Arniches's parents moved their family to Barcelona in 1880. Carlos Arniches was deeply affected by his father's dismissal and the subsequent poverty that the family experienced. Later in life, he incorporated his bitter feelings about political injustice and corruption into the play Los caciques, which forcefully attacks the system of political \"bosses.\"\n\nArniches lived in Barcelona for five years, working as a dry goods clerk, a job that earned him a reasonable salary and helped to support his family. He preferred, however, to write articles for La Vanguardia, a leading newspaper in Barcelona, because it connected him with the literary world of the day. In 1885 Arniches moved to Madrid in the company of a maiden aunt. She supported his financial needs for two years, until she realized that she could not impose her will upon her nephew and convince him to become a lawyer. Arniches's insistence upon a literary career resulted in a rift between them, and he found himself penniless at the age of twenty.\n\nThe following two years were financially bleak, but Arniches later credited this time as a character-building period of his life. He worked on the editorial staffs of three small newspapers and, according to McKay, came to value and believe \"in the fortifying virtue of work.\" When it seemed that he had reached his lowest and most desperate point, Arniches published his first book, a reading primer titled Cartilla y cuaderno de lectura. This rhyming alphabet book describes the life of the monarch, Alfonso XII, and was dedicated to the king's son, Alfonso XIII. The ninety-six-page work was almost immediately utilized as a primer throughout the Spanish public school system.\n\nIn 1888, scarcely a year after the reading primer appeared, Arniches introduced his first play, Casa editorial, a musical revue written with an older author from Alicante, Gonzalo Cant\u00f3. The production continued for 150 performances; when it completed its run, Arniches's days of poverty were ended. After that point, his life became \"a document of ascendant success, comfort and prosperity,\" according to McKay. Casa editorial received so much praise from both critics and the public that Arniches decided to continue his career in the theatrical world. He followed this success with two more musical revues, which were even more popular than the first. The fourth play, Las manias, was similar in style to the preceding three works, but it was poorly received and proved to be a terrible failure. Arniches, however, did not allow that to deter his career. Instead, he directed his energies into writing sainetes, one-act plays that depict, in McKay's words, \"the popular customs of the common people.\"\n\nArniches's early works were typical of the Spanish sainete form, and he brought no new impulses to the genre. McKay commented that the early characters were usually \"involved in single, uncomplicated love conflicts\" that tended to be resolved by a happy ending. He also remarked that \"the plot line in most of these works is based upon mistaken identities and hilarious misunderstandings.\" Through his collaborative work with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3 and Celso Lucio, however, Arniches began to introduce novel elements into the sainete. The first difference was that Arniches's later plays were occasionally marked by \"spontaneous, sparkling dialogue\" that emerges during the action. The second new element, according to McKay, was \"the emphasis on problems of real people \u2026 peddlers, washerwomen, barbers, dressmakers, maids\u2014in short, the poor and simple citizens of the city.\" Arniches sought to embody and preserve the unique qualities of the Spanish folk spirit\u2014particularly with regard to the Madrilenian citizenry\u2014in his later sainetes.\n\nAlthough Arniches wrote many of his stage plays in collaboration with other writers, there are a few pieces that serve as strong examples of his individual style. One of these is the sainete El santo de la Isidra. The play's action occurs during the annual Festival of San Isidro, a feast honoring Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid. El santo de la Isidra concerns two young men who vie for the hand of a lovely young maiden, Isidra. Her former suitor, a bully and a coward, is challenged and defeated by a shy young man named Venancio. As McKay noted, the plot is not particularly original, but the play's \"major importance is found in the magnificent local color attending the fast pace of the action.\" For example, according to McKay, Amiches was able to \"convey a sense of the unrehearsed spirit of living\" in the opening scene of the play, wherein flower vendors shout the praises of their wares, young people argue with one another, and a shoemaker hammers on the sole of a shoe.\n\nSix years later, in 1904, Amiches introduced the play Las estrellas, which deals with the themes of illusion and reality. A barber, Prudencio, falsely believes that his teen-aged daughter and son have talents for acting and bullfighting, respectively. He has heard that his friend's wife and daughter are earning their fortunes as members of a well-respected dance company in Paris, and he wishes to secure an equally bright future for his own family. In order to pursue his dreams of fame and fortune for his children, Prudencio sells the barbershop lease for a mere 700 pesetas. His strong-willed wife, Feliciana, realizes that, as much as she loves her children, they have no such talent as her husband imagines, and she tries to show him the truth. However, he will not listen to his wife, and encourages his daughter to make her stage debut, and his son to enter the bullfighting ring. The three leave Feliciana behind and go off to seek their fortunes. After their departure Feliciana manages to recover the barbershop lease with the help of her brother, who is a lawyer. As might be expected, both children are shamed and humiliated by their endeavors, and they return home with their father. At first Feliciana is furious with them for their foolishness, but then she welcomes them tenderly back into their home. It seems as if this will be one of Amiches's typically happy endings, but then Prudencio's friend returns from Paris, having discovered that his wife and daughter have actually been earning their money through prostitution rather than dancing.\n\nMcKay suggested that this play begins a \"gradual transformation from the genial vignettes of Madrid folk life to plays of an expanded intrigue.\" He felt that in Las estrellas, Amiches moves into a new realm, one in which \"social and moral concerns take precedence over mere 'costumbrismo'\". The playwright himself considered Las estrellas to be the sainete that is most representative of his theatrical work.\n\nIn 1918 Amiches began to write in the genre that became known as grotesque tragedies. These plays mingle humor and pathos in a way that critic Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala, as quoted by McKay, called \"an exaggeration of comedy.\" The first in the series of grotesque tragedies is Que viene mi marido! This play combines humor and slapstick with a plot that revolves around a young woman who can only inherit a great fortune if she is a widow. This play exemplifies a pivotal moment in Amiches's relation to the critics of his time. Until then, Amiches had generally received favorable reviews from the literary critics. There were a few detractors, such as Jos\u00e9 Vega and Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez Ruiz, who, as McKay noted, charged that \"Amiches is a typical case of theatrical inertia, cleverly expanding the simple sainete to accommodate the playgoers of a new era.\" Another critic, Jos\u00e9 Benjamin, also quoted by McKay, disagreed and stated: \"Amiches never designed his plays after prescribed formulas.\"\n\nAfter viewing Que viene mi marido!, author and literary critic Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala published a series of influential articles about Amiches. McKay noted that he praised the play \"with unreserved gusto, enjoining the world of higher criticism to give heed to the artistic virtues of one of Spain's most remarkable playwrights.\" When these reviews appeared, the literary world seemed to consider Amiches more seriously than it had, and as McKay further mentioned, \"few disparaging remarks were written about Amiches' theater after 1920.\"\n\nIn 1921, Amiches achieved more honor in the form of an award from his hometown, Alicante. This city bestowed Arniches with the title of \"Alicante's Favorite Son.\" Not to be outdone, the citizens and government of Madrid not only named him \"Madrid's Favorite Adopted Son\" in 1931, but they also changed the name of a street, Calle Pe\u00f1on, to Calle Carlos Arniches.\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Amiches and his wife went into a self-imposed exile, traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The separation from family and friends, although voluntary, was extremely painful for Arniches. In order to forget his sorrow, Arniches devoted himself to writing more plays. The public of Buenos Aires received his work with overwhelming enthusiasm and granted him the highest honorary tribute that a living artist could receive\u2014induction into the Ateneo Iberoamericano. Despite the theatrical successes in Argentina, Arniches and his wife gratefully returned to their homeland in 1940.\n\nUpon his return, Arniches continued to write throughout the remaining three years of his life. He was productive up until the last hours of his life, completing his final play, Don Verdades, late in the afternoon of April 15, 1943. On the following day, Arniches died of a heart attack, which many surmise was brought on by the writer's weakened condition following news of his daughter's premature death only a few months before.\n\nArniches's funeral was a spectacle of public mourning, only rarely seen in the history of Spain. McKay described the procession, which embodied the \"entire city's devotion to the memory of a beloved artist.\" Alfredo Marquerie, as quoted by McKay, related an often-repeated anecdote about the day. A city policeman noticed the enormous funeral procession crossing the streets of Madrid and asked a member of the procession for the name of the deceased. When the policeman heard that it was Arniches, \"he removed his helmet, abandoned his post, and joined the procession with tears in his eyes.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nEncyclopedia of World Literature in the Twentieth Century, 3rd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1999.\n\nEveryman's Dictionary of European Writers, E.P.

Although he was undisputed successor to the great saineteros such as Ramon de la Cruz and Ricardo de la Vega, his background was far removed from the Madrid literary coffee houses and tertulias that bred so many of the capital's celebrated stage writers. He left home aged 14 for a post in a Barcelona bank, later working in a sewing machine factory. A benevolent maiden aunt covered the costs of a mutual move to Madrid in 1885, though she soon retired to Valencia and left him to his own financial devices. Penury forced him to move back to Barcelona, but one clever idea - a Rhyming Alphabet based on incidents from the life of Alfonso XII, dedicated to his young son and heir Alfonso XIII - won the heart of the Queen, who ordered its use in all Spanish schools. Arniches returned to Madrid, this time for good. His first short play Casa editorial was written with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3, and performed at the Teatro Eslava in 1888. Altogether he wrote over 200 stage pieces, many with other writers. Many of these earlier works are sainetes in one or two acts, with or without music, full of costumbrismo (popular life and customs) and written in the fresh, colourful and buoyant style which was his trademark. Later on he developed a new dramatic form, the tragi-comic tragedia grotesca, often farcical in action but trenchant in social commentary: the full-length plays La se\u00f1orita de Trev\u00e9lez (1916) and Es mi hombre (1921) are amongst the most potent of these. His spoken dialogue (other writers often wrote the sung lyrics) is fluent but far from vapid, sparkling with keen wit. His texts have a moral framework which allays any suspicion of frivolity. Arniches' scripts were in great demand with virtually all the leading composers and writers of the day. A mere handful may be singled out, though many more will be found in the Zarzuela Index. For Chap\u00ed he penned three notable works with Cant\u00f3 which cemented his reputation - Ortograf\u00eda (1888); La leyenda del monje (1890); and Las campanadas (1892) - two with Celso Lucio, El reclamo (1893) and V\u00eda libre (1893) - one with Asensio Mas, El pu\u00f1ao de rosas (1902) - and unaided La cara de Dios (1899) and El maldito dinero (1906). For Caballero he wrote Los aparecidos (1892), and the evergreen El cabo primero (1895, with Lucio); for Chueca, Los descamisados (1893) and El coche correo (1896), both with Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Silva. Of his many sainetes for Torregrosa El santo de La Isidra and La fiesta de San Ant\u00f3n (both 1898) retain their popularity; as does El pobre Valbuena (1904) with music by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, and lyrics by Enrique Garc\u00eda Alvarez. Arniches and Garc\u00eda Alvarez also enjoyed great success writing sainetes for the young Serrano such as El pollo Tejada (1906); the brilliant Alma de Dios (1907); and El trust de los tenorios (1910). La alegr\u00eda del batall\u00f3n (1909) was written for the same composer with F\u00e9lix Quintana. Alone, he wrote El amigo Melquiades (1914, music by Serrano and Quinito Valverde). A collaboration with Antonio Estremera, Don Quint\u00edn el amargao (1924), a sainete in two acts with a substantial music score by Jacinto Guerrero, proved one of his biggest music theatre successes. No less than three films were made of the play, two of them directed by no less than Luis Bu\u00f1uel (1935 and 1951), who amplified Arniches hints of surrealism in his treatment of the \"embittered\" anti-hero and his gangster sidekicks. Perhaps his heyday was the brilliant period between 1916 and 1926, when he was a nationally known and loved figure. His work rate later declined considerably - until the onset of the Civil War, when he moved to Argentina and resuscitated his career in theatre, radio and cinema. Unhappy away from his beloved Madrid, he and his wife returned home in the early 1940's, only to find the capital changed beyond recognition. Loved and respected for his personal virtues as well as his sainetes, Arniches died in Madrid on 16th April 1943, from heart failure brought on by news of the sudden death of his daughter Rosario. **See also El pud\u00edn negro de Stornoway (December 28th 1904), \"by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, to a libretto by Carlos Arniches\"**\n\n\n\n[Back to top of page]"}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Carlos_Arniches", "page_content": "This category has the following 2 subcategories, out of 2 total.\n\nMedia in category \"Carlos Arniches\"\n\nThe following 6 files are in this category, out of 6 total."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1125200.Carlos_Arniches", "page_content": "Error rating book.

Although he was undisputed successor to the great saineteros such as Ramon de la Cruz and Ricardo de la Vega, his background was far removed from the Madrid literary coffee houses and tertulias that bred so many of the capital's celebrated stage writers. He left home aged 14 for a post in a Barcelona bank, later working in a sewing machine factory. A benevolent maiden aunt covered the costs of a mutual move to Madrid in 1885, though she soon retired to Valencia and left him to his own financial devices. Penury forced him to move back to Barcelona, but one clever idea - a Rhyming Alphabet based on incidents from the life of Alfonso XII, dedicated to his young son and heir Alfonso XIII - won the heart of the Queen, who ordered its use in all Spanish schools. Arniches returned to Madrid, this time for good. His first short play Casa editorial was written with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3, and performed at the Teatro Eslava in 1888. Altogether he wrote over 200 stage pieces, many with other writers. Many of these earlier works are sainetes in one or two acts, with or without music, full of costumbrismo (popular life and customs) and written in the fresh, colourful and buoyant style which was his trademark. Later on he developed a new dramatic form, the tragi-comic tragedia grotesca, often farcical in action but trenchant in social commentary: the full-length plays La se\u00f1orita de Trev\u00e9lez (1916) and Es mi hombre (1921) are amongst the most potent of these. His spoken dialogue (other writers often wrote the sung lyrics) is fluent but far from vapid, sparkling with keen wit. His texts have a moral framework which allays any suspicion of frivolity.

We understand the quality of this translation is not excellent and we are working to replace these with high quality human translations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the summer of 1934 the construction of the Hippodrome de la Zarzuela is authorized according to the draft submitted by architects Carlos Arniches, Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez and the civil engineer Eduardo Torroja, winner of the competition organized by the Technical Office of Access and Outskirts of Town, which is presented nine projects. First flown gallery pillarless Spain, National Prize of Architecture, based in the San Siro Hippodrome in Milan. Its aim was to replace the old enclosure located in the Paseo de la Castellana, where later the Nuevos Ministerios rose.\n\nWork began in 1935 but were stalled in July 1936 as a result of the Spanish Civil War, after which the facilities were built were destroyed. In 1940 the reconstruction ending begins in 1941, opening the enclosure with minimal services were improved in the decade of the 50. In 1980 it was declared a Historic Artistic Monument.\n\nIn 1997 the company that manages the site declares bankruptcy and the Hippodrome de la Zarzuela closed its doors. In 1997 National Heritage calls two unsuccessful competitions until 2003 will reach an agreement between it and the SA Zarzuela Hippodrome for exploitation and rehabilitation. After numerous drawbacks Racecourse reopened its doors in 2005 to begin a rehabilitation that includes new racetrack and training, a grass, two sand and fiber and sand, improvement of basic infrastructure: sewerage, electricity, water, data, voice and wired for television. It has also created a trade school to train future jockeys and riders, farriers, saddlers and young men.\n\nSituation\n\nThe racecourse is located on Avenida Padre Huidobro s / \u200b\u200bn, National A-6 kilometer 8, Zarzuela, land belonging to the Quinta del Pardo de Madrid, Spain.\n\nIn 2008 the Hippodrome de la Zarzuela was limited as follows: in the eastern area delimited by the road from the beach and the Manzanares River in the northern part of the mountain of El Prado and M-40, western sector bounded by the neighborhood and the southern sector Valdemar\u00edn Av. Del Padre Huidobro, also known as National VI.\n\nConcept\n\nStudy obtaining hyperbolic surface\n\nWith the cover designed for the stands of the hippodrome, Torroja plays for the first time with the beat. It does this by changing the first design proposed a flat roof and replacing it with cylindrical sheets and in itself suggest rhythm, with higher ridges on the supports at the ends as befits a cantilever. Given this idea the form of hyperbolic hyperboloid horizontal axis emerges as the most appropriate solution and architectural aesthetics, forming what would be the final module of the structure of the stands.\n\nFrom this way architects played and combined forms, tilt axes, broke symmetries, throat moved out of the support line, replaced the straight hyperbolas intersect sectors hyperboloid. The result is a hyperboloid, but is similar structurally and aesthetically much more powerful, where formal simplicity underlies the rate obtained without greater structural complexity.\n\n\u2026 \u201cThe construction, architecture, can not ignore the reality of the physical phenomena, ie the laws of statics. Its beauty is essentially based on truth, on the rationality of the structure; should therefore be achievable without additions or external ornamentation. But to get it, you need a long and strenuous effort in the sense of intimate reasons of strength of forms. The brilliant result of a moment of inspiration is always the epilogue of a drama, which is often constituted by a whole detrabajo life. \u201cThe best work is the one that stands on its way\u201d\u2026. (E.Torroja)\n\nSpaces\n\nThe building is formed by the structure that supports their way to the podium and his cover. The tribunes of the Hippodrome de La Zarzuela were declared a Cultural (BIC) with monument category in October 2009.\n\nTerraces\n\nThe area for spectators lined form three separate buildings. The stand of the partners, Central Tribune, with 30 meters in length is between those for preferred and general, the North and South stands 60 meters each. These three blocks, together with the restaurant, are joined by a continuous gallery level track you connect through open arcades. The North and South stands have a cover consists of 12 modules, while the Central includes 5.\n\nUnder the bleachers box office, services and auxiliary facilities are located. Behind them on the top floor, a gallery open to the other side of the track develops.\n\nFirst the organization of the various functions that would play on site and on this basis the project was developed was studied. When the chart took shape proceeded to the structural study of the elements composing it. Thus the parties subject to tension could reduce their section or the knots should allow movement due to expansion or shrinkage deformations could be resolved as joints, always seeking to adjust the material to its structural function together with the elegance of form.\n\nAfter the war and once rebuilt the racecourse, the exhibition was composed of the following buildings:\n\nGroup of buildings linked\n\nA restaurant in the south, the southern grandstand, central and north stand, two small buildings of square plant located on the west side. The paddock with its three perimeter galleries, northern garden, garden south, west gallery with its archways, the \u201cpelouse\u201d or grass and\n\na tower for racing commissioners consisting of a rectangular building with circular corner tower with an area of \u200b\u200b72 m\u00b2.\n\nTracks\n\nThe tracks consist bounded by the outer edge of the grass courts enclosure. It consists of three sections, the northern line, also called straight ponies, straight south and central ring. Within this central ring, besides the grass runway, other sand tracks and horse training area.\n\nBlocks\n\nThe blocks designed by Torroja are located in the southwest sector, called Villa Sur. Comprises five buildings of brick and plaster Ceramic tile pitched roof. Its use is to block with boxes, core services and two heights in all buildings.\n\nWater tank\n\nSection deposit\n\nThe deposit Cup, located in the western sector close to the gateway to the farm from the street Tapia de Casariego, consists of the following buildings: water reservoir cup-shaped, with circular 18m diameter and area of \u200b\u200boccupancy of 266 m\u00b2, with a brick fa\u00e7ade envelope.\n\nIn the original draft of 1934, Torroja proposed an innovative reinforced concrete structure requiring a complex formwork system and due to its high cost was never built. Torroja complained that the Spanish Civil War \u201cthwarted his dream as so many others.\u201d\n\nAfter the war Torroja built a tower of bricks reinforced with the same design of the original and substantially cheaper. The brick building is a hyperboloid of revolution, which apparently is a pioneer in the hyperbolic paraboloid forms of cooling towers made of reinforced concrete in later decades. It is an elegantly simple tower, designed so that the bottom of reinforced brick does not act in compression. The top of the tower is subject to the pressure of the water contained therein and was placed steel reinforcement to resist traction efforts. Water weight is supported by a concrete dome surface which transfers the vertical load to the brick walls. The thrust of the dome is redirected to walls with the help of a tension ring in the base thereof.\n\nStructure and materials\n\nThe structure of the construction is simple: each module has section V with curved edges, and a width of 5 m which is supported by a single pillar and flies over the stands 13 meters. On the back is held by steel straps liabilities.\n\nCover\n\nThe roof of the grandstand, developed by engineer Torroja meant a novelty within the Spanish architecture, was the first of its kind in the country. Sheets made of reinforced concrete in the form of hyperboloids of variable thickness is 65 cm in the zone of the pillars to 5cm on the ends of the cantilevers, supports all efforts without reinforcements or ribs, just with a rear anchor straps, separated by five meters. The marquee laminar flies almost 13 meters.\n\nTorroja, magazine Works 1941 with the following words defined his work:\u2026\u2026 \u201cSome have asked me how they were born the laminar covers Racecourse Madrid. Well, they are neither the work of a genius, or the result of a wonderful idea or a momentary inspiration, are simply the result of a previous study of evolution of forms of reinforced concrete. For a fairly accustomed to this type of structure eye was clear that this form of blade was well able to withstand the efforts and perhaps most interesting structural phenomenon that was asked (\u2026) of this structure was the inability to develop an analytical calculation perfect it, but that does not justify a refusal to use, since the advantages of lightness, adaptability Resistant and aesthetic effect phenomenon seemed obvious \u201c\u2026\u2026\n\nForm\n\nThe shape of the canopy is precisely what gives stability to the element, besides being part of the artifact of checks and straps together. This is a self-contained stable because its shape is arcuate. Torroja explains the choice of a curved shape was a logical sequence to section vaulted room bets:\n\n\u201c\u2026. Having taken the form, the marquee is precisely what gives stability to the element and the curved profile to the bottom of the structure, it seemed reasonable to also give a curved shape to the deck. Doing it through sustained by strong hidden brackets after him would have been a heavy wrought solution and unsightly. For a longitudinal row of supports, the obvious solution would be a series of support to support vaults,\u2026\n\nModular structure stands\n\n\u2026 The main structural function of such domes is to act as cantilevers curved section. To achieve the necessary brackets such resistance is desirable that their relationship song / width is maximum on the main supports and decreases towards the free edges. Among the many possible basic types, the resulting surface could have been a conoid, but it was not a very attractive solution. It seemed preferable to look for another double-curved surface. Among the best known ways, none seemed as adaptable as the hyperboloid; therefore vaults took the form of hyperboloid sectors\u2026. \u201d\n\nThe cross section of the vaults, which include the elevation of the building, is different in the media and at the ends of the cantilever: in the stands, bow arrow is 1.40 m and the radius of curvature is 2\u201975 meters, while the arrow in the overhang is 50 cm and the radius of curvature is 6.70 meters.\n\nThe line of contact between the sheets would have been a hyperbola when a vertical section parallel to the axis of the hyperboloid. However, the profile of the underside of the slab was amended by decision of the architects, for a straight edge at the junction between lobes of the cover. This favored the slab thickness is increased at the point of supporting up to 14 cm (extrados face retained\n\ncurved) shape and be retained on a 5 cm at the end of the cantilever.\n\nRepeating the element on the cover, the basic structural module is formed by each pillar means and two hyperboloids, so the module is supported by the abutment element. The joint between parts is imperceptible. Image from a distance is of a corrugated slab which flattens out and cantilevered on the support arches, since the arcs in the plane of the pillars\n\nare smaller than the arches at the end radio.\n\nGeometry\n\nHyperboloid of one sheet\n\nAfter studying different solutions to cover stands, flat, cylindrical, conical, Torroja is decided by solving a piece of hyperboloid of one sheet with minor modifications on the boards of various hyperboloids.\n\nSome works that have used the hyperboloid of one sheet are the Palace of the Assembly in Chadigarh of Le Corbusier, Skyscraper Project Administrative IMPei, Spotlight Adziogol of Vladimir G. Schuchow in Ukraine or the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasilia of Oscar Niemeyer.\n\nThe shape of the canopy section is obtained from sectioning the original hyperboloid form by appropriate vertical planes, with the edge between the arches a straight line. The surface resulting from the modification of the profile is no longer a simple but hyperboloid defined by the fixed lines, three arcs of different radius and the same rope, including three lines are the hyperbole of the ridge and the two edges side formed by two straight segments.\n\nThe cover sheet will be defined as more evident as possible: for their cross sections are circular arcs. This is the easiest profile rethink on site at the time of forming the formwork failing to use the regulated hyperbolic surface which had split.\n\nThe shape retains its static qualities since is at the service of stability, allows a very thin sheet and the construction is not overly complicated by the knowledge of geometry involving the corrections imposed by aesthetic decisions.\n\nThe cover, CK, with its large overhang on the grandstand bleachers supports the mainstay, AB on which is articulated, being prevented by the tie rollover CD, thereby compensating for the weight of the gallery DB, and the rest of the deck, below room betting part remaining in flown outside strap\u2026 (\u2026)\n\nHyperbolic paraboloid\n\nThe hyperbolic paraboloid is a fl regulated surface formed by the lines that WILL support, orderly, in two lines that intersect in space, causing the generating lines are all parallel to a given plane perpendicular to the generating lines. The super fi paraboloid is a doubly ruled surface. For the hyperboloid of one sheet generates a mesh structure that gives strength to the construction. It is also a quadratic surface, ie, a polynomial solution of quadratic equation and can be used in architecture, other than to other issues covered for double curvature of the second type.\n\nAmong the innovative aspects and to be a prominent ago for use in architecture highlights the fact that a surface is very close to a surface with minimal which is stable and to be of minimum area saves material. Indeed, the hyperbolic paraboloid has been, and remains, one of the most used surfaces in architecture of the twentieth century, especially in the design of covers.\n\nThe paraboloid Hyperbolic is one of the most original and important areas used by Gaud\u00ed a pair of symmetrical paraboloids support of the floor of the veranda of the Finca G\u00fcell to Barcelona, also used this area in the crypt of Colonia G\u00fcell, but undoubtedly the most important relationship with the hyperbolic paraboloid Gaud\u00ed was on the covers of the Sagrada Familia also in Barcelona.\n\nTerraces\n\nThe spectators stands rests at its top in a main vertical support, hiding inside another highly rigid support. The position of this is given by a functional necessity, to accommodate under the Tier One gallery with direct exit to the track. The floor of this gallery on consoles flown leaving the main stand open to the public has an important structural role as a counterbalance to the overhang of the large canopy, both being joined by a brace as a pillar.\n\nThe soffit of the slab is the dome of the betting room longitudinally has the same level of access.\n\nConstruction\n\nPrototype\n\nA prototype was performed at full scale to check the structural behavior, whose calculations were complicated, but also to see how to define the shape, the latter was the subject of discussion between architects and engineer. With the full-scale prototype could also test the mounting system formwork had to repeat.\n\nIn some photographs that remain can be seen that the iron armor, before pouring concrete follow paths with two goals, some follow the cross shape and others are straight lines diagonally drawing lozenges around the fulcrum. This second laying of the armor is the most reliable fact that these sheets are at least approximate, since this figure hyperboloids which would fulfill the conditions demand it: having circular sections in one direction and be a ruled surface, while having the double curvature which helps the blade reaches that overhang.\n\nConsequences of the Spanish Civil War\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the racecourse was in the area of \u200b\u200bthe front lines, facilities suffered numerous bomb hits that left plenty of holes in the roof, often exposing the rebar. Although no section covers collapsed, were fractures due to fluctuations caused by blast waves of impacts.\n\nThe perforations in the cover slip were repaired using formwork tables of the same dimensions as the original.\n\nOverhanging ends of end modules were reconstructed.

His prolific work, drawing on the traditions of the g\u00e9nero chico, the zarzuela and the grotesque, came to dominate the Spanish comic theatre in the early twentieth century.\n\nAfter starting his career as a novelist and journalist, Arniches turned to theatre in 1888 with the publication of his first play, Casa editorial. Much of his work is set in lower-class Madrid and uses colloquial language, song, dance and music.\n\nArniches was complimented in a 1935 interview by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, often a scathing critic of contemporary Spanish theatre, as 'more of a poet than almost any of those who are writing theatre in verse at the moment'.\n\nFollowing the end of the Spanish Civil War, the social dramas of Carlos Arniches were among the relatively non-controversial plays allowed by the new government."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Seraf%C3%ADn_el_pinturero_o_Contra_el_querer.html?id=E2c8vgAACAAJ", "page_content": "This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

For the new hippodrome, the planners sought out a more remote and suitable location, eventually deciding on a 115 hectare plot of land close to Monte El Pardo, on the northern outskirts of Madrid, where it would have the necessary space but also be connected to the city center via public transportation.\n\nNine projects were entered in the contest, with the winning team consisting of architects Carlos Arniches and Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez along with engineer Eduardo Torroja.\n\n+ 13\n\nThe winning entry was praised for its novel and refreshing approach to the complex project, an approach that emphasized functionality as well as rationality and struck the perfect balance between the neo-regionalism and rationalism movements. A focal point for the designers was the relationship between the spectators and the horses, that they should always have visual contact (to promote betting, the end-all, be-all of the race) but not interfere in each other's spaces. The proposed design was a metallic structure that meshed well with the topography of the land it was situated on and mixed modern abstraction with the forefront trends of the time.\n\nWork on the project soon got underway. By the end of 1935, all that was left to do was to close off the perimeter of the complex and the galleries. In 1936, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the project was put on hold, but eventually completed under the direction of military personnel. During the war, however, the hippodrome suffered damage from a nearby battlefront and was later repaired by Eduardo Torroja. The Nationalist government then revoked the architectural licenses of Mart\u00edn Dom\u00ednguez, who went into exile in Cuba and also worked in the United States, and Carlos Arniches, who remained in Spain under official ostracism by the government, which would not be lifted until the end of his life. In 1941, two years after the civil war came to an end, the official inauguration of the Hippodrome took place.\n\nIn the end, the complex was built using enforced concrete rather than the metallic materials listed in the proposal. In general, it keeps to the typology of the original plan, but alterations were made to the spaces between the spectators and the horses. The singularity of the marquees that cover the three galleries are known worldwide and became the most recognizable facet of the building.\n\nTorroja took the project to the limits of feasibility with his calculations and measurements but his knowledge of concrete and its structural properties resulted in a bold eye-catching gallery that hit the perfect balance between aesthetics and safety. The asymmetry of the section balanced out the weight of the marquee and the vault while a guyed facet supported the covering over the betting booths and upper gallery without obstructing the view of the paddock. The result was simple and straightforward, with a great deal of plasticity.\n\nAfter years of deterioration and neglect, during which the building suffered a multitude of interventions that tarnished its singularity, a contest was announced in a bid to rehabilitate the Hippodrome in 2004, a contest won by architect Jer\u00f3nimo Junquera\n\nJunquera's main goal was to revive Arniches, Dom\u00ednguez, and Torroja's original ideas for the project, by reestablishing the image of the building by doing away with the alterations that took away its original look. This included separating the racetrack and the spectators' spaces without letting one outshine the other. The objective of the project was ultimately to ensure the Hippodrome's profitability in the 21st century which required new functional requirements with new installations, including patios and green areas. This also meant revamping the marquees and galleries, cleaning up and revitalizing the structure so as to allow free movement that wouldn't interfere with the architectural elements. All of this was done with the materials originally used to build the Hippodrome, in keeping with the original spirit of the project.\n\nThe result of this revitalization can be seen and appreciated with the images accompanying this article, taken by photographer and arquitect Ana Amado, in which black and white photographs take the modern-day Hippodrome back to its inception. This is done in homage to the project and its authors, the forgotten architects who birthed it, giving them the recognition they so richly deserve.\n\nBibliography\n\nConcurso de proyectos del Hip\u00f3dromo de Madrid.
