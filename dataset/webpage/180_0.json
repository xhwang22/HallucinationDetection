The books joined a roster of increasingly successful series that also included The Incredible Hulk . Lee and Kirby added another winner to the group when they created The X-Men in 1963. A distinctive feature of Lee\u2019s comic-book heroes is that they combine superhuman powers with human insecurities and emotions. Marvel continued to prosper, and in 1972 Lee became publisher and editorial director of the group.\n\nAfter graduating from high school at age 16, Lieber was hired as an editorial assistant for Timely Comics, and in 1942 he was promoted to editor. By that time he had begun writing comic-book scripts for Timely as Stan Lee, a pseudonym that eventually became his legal name. In the 1940s and \u201950s\u2014during which time the group, later named Atlas, struggled financially\u2014Lee created several comic-book series, including The Witness, The Destroyer, Jack Frost, Whizzer, and Black Marvel.\n\nLater work and participation in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nAfter working for Marvel in an official capacity for nearly 60 years, Lee began to pursue other projects, and in 1999 he formed Stan Lee Media, an Internet entertainment company built around his creations.

He and his partners sold the company in 2017.\n\nFilm adaptations based on the series that Lee cocreated were highly successful.

Other Lee creations to receive the Hollywood treatment were Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), and Iron Man (2008). Lee was often featured in cameo roles in those films, a tradition that continued after Disney purchased Marvel in 2009. A flood of Marvel films followed the acquisition, including those based on Lee-Kirby creations such as Thor (2011), the Avengers (2012), and Ant-Man (2015).

Kobe's passion in helping her, mentoring her ... I'd already been through that,\" Heal said.\n\n\"Through the juniors, the programs, and now Shyla's represented Australia.\n\n\"Kobe was talking about the same pathway for his daughter. To realise that she was gone too was shattering. It hit so close to home for me.\"\n\nHeal was immediately on the phone to Shyla, who is currently playing for the Bendigo Spirit in the WNBL and is also eyeing a move to the WNBA.\n\n\"It's been her dream to be able to do all of that,\" Heal said.\n\n\"Her dad being this sports person ... you want more for your own kids than what you had. And I could see Kobe taking that same mindset. It became his passion.\n\n\"Speaking to (Shyla) today, I mean, I've still got two daughters at home but Shyla's interstate now playing for their season. It really hit home.\"\n\nAccording to Heal, basketball great Michael Jordan was the player that inspired an entire generation of hopefuls during his era, himself included.\n\nHeal believes Bryant has followed in his footsteps.\n\n\"When you look at guys like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, they've had a massive impact globally,\" Heal said.\n\n\"And that includes Australia - we're one of the biggest consumers of NBA in the world. The influence he's had in Australia is massive.\n\n\"He scored 81 points in a game, 60 at Madison Square Garden, won titles, and he did it all for one team in LA, which only made him more of a global star.\"\n\nBut for Heal, Bryant is more than a basketball player.\n\n\"He was an amazing talent, and I've always been a fan,\" he said.\n\n\"But I've probably become more of a fan since he retired because he's got four daughters, and I've seen his relationship mentoring them.\n\n\"It's the passion I have for my daughters as well.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nzhalloffame.co.nz/Inductees/H/Stan-Hill.aspx", "page_content": "\n\nA high point of his long career was leading New Zealand to a historic victory over Australia in 1978.\n\n\n\nHe played in New Zealand for several provincial and franchise teams, helping each to become national title contenders, and he also played successfully in the United States and England.\n\n\n\nHe was offered a chance to play in the American NBA, but opted for a club in England instead.\n\n\n\nHill later turned to coaching, including being assistant coach of the national team.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.9news.com.au/national/shane-heal-fraud-charges-brisbane/7f649983-3750-4fd0-9b8a-9753c73e99c9", "page_content": "Former professional basketball player and Australian Boomers star Shane Heal will front a jury on fraud charges after being committed to stand trial in Brisbane's District Court today.\n\nThe four-time Olympian is charged with three counts of fraud.\n\nIt is alleged he defrauded Philadelphia 76ers NBA coach Brett Brown when Mr Heal was sole director of three companies.\n\nThe Crown alleges Mr Brown gave Mr Heal a total of $1 million in investments as cheques on three separate occasions which were not used for the intended purposes.\n\nThe fraud relates to $750,000 of that amount.\n\nDeborah Holliday acting on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions told the court the money went into Mr Heal's CommSec Margin loan.\n\n\"It was used not for the purpose that Heal represented to Brown that it would be used for,\" Ms Holliday said.\n\nShane Heal arrives at Brisbane Magistrates Court.

He was driving back to his apartment, subsidized housing in Atlanta, when his chest started tightening, the sweat started soaking his clothes.\n\nHe survived because of \"his lady,\" he said. When he got home, McHartley told her he just needed to rest on the couch. She insisted he get to the hospital where doctors told him he'd had a heart attack. Stents were put in. But his heart needed more.\n\nSo McHartley was in the waiting room on Feb. 4, five months later, for cardiac rehab that costs him $50 a week out of pocket. It doesn't sound like much to most, he knows, especially to a former pro basketball player.\n\n\"But it is to me,\" said McHartley, who once was a player in the American Basketball Association.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nHe waits some more, the clock ticks toward his appointment time. No big deal. He talks about how used he is to waiting.\n\nMcHartley has waited, he says, for too long. Waited for a pension from the NBA. A pension that would give him $400 a month, at least.\n\nHe is retired from a job as a newspaper truck driver, after playing four years in the ABA. Yet, he's had to ask for financial help plenty of times in the past few years.\n\n\"A pension, there's a lot of things it would go toward,\" said McHartley, who during his career played for the ABA's Miami Floridians, New York Nets and Dallas Chaparrals. \"Car insurance, upkeep on your car, food intake, rent. So, it\u2019s a lot of things that would help out with your overall living.\"\n\nMcHartley is diabetic with kidney problems and now heart trouble. He said he isn't asking for a handout. He is asking for what he and the remaining 108 ABA players who didn't qualify for pensions under the NBA's contract when the two leagues merged, say they earned.\n\nMany of 108 those players \u2013 the same ones who helped create the style of game that is today's multi-billion-dollar NBA \u2013 are struggling, worn out and desperate.\n\nThey are in their late 60s, 70s and 80s. Some are homeless, living under bridges. Some die alone with no money for a gravestone. Others can't even afford dentures or a new suit to go to church.\n\n\"They should have already done it,\" McHartley said, of the NBA. \"So many guys have missed out. Think of how many of us have passed and never got anything.\"\n\nThe NBA did make a move to help out some players not getting pensions, those who were in the league before 1965, when the contract was established.\n\n\"About all those guys were white,\" McHartley said.\n\nNeither he nor any of the other former ABA players want to make this a racial issue. But, they say, the NBA seems to be two things. It claims to lead the charge of professional sports leagues in social justice and racial equity.\n\nAnd yet, the players of the ABA left destitute are mostly Black. They have fallen through the cracks and the NBA is doing nothing to pull them out.\n\n'Pawns in this whole thing'\n\nThree white men \u2014 Dick Tinkham, Dennis Murphy and Gary Davidson \u2014 sat around a table one day in the late 1960s with an idea. Create a basketball league that would challenge the NBA, in existence nearly 20 years by then.\n\nMake it flashier, faster, a more entertaining form of play. Do away with that slow offensive game revolving around a big center in the middle. Use a red, white and blue ball.\n\nThen, at the peak of the league's success, force a merger with the NBA and make money, lots of it.\n\nAnd so was born the ABA in 1967.\n\nThere were no television contracts as the league launched and it didn't have loyal fans. The ABA needed to be edgy to inspire allegiance.\n\nThe ABA used a 30-second shot clock, as opposed to the NBA's 24-second clock. It allowed the 3-pointer, which had started in the American Basketball League. It introduced a slam dunk contest.\n\nAnd when it came to building rosters, it was the Black players who were drawn to the ABA.\n\nThe league allowed players to sign out of high school and without playing college, something the NBA banned. That meant players from financially disadvantaged backgrounds were prime recruits, needing to make money to help their families now rather than later. The ABA offered hardship signings.\n\nThose players built the league which, during its nine-year span, was in many ways magical. It was a different breed of sport, a quirky, wacky era of the game.\n\nIt had mascots like the Pacers' Dancing Harry, who cast spells on other teams. Players were permitted to have Afros and sport bell bottoms and fur coats, not allowed in the NBA.\n\nBig name players such as Moses Malone, Julius Erving, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Dan Issel, George McGinnis, Bob Netolicky, Darnell Hillman, Mel Daniels and Roger Brown thrilled fans with stunning skills and showy plays.\n\nBy night, wild parties lasted into the wee hours of the morning. By day, cheesy, outlandish promotions drew fans to the games. In 1973, the Denver Rockets held Halter Top Night. Every woman wearing a halter top and accompanied by a paid ticketholder was admitted free.\n\nIn 1975, the Pacers brought in a live bear to their arena. Victor the Wrestling Bear took on local TV personalities and wrestlers at halftime, with a promise to wrestle fans.\n\nA photo from 1973 gives a revealing glimpse: Daniels inside the Pacers locker room talking to coach Bobby \"Slick\" Leonard. In one hand, Leonard has a beer and a cigarette.\n\nYet, in nine years, the ABA never secured a national television contract. Financial troubles persisted. Collectively, the teams of the ABA were the little brother to the NBA \u2014 never good enough. It was a league that had to fight and claw to get even a sliver of respect.\n\nMany times, ABA games were played in gyms in front of hundreds \u2014 high school-level attendance. Sometimes, after those games, teams would go to hotels only to be turned away because they hadn\u2019t paid the bill from their last stay.\n\nWhen the ABA disbanded in 1976, merging with the NBA, four of its 11 teams were absorbed by the NBA \u2014 the Pacers, Nuggets, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs. The rest of the players on those other teams were left hanging. No pension, salaries shut off, health insurance gone.\n\n\"The pawns in this whole thing are the Black players who were lured in to the ABA,\" said Scott Tarter, co-founder of Dropping Dimes Foundation, an Indianapolis-based organization that helps struggling former ABA players. \"Then they've just been forgotten about.\"\n\nNearly 80% of the players Dropping Dimes help are Black. Eighteen men on the organization's pension list have died in the past two years; 13 of them were Black.\n\nThose players made the NBA game what it is today and they deserve something for that, Tarter said.\n\nFor the first time Tuesday night, the NBA spoke publicly to IndyStar about these players' plights, acknowledging it is looking to possibly help them.\n\n\u201cWe are in discussions with the Dropping Dimes Foundation on this issue,\" said Tim Frank, senior vice president, league operations communications for the NBA.\n\nTarter said he hopes the NBA steps up.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question that predominantly African-American players came into the ABA and changed the style of play, made it more entertaining,\" said Tarter. \"And now the guys who freaking made it work can't pay basic medical bills or buy dentures. It's absurd.\"\n\n'Shouldn't have to be like that'\n\nFrank Card considers himself one of the lucky ones. And yet, he lives in a rented apartment, not a posh house. He is a retired public bus driver.\n\nAs he puts it, he and his wife Charlotte aren't raking it in \"but we're not homeless either.\"\n\nIn his heyday, playing for the ABA's Denver Rockets, Card lived a different life. He bought a brand-new Pontiac Grand Prix in 1971 and it was something else.\n\n\"It had a silver bottom with a black top ... this damn thing looked like it was moving when it set still,\" he said. He remembers a white man who saw him in it one night and thought he was a valet driver.\n\n\"I thought damn,\" he said. \"That's the way it is?\"\n\nBut when he was Card the basketball player, he could go to restaurants, hotels, clubs and they knew him. \"People treat you ... when you play pro basketball, people treat you really differently than they treat everybody else.\"\n\nCard left that behind when his pro basketball career ended in 1974. He worked nearly 25 years for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. He was paid well and has a pension.\n\n\"We are not out on the street,\" he said. \"I'm very thankful and happy I was able to do what I did.\"\n\nThankful to not be on the street. That's the way many of these former ABA players measure their success. If they're not homeless, they're a success.\n\nBefore Daniels died, he talked about players living under bridges in New Orleans. Recently, word has spread among former ABA players about the November death of former ABA All-Star George Carter, who had cancer and was unable to work his job as a limo driver, leaving him with no money and no family.\n\n\"I was sorry to hear about George's predicament. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of guys who have predicaments like that,\" said Card. \"That makes me mad over and over and over again. And it shouldn't have to be like that.\"\n\nCard wants people to understand. This isn't about trying to get something for nothing.\n\n\"I'm not asking for some kind of hand out or something I didn't work for or deserve,\" he said. \"I don't know why these guys don't step up and say, 'Why shouldn't we take care of them like they took care of us?' \"\n\nInstead, Card believes the NBA is just buying time.\n\n\"As far as this pension thing, the NBA is waiting for us to die off,\" he said. \"Adam Silver and the board are waiting for us to die so they don't have to worry about it.\"\n\nCost to NBA: 'A relative pittance'\n\nDropping Dimes has done sophisticated calculations. If the NBA agreed to help the 108 remaining ABA players with the minimum $400 a month, it would cost the NBA $1.8 million a year.\n\n\"The bottom line is the amount of money it would take to fully fund reasonable pensions, not exorbitant pensions,\" said Bob Costas, \"is a relative pittance.\"\n\nOne year's salary for the 12th guy on the bench of an NBA team could fund all of it. And, by attrition, that amount is only dwindling, said Costas, who is a board member of Dropping Dimes and got his start in broadcasting calling radio play-by-play for the ABA\u2019s Spirits of St. Louis.\n\nThe remaining ABA players range in age from 68 to 84. The average male life expectancy is early 70s.\n\n\"These guys are dying very quickly and they are not going to be around much longer,\" Tarter said. \"It's not a callous thing to say. It's important to recognize. That $1.8 million? The NBA won't even need to fund 10 years from now.\"\n\nNBA players have had a pension plan since 1965. Any player with at least three years of service in the league is eligible for a monthly payment and access to other benefits, such as life-long healthcare coverage, a college-tuition reimbursement program and more.\n\nMany of the ABA players never got to the NBA after the merger. Some did, but played only a year or two. Without those three years of service, it doesn't matter how much they contributed to the ABA. They are left without that payout.\n\n\"There were guys whose whole career might have been in the ABA and they didn\u2019t make a fortune and they hit upon hard times and they have no fallback,\" Costas said. \"We hear these stories of these ABA players who can't make rent, can't afford medical expenses and, unfortunately, funeral expenses.\"\n\nTarter said Dropping Dimes is in discussions now with the NBA about the plight of those former ABA players.\n\n\"Those talks are taking place at a high level and the NBA has indicated it\u2019s interested in addressing the problem,\" he said.\n\nTarter said most of the players he's talked to said they were promised a pension when the two leagues merged.\n\n\"They were under the impression,\" he said, \"they would be taken care of.\"\n\n'Everything ripped away'\n\nA simple suit was a luxury for Charlie Jordan \u2014 such a luxury that he couldn't buy one in 2015 when he wanted to go to church.\n\nJordan was plagued by dementia, riddled with arthritis and with severe diabetes. His family reached out to Dropping Dimes not to ask for money. Jordan just wanted a suit so he could go to worship service on Sunday mornings.\n\nThe 6-8 Jordan, who played for the ABA Pacers, used a walker to enter the Style Store for Big & Tall in Indianapolis in August 2015. His sister, Debra Jordan-Turner, was there with him. She said he'd been depressed and not up to doing much.\n\n\"Actually, I need a new suit and shoes,\" said Jordan as he sat in a chair outside the fitting room, \"so I felt that getting up this morning, it was worth it.\"\n\nAfter his ABA stint, Jordan played in international leagues. He coached briefly in Spain at a university. He's been married and divorced twice. He has suffered a stroke and a heart attack.\n\n\"He's had everything ripped away from him that he had,\" Jordan-Brown said at the time.\n\nShe remembers her young brother sneaking out of the house to IPS School 44 to play basketball on the outside courts. She remembers him dominating, having such a promising future.\n\nJordan played just one year for the Pacers, the 1975-76 season. He wasn't drafted in the merger. After that, hard times came hard. Jordan's story isn't a rarity in the league.\n\n\"There are some guys who did fine,\" Costas said. \"But there are others, many others, who didn't.\"\n\nWhat Dropping Dimes is doing for struggling ABA players has spread among them. Tarter gets calls daily. He has become friends with many of these players.\n\nThe most recent application for assistance came in this week. A Black player, 77, a jack of all trades still working at a country club in Kentucky. As he talked to Tarter, he kept saying \"yes sir and no sir.\"\n\n\"He was so nice and so humble,\" said Tarter. \"And I was saying to him, 'Hey. I'm a fan of yours. You are my hero. I want to call you sir.'\"\n\nThe man's wife has cancer and there are medical bills to pay that he can't. A woman at the club told Tarter the man never turns down work. Yet, he still struggles.\n\n\"These guys aren't asking for the world,\" Tarter said. \"They just want to live normal lives. Just like what he said to me at the end of our conversation, 'Just anything you can do to help.'\"\n\nTo reach the Dropping Dimes Foundation, go to their website, visit them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow.

The son of former NBA player Dell Curry, Stephen first garnered national attention for his impressive play at Davidson College. He was drafted in 2009 by Golden State and eventually developed into one of pro basketball's top players with his stellar shooting skills. After garnering Most Valuable Player honors and helping the Warriors win the NBA championship in 2015, Curry led the team to a league-record 73 wins the following season. In May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named MVP by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row. He then helped the Warriors win the NBA title again in 2017 and 2018, both times over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nStephen Curry was born Wardell Stephen Curry II in Akron, Ohio on March 14, 1988, but mainly grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. The oldest son of former NBA player Dell Curry, Curry learned the fundamentals of basketball by watching and practicing with his father. However, it was mom Sonya, a former Division I volleyball star, who instilled the discipline to train in her son while Dell Sr. was with his team on road trips.\n\nCurry has two siblings. His younger brother, Seth Curry, went on to a career in professional basketball after starting at Duke University. Stephen\u2019s sister Sydel became a volleyball player at Elon University.\n\nCollege Career and NBA Draft\n\nLightly recruited by major college basketball programs despite a standout career at Charlotte Christian School, Curry enrolled at tiny Davidson College near his hometown. He immediately showcased his skills by scoring 32 points against the University of Michigan in his second game and wound up earning Southern Conference freshman of the year honors.\n\n\"Make it work no matter what you have to work with \u2013 that\u2019s something that stuck with me very early on as a point guard. Adjust. Get creative. Try a different angle, a different lane, a different move or a different shot \u2013 just make it work.\" - Stephen Curry\n\nCurry became a national star in March of his sophomore year when he carried the Wildcats to a berth in the regional finals of the NCAA tournament with a series of high-scoring performances.\n\nAfter leading the nation with an average of 28.6 points per game as a college junior in 2009, Curry was selected with the seventh pick of the NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors.\n\nNBA Stardom\n\nDespite his slight frame and boyish looks, Curry proved more than capable of handling the NBA opposition with his shooting and ball-handling abilities. As a guard, he averaged more than 22 points per game after the 2010 All-Star break and wound up finishing second in the Rookie of the Year balloting. His impressive play earned him a spot on the USA Men's Basketball Senior National Team, which won the gold medal at the 2010 World Championships.\n\nCurry sustained a sprained ankle while practicing with the national team, an injury that lingered for the following two seasons.\n\nA return to full health allowed him to regain his dazzling form in 2012-13, and Curry responded by setting an NBA record with 272 three-pointers. Named the Western Conference Player of the Month in April, he followed by leading the Warriors to an upset against the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nChampionships\n\nAfter earning his first All-Star nod in 2014, Curry reached new levels of performance and popularity the following season. As one half of the \"Splash Brothers\" duo, which also featured sharpshooting guard Klay Thompson, Curry led an exciting Warriors team to an early 16-game win streak and was the leading vote-getter for the 2015 All-Star Game.\n\nCurry capped a memorable season by helping the Warriors knock off LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, giving the team its first championship since 1975.\n\nFor an encore, Curry helped the Warriors to 24 consecutive wins out of the starting gate in the 2015-16 season, a torrid pace that propelled the team to an NBA-record 73 wins. The superstar guard again demonstrated his unparalleled skills throughout the season, finishing with an astounding 402 three-pointers and league-high 30.1 points per game.\n\nStephen Curry Photo: Getty Images\n\nDespite his accomplishments, Curry knew that the personal and team records would be for naught if Golden State couldn't repeat as champions. The Warriors were put to the test when Curry suffered ankle and knee injuries early in the playoffs, but he returned to score a record 17 overtime points in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals, before sparking a comeback win in the following round over the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, his quest for a second straight title fell just short when a long season came to a close with a 93-89 loss to the Cavaliers in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nIn 2017, Curry helped lead the Warriors to a Finals matchup with James and the Cavaliers once again. In Game 5, Curry scored 34 points and teammate Kevin Durant added another 39 points in a 129-120 victory, for the Warriors' second NBA championship in three years.\n\nThe victory was sweet and long-awaited for Curry. After the Warriors' 2016 loss, he had asked a friend to save a cigar for him so he could smoke it when the team won back the title. Curry lit up his cigar live on NBA TV. \"I've been waiting a whole year to smoke this,\" Curry said.\n\nExpected to contend for the title with his teammates again in 2018, Curry instead encountered a setback by way of an MCL sprain late in the regular season, his absence leaving the Warriors on shakier ground heading into the playoffs. But the superstar guard returned in the second round to finish off the New Orleans Pelicans and then helped put away the top-seeded Houston Rockets for the Western Conference crown.\n\nGame 1 of the fourth straight Warriors-Cavaliers Finals went down to the wire before Curry helped his team pull away in overtime with a game-high 33 points. Three games later, the veteran guard again topped the field with 37 points as the Warriors finished off the sweep to claim their third NBA title in four years.\n\nTwo-Time MVP\n\nIn 2015, Curry set a new record with 286 three-pointers and led the league in steals, an impressive all-around display that garnered him the Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nIn May 2016, Curry became the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history, and one of only 11 players to win the MVP award two years in a row.\n\n\"I never really set out to change the game. I never thought that would happen in my career,\" Curry said after receiving the MVP honor. \"What I wanted to do was just be myself. ... I know it inspires a lot of the next generation, a lot of people who love the game of basketball to value the skill of it, value the fact that you can work every single day to get better. You've got to be able to put the time and the work. That's how I got here, that's how I continue to get better every single day.\"\n\nNew Arena and Injury\n\nAlthough Curry enjoyed a stellar 2018-19 campaign with an average of 27.3 points per game, there were signs of turmoil within the NBA's reigning dynasty. Golden State still managed to advance to the 2019 NBA Finals, though Curry was unable to lift his team in the wake of injuries to Durant and Thompson, and the Warriors lost to the Toronto Raptors in six games.\n\nHaving bid farewell to Durant in free agency, the Warriors prepared to start a new chapter in 2019-20 with the move to the Chase Center in San Francisco. However, the team's hopes of competing suffered a serious blow when Curry broke his hand just four games into the season, an injury that knocked him out of action until early March 2020.\n\nStephen Curry\u2019s Career Stats\n\nAccording to the NBA, at of the end of the 2018-19 regular season, Curry\u2019s career stats are:\n\n34.4 minutes per game\n\n47.7 field goal percentage\n\n43.6 3-point percentage\n\n90.5 free-throw percentage\n\n23.5 points per game\n\n4.5 rebounds per game\n\n6.6 assists per game\n\n0.2 blocks per game\n\nStephen Curry\u2019s Salary and Contract\n\nIn 2012, Curry signed a four-year contract extension with the Golden State Warriors. Curry\u2019s $12.1 yearly salary made him just the 85th-highest paid NBA player in the 2016-17 season, despite his two-time MVP status. However, in June 2017, Curry made up for his previous bargain rate and then some by signing the NBA\u2019s highest-paid contract ever: a $201 million salary over five years that will take him through the 2020-21 season.\n\nCurry has signed endorsement deals with Under Armour, JPMorgan Chase, Brita, Vivo and PressPlay.\n\nProduction Company and Sony Deal\n\nIn April 2018, it was announced that Curry's newly formed production company, Unanimous Media, had signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment. The arrangement gives Sony first-look rights at Unanimous' film and TV projects, which reportedly will focus on faith, family and sports-related content.\n\n\"I've been blessed to have this platform and I want to use it to affect the world positively,\" said Curry said in a statement. \"Partnering with Sony to share inspiring content with a global audience was a foregone conclusion.\"\n\nVolunteer Work\n\nSince his time as a student at Davidson, Curry has been involved with the United Nations Foundation Nothing But Nets campaign, which distributes insecticide-treated mosquito nets across Africa to help combat malaria. The NBA star also raises resources for schools through the Stephen Curry Foundation and annually hosts a pair of charity golf events.\n\nWife and Children\n\nCurry married his college sweetheart, Ayesha Alexander, on July 30, 2011. Born on March 23, 1989, in Toronto, Canada, Ayesha Curry is an entrepreneur and former actress known for the TV series Ballers and as the host of the cooking show Ayesha's Home Kitchen.\n\nThe Currys have two daughters. On July 19, 2012, they welcomed their first, named Riley. Their second daughter, Ryan, was born on July 10, 2015. Three years later on July 4, 2018, Ayesha gave birth to their first son, Canon W. Jack.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Stephen Curry\n\nBirth Year: 1988\n\nBirth date: March 14, 1988\n\nBirth State: Ohio\n\nBirth City: Akron\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Professional basketball player Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors was the first person to be named Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in NBA history.\n\nIndustries\n\nSports\n\nAstrological Sign: Pisces\n\nSchools\n\nDavidson College\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Stephen Curry Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/athletes/stephen-curry\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: September 28, 2022\n\nOriginal Published Date: June 9, 2015\n\nQUOTES"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kobe-Bryant", "page_content": "Kobe Bryant, in full Kobe Bean Bryant, (born August 23, 1978, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died January 26, 2020, Calabasas, California), American professional basketball player, who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five championships (2000\u201302 and 2009\u201310).\n\nBryant\u2019s father, Joe (\u201cJelly Bean\u201d) Bryant, was a professional basketball player who spent eight seasons in the NBA and eight more playing in Italy, where Bryant went to school. When his family returned to the United States, Bryant played basketball at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where he received several national Player of the Year awards and broke the southeastern Pennsylvania scoring record set by Wilt Chamberlain with 2,883 points. Bryant opted to forgo college and declared himself eligible for the NBA draft when he graduated from high school. The Charlotte Hornets chose him with the 13th pick of the 1996 draft. He was traded to the Lakers shortly thereafter and became the second youngest NBA player in history when the 1996\u201397 season opened. He quickly proved his merit with the Lakers and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game in just his second season, becoming the youngest All-Star.\n\nBritannica Quiz Basketball Quiz\n\nBryant was forced to share the role of the Lakers\u2019 star player with his popular and talented teammate Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The two had an uneasy relationship, but they found success under the leadership of Phil Jackson, who became coach of the Lakers in 1999. Bryant, a shooting guard, and O\u2019Neal, a centre, meshed into a remarkably effective combination, and, by the time Bryant was 23, the Lakers had won three consecutive NBA championships.\n\nAfter winning their third title in 2002, Bryant and the Lakers encountered difficulties. In the 2003 playoffs the Lakers were defeated in the second round. Several months later Bryant was accused of raping a young woman in Colorado. He maintained his innocence, and all charges were eventually dropped when the woman refused to testify after a monthslong campaign of harassment by fans of Bryant and some members of the media. (Bryant later apologized, admitting that he realized his accuser did not believe their sexual encounter was consensual, and a civil suit was settled in 2005.) The incident greatly tarnished his image. Led by Bryant, the Lakers returned to the finals in 2004, but they were upset by the Detroit Pistons. O\u2019Neal subsequently was traded, and Bryant emerged as the team\u2019s sole leader.\n\nBryant led the league in scoring during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons, and in 2008 he was named the league\u2019s MVP for the first time in his career. Bryant won his fourth NBA title in 2009, and he was named the finals MVP after averaging a stellar 32.4 points per game in the series. He led the Lakers to their third straight Western Conference championship in 2009\u201310, and he was once more named NBA finals MVP after the Lakers defeated the Boston Celtics in a seven-game series. The Lakers won division titles in each of the following seasons but were eliminated in the second round of each postseason. Entering the 2012\u201313 season, the Lakers added superstars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard to their lineup and were considered one of the preseason title favourites, but the disappointing team was barely on pace to qualify for the final Western Conference playoff spot when Bryant ruptured his Achilles tendon in April 2013, causing him to miss the rest of the season. (The Lakers were ultimately the eighth and final playoff seed that season and were swept in their first series.) He returned to the court in December 2013 but played in just six games before fracturing his kneecap and missing the remainder of that season as well. Bryant returned for the beginning of the 2014\u201315 season before he was again injured, tearing his rotator cuff in January 2015. He played almost all of the following season but again struggled, with a career-low .358 shooting percentage while averaging 17.6 points per game, and he retired following the last regular-season game of the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nFollow the career of star basketball player Kobe Bryant See all videos for this article\n\nIn addition to his professional accomplishments, he was a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. men\u2019s basketball teams at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the 2012 London Olympic Games. In 2015 Bryant wrote the poem \u201cDear Basketball,\u201d and two years later it served as the basis for a short film of the same name, which he also narrated. The work won an Academy Award for best animated short film. In 2018 Bryant published the book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, in which he described his approach to basketball; the title reflected a nickname he bestowed upon himself during his playing days, \u201cThe Black Mamba.\u201d On January 26, 2020, Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter were among a group traveling to a girls basketball game in a helicopter when it crashed, killing all nine people aboard.

Considered one of the best basketball players ever, he dominated the sport from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and earned the league\u2019s MVP Award five times. With five regular-season MVPs and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan became the most decorated player in the NBA.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Michael Jeffrey Jordan\n\nBORN: February 17, 1963\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Brooklyn, New York\n\nSPOUSES: Juanita Vanoy (1989\u20132006), Yvette Prieto (2013\u2013present)\n\nCHILDREN: Jeffrey, Marcus, Jasmine, Ysabel, and Victoria\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York. His mother, Deloris, was a bank teller who has since written several books. His father, James, was a maintenance worker turned manager at General Electric. Jordan, the fourth child of Deloris and James, has four siblings: James Jr. (known as Ronnie), Deloris, Larry, and Roslyn.\n\nRelated Story The Best Books About Michael Jordan\n\nGrowing up in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jordan developed a competitive edge at an early age. It was James who introduced his son Michael to baseball and built a basketball court in their backyard. Michael idolized his brother Larry, and the two would often play one-on-one into the night. Michael wanted to win every game he played.\n\n\n\nJordan attended Laney High School in Wilmington. He was notably assigned to the school\u2019s junior varsity basketball team as a sophomore\u2014he was still under 6 feet tall then\u2014before developing into one of the country\u2019s top recruits.\n\nDuring a basketball camp in the summer of 1980, Jordan grabbed the attention of legendary University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill head coach Dean Smith and his staff. He signed his letter of intent with the school in 1981.\n\n\n\nplay icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\nCollege Career\n\nJordan enrolled at North Carolina in 1981 and soon became an important member of the university\u2019s basketball team. UNC won the NCAA Division I championship in 1982, with Jordan scoring the final basket needed to defeat Georgetown University. He was also singled out as the NCAA College Player of the Year in 1983 and in 1984.\n\nJordan left college after his junior year to join the NBA in 1984. In 1986, Jordan finished his bachelor\u2019s degree in geography as he continued to play basketball professionally.\n\nProfessional Basketball Career\n\nMichael Jordan plays for the Chicago Bulls during the 1997 NBA playoffs. Getty Images\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Jordan began his professional basketball career when he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. He was the third overall pick, behind Hakeem Olajuwon, who was selected first by the Houston Rockets, and Sam Bowie, taken by the Portland Trail Blazers; the draft also featured legendary players John Stockton and Charles Barkley.\n\nJordan soon proved himself on the court. He helped the Bulls make the playoffs and scored an average of 28.2 points per game that season. For his efforts, Jordan received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and was selected for the All-Star Game.\n\nAlthough his second season was marred by injury, he broke new ground on the court during the 1986-87 season. He became the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score more than 3,000 points in a single season. By the late 1980s, the Chicago Bulls were quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Jordan was an instrumental part of the team\u2019s success.\n\nThe Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1990 and won their first NBA championship the following year by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers. Jordan was well known by then for his superior athleticism on the court and for his leadership abilities.\n\nIn 1992, the Chicago Bulls beat the Portland Trail Blazers to win their second NBA championship. The team took their third championship the following year, dominating in the basketball world.\n\nFollowing the 1993 death of his father and a short stint in minor league baseball, Jordan returned to the basketball court and the Bulls in March 1995. He came back even stronger the following year, averaging 30.4 points per game to lead the Bulls to a then-record 72 regular-season wins before they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics for the NBA championship.\n\nChicago nearly matched the previous year\u2019s record with 69 wins in 1996-97, a season that ended with a Game 6 win over the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. The two teams faced each other again for the championship in 1998, with Jordan sinking the winning shot in Game 6 to claim his sixth and final title. In addition to those six rings, Jordan won each of his five league MVP awards with Chicago.\n\nAfter his second retirement from basketball in 1999, Jordan joined the Washington Wizards in 2000 as a part owner and as president of basketball operations. In the fall of 2001, Jordan relinquished these roles to return to the court once more. He played for the Wizards for his final two NBA seasons.\n\nJordan\u2019s Jersey Numbers\n\nJordan is most famous for donning No. 23 during the majority of his career. He once said the number was a reference to brother Larry, as it was roughly half of his elder sibling\u2019s high school number 45.\n\nJordan did wear 45 upon his 1995 return to the NBA because 23 was the number his late father knew him by, and he wanted a new beginning. That lasted only a couple months before Jordan switched back to 23 during the 1995 playoffs.\n\nJordan famously wore No. 12 for one game on February 14, 1990, because his jersey had been stolen. The Bulls didn\u2019t have a backup and tried to locate a 23 jersey in the stands that would fit Jordan but couldn\u2019t. The temporary change didn\u2019t affect his performance, as Jordan scored 49 points in a loss to the Orlando Magic.\n\nOlympics\n\nDuring the summer of 1984, Jordan made his first appearance at the Olympic Games as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team. The team of college amateurs won the gold at the games that year, which were held in Los Angeles.\n\nJordan later helped the American team bring home the gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games, held in Barcelona, Spain. The U.S. squad featured professional players for the first time that year, including Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Jordan, and became known as the \u201cDream Team.\u201d\n\nRelated Story How NBA Legends Led the Dream Team to Olympic Gold\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nIn 1988, Jordan received his first MVP Award from the NBA, an honor he would earn four more times, in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998.\n\nIn April 2009, Jordan received one of basketball\u2019s greatest honors: He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Attending the induction ceremony was a bittersweet affair for Jordan because being at the event meant \u201cyour basketball career is completely over,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn 2016, Jordan was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.\n\nStats\n\nHere is a rundown of Jordan\u2019s NBA career averages and totals, according to Basketball Reference:\n\nCareer Averages\n\nMinutes: 38.3\n\nField Goal Percentage: 0.497\n\n3-Point Field Goal Percentage: 0.327\n\nFree Throw Percentage: 0.835\n\nOffensive Rebounds Per Game: 1.6\n\nDefensive Rebounds Per Game: 4.7\n\nAssists Per Game: 5.3\n\nSteals Per Game: 2.3\n\nBlocks Per Game: 0.8\n\nTurnovers Per Game: 2.7\n\nPersonal Fouls Per Game: 2.6\n\nPoints Per Game: 30.1\n\nCareer Totals\n\nGames: 1,072\n\nGames Started: 1,039\n\nMinutes: 41,011\n\nField Goals Made: 12,192 of 24,537 attempts\n\n3-Point Field Goals Made: 581 of 1,778 attempts\n\nFree Throws Made: 7,327 of 8,772 attempts\n\nOffensive Rebounds: 1,668\n\nDefensive Rebounds: 5,004\n\nTotal Rebounds: 6,672\n\nAssists: 5,633\n\nSteals: 2,514\n\nBlocks: 893\n\nTurnovers: 2,924\n\nPersonal Fouls: 2,783\n\nPoints: 32,292\n\nRetirements from Basketball\n\nJordan retired from the sport three times over the span of his 19-year professional career. He first stepped away on October 6, 1993, at age 30 to pursue a career in baseball following the death of his father. In July of that year, James was murdered when two teenagers shot him in his car in an apparent robbery as he was driving from Charlotte to Wilmington, North Carolina. He was missing for 23 days until his body was found in a swamp in McColl, South Carolina. The teens were later tried and convicted of the crime and received life sentences for first-degree murder.\n\nJordan retired from the Bulls again on January 13, 1999, at age 35 before eventually returning to the court with the Wizards. He finally hung up his jersey for good at age 40 on April 16, 2003.\n\nBaseball\n\nMichael Jordan plays baseball for the Birmingham Barons in August 1994. Getty Images\n\nIn a move that shocked many, after the end of the 1992-93 basketball season, Jordan announced his retirement from basketball to pursue baseball. For one year in 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, as an outfielder.\n\nThis decision came shortly following the murder of Jordan\u2019s father, who always wanted him to play baseball. He had last played baseball as a high school senior in 1981.\n\n\u201cYou tell me I can\u2019t do something, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nDuring his short career in baseball, which many fans considered a whim, Jordan had a rather dismal .202 batting average. However, many of the people who worked with him at the time an extremely dedicated player with potential.\n\n\u201cHe had it all: ability, aptitude, work ethic. He was always so respectful of what we were doing and considerate of his teammates. Granted, he had a lot to learn,\u201d former Barons manager . \u201cI do think with another 1,000 at-bats, he would\u2019ve made it. But there\u2019s something else that people miss about that season. Baseball wasn\u2019t the only thing he picked up. I truly believe that he rediscovered himself, his joy for competition. We made him want to play basketball again.\u201d\n\nAfter his season with the Barons, Jordan went to the Arizona Fall League to play for the Scottsdale Scorpions. After hitting .252 and naming himself the team\u2019s \u201cworst player,\u201d he returned to the NBA in March 1995 with a two-word press release: \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s Business Ventures\n\nOutside of his career in basketball, Jordan has been involved in a number of profitable business and commercial ventures, including a longtime partnership with Nike. Jordan signed his first deal with Nike in 1984. The company launched its signature Air Jordan basketball sneakers in 1985. In its initial contract, Nike gave Jordan a generous 25 percent in royalties.\n\nThe Air Jordan quickly proved very popular, and it continues to be a best-seller for the apparel maker more than 30 years later. The collaboration mints money for Nike and Jordan, with Nike reporting nearly $2.9 billion in revenue for the Air Jordan line in 2018.\n\nThe story of Jordan\u2019s partnership with Nike is the subject of the 2023 biographical drama Air, which stars Ben Affleck as Nike founder Phil Knight and Matt Damon as marketing executive Sonny Vaccaro.\n\nOver the years, Jordan has signed a number of other endorsement deals with brands like Hanes, Upper Deck, Gatorade, Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Chevrolet, and Wheaties. The Gatorade partnership featured a memorable ad campaign encouraging kids and adults to \u201cBe Like Mike.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, Jordan launched into the restaurant business as the owner of Michael Jordan\u2019s The Steak House N.Y.C. Designed to reflect Jordan\u2019s tastes and style, this typical steakhouse seated 150 and 60 at the bar, occupying 7,000 square feet in Grand Central Terminal, before closing in late 2018.\n\nAs of April 2023, there are four Michael Jordan\u2019s Steak House locations: in Chicago; in Oak Brook, Illinois; at the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut; and at the Ilani Casino in Ridgefield, Washington.\n\nPart Owner of the Charlotte Hornets\n\nIn 2006, Jordan bought a share of the Charlotte Hornets (formerly known as the Bobcats) and joined the team\u2019s executive ranks as its managing member of basketball operations. In 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets and serves as the team\u2019s chairman.\n\nImproving the team\u2019s less-than-stellar record seemed to be Jordan\u2019s priority. In November 2012, he told ESPN: \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate getting out of this business. My competitive nature is I want to succeed. It\u2019s always been said that when I can\u2019t find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.\u201d While the Hornets\u2019 on-court record wasn\u2019t hugely successful\u2014they failed to make the playoffs six straight seasons from 2016 through 2022\u2014the organization has grown from a $175 million valuation in 2006 to $1.7 billion as of October 2022.\n\nIn March 2023, that Jordan was in talks to sell his majority stake in the franchise to a group led by two NBA minority owners. If completed, Jordan is expected to maintain a minority stake in the team.\n\nJordan\u2019s NASCAR Team\n\nMichael Jordan watches a 2021 NASCAR event in Pennsylvania from his 23XI Racing team\u2019s pit box. Getty Images\n\nIn 2020, Jordan partnered with NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin to form the 23XI Racing team. The name is a reference to Jordan\u2019s basketball number and Hamlin\u2019s No. 11 race car.\n\nJordan is a longtime NASCAR fan and grew up watching legends of the sport like Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, and Dale Earnhardt. Hamlin is a Jordan brand athlete and fan of the Charlotte Hornets, so the two were friends before the NASCAR partnership.\n\nThe team debuted in the 2001 Daytona 500 with Bubba Wallace driving the No. 23 car. Wallace picked up the team\u2019s first NASCAR Cup victory later that season on October 4 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.\n\nThe team expanded to two cars for the 2022 season, with former champion Kurt Busch driving the No. 45 car. Busch and Wallace each won a race at Kansas Speedway that year. Tyler Reddick replaced Busch in the 45 for the 2023 season and quickly gave the team a fourth race win at Circuit of the Americas.\n\nNet Worth\n\nForbes listed Jordan\u2019s net worth at $2 billion as of April 3, 2023.

Tiger Woods, Spike Lee, and Patrick Ewing, among other celebrities, reportedly attended the wedding ceremony. The couple welcomed twin daughters, Victoria and Ysabel, in February 2014.\n\nJordan and Juanita\u2019s two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, both played basketball in college and had dreams of making it to the NBA.\n\nJeffrey joined the basketball team at the University of Illinois in 2007. Both Jordan and his ex-wife, Juanita, supported their son and tried to help him deal with playing in the shadow of an NBA legend. \u201cThe thing that we have tried to tell Jeff is that you set your own expectations. By no means in this world can you ever live up to someone else\u2019s expectations of who you are,\u201d Jordan said during an appearance on the Today show.\n\nJeffrey played for the University of Illinois for three seasons, from 2007 to 2010. He then played for the University of South Florida for one season, from 2011 to 2012, before retiring from basketball. He later entered a management training program at Nike.\n\nJordan\u2019s younger son, Marcus, played basketball for the UCF Knights, for three seasons from 2009 to 2012. He went on to open a basketball shoe and apparel store in Florida. \u201cThey wanted to be like their dad. What boy doesn\u2019t?

It\u2019s always been said that when I can\u2019t find a way to do anything, I will find a way to do it.\n\nI\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of my career. I just feel that I don\u2019t have anything else to prove.\n\nI can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can\u2019t accept not trying.\n\nLimits, like fear, is often an illusion.\n\n[A]t the end of the day, the team\u2019s got to go out and play.

But don\u2019t try to put the organization above the players.\n\nThe game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I\u2019ve always gone where I needed comfort and peace. It\u2019s been the site of intense pain and the most intense feelings of joy and satisfaction. It\u2019s a relationship that has evolved over time, given me the greatest respect and love for the game.\n\nI try to be a role model for Black kids, white kids, yellow kids, green kids.\n\nEnjoy every minute of life. Never second-guess life.\n\nI always thought I would be a professional athlete. I always loved sports. I knew one thing I didn\u2019t want was a job. Me and working were never best friends.

He attended Louisiana State University (LSU), where he quickly established himself as one of the best players in the nation. He was named the consensus College Player of the Year in 1991. O\u2019Neal left school and entered the NBA draft in 1992 and was taken with the first pick by the Orlando Magic. In 2000, however, he finished his studies and earned a degree from LSU.\n\nBritannica Quiz Great Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nNamed NBA Rookie of the Year in 1992\u201393, O\u2019Neal led the Magic to a 41\u201341 record, 20 wins better than the previous season. Two years later he won the scoring title and led Orlando to the finals against the Houston Rockets. After Houston\u2019s sweep of the Magic, O\u2019Neal developed a reputation for losing big games. O\u2019Neal\u2019s great size and strength\u2014he stood 7 feet 1 inch (2.16 metres) tall and weighed 315 pounds (143 kg)\u2014made him virtually impossible to stop on the offensive end of the court. He was, however, a poor free-throw shooter, and opponents adopted a strategy (known as \u201cHack-a-Shaq\u201d) of intentionally fouling him, knowing that he was less likely to make free throws than to score a field goal.\n\nO\u2019Neal was a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team that won the gold medal in 1996, the same year he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, where he teamed with blossoming superstar Kobe Bryant. Although O\u2019Neal continued to dominate on offense, his teams continued to disappoint in the play-offs. That changed in 1999\u20132000, when, under new Lakers coach Phil Jackson, he became the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player (MVP). At Jackson\u2019s urging, O\u2019Neal became more of a team player, paying special attention to his defense, rebounding, and free-throw shooting. As a result, he led the Lakers to championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003, capturing the finals MVP award each year.\n\nIn 2004\u2014after years of on-and-off feuding with Bryant, which had become a major distraction within the Lakers organization\u2014O\u2019Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. There he teamed with the talented young guard Dwyane Wade to lead Miami to an NBA championship in 2006. Injuries limited O\u2019Neal\u2019s production over the following seasons, and he was traded to the Phoenix Suns in February 2008. O\u2019Neal\u2019s playing style did not mix well with the Suns\u2019 up-tempo game, and\u2014despite having had a very solid 2008\u201309 season\u2014he was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009 as Phoenix began a rebuilding process. He signed with the Boston Celtics in 2010, but an Achilles tendon injury limited his play. O\u2019Neal retired after the 2010\u201311 season. His career totals include 28,596 points (the seventh highest total in NBA history at the time of his retirement) and 15 All-Star Game selections. O\u2019Neal was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nO\u2019Neal had limited success as a rapper and as an actor, starring in such feature films as Blue Chips (1994), Kazaam (1996), and Steel (1997). He voiced himself in the computer-animated The LEGO Movie (2014). His gregarious personality and charm made him a popular pitchman throughout his career and helped him to become a commentator on an NBA television studio show after his retirement."}]}
