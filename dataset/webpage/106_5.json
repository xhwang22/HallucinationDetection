Brogdon could be the first, but he has plenty of competition.\n\nBrogdon's lead in 3-point shooting is a small one.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon, Celtics: 45.5 percent Isaiah Joe, Thunder: 45.2 percent Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Nuggets: 45 percent Luke Kennard, Grizzlies: 44.9 percent Damion Lee, Suns: 43.9 percent\n\nThe Celtics acquired Brogdon last summer in a trade with the Indiana Pacers.

Minor tweaks that can give their team even a little edge.\n\nBut four games into a series, there are not a lot of secrets left. Everyone knows what is coming. It is often more about execution and effort over adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of both,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely some things we can adjust on, and then it\u2019s also about a little bit more effort and just doing more. You always need more, always can do more\u2026 we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the floor, but you know, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Heat need to figure it out before Game 4 on Friday night, because they can\u2019t afford to go down 3-1 to the Nuggets in this series. Game 4 is as close as it gets to must-win for Jimmy Butler and the Heat.\n\nHere are two things worth watching in Game 4, plus some betting advice from Vaughn Dalzell of NBC Sports Edge.\n\n1) Miami has to slow the Jokic/Murray two-man game. Somehow.\n\nDenver\u2019s defense has been impressive in these Finals, holding Miami to a 111.1 offensive rating through three games (for comparison, that is 7.2 below their offensive rating against Boston).\n\nPart of the reason is that Nikola Joki\u0107 can be a better rim protector and defensive player than people give him credit for. Another key is Malone has been able to lean hard into more defensive-based lineups because the two-man game of Jamal Murray and Joki\u0107 has been all the offense the Nuggets need.\n\nThe Murray/Jokic pick-and-roll has been a masterclass in this series \u2014 the Nuggets have a 126 offensive rating this series when running that play. In Game 3, the Denver stars ran 32 pick-and-rolls, and those plays were the foundation of each of them getting a 30-point triple-double (the first teammates to have a 30+ point triple-double in any NBA game).\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are the first pair of teammates with triple-doubles in Finals history! Jokic: 32 PTS, 21 REB, 10 AST\n\nMurray: 34 PTS, 10 REB, 10 AST DEN/MIA Game 4: Friday, 8:30pm/et on ABC pic.twitter.com/0hLcPvv0zN \u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 8, 2023\n\n\u201cI mean, the Murray/Jokic two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop,\u201d Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cBut we got great defensive players, got some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy [Butler] and Bam [Adebayo], so we\u2019re gonna figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies we can throw at Murray as well.\u201d\n\nMiami may need to sell out to stop Joki\u0107 and Murray and force any other Nugget to beat them. The Heat did blitz the pick-and-roll more in the fourth quarter of Game 3, but that led to Christian Braun cuts to the basket and Denver buckets. Miami may have to live with some of that, they have to keep Murray in particular in check (it feels like Joki\u0107 will get his no matter what).\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, you just can\u2019t do it all the time,\u201d Spoelstra said of defending the Nuggets duo. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolutes when you get to this level. It\u2019s the highest level of competition. You\u2019re getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they\u2019re trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThe first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn\u2019t need to go to any other part of their playbook.\u201d\n\nMiami needs to see the rest of that playbook.\n\n2) Miami has to make shots, rebound, set defense\n\nThe best way for Miami to limit the Jokic/Murray action and the Denver offense in general is to slow the game down. Make them go against a set defense every time down. That didn\u2019t happen enough in Game 3 \u2014 Denver was free-flowing on offense when Miami needs the game played in the mud.\n\nFor the Heat to change that dynamic two key things need to happen.\n\nFirst, Miami has to make shots. It\u2019s simplistic but it\u2019s true. Denver isn\u2019t going to run if they are taking the ball out of the net.\n\nThat starts with 3-pointers, because as has been noted everywhere the Heat are 6-1 when they shoot 45% or better from 3 this postseason (including Game 2 against the Nuggets), and unreasonably hot shooting has sustained their run to the Finals. The Heat starters were 5-of-19 (26.3%) from beyond the arc in Game 3, which is simply not good enough \u2014 Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and the rest of the role players must step up and knock down shots. However, the bigger concern in Game 3 was the Heat shooting 38.2% within eight feet of the basket. The Nuggets\u2019 size is clearly bothering the Heat. Jimmy Butler needs to get downhill and then make the shots, Bam Adebayo has to get the floater to fall, and the Heat need to attack and get to the free throw line.\n\nSecond, the Heat can\u2019t let the Nuggets win the rebounding battle by 25. Denver\u2019s size advantage has played out in this series in many ways (including how they contested 3s in Game 3), but it is most clearly on the glass. Miami is getting one shot and they\u2019re done, but the Nuggets grabbed the offensive rebound on 36.1% of their missed shots in Game 3, and if you give them that many second chances you will pay.\n\nIt will take gang rebounding and effort, but the Heat must be stronger on the glass.\n\n3) Vaughn Dalzell\u2019s betting recommendations\n\nOver/Under: The total continues to drop from game-by-game starting at 219.5 then going from 216.5 to 214.5 and now 210.5 for Game 4. Denver and Miami have struggled with consistency when it comes to scoring, Miami a little more than Denver. The Nuggets are shooting 51% to Miami\u2019s 41% from the field and averaging 10 more free-throw attempts per game. The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field. When betting player props in the NBA Finals, keep it simple stupid (KISS).\n\n(Check out more from Dalzell and the team at NBC Sports Edge.)"}, {"url": "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brogdma01.html", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow old is Malcolm Brogdon?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is 30 years old.\n\nWhere was Malcolm Brogdon born?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was born in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWhen was Malcolm Brogdon born?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was born on December 11, 1992.\n\nHow tall is Malcolm Brogdon?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is 6-5 (196 cm) tall.\n\nHow much does Malcolm Brogdon weigh?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon weighs 229 lbs (103 kg).\n\nIs Malcolm Brogdon in the Hall of Fame?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhen was Malcolm Brogdon drafted?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was drafted by Milwaukee Bucks, 2nd round (6th pick, 36th overall), 2016 NBA Draft.\n\nWhat position does Malcolm Brogdon play?\n\nPoint Guard and Shooting Guard.\n\nWhat is Malcolm Brogdon's net worth?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon has made at least $66,182,562 playing professional basketball.\n\nHow much does Malcolm Brogdon make?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon made $21,700,000 in 2022.\n\nWhat does Malcolm Brogdon average?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon averages 14.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.\n\nHow many rings does Malcolm Brogdon have?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon has won 0 championships.\n\nWhat is Malcolm Brogdon's Twitter account?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is on Twitter at MalcolmBrogdon7.\n\nWhat is Malcolm Brogdon's Instagram account?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is on Instagram at malcolmbrogdon.\n\nWhat schools did Malcolm Brogdon attend?\n\nMalcolm Brogdon attended Greater Atlanta Christian in Norcross, Georgia and Virginia.\n\nWhat are Malcolm Brogdon's nicknames?\n\nHumble Moses, The President, Uncle Malcolm, Mookie Dew are nicknames for Malcolm Brogdon."}, {"url": "https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/pacers/2022/01/31/pacers-star-domantas-sabonis-out-due-covid-19-protocols/9290839002/", "page_content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Pacers coach Rick Carlisle may as well have changed his title to Dr. Carlisle after running through a list of injury and illness updates on his team just over an hour before Indiana hosted the Clippers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Monday night.\n\nThe most notable news pertained to two-time All-Star Domantas Sabonis and starting point guard Malcolm Brogdon. Sabonis entered the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocols Monday and was ruled out against the Clippers. Brogdon completed his 10-day rehab for his sore right Achilles on Monday, but there is still no timetable for his return.\n\n\"I'm not sure how long (Sabonis will be out),\" Carlisle said. \"Minimum of six days and it'll need to be two negative (PCR) tests or two favorable cycle counts (the amount of the virus a person carries) after six days. I guess that's the way it's gone.\"\n\nSabonis is averaging 19.1 points, 12.1 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game, while shooting 58.1% from the field this season. The 6-11 big man recorded his fifth triple-double of the season Friday at Oklahoma City and his 34th double-double Saturday at Dallas after returning from a four-game hiatus due to a sprained left ankle.\n\nBrogdon was sidelined for his seventh straight game Monday. He's averaging 18.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.1 rebounds per game this season.\n\n\"He's doing well, and he continues to progress,\" Carlisle said. \"He's playing one-on-one, and he's doing a lot of things that are in a controlled environment to really load that leg muscle and to try to build it up progressively and so far and so on. It's gone well, but (I) do not have a concrete timetable for his return to games.\"\n\nCarlisle said he thinks Brogdon has \"a chance\" to start practicing again soon.\n\nThird-year center Goga Bitadze was also ruled out for the second straight game with a bruised right foot, and Carlisle did not have a timetable for his return either. Reserve swingman Oshae Brissett, who's slotted in lately as Indiana's small-ball center, was a late scratch due to a sore right ankle.\n\nMore:Pacers radio voice Mark Boyle unloads during historic loss: 'Totally unacceptable'\n\nMore:'A wonderful gesture': Mavs greet Rick Carlisle with tribute video; Luka Doncic dominates Pacers\n\nLeague-leading shot blocker Myles Turner is still out indefinitely with a stress reaction in his left foot, though Carlisle said he's \"back on floor\" and has been shooting with the team. He also noted that Turner has ramped it up on the elliptical.\n\nThe absence of Turner, Sabonis, Bitadze and Brissett will lead to more minutes for rookie forwards Isaiah Jackson and Terry Taylor, who've both shown flashes of their potential in recent games. Jackson, 6-10, was a first-round pick in last year's NBA Draft. He made his first career start Monday against the Clippers and gives Indiana another shot blocker and lob threat.\n\nTaylor, 6-5, went undrafted last year but has played his way into the Pacers' rotation after dominating with the franchise's G League affiliate, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. Taylor is averaging 29.8 points, 12.0 rebounds and 4.3 assists through four regular-season G League games. He slotted in as the Pacers' backup center Monday.\n\n\"Terry Taylor is doing good,\" Carlisle said. \"His minutes in the Oklahoma City game (Friday) were decisively important in that game. ... He's had this amazing run going in the G League games, and people look at his size, the fact that he's been playing center and all that, there were a lot of folks that were curious as to whether that could translate. He's done good things in all of the (NBA) games he's gotten in.\"\n\nCarlisle rounded out his pregame news conference by announcing that backup point guard T.J. McConnell, who underwent right wrist surgery in early December, had a pin taken out of his wrist. Carlisle said McConnell is looking at a \"weeks not days\" timeline for his return.\n\nStarting swingman T.J. Warren, who has not played this season due to a stress reaction in his left foot, continues to make progress, too. Per Carlisle, Warren played one-on-one against Brogdon before Monday's game against the Clippers.\n\n\"(Warren's) stuff has gone from zero impact to low impact to bike to then light stuff on the court and then full running and then some plyometric stuff,\" Carlisle said. \"Now, he's back doing some competitive stuff.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar Pacers beat writer James Boyd on Twitter: @RomeovilleKid.

All-Star Weekend is over, and as of this writing, just 20 games lie between the Boston Celtics and the NBA Playoffs. The race for the top seed in the Eastern Conference is as tight as ever, which makes each of these games all that much more important \u2014 and our Player of the Week\u2019s performance that much more impactful.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar sample size for this week\u2019s award, just in an unfamiliar format. We\u2019ve got four games to cover: two before the All-Star break and two after. First up was the Celtics\u2019 narrow loss to Milwaukee sans four starters, followed by the win over Detroit to enter the break. The following week, then, we have dramatic wins over Indiana and Philadelphia to round out the slate. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nIn the interest of being completely transparent, this was a dogfight between two players, and at least a small reason why Derrick White didn\u2019t take home the hardware this week was because I\u2019m a bit leery of a three-peat. White has been a revelation for the Celtics in recent weeks, and has captured the past two Player of the Week awards, which covered the three weeks prior to the All-Star Break in all.\n\nHe was that good again during this two-week stretch, and if you feel he should have taken the top spot again this week, I won\u2019t argue with you. He averaged 18 points per game on 46/37/84 shooting splits, and didn\u2019t miss a bit upon returning to the bench as the team came back from the break fully healthy. We\u2019re going on more than a month of excellent basketball from Derrick White, a remarkable run from a glue guy.\n\nElsewhere, the entire starting lineup against Milwaukee deserves a shout-out for taking the Bucks to overtime despite missing four starters (and with the fifth playing only 13 minutes). Grant Williams, Mike Muscala, Blake Griffin, Sam Hauser and White all scored in double-figures in one of the team\u2019s scrappier performances this season. Against Detroit, Marcus Smart returned from a lengthy absence due to an injured ankle and recorded a comical 9-7-6-6 stat line to help guide into the break on a winning note.\n\nCelticsBlog Player of the Week #17: Malcolm Brogdon\n\n4 GP, 31.3 MPG, 20 PTS (59% FG, 59% 3PT), 4.8 REB, 4.5 AST, +23\n\nOur game of backup guard hot potato brings us back to Brogdon, meaning the Celtics\u2019 reserve duo has accounted for five of the last six Player of the Week awards dating back to the beginning of January. It\u2019s safe to say the team has gotten more than their fair share of value from the duo, who are far and away the most crucial pieces of this bench.\n\nBrogdon doesn\u2019t bring the defensive value of White \u2014 he\u2019s arguably the worst defender in the Celtics\u2019 regular rotation \u2014 but he remains the superior offensive player, even as White has surged in that area. What he\u2019s given the Celtics this season is essentially a turbo-charged version of his final year in Milwaukee \u2014 hyper-efficient scoring and offensive competency in a role player capacity. He was a 50-40-90 player that season, and to this point, he\u2019s beaten it in terms of true shooting percentage, 62.9% versus 61.4%, despite posting a higher usage rate. The only guards that outrank him (26th) on the leaderboard for true shooting percentage are Steph Curry (10th) and Damian Lillard (15th).\n\nThere\u2019s a mechanical efficiency to everything Brogdon does offensively. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a robot built exclusively for scoring efficiency; every catch-and-shoot three feels like an inevitability, every drive precisely engineered for success. He\u2019s the kind of player that can pile up stats without necessarily catching your eye as a viewer. These 20+ point outings really sneak up on you.\n\nAcross this four-game stretch, Brogdon scored 24 or more points three times, with the lone blemish being a fairly anonymous five-point outing against Philadelphia. After cashing in on 13 of his 22 attempts in these games, he\u2019s extended his three-point shooting lead, with a 46.4% mark that outpaces second-place Luke Kennard by nearly a full percentage point. It doesn\u2019t matter how he takes these threes, they\u2019re just going in \u2014 he converts catch-and-shoot threes at a 46.1% rate and pull-ups at 47.1%.\n\nThe stretch run is now approaching, and with the Milwaukee Bucks hanging tight in the race for the Eastern Conference\u2019s top seed, the games will continue to matter for the Celtics. Our next week includes four games: Monday\u2019s disappointing loss to the Knicks and three straight ESPN games against the Cavaliers, Nets and a New York rematch. Are there any Celtics who can overthrow Brogdon and White for Player of the Week honors? Check back next week when we break it down."}, {"url": "https://heavy.com/sports/boston-celtics/malcolm-brogdon-all-star-game-projection/", "page_content": "Now that the summer of Boston Celtics trade rumors is (seemingly) over, fans can get back to thinking about next season. Boston has a great roster already in place from last year and made two stunning additions \u2013 Danilo Gallinari (who just suffered an unfortunate injury) and Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nThe latter of those two players was acquired in a trade that shocked a lot of people. Brad Stevens sent five players and a first-round pick to the Indiana Pacers for Brogdon, and he\u2019ll now join Marcus Smart, Derrick White, and Payton Pritchard in what could be considered the league\u2019s best backcourt.\n\nAnd while Brogdon is expected to take on a sixth-man role, Zach Buckley of Bleacher Report believes he could have a very high ceiling. In a recent article, he predicted that Brogdon\u2019s ceiling for the upcoming season could be an All-Star appearance.\n\n\u201cStardom might initially seem like a reach for Brogdon, whose two-way versatility makes him a perfect fit in a complementary role. Having said that, he was one of only a dozen players to average at least 19 points, five assists and five rebounds in each of the past two seasons, per Stathead Basketball, so it\u2019s not like his stat lines are far away from star-quality,\u201d Buckley wrote.\n\nMALCOLM BROGDON CALLED GAME \u2744\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Oa7yqdzQlk \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) January 23, 2021\n\nDuring his time in Indiana (when he was healthy), Brogdon looked like an All-Star-caliber player. But since the Pacers were never great and he couldn\u2019t stay healthy, he never earned the recognition.\n\nHowever, Buckley outlined exactly what Brogdon needs to do to reach that peak.\n\nHow Brogdon Makes All-Star Team\n\nThe most important goal for Brogdon next year is to stay healthy, but past that, Buckley pointed toward the need for a consistent three-point jump shot and the ability to get consistent touches as the most important factors in Brogdon\u2019s All-Star campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has to stay healthy, though, and that\u2019s been a challenge throughout his career. Beyond that, he needs to find consistency with his outside shot (31.2 percent last season, 38.8 the year prior) and find enough touches on this fully loaded offense to catch All-Star voters\u2019 attention.\n\nThere isn\u2019t an impossibility in that list, though, so Brogdon has a shot,\u201d said Buckley.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is locked in vs. the Lakers \ud83d\udd12 23 PTS\n\n9-13 FG | 4-5 3PM\n\n18 MIN Cooking. pic.twitter.com/tzNng3hJzd \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) March 13, 2021\n\nBut with his high hopes came bad ones, as Buckley was writing about the ceilings and floors of Boston\u2019s stars.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s Potential Floor Next Season\n\nWhile Buckley believes that there is a pathway for Brogdon to make the All-Star Game next year, he also thinks that Brogdon fails to stay healthy and could potentially fall out of Boston\u2019s closing lineup completely.\n\n\u201cBrogdon played 75 games in his rookie season and hasn\u2019t topped 64 appearances since. He made a career-low 36 appearances last season, which marked the second time in five years that he failed to play 50 games.\n\n\u201cIf injuries have the 29-year-old in and out of the lineup, the Celtics could seek a more consistent presence to establish a rhythm with their closing group,\u201d Buckley stated.\n\nOnly time will tell how Brogdon\u2019s season plays out, but with the Celtics having championship aspirations, fans should be hoping for the All-Star appearance rather than the injury-riddled storyline."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/indiana-pacers/news/nba-league-pass-game-of-the-night-malcolm-brogdon/px2z80hjsr1n1gwcqew3r4138", "page_content": "With a six-game slate on the Tuesday schedule, our pick for League Pass Game of the Night is one featuring a pair of teams looking to move over .500 as the Indiana Pacers visit the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon, 2020 All-Star?\n\nWhen the Indiana Pacers lured Brogdon away from the Milwaukee Bucks in restricted free agency, most saw it as a quality acquisition and the perfect complementary piece for All-Star shooting guard Victor Oladipo once he eventually returns to the lineup.\n\nFew saw this coming.\n\nBrogdon has looked like so much more than merely a complementary piece in the early going as he's erupted out of the game with numbers that scream \"I should be an All-Star this season.\"\n\nMORE: Most likely first-time All-Stars\n\nHe's scoring more points than Zach Lavine, dishing out more assists than Kyrie Irving and turning it over nearly half as often as Trae Young. His Player Efficiency Rating ranks among the top 10 in the league, just ahead of James Harden, while he's once again a threat to finish 50-40-90.\n\nIf you line up what Brogdon's done so far with one of the best seasons of Chris Paul's career, you'd be hard-pressed to pick one definitively over the other. Take for instance, CP3's 2011-12 campaign which was his first in Los Angeles when he finished third in MVP voting.\n\nPlayer PPG APG RPG FG% 3P% FT% FTA Stls TO PER 2011-12 Paul 19.8 9.1 3.6 48% 37% 86% 5.0 2.5 2.1 27.0 2019-20 Brogdon 22.5 9.7 5.3 47% 35% 97% 5.7 1.3 2.8 27.6\n\nYes, we're only six games into the season, but the longer this goes, the harder it will be to deny that Brogdon is playing at a level that's worthy of All-Star consideration. It's not like this can simply be chalked up to an unsustainable stretch of hot shooting either as he's actually posting a lower true-shooting percentage than he did all of last season.\n\nIf this is the version of Brogdon that Indiana will get moving forward, the Pacers will be an absolute force to be reckoned with once Oladipo returns. Given his strong play, Indiana can also now afford to ease Oladipo back into the mix rather than crossing its fingers that Oladipo will be back to his old self the minute he steps foot on the floor.\n\nBrogdon is worth your attention.\n\nDomantas Sabonis is a wrecking ball\n\nSabonis missed Indiana's last game and is questionable for this one although he did travel with the team to Charlotte.\n\nIf Sabonis is able to go, he's a good candidate to go off given his strong start to the season. After agreeing to a four-year extension on the eve of the start of the regular season, the 23-year-old is proving to be worth every penny and then some as he's averaging 21.8 points and 11.4 rebounds per game on 57% shooting. He's currently one of just seven players averaging at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per game and is the second-youngest among that group ahead of only Luka Doncic.\n\nHis best game of the season came the last time the Pacers played on the road as he dominated the Brooklyn Nets down the stretch, scoring 10 of his game-high 29 points in a decisive fourth quarter in which he was easily the best player on the floor.\n\nMuch in the same way that Brogdon is holding the Pacers' frontcourt together in the absence of Oladipo, Sabonis is holding the fort down while Myles Turner works his way back from an ankle injury. Turner is doubtful for Tuesday's game although he could be back in the lineup on Wednesday against the Washington Wizards.\n\nHow about some buzz for the Hornets?\n\nNot much was originally expected from the Charlotte Hornets in the short-term as they begin to transition for the future after losing Kemba Walker in free agency. And while the Hornets are certainly still in the middle of a long re-building process, they've proven frisky in getting out to a 3-3 start.\n\nFollowing back-to-back losses to the Lakers and Clippers on consecutive days, the Hornets bounced back with a pair of wins at Sacramento and Golden State to avoid what easily could have been an 0-4 west-coast swing en route to a 1-5 start. That Warriors win in particular looks more impressive after that same depleted Warriors team on Monday knocked off a healthy Portland Trail Blazers squad that finished third in the Western Conference last season.\n\nWinning on the road is hard in the NBA.\n\nWith one more win, this time at home, the Hornets can move over .500 and would actually be head of the early pace set forth by last year's team that started 3-4.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, prized free agent signing Terry Rozier is starting to come on strong as he strung together several nice performances during the team's four-game trip out west, averaging 19.5 points, 4.8 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game. Joining in the fun is backcourt mate Dwayne Bacon who erupted for a game-high 25 points in the win over the Warriors.\n\nThrow in the likes of P.J. Washington who continues to impress and it's been a far more positive start to the season than many projected for the Hornets.\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/01/malcolm-brogdon-interview-milwaukee-bucks-nba", "page_content": "It\u2019s still winter in America, with downtown Milwaukee lined by banks of dirty snow, but there is sunshine in this room. Donald Trump remains in office, as anger and disillusion festers, but Malcolm Brogdon defies these downbeat days. Fiery eloquence and hope pour out of the NBA\u2019s 2017 Rookie of the Year who plays for the most exciting basketball team in America. The Milwaukee Bucks lead the Eastern Conference and have the best record in the league.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, a 6ft 11in Greek immigrant of Nigerian descent, is the Bucks\u2019 exhilarating star who now bears comparison with LeBron James and Steph Curry. But Brogdon is the steady heart of this young team. Antetokounmpo is called the Greek Freak while Brogdon\u2019s stately nickname is The President. Having come late to the pro ranks after completing his post-graduate degree, the 26-year-old talks with the resolve of a man destined for more important matters than his current drive to help the Bucks become NBA champions for only the second time in their five-decade history \u2013 and the first since a young Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in their fold.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to America as a whole,\u201d Brogdon says as he considers the perennial question of race in a country where Trump sits in the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected someone who allows hatred and racism to continue and, in some way, supports it. It was shocking when we put him in office but having him there has allowed everyone to see what people in the country really feel. Now we can rebuild the country properly. It\u2019s about electing someone that unites people and supports progressive ideas. We no longer need a president who tries to destroy people.\u201d\n\nBrogdon, a quietly impassioned orator, pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic because, while Trump tries to break people down and tear them apart, he\u2019s brought so many of us together. This is especially true for the black community. One of our main problems is that, after the Civil Rights movement, black people did not look after each other. But having Trump in office has brought us together.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\u2019s Bucks have the best record in the NBA this season, outperforming the likes of Kyrie Irving\u2019s Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference. Photograph: Aaron Gash/AP\n\nAn hour-long conversation with Brogdon is very different to a routine sports interview. I am struck by the cool intelligence and defiant optimism that surges through him and can understand why a superstar like Antetokounmpo has stressed his teammate\u2019s nickname is not a joke \u2013 but echoes a belief among the Bucks that they could have a giant of a man in their midst.\n\nBrogdon takes a difficult subject such as racism and turns it over to find something new to say. \u201cIt builds mental toughness. It builds character. It builds identity. From a young age you figure out I can be a smart, articulate, educated black man and still identify as an African American. I\u2019m named after Malcolm X and Malcolm always said: \u2018If you don\u2019t have education then you have no future.\u2019 My parents are huge Malcolm X fans and raised me according to his guidelines.\n\n\u201cBut I went to a school [in Atlanta] where many racist situations occurred. The basketball was pretty racist; the classroom was very racist. The teachers were so blatant in their targeting based on colour. I went to a private school and I only had one or two black friends. We were always the ones in detention. My mom knew to get me out of there. But I\u2019d go to basketball practice with my black friends, in my neighbourhood, and me and my brothers were called white because we went to private school and were articulate.\u201d\n\nHis father, Mitchell, is a lawyer, while Brogdon\u2019s mother, Jann Adams, is the former chair of the psychology department at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College, among the most famous of America\u2019s historically black colleges and universities. She is now the associate dean of the science and maths department. \u201cI was lucky I had a mom who had seen it all. From seeing my grandfather march in the Civil Rights era, she understood the depth, character and stability you need to go through racism. She taught me not to accept it to but deal with it, and be better than it. My mom grew up in Waco, Texas, when the KKK was still prominent. She remembers them burning crosses in the front yard. The racism was palpable every day.\u201d\n\nHaving Trump in office has allowed everyone to see what people in the country really feel\n\nBrogdon tells me the remarkable story of how his parents made the decision, when he and his two brothers were still young, to move the family out of a middle-class neighbourhood. \u201cWe moved into inner-city Atlanta. It was a developing neighbourhood but it was lower income. It was one of the best moves my parents ever made. It was a conscious decision on their part to make sure we grew up with an understanding of what other people had to go through.\u201d\n\nHis parents also took their boys to Africa, on a three-week trip to Ghana where, instead of a vacation, they worked in day-care and maternity centres. While playing soccer with barefoot local kids, Brogdon realised how fortunate his family were in comparison to most people. \u201cI have great memories from childhood. Of course the divorce, when I was 11, was tough. But my mom, especially, did a great job in raising us. She rooted us in black environments while situating us in private school. We tasted both sides.\u201d\n\nThere was a basketball court just behind Brogdon\u2019s backyard in Atlanta and his face lights up at a surreal memory. \u201cWe had crackheads, all types of users, coming by the court. We befriended all of them. They would come play with us. My mom saw no danger. She thought it was a great environment for us to learn how to be with different people. They knew our names, we knew their names. We had fun every day.\n\nThe Bucks\u2019 new practice facility is adjacent to their stadium in downtown Milwaukee. Photograph: Adam Jason Cohen/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI learnt that drug users could be good people too. They had just gone down a wrong path. It\u2019s easy to dismiss people but my grandfather taught us to think differently. He marched with Dr Martin Luther King and to this day my grandmother is great friends with Andrew Young [a King confidant who became the US Ambassador to the United Nations]. It was a blessing and a privilege to have my grandfather \u2013 a giant among men.\u201d\n\nAs a kid did Brogdon believe a career in the NBA was impossible? \u201cMy parents never planted the seed that anything was impossible. They planted the seed that things were doubly hard for a black man. My brothers and I made sure we outworked people and were better than everyone we were around.\u201d\n\nBrogdon smiles. \u201cAnyway, I really wanted to play professional soccer. I loved Arsenal and Thierry Henry. Soccer is still my favourite sport. I was a striker \u2013 like Henry. But things changed when I got to the ninth grade. My brother was always playing basketball and I wanted to be more like him. I wanted to be around more black people.\u201d\n\nWe discuss my interview last year with Jaylen Brown, of the Boston Celtics, another impressive young NBA player. It was rumoured that an unnamed executive said Brown was \u201ctoo smart\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for being too educated and political. \u201cAbsolutely. Me and Jaylen went through the same [2016] draft. I went into draft interviews and they would say: \u2018You went to college for four years, and got your master\u2019s in your fifth year. Are you sure you want to be an NBA player? Don\u2019t you want to go into politics?\u2019 It seems as if you\u2019re black you can\u2019t be both educated and a sportsman. I\u2019d rather they said: \u2018You showed so much dedication and perseverance in your studies we know you will show it on the court.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt does not sound like an isolated incident. \u201cThere were multiple teams. But it\u2019s not disheartening. It\u2019s empowering and a chance for me to break the mould for younger black athletes get their degree, their master\u2019s, and come into the NBA and shock the world.\u201d\n\nMalcolm Brogdon is full of praise for his All-Star teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo. Photograph: Jeffrey Phelps/AP\n\nBrogdon still believes that \u201cthe NBA is the most progressive league out there. I\u2019ve been a bit surprised, and encouraged, by the NBA\u2019s support for athletes that speak out. Compared to the NFL it\u2019s night and day. Look at the NFL\u2019s treatment of Colin Kaepernick [who was shut out of football after he refused to stand for the national anthem]. Kaepernick is a hero. When you talk about Malcolm X and Dr King the word that comes to mind is sacrifice. Colin Kaepernick is the epitome of that sacrifice in our generation. I love it that black athletes are now willing to speak out. It\u2019s inspiring.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks have been inspiring on court. At their new arena, the stunning Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, I saw them demolish the Dallas Mavericks. With Antetokounmpo and Brogdon in full flow, it\u2019s easy to imagine the Bucks facing the Golden State Warriors, the imperious champions, in June\u2019s NBA finals.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Brogdon says. \u201cWe have a phenomenal coach [Mike Budenholzer] and a phenomenal system. We have guys with little ego and a superstar, Giannis, who is top five in the league. We have great role players behind him. You can\u2019t get a better recipe than that \u2013 unless you\u2019re Golden State. But we\u2019ve already beaten them this season [the Bucks won easily in Oakland, in November, with Brogdon scoring 20 points]. I\u2019m living my dream and playing in the NBA. But the next level of the dream is to win a championship. It\u2019s something very few NBA guys do \u2013 so it would be amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks new state of the art practice facitilty is adjacent to their brand new stadium in downtown Milwaukee. Photograph: Adam Jason Cohen/The Guardian\n\nHe laughs when asked what it\u2019s like to play with Antetokounmpo. \u201cGiannis does so many amazing things on the floor. A lot of time you just watch him play \u2013 like the fans. Sometimes you just have to get out of the way, and let him do his thing. For six or seven minutes, long stretches, he dominates. There are times when he needs support but Giannis attracts so much attention that often all you have to do is stand on the perimeter and shoot at the ring \u2013 or cut to the basket and score a lay off. He makes the game easy for us.\u201d\n\nPeter Feigin, the Bucks\u2019 charismatic president, is a New Yorker who offended many locals in 2016 when he said Milwaukee is \u201cthe most segregated and racist place\u201d he had known. Was Brogdon surprised? \u201cNot at all. Before I came to Milwaukee I\u2019d heard the city was the most segregated in the country. I\u2019d heard it was racist. When I got here it was extremely segregated. I\u2019ve never lived in a city this segregated. Milwaukee\u2019s very behind in terms of being progressive. There are things that need to change rapidly.\u201d\n\nIs this an opportunity to change Milwaukee? \u201cAbsolutely. Leadership and change starts from the top down \u2013 with our owners being progressive. They encourage players that also want to be forward thinking. For them to support Peter Feigin is a big sign and encourages us to do the same. To speak out for what is good and right.\u201d\n\nIs Milwaukee, agog with the brilliance of the Greek Freak and teammates like Brogdon, already changing? \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how sports is a way to control the masses. But it also unites people. When you have a team on the rise, with a player like Giannis, it brings the city together. The owners, and Peter Feigin, have trademarked the team as something the city can really get behind as a progressive unit.\u201d\n\nBefore he won Rookie of the Year, Brogdon persuaded the Bucks to divert all the money they had earmarked for his campaign to charity. \u201cI thought my play would speak for itself and all the money put into that should go to something more important. The award is superficial. It\u2019s more important to give back when you can.\u201d\n\nBrodgon\u2019s master\u2019s thesis was on the necessity for clean water in rural South Africa. \u201cWhen I first went to Africa, aged 11, it was the trip of a lifetime. It ignited a fire in me. I saw people less privileged than me. But they were still happy \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have clean water. They didn\u2019t have food to eat. They were starving to death. From then on I wanted to make a change.\n\n\u201cI went on a mission trip with my grandparents \u2013 to Malawi \u2013 when I was 14. Malawi was far worse off than Ghana. It was mind-boggling that people don\u2019t have clean water. And then an opportunity arose. During my thesis I was looking for an organisation I could work with. And there happened to be one based in Charlottesville. I worked with them on my thesis, went out [to South Africa] for nine days and it was the best trip I\u2019ve ever taken.\u201d\n\nBrogdon is the founder of Hoop2o which, last October, he and four other NBA players launched to help people benefit from clean water in Tanzania. By late January they had raised $125,000 and built two wells which now provide water to 11,000 people. Brogdon also works with the NFL player Chris Long, who started Waterboys \u2013 an initiative that funds 55 wells and provides clean water to 210,000 people in Africa. Their aim is for their wells to reach a million people \u2013 as a child in Africa dies every 90 seconds from a water-related disease.\n\n\u201cClean water allows little girls traveling miles to school to get an education,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt allows them not to be eaten by animals when they\u2019re trying to get water.\u201d\n\nDid he know Long, one of the most politically conscious white sportsmen in America, when they both went to the University of Virginia? \u201cI didn\u2019t as he\u2019s about [seven] years older than me. I just heard great things about him. Chris is totally aware of what\u2019s happening in America and the world and he\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nBrogdon and Long went to college in Charlottesville where, in August 2017, members of the far-right marched with burning torches and chanted \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d and the Nazi slogan \u201cBlood and soil\u201d. A car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protestors and a woman was killed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my experience of Charlottesville,\u201d Brogdon says, \u201cbut it was a powerful reminder of racism and prejudice. I see the news, I read, and there\u2019s so much hatred and violence.\u201d\n\nTrump initially refused to comment on Charlottesville \u2013 and when he did speak the President praised the \u201cmany fine people on both sides\u201d. Despite the constant accusations swirling around Trump, many Americans believe he will be re-elected. \u201cIt\u2019s very realistic,\u201d Brogdon says of that bleak possibility. \u201cIt\u2019s very discouraging. But the focus has to be on getting the minorities, especially African Americans, voting. We have a history of not voting. But people died for our right to vote. We must get out and vote and change the outcome of these future elections.\u201d\n\nWhat will Brodgon be doing in 10 years? \u201cI\u2019ll be finding something that will impact people\u2019s lives. I\u2019d like to stay in the non-profit sector whether it\u2019s clean water or fighting poverty. I have a passion for Africa and I would love to continue to use my resources to help others.\u201d\n\nIs politics too dirty a business? \u201cNo, it\u2019s not too dirty. There are good people in politics that are doing great work. But is a business where there is dirt. If I want to get into that I have to be ready to take on every aspect \u2013 including politicking. It\u2019s similar to the NBA. You have to fight for what you want. I need to decide if I want another career like that because, by that time, I\u2019ll have kids. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nHow did his presidential nickname arise? \u201cThat came up when President Obama was in office. People said I spoke like him and looked like him. I was articulate and had my master\u2019s degree. People started to call me The President.\u201d\n\nBrogdon, who will surely do even more in life than chase down an NBA championship in Milwaukee, smiles when asked if he likes his nickname. \u201cI love it \u2013 as long as you know the context. We need context for everything.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://bolavip.com/en/nba/steve-nash-backs-pacers-malcolm-brogdon-as-an-all-star-this-year-20210211-0007.html", "page_content": "Malcolm Brogdon's breakout season has turned a lot of heads, including Hall of Famer Steve Nash.

Dennis Schroder and Payton Pritchard rounded out the position on the bench, but it was clear Boston needed more help. Over the next year, they added two more high-level point guards to the mix, creating a three-headed monster of Smart, Derrick White, and Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nIn the Celtics\u2019 full season with White and Brogdon in tow, they fell short of their ultimate goal, losing to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. But how did White and Brogdon perform?\n\nDerrick White\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the season, White was tremendous for the Celtics in every sense of the word. Newly-minted head coach Joe Mazzulla decided to roll with him as a starter over Robert Williams, and while the prioritized offensive identity rubbed some people the wrong way, the results spoke for themselves.\n\nWhite was far better as a starter than coming off the bench. He appeared in all 82 games for the Celtics, notched a career-high three-point percentage at 38.1% (outside of his low-volume rookie season), and was named to the All-Defensive Second Team, leading all NBA guards in blocks.\n\nHis regular season showed why Brad Stevens invested so many assets into trading for him, but the playoffs elevated his Bostonian status to the next level.\n\nThere was a case to be made that White was Boston\u2019s third-best player in the regular season, and in the first round of the playoffs, he confirmed that thought. From the jump, White was phenomenal. He earned MVP chants at TD Garden against the Atlanta Hawks. He had a few down games mixed in, but he was one of Boston\u2019s most consistent players in the postseason.\n\nAnd while it will likely be erased from history due to Boston\u2019s Game 7 loss to the Heat, White\u2019s game-winner in Game 6 took the world by storm for 48 hours.\n\nWhite established himself as the best guard on the roster this past season, and while Smart\u2019s place in the starting lineup likely won\u2019t change, there\u2019s a real case for White to be a full-time starter. Smart is a better playmaker and overall defender and Brogdon is a better shooter, but White proved to be the most complete guard. Running double-big lineups may be the best way to maximize Boston\u2019s potential as a defensive unit, but taking White out of the starting group should not be the way to do that.\n\nAs the Celtics explore potential trade options this summer, the guard rotation will be looked at through a magnifying glass. Having White, Smart, and Brogdon together on the roster could be redundant, especially considering the team\u2019s lack of wing depth. And with the season White just put forth, he should be the last to be considered in trade talks.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\n\nLast summer, Boston\u2019s trade for Malcolm Brogdon seemed like the perfect move. They had just lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals and desperately needed another guy who could set up the offense and create for himself.\n\nBrogdon brought that to the table.\n\nFor the first time in his career, Brogdon was asked to come off the bench, which worked to perfection. The lessened load allowed Brogdon to stay healthy, which led to him playing in the second-most games of his career (67) and the most since his rookie season.\n\nHe churned out efficient performance after efficient performance, ending the season as the league\u2019s fourth-best three-point shooter (44.4%). By year\u2019s end, he was named the Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nEverything seemed to work perfectly until it didn\u2019t.\n\nBoston brought Brogdon on board in part for his shot creation, but arguably the biggest reason was because of his playmaking. Smart was the only true playmaker they had on the roster the season prior, and Brogdon was coming off two-straight seasons of averaging nearly six assists per game.\n\nAnd while he put up 3.7 assists per game in his bench role, that number dipped to 2.9 in the playoffs, as Brogdon turned into another score-first option on a team full of them. Rather than being the playmaking point guard Boston desperately needed alongside Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Brogdon consistently called his own number, acting as the Kemba Walker and Kyrie Irving-type score-first guy that failed to help the Celtics get over the hump.\n\nHis lack of awareness for the lob pass was brutal, consistently missing Robert Williams and others rolling to the rim. He was also a terrible finisher at the rim, something that carried over from his otherwise rock-solid regular season run. Brogdon shot 50.0% within five feet of the basket in the playoffs; only five players shot worse than him from that distance, and four were eliminated in the first round. (And the other was James Harden.)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Brogdon didn\u2019t have value. His three-point shooting was crucial against the Philadelphia 76ers. But Mazzulla often wrongly used the logic of \u201cgood three-point shooting equals more minutes.\u201d Brogdon\u2019s shooting was important, but as the only guard on the floor or the primary ball-handler, he left much to be desired in the playmaking department.\n\nBrogdon tore a tendon in his arm and had been playing through it against the Heat. Unfortunately, his shooting stroke was gone. He eventually earned fewer and fewer minutes until he was completely unplayable, which was far from his own fault.\n\nHis struggles all culminated at the worst time. He played just 7:05 in Game 7 against the Heat but was a -15 \u2014 the third-worst plus/minus on the team.\n\nReflecting on the Brogdon trade nearly a year later, it\u2019s hard to say it was a loss. They gave up zero every-night players, and while having their first-round pick in this year\u2019s draft would have been nice, Brogdon holds more value than that.\n\nAt the same time, Brogdon didn\u2019t provide the Celtics with what they should have wanted. His three-point success and shot creation was helpful. Throughout the regular season and postseason, he was a consistent source of offense. But it was a one-man offense. Too often did Brogdon call his own number instead of throwing an easy lob to Williams or kicking the ball to Tatum or Brown. Rather than acting as the pass-first point guard many were expecting and hoping he\u2019d be, Brogdon turned into a better-shooting, upgraded version of Schroder, a player who clearly did not fit the Celtics needs. Obviously, Brogdon fit the Celtics much better than Schroder did, but at the end of the day, his score-first mentality won\u2019t help elevate the Celtics into the championship team they can be at their peak.\n\nNow, heading into a summer of potential changes, Brogdon seems like the obvious choice of the three guards to be traded. Smart\u2019s defense and playmaking are more valuable at the guard spot than Brogdon\u2019s shooting, especially since the Celtics could trade him for shooting at a more convenient position. Meanwhile, White\u2019s all-around game has him in place to be Boston\u2019s best guard next year.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s first season with the Celtics wasn\u2019t a failure, but it wasn\u2019t what the team necessarily needed. Trading him for an upgrade on the wing or an extra backup big could be the team\u2019s next move, and with how much Brogdon makes combined with Boston\u2019s need to re-sign Grant Williams, it makes all the more sense.\n\nThe Celtics are in a much better spot at the point guard position now than they were two seasons ago. Going from Walker, Smart, and Brad Wanamaker to Smart, White, and Brogdon is a massive improvement. But it\u2019s gotten to the point where their guard play could be too overwhelming.\n\nIn Game 1 against the Heat, Mazzulla rolled out an eight-man rotation with White, Brogdon, and Payton Pritchard off the bench.

Despite missing some key players due to injury and getting used to a new head coach in the lead seat, the Celtics have started the season with a bang.\n\nThe Celtics took down the Miami Heat on Friday night, earning a 111-104 victory. Even without the presence of Robert Williams, they were able to get the best of Miami on the defensive end.\n\nAfter the game, head coach Joe Mazzulla expressed gratitude for his team\u2019s willingness to give their all on defense.\n\n\u201cI love that our guys love playing defense. And anytime you have a group of guys that love defense, you have a chance to be special. And since I\u2019ve been here as a Celtic, every guy on this team has loved playing defense.\u201d\n\nThe Heat ended up shooting 45.7% from the field, but Boston managed to hold them to 8-of-26 (30.8%) shooting from behind the three-point line. Tyler Herro and Max Strus combined to shoot just 2-of-9 shooting from distance.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon, the Celtics\u2019 newest addition, said that he enjoys playing on a defensive-minded team for the first time in his career, calling it a \u201cchampionship characteristic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very special. I haven\u2019t played on a team like this, where one through five, everybody that\u2019s on the floor takes pride on the defensive end. It\u2019s a championship characteristic for sure.\u201d\n\nBoston recorded four steals and 11 blocks in their hard fought win over Miami. They punished the Heat\u2019s smaller lineups, as Bam Adebayo got into foul trouble, and backup big man Omer Yurtseven was out with an injury. In fact, five different Celtics players notched two or more blocks. Oddly enough, Derrick White led the way with three.\n\nThree of the Celtics\u2019 11 blocks were on jump shots which is a testament to their stifling perimeter defense. With Williams out, Boston\u2019s focus will have to be on stopping pressure on the outside rather than denying shots in the paint. (Although their win over Miami proved they can still do both.)\n\nJaylen Brown also touched on their physicality as a unit, noting that \u201cif we come out and be the more physical team, it\u2019s going to be tough to beat us.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the big man rotation was tested in back-to-back games and passed with flying colors, as Noah Vonleh put on an impressive performance against Miami, backing up Al Horford.\n\nHowever, they will face another challenge in the form of a back-to-back against the Orlando Magic, who employ a multitude of big men such as Wendell Carter Jr., Mo Bamba, Bol Bol, and #1 overall pick Paolo Banchero. And considering Horford played over 33 minutes against Miami, the backups could be called on even more in Orlando.\n\nThat game will tip off on Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. EST."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/7236a23dc9c4428eafe3f099137d2693", "page_content": "MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon has been selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team while Giannis Antetokounmpo has been named to the All-Defensive Second Team.\n\nThe NBA says Brogdon was a unanimous selection for the All-Rookie team.

Players are graded based on performance related to expectations, not simply skill level.\n\nWhen Brogdon was acquired last summer, there were questions about his health and his willingness to accept a reserve role. During the regular season, he loudly answered both, as he provided essential offense off the bench and was named the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nWhenever Brogdon talked about sacrificing playing time, he said he would do whatever it took to win his first title. Then everything came crashing down at the end, when a forearm strain rendered him ineffective in the conference finals against the Heat. He missed Game 6, and was 1 for 16 from the field over Games 3, 4, 5, and 7. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what will be remembered most about his season.\n\nGet Breaking Sports Alerts Be the first to know the latest sports news as it happens, and get the Globe's most interesting reporting right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nBefore that grisly stretch, Brogdon was remarkably consistent. He shot at least 44 percent from the field in every month of the season, as well as the first two playoff series. He provided necessary scoring pop when Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown struggled, gained coach Joe Mazzulla\u2019s trust, and was regularly part of the closing lineups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the playoffs, Brogdon was critical of the Celtics\u2019 departure from the defensive identity that carried them to the Finals a year ago. But he was part of the problem. His defensive real plus/minus of minus-4.6, a measure of the points allowed while on the court compared with a league-average player, ranked 503rd out of 525 eligible players.\n\nBrogdon was critical of the Celtics for departing from the defensive identity that carried them a year ago, but he was also part of the problem. Jim Davis/Globe Staff\n\nAl Horford: B-minus\n\nThe Celtics focused on Horford\u2019s freshness for the playoffs by keeping him from playing in games on back-to-back nights. But his workload remained quite high. In fact, Horford averaged 30.5 minutes per game this season, his most since 2017-18. And there were times during the playoffs when he appeared gassed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt his best, though, Horford remains a valuable piece of this core. The Celtics\u2019 118.9 offensive rating with him on the floor was second to only Tatum\u2019s mark. Horford\u2019s game continues to evolve, even at this stage of his career.\n\nThis season, he mostly planted himself in the corners on offense. That pulled opposing big men to the perimeter to create space for Tatum and Brown, and when Horford was left open, he capitalized, connecting on 44.6 percent of his 3-pointers. He struggled mightily in the playoffs, however, making just 29.8 percent. It\u2019s hard to know whether tired legs factored in.\n\nOn defense, Horford remains a sturdy force in the paint and a good rim protector. But he was sometimes exploited by perimeter players in the Celtics\u2019 switch-heavy scheme. 76ers guard James Harden provided the most recent examples in the conference semifinals.\n\nHorford turned 37 Saturday, and it\u2019s fair to wonder how much he has left.\n\nHorford (left) was sometimes exploited on defense by perimeter players like Miami's Jimmy Butler (right) in Boston's switch-heavy scheme. Jim Davis/Globe Staff\n\nDerrick White: A\n\nThere was a moment when White appeared destined to cement his place in Celtics lore. He followed up his Game 6 buzzer-beater in the conference finals against the Heat by leading the Celtics\u2019 Game 7 third-quarter rally from a 17-point deficit. He received loud \u201cMVP\u201d chants from the Garden crowd. Though the Celtics lost that game, it was a memorable and strong season for White anyway.\n\nAfter White was acquired from the Spurs in February 2022, he sometimes appeared tentative as he tried to adjust to his new surroundings. And during the Finals run that year, opponents often tested his self-doubt and left him wide open beyond the arc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis season, White\u2019s confidence oozed at both ends of the court. He emerged as perhaps the best rim protector among NBA guards and earned second-team All-Defense honors. On offense, his strong drives were followed by soft-touch floaters, and he shot 3-pointers with tremendous confidence, connecting on 45.5 percent during the postseason.\n\nIn the regular season, the Celtics were 9.7 points per 100 possessions better with White on the court than off, more than 4 points better than the next-closest player. And he was the only Celtic to appear in all 82 regular-season games. His strong play this season absolutely raised the team\u2019s ceiling.\n\nDerrick White (right) oozed confidence this season, connecting on 45.5% of his 3-pointers during the playoffs. Jim Davis/Globe Staff\n\nRobert Williams: B\n\nWilliams had a team-leading plus-11.4 net rating during the regular season. That is impressive on its own, and it\u2019s remarkable considering he missed the team\u2019s 22-5 start as he recovered from offseason knee surgery.\n\nWilliams\u2019s potential remains immense, but his inability to stay healthy for an entire season remains troubling. The Celtics were incredibly cautious with the big man even after his return, limiting his minutes and refusing to play him on back-to-back nights.\n\nAssuming he has a healthy and productive offseason, the Celtics have to ramp up his workload next year. The illness that hampered Williams in Game 7 against the Heat was simply crummy luck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Williams played just 14 minutes in the Game 7 loss to the Heat while dealing with an illness. Jim Davis/Globe Staff\n\nWilliams is dangerous above the rim at both ends of the court and is also a gifted passer. He can be a central part of this team\u2019s offense. Mazzulla has urged him to develop a scoring punch that goes beyond alley-oops, though, so maybe that will be an offseason focus. He attempted just 1.2 free throws per game this season.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach can be reached at adam.himmelsbach@globe.com.

According to Bobby Krivitsky of Sports Illustrated, one way Stevens could improve Boston\u2019s roster is by swapping reigning Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon for Dorian Finney-Smith of the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nA Malcolm Brogdon trade could keep Payton Pritchard in Boston. But in the event the latter's playing elsewhere next season, I spent way too much time examining who or what the #Celtics could potentially get for the former Oregon Duck.https://t.co/AIxt3JnOGW \u2014 Bobby Krivitsky (@BobbyKrivitsky) June 6, 2023\n\n\u201cThe six-foot-seven hard-nosed wing is a talented and versatile defender, meshing with the calls from Boston\u2019s players to return to an identity where defense sets the table for its success,\u201d Krivitsky wrote. \u201cAnd while this isn\u2019t to say the former Florida Gator lives above the rim, he\u2019d bring more athleticism. He\u2019d also allow the Celtics to play with three wings while keeping Tatum at the three, his best position.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Brogdon has struggled with a slew of injuries, providing a healthy season in just his rookie year and this past season with the Celtics. As such, it would make sense if Stevens began to look for ways to move on from Brogdon rather than risk the injury bug coming to bite him next season.\n\nDamian Lillard Prefers Miami Over Boston\n\nOutside of potentially rebuilding the supporting cast, some former players, media members, and a portion of the fanbase would rather see a bigger change be made. With just one year left on his current contract, and a big decision regarding his supermax eligibility hanging over both him and the team, Brown has once again found himself being floated in trade rumors.\n\nThe most notable discussion that is circulating on social media at present is the idea of swapping Brown for Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers. However, there has currently been no noise surrounding the Western Conference team\u2019s willingness to move on from their star player, and Lillard has remained steadfast in his desire to continue building with the Trail Blazers.\n\nHowever, during a recent appearance on \u201cThe Last Stand\u201d with Brian Custer, Lillard did note that should he be traded, he would prefer to join the Miami Heat rather than the Celtics \u2013 or New York Knicks, for that matter.\n\nDamian Lillard says Miami is \u2018obviously\u2019 his first choice over Boston, New York and Brooklyn in a hypothetical trade \u201cBam is my dawg\u201d (Via @Showtime ) pic.twitter.com/9XhBZq3kIp \u2014 NBACentral (@TheNBACentral) June 7, 2023\n\n\u201cMiami, obviously,\u201d Lillard said with a laugh. \u201cMiami is the obvious one, and Bam (Adebayo) is my dawg. Bam is my dawg, for real\u2026Brooklyn is another obvious one because Mikal Bridges is my dog too. Both have capable rosters.\u201d\n\nLillard will be entering the third year of his current $176 million contract but also has a $121 million contract extension that is due to take effect in 2025 \u2013 a contract that will see him earn an average of $60 million per season.\n\nShaq Believes Boston Should Trade Brown\n\nAccording to former Celtics big man Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who was speaking on a recent episode of The Big Podcast, the Celtics should consider moving on from Brown so that they can improve other areas of their roster.\n\nPlay\n\nShaq Says Tatum & Brown Should Split | Gary Payton On Heat Culture + Errol Spence Joins The Big Pod Our Hall of Fame Finale tips off with a very special guest: NBA Champion Gary Payton joins to talk Heat culture, how Miami can win it all and reminisce on playing with The Big Fella. Shaq details why he thinks the Boston Celtics should break up Tatum and Brown. Errol Spence Jr. previews his upcoming\u2026 2023-06-07T02:30:12Z\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want five stars on my team. I want a guy that I can go to every night, I want a guy that\u2019s going to lead, and I want three dogs, three others. I would prefer if they were specialists: one to be a shooter, one to be a rebounder, and one to be a fighter,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI would, business-wise, break [Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown] up and use one of them to get the pieces I want. I will say Tatum is the number one; use Brown to bring in a Brown-type player, and then just do it like that.\u201d\n\nBrown is coming off an impressive season for the Celtics that saw him earn All-NBA Second Team recognition and will likely hold a high trade value with teams around the league."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2566769/malcolm-brogdon", "page_content": "Lowe: Who takes home the hardware for the MVP, ROY and DPOY awards?\n\n2M\n\nZach Lowe"}, {"url": "https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2021/11/12/pacers-myles-turner-nba-best-defensive-player-malcolm-brogdon/8584336002/", "page_content": "The Pacers were a few minutes away from arguably their biggest win of the season when Thursday night\u2019s game at Utah took a swift turn. Indiana\u2019s Myles Turner had just blocked Jazz center Rudy Gobert with about four minutes left in the fourth quarter, and as Gobert fell to the floor, he grabbed Turner and pulled him down, too, seemingly out of frustration.\n\nWhen the two were back on their feet, Turner intentionally ran into Gobert to address the takedown, and they locked arms before being separated and ejected. Gobert was fined $35,000, Turner $25,000.\n\nTheir altercation has gone viral on social media, perhaps overshadowing the fact that Indiana won 111-100 and handed Utah its first home loss of the season. Regardless of what viewers take away from the incident, though, Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s takeaway from the Pacers\u2019 victory was clear: Turner is as good as it gets.\n\n\u201cWe got the best defensive player in the league on our team,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI hope people saw that (Thursday). We got the best defensive player that was playing against the second-best defensive player in the league and Myles shows that every night. He gets no recognition year after year, but hopefully this year he\u2019ll get defensive player of the year.\u201d\n\nBrogdon added that Turner\u2019s defensive prowess is \u201cgonna come to light soon,\u201d and he certainly flipped the switch Thursday. Turner had two highlight-reel rejections on the 7-foot-1 Gobert, who is the reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year and a three-time recipient of the award.\n\nTurner finished the night with 13 points, nine rebounds and three blocks. He is now ranked fifth all-time in Pacers history for rejections (907), breaking a tie with Dale Davis, who was an all-star for the Pacers in 1999-00 and is the father of Indiana men\u2019s basketball star Trayce Jackson-Davis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge for me. I think (this accomplishment) is a confidence boost more than anything,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for seven years now. I want to kind of leave my mark here on this organization, so I\u2019m still climbing. I still got a ways to go. Fifth (place) is cool, but I think Jermaine O\u2019Neal is No. 1, and he knows I\u2019m on his (expletive).\u201d\n\nTurner and Gobert rank first and sixth, respectively, in blocks per game at 3.2 and 1.8. Turner is the only player in the league averaging more than three swats.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle described Gobert and Turner as \u201cthe best that there is right now at patrolling the lane,\u201d and he\u2019s thrilled to have the latter on his team.\n\n\u201c(Turner) just has an amazing pride in protecting the rim,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that he has great timing. He has phenomenal quickness, anticipation. \u2026 It\u2019s just breathtaking stuff to watch.\u201d\n\nT.J. McConnell, who is one of the better on-ball defenders in the league, said it\u2019s a luxury to have Turner anchoring the Pacers\u2019 defense. The 6-foot-11 forward has recorded a block in every game this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s appreciated by us, but I feel like he doesn\u2019t get enough attention around the league, which is egregious,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHe blocks so many shots and affects the way people drive to the basket.
