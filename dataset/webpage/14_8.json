Proceeds for the song will go to Earle\u2019s family, wife Jenn Marie and daughter Etta St. James Earle. The song was originally released as a free download 10 years ago, and the duo frequently covered the Parton ballad while on tour. \u201cWe recorded this song just for the fuck of it,\u201d Earle said onstage in 2010.\n\nWritten in the Seventies, Parton first released the song as a double A-side with \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d in 1982. Though not nearly as well known as her biggest hits, the \u201cDo I Ever Cross Your Mind,\u201d which was initially recorded by Chet Atkins, has more recently been covered by Laura Marling, Joan Osborne, and Ashley Campbell.\n\nEarle died last August at the age of 38. \u201cA lot of famous people who are charismatic and handsome and stylish and talented, they struggle with mental illness, too,\u201d Jenn Marie Earle told Rolling Stone earlier this year. \u201cI wish people knew how much he did struggle with what they couldn\u2019t see, and what he didn\u2019t write about.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bates.edu/news/2011/04/27/wax-landes/", "page_content": "Two eclectic up-and-coming indie bands, the David Wax Museum and Dawn Landes & The Hounds, perform at Bates College at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, May 21, in the Olin Arts Center Concert Hall, 75 Russell St.\n\nAvailable at www.batestickets.com, advance tickets are $18 for the general public and $10 for students and seniors.

looked for me in the sun with your shadow on the wall like a canyon Did you lose the trail at all and fall in to another winding road of devotion Tell me my friend It\u2019s good to see you Good to see you again Good to see you It\u2019s good to see you again, my friend Did you come on back to me just to say hello Sing a little symphony howl and moan You\u2019re gonna run after me, not gonna catch me though Don\u2019t know what to do, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see you around Don\u2019t wanna let you down It\u2019s good to see you Good to see you again Good to see you It\u2019s good to see you again, old friend\n\nGoing down south Put a song in my mouth Put a rip in my sleeve Grass at my feet A hand on my hip with a gentleman\u2019s grip Oh, Steady me I\u2019ll try not to lead Oh, I\u2019m learning to dance real slow Oh, Here it comes again Heel Toe, Heel Toe, Heel Toe Down in the bayou Man, they can hide you Necks in the reeds swing in the breeze But don\u2019t mind you Walk inside to kitchen scenes and sweet harmonies Oh, I\u2019m learning to move as I go Oh, Here it comes again Oh no, Oh no, Oh no Oooh, we move like the wind blows Oooh, yeah a body knows Hold on to me then set me free Sweet Lafayette I feel like we\u2019ve met In a song, in a dream A second-hand seam Tight on the skin We are where we\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been way down but I\u2019m back again Oh, I\u2019m learning to dance real slow Oh, Here it comes again Heel Toe, Heel Toe, Heel Toe\n\nNo matter how hard I try the pain lingers Our love\u2019s gone dry like grease on my fingers Don\u2019t need a reason why, just pull out the stingers I\u2019m not gonna cry no more Not gonna cry no more I know what crying\u2019s for I\u2019m not gonna cry no more Sing a lullaby, feel the wind blow I don\u2019t even sigh when I pass our old windows There\u2019s someone else inside That\u2019s just how time goes I don\u2019t need to cry no more Not gonna cry no more I know what tears are for I don\u2019t need to cry no more Feels like waking up No more sleeping My hearts still beating me up I wanna go outside and feel the summer Close my eyes and let the sun burn Remember the good times more than the others I\u2019m not gonna cry no more Not gonna cry no more I know what crying\u2019s for I\u2019m not gonna cry no more Not gonna cry no more I know what tears are for I don\u2019t need to cry no more\n\nOh Brother, Oh Brother Do you have the time To get to know each other In a little pantomime Tryin to walk the blood line Oh Sister, Oh Sister Where has she gone You\u2019d knew even know you missed her She\u2019s standing on the lawn Waitin for love to come take her away Away Just trying to get away But I can\u2019t escape Mistakes have been made Chalk it all up to fate Oh Brother, Hey Brother Did you really need a dime Just think it over You know you ask all the time You leave your mother crying You say Sister, Oh Sister Get off my back Go and lose your temper, you\u2019ll never get it back Believe me I\u2019ll be gone I\u2019m going away Just trying to get away But I can\u2019t escape the choices they made Oh we\u2019re tryin to get away But we can\u2019t escape Chalk it all up to fate Oh Brother, Oh Brother are you a friend of mine?\n\nDiamond rivers run in streaks Down my lovers cheeks They run for weeks and cut so deep Tell my lover I\u2019m at peace Now that he sleeps Forever sleeps I feel a breeze blow through me in a slow eddy I\u2019m not ready to leave Carry me Gary Marry Me, Your Emily\n\nUp in the morning I know you\u2019re there and the sun will rise Back of the evening lay down somewhere and we close our eyes I can\u2019t count on anything but the day and night I wanna write you a love song with my life Another season and that old moonlight shines down on us Don\u2019t got a reason to be out tonight, just a wanderlust I can\u2019t count on anything Come rain, Come rust I wanna write you a love song you can trust Going way downtown tonight Gonna feel it out alright Gonna down this town tonight Head held high Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s hard to know a world so bright The technicolor of a loving soul dimmed to black and white I can\u2019t count on anything but the stars in the sky I wanna write you a love song with my life Going way downtown tonight Gonna feel it out alright Gonna down this town tonight Head held high I wanna write you a love song with my life Gonna write you a love song with my life Let me write you a love song with my life\n\nLet\u2019s get out of town, go swimming, swimming Move your arms around and we\u2019re wading so far out Nothing to cry about when baby made a sound Let\u2019s get out of here, go flying, flying You\u2019re so pretty dear, when you\u2019re minding Aren\u2019t you now? higher than a cloud when baby made a sound Oh didn\u2019t you find me drawing a line we\u2019ve been dragging it out Oh, didn\u2019t you know me nothing to show we\u2019ve gotta get out Let\u2019s get out of town, go sailing, sailing Throw the anchor down and head to heaven with me now Angel on the bow My baby made a sound Baby made a sound"}, {"url":

"Her voice is lovely and bright and she knows her way around the traditional Nashville songbird style in a way that reminded me of Emmylou at times....however the material isn't that memorable and i just kind of switched off after a while.\n\n\n\nI guess the real source of interest is veteran country producer Fred foster overseeing this and veteran bobby bare turning up on the last track....sadly it felt gimmicky and silly. She sounds much better on the livelier, more honky tonk sound of 'why they name whiskey after men'.\n\nPublished"}]}
