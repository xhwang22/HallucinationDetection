De Bruin played 34 tests for South Africa before moving to New Zealand in 2000. She made her on-court debut for the Silver Ferns in 2003, and has gone on to represent New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games and Netball World Championships, playing in the goal defence and goal keeper positions.[1] In 2009, she pulled out of the team due to pregnancy, before returning the following year.[2]\n\nSouth African-New Zealand netball player\n\nQuick facts: Personal information, Full name, Born, Height... \u25bc\n\nDe Bruin played for the Southern Sting, Capital Shakers, Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic and the Northern Force in the National Bank Cup. With the start of the ANZ Championship in 2008, de Bruin stayed in Auckland with the new Northern Mystics franchise. The following year, she returned to the Magic in Hamilton, partnering in the defensive circle with Silver Ferns teammate Casey Williams.[3] De Bruin played most of the 2009 round-robin season before pulling out due to pregnancy. She returned to competitive netball the following year, signing with the Southern Steel for the 2010 season,[4][5] before returning to the Magic in 2012 for the remainder of the ANZ Championship.\n\nShe announced that she would retire from international netball in July 2016.[6] Domestically, she signed with the Northern Stars for the inaugural season of the new ANZ Premiership, delaying her retirement from all forms of the game. She signed with Australian club Adelaide Thunderbirds for the 2018 Suncorp Super Netball season.[7] She was named captain of the Thunderbirds prior to the start of the season.[8] de Brun was captain at a difficult time for the club, as the Thunderbirds went winless for the entire season.

The in-circle defender began her international career in South Africa where she played 34 Tests for her country of birth. De Bruin made New Zealand home in 2001.\n\n\n\nDebuting for the Silver Ferns in February 2003 against the England Roses was the start of a stellar career for the hard-working defender. Consistently a strong performer, she was a tight and effective circle defender who provided powerful through-court drives and support play.\n\n\n\nShe notched a significant personal milestone at the 2015 Netball World Cup in Sydney when becoming the fifth Silver Fern to achieve 100 Test Caps.\n\n\n\nDe Bruin is one of a select group to have played in five Netball World Cups \u2013 1999 (for South Africa) and 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 (for New Zealand).

After retiring from international netball last month, even Leana\u2019s a little surprised at how happy she is post-Ferns. After all, it\u2019s a team she was a part of for a staggering 14 years, notching up 104 test caps in the black dress, and before that, 34 for her native South Africa. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s given her everything \u2013 a career as a professional sportswoman, her closest friends and a new home in New Zealand. And apart from being Mum to the very energetic and vivacious Caleb, netball remains her greatest passion. Leana\u2019s decision to hang up her now well-worn bib was incredibly tough but, as the 1.90m defender concedes, it was time.\n\n\u201cMy body couldn\u2019t take it any more,\u201d the no-nonsense netball stalwart says. \u201cI went into the Silver Fern trials with an open mind, but my ankle was giving me grief the whole season. The Ferns environment is tough and I was battling. I couldn\u2019t give 100 per cent, so I said to [Silver Ferns coach] Janine [Southby] before she made the final decision, I think it\u2019s time. And it was. I was always going to be playing in pain and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more.\u201d Still, it was hard to let go of a 14-year tenure that\u2019s seen her win a world championship, two Commonwealth Games and an ANZ Championship title. \u201cPart of me still wanted to be a part of it,\u201d she admits. \u201cI wanted to finish on a game, rather than just randomly like I had to. But, unfortunately, you know, life takes funny turns. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d And fate was the reason a 22-year-old Leana ended up in Aotearoa in the first place. After the 1999 World Championships, a World Seven invitational team was formed to play against the Silver Ferns in New Zealand, and Leana jumped at the chance to be a part of it.\n\n\u201cThe manager of that team was from Invercargill. I was chatting with her and I mentioned how cool it would be to come over and play in New Zealand, and then she asked me!\u201d Three years later, Leana was a surprise selection for the Silver Ferns and lined up for her debut in 2003. Soon, she found herself up against her former team. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe hardest part was hearing the South African national anthem. I couldn\u2019t sing that, I had to sing the New Zealand one. That got the heartstrings, for sure. But for some reason, it also felt right, as hard as it was. I was immensely proud to be wearing that black dress.\u201d Now Leana\u2019s a true blue Kiwi \u2013 a fact reinforced by her New Zealand-born and All Black fanatic son Caleb, whom she\u2019s thrilled to be spending more time with.\n\nLeana played for the Silver Ferns for the past 14 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loving the fact I\u2019m home a bit more now. Every afternoon, we\u2019ll have a bit of a rugby game or a kicking contest in the backyard,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows everything there is to know about the All Blacks, he has the same birthday as Kieran Read, which he just thinks is the coolest thing ever. He\u2019s playing rippa at the moment, but moves onto tackle rugby next year. \u201cHe does understand that I\u2019m not playing with the Ferns any more, but he does keep asking when we\u2019re going away again, because we\u2019ve been used to travelling a lot! It is a little weird to him that all of a sudden, Mum\u2019s home every weekend.\u201d As far as a new plan goes, spending time with her son is at the top of Leana\u2019s list, as well as being \u201ca good tenant\u201d and helping her landlords, Laurie and Jo, look after the farm and the animals. But Leana has found she\u2019s been unable to let go of netball completely. While she currently can\u2019t confirm if she is playing in either the new South Auckland-based team for the inaugural New Zealand elite league or is seeking an Australian contract, Leana reckons she might have one more year of domestic netball in her.\n\nAnd she\u2019s also scored coaching gigs overseas, as well as ambassador work for Netball New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in netball world!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think I would have been totally depressed if I had to ask myself,\n\n\u2018What next?\u2019, but the transition from player to ambassador has been quite easy. Netball New Zealand has been great.\u201d Along with moving into a more mentor-based netball role, where she\u2019s keen to share her experience and wisdom, she also has a very important event to plan \u2013 Caleb\u2019s upcoming seventh birthday party. \u201cI had planned to still be playing netball at the end of October, when his birthday is, so now that I\u2019m not, we get to organise the party together, which is really exciting. This will only be the second time in his life that I\u2019m home for his birthday because we\u2019ve always been playing overseas.\u201d She\u2019s also looking forward to spending some more time with her new partner, who lives in South Auckland. \u201cYup, there\u2019s a bit of a dude hanging around. It\u2019s quite nice,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice \u2013 well, it sounds horrible \u2013 but we\u2019re not in each other\u2019s face all the time! So the distance thing works. But it does help when you\u2019re not playing; you have a bit more time to fit everything in and the headspace too.\u201d\n\nWith her Silver Fern team mates.\n\nCaleb is keen on a caravan trip around the North Island too, but Leana admits she isn\u2019t so sure about that plan. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to attempt it!\u201d Still, Leana says she can\u2019t quite shake a few old habits, such as keeping up with the gym sessions. \u201cI know that sounds a bit weird, but I love training!\u201d she tells. \u201cThough now I can just cruise on the bike, instead of going a million miles an hour, and then afterwards, I have time to catch up with friends, have a coffee and go for a walk.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s blissfully happy with her new, less structured and more relaxed life, Leana knows netball will always be in her blood, and the woman her Silver Fern team-mates know as Vlooi will always be somewhere in the background, coaching, mentoring or simply as a fan. \u201cEveryone needs a nickname in the team and mine was Vlooi,\u201d explains Leana. \u201cIt actually means flea in Afrikaans... but I\u2019m not tiny and I can\u2019t jump that high. When Casey [Kopua] found that out, she started calling me fleabag.\u201d Shaking her head, she continues, \"My maiden name is du Plooy and someone at my high school gave me that nickname because it rhymed. Irene [van Dyk] is probably the reason why it\u2019s stuck!\u201d It\u2019s the friendships in the team that Leana will miss the most, especially with Irene, Maria Tutaia, Cathrine Latu, Grace Rasmussen and Anna Harrison."}, {"url": "http://www.wmzyw.com/shiti/yingyu/2020-09-22/44952.html", "page_content":
