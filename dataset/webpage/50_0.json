Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/140cee9f/Emily-Gielnik", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://olympics.com/en/athletes/emily-gielnik", "page_content": "Year of Birth\n\nYear of Birth 1992\n\nFirst Olympic Games\n\nFirst Olympic Games Tokyo 2020"}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2018/04/05/gielnik-quest-golden-boot/", "page_content": "The Matildas touched down in Jordan last week, with the squad hitting their straps with the aim of adding a second AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup to their trophy cabinet.\n\nFootball Queensland journalist Chloe Walker spoke with Matildas and Brisbane Roar striker Emily Gielnik about her road to Jordan.\n\nThe shoe fits! Like Cinderella it was a race against the clock for Australian football player Emily Gielnik, but she has managed to escape the confines of her moonboot, trading Velcro straps for leather lace-ups just in time to make the Matildas squad for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan. Moments before boarding her plane to Portugal for the 2018 Algarve Cup in early March, Gielnik received news that the excruciating pain in her ankle was a result of bone stress. She says it was a blessing in disguise as any further strain would have caused a fracture, sidelining the Matildas forward for 3-6 months. With a grueling strength and conditioning program combined with some TLC, Gielnik has beaten the odds and found her happily ever after in the Australian squad.\n\nGielnik says her most recent injury is the result of a prior ankle fracture following one of the biggest performances that sparked her professional career in 2012. Gielnik made her debut for the Young Matildas in the FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Vietnam scoring a hat-trick and changing the game for the green and gold, from three goals down to a 4-3 win. She says however, an evolution in her career has occurred more recently, coincidently in last year\u2019s Algarve Cup, scoring three goals during the tournament against big name teams including China and The Netherlands.\n\n\u201cIt was a turning point for me not just scoring the goals but having a good tournament and the realisation that I wanted to do it (football) full-time and take it more seriously,\u201d Gielnik says.\n\nGielnik, 25, was a late bloomer to the sport at age 12 when she began playing for Redlands United, already setting her sights high towards Brisbane Roar and Young Matildas. She says her pathway into the sport was quite different to others as it happened during a school trip to the Australian Institute of Sport where the Matildas were holding a training session.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my sports teacher who asked the coach at the time, Tom Sermanni, if I could have a session with them,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cHe (Sermanni) asked me to come back the next day and I played a game with them. Straight away he made the call to get me into the QAS (Queensland Academy of Sport) with Jeff Hopkins who was the head coach at the time.\u201d\n\nGielnik\u2019s professional football career began with the Brisbane Roar in 2009 where she later was dubbed the super-sub coming off the bench time and time again to score 12 goals in 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cI got second highest goal scorer for that year and I only played 5-10 minutes every game,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure to keep going on and scoring but it actually just kept happening.\u201d\n\nHaving recently finished her eighth season loyal to her club, Gielnik is eager to go all the way with Brisbane Roar after they were knocked out in a devastating loss in Westfield W-League semi-final despite finishing minor premiers.\n\n\u201cSo we didn\u2019t win and that\u2019s just football; in the most important games any team can win on any given day and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gielnik\u2019s season never ends with W-League. Throughout her career she has ventured to international clubs including Liverpool, Ottawa Fury in Canada, Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan and Avaldsnes IL in Norway. She says although the style of play differs from place to place, the W-league provides a high standard of football.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are far behind and sometimes I think we are a little bit ahead. Now we are starting to attract international big names as well as those in the American league coming over to play W-League.\u201d\n\nDespite the W-League producing strong competition Gielnik says women\u2019s football has a lot of catching up to do in the male oriented sport but it is growing every year. She says Brisbane Roar is already contributing to that growth by including the young Roar girls under-17s team to compete in the NPL Queensland Women\u2019s competition.\n\n\u201cI think it is a foot in the door for the girls to be exposed.\u201d\n\nShe says the biggest issue is the lack of opportunities for exposure and is why Brisbane Roar are trying to provide a platform for youth girls teams as young as 13-14.\n\n\u201cI think it needs a bit of work (the football pathway) but its heading in the right direction, so it\u2019s a positive.\u201d\n\nShe says her biggest advice to young up and comers is to be doing extra work outside of training.\n\n\u201cThose willing to work a bit hard will be rewarded in the end.\u201d\n\nOn top of her already busy schedule Gielnik also holds private coaching for girls that she believes are quite talented, this is on top of owning her own strength and condition gym ShedEm, teaching 16 classes a week.\n\nBeing selected to play for the green and gold in the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup has crossed one goal off Gielnik\u2019s list and if all goes well she is eager to compete in 2018 Tournament of Nations in the US after Matildas won the major competition last year putting them on the map.\n\nThe Matildas kick-off their Asian Cup campaign in Jordan on Sunday, April 8.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup group stage

Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://richathletes.com/emily-gielnik-bio-profile-net-worth-facts-her/", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik is an Australian international women\u2019s football player currently playing in Sweden for Vittsjo and the West Matildas of Australia as a striker. She fell in love with soccer at a young age but didn\u2019t get to have a taste of it until the age of twelve.\n\nInitially, her football career was characterized by many lows that could have made her quit, but her never-dying spirit spurred her on. She has played across several leagues in Europe and a few in her native country.\n\nShe played for Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory in Australia, Liverpool Ladies in England, Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan, Avaldsness IL in Norway, Bayern Munich in Germany, and Vittsjo in Sweden.\n\nOn the international front, she has represented Australia at the under-19 level, before featuring for the senior side in a 3 nil friendly loss to Japan in July 2012.\n\nBiography Of Emily Gielnik\n\nEmily Gielnik was born on 13th May 1992 in Melbourne, the capital city of Australia. Although her parents\u2019 names remain unknown, they both played an important role in her career path.

It is not clear whether she attended other schools after graduating from high school. However, she is currently studying to obtain a Bachelor of Exercise Science from an unnamed institution.\n\nIt is not out of place to say that she was born with a natural gift for sports, but she didn\u2019t have the slightest idea that would end up a footballer. It was basketball and rugby at the beginning, but due to the physicality of the game and injuries she sustained, her mother talked her out of it.\n\nBut she was not the type that gives up easily, so she convinced her mother to allow her to play soccer instead. And that marks the beginning of a journey, though filled with many ups and downs, only courage, drive, and passion saw her through.\n\nToday, She is one of the formidable strikers in the Westfield Matildas with the natural knack to score goals from anywhere and everywhere.\n\nAlso; Read Aliona Bolsova- Tennis Career and Earnings, Bio, Dating, 7 Unknown Details\n\nEmily Gielnik\u2019s 2021 Player Profile\n\nFull Name: Emily Gielnik\n\nEmily Gielnik Date of Birth: 13th May 1992\n\n13th May 1992 Age: 31 years old\n\n31 years old Place of Birth: Melbourne, Australia\n\nMelbourne, Australia Nationality: Australia\n\nAustralia Current Club: Vittsjo GIK (Sweden)\n\nVittsjo GIK (Sweden) Position: Forward\n\nForward Jersey: #15\n\n#15 Preferred Foot: Right\n\nRight Education: Cleveland District State High School/ Bachelor of Exercise Science\n\nCleveland District State High School/ Bachelor of Exercise Science Height: 6 feet 0 inch (1.83m)\n\n6 feet 0 inch (1.83m) Weight: 68kg (149lbs)\n\nNet Worth Of Emily Gielnik\n\nGielnik who can play on the wing but is more dangerous in the center makes a pretty amount of money from playing football. Her net worth has been quoted by the media to be around $1 and $5 million.\n\nHaving played for some giant clubs in Europe; especially Liverpool and Bayern Munich, it is not an understatement to say that she made a decent amount from her deals with the clubs.\n\nIf she is not retiring any time soon, then it means she still has some years under her playing boots. Possibly, some big clubs with better deals would come for her in the nearest future. Besides, she is playing well.\n\nInteresting Facts About Emily Gielnik\n\n1. Gielnik Didn\u2019t Make It To The 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup And 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nPlayers are always devastated whenever they don\u2019t make it to the squad representing their countries in international tournaments. It was a similar experience for Gielnik whose name was omitted from the 2015 FIFA women\u2019s world cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. Even though she was part of the squad that played the Rio 2016 qualifying games.\n\n2. She Owns A Fitness Outfit\n\nSometimes happiness and fulfillment don\u2019t only come from targets you set to reach. But also from areas, you ain\u2019t looking at. It happened to Gielnik after she left out of Australia\u2019s 2016 Rio Olympics team and since she didn\u2019t meet her goal, she tried something else.\n\nShe opened a gym center, \u201cShredEm Fitness\u201d. She didn\u2019t realize that it would make her happy, but it did.\n\n3. Her Father\u2019s Criticisms As A Child Inspired Her To Greatness\n\nThough her mother was apprehensive when she wanted to start playing football in the beginning, but her dad was the opposite. In fact, he was the one who often takes her to every sporting event. He watches all her basketball and football games and goes as far as to the sidelines.\n\nShe gives him credit for all the times he supported and pushed her to go the extra mile, to become a better player.\n\n4. Tokyo Olympics Is Her First Olympics\n\nAfter she didn\u2019t make the cut for the 2016 Rio Olympics, the forward didn\u2019t allow it to weigh her down completely. Football is the game she loves, so she improved on herself and her skills.\n\nShe moved to Norway and later returned to play in the W-League for Melbourne Victory. After the improvement, she returned to the Westfield Matildas and began to gain more ground by scoring more goals.\n\nWith this, she was shortlisted for Jordan 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup. And the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in France.\n\nShe was in Germany for Bayern Munich where she gained more experience. Now, she is seen as a key figure for Australia in Tokyo.\n\n5.

It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2019/05/28/emily-gielniks-journey-from-queensland-to-her-first-world-cup/", "page_content": "In football there are stories of disappointment but there are also the ones of triumph and dedication, where players fight tooth and nail to get their chance. Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the World Cup on June 9 against Italy.\n\nImage: Matt King/Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/player-profile-emily-gielniks-lifelong-olympic-dream", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik has been to a FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and an AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and can now finally add the Olympics to her resume.\n\nHer career is defined by perseverance and grit. Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Emily_Gielnik", "page_content": "What we do.

Westfield Matildas\u2019 forward Emily Gielnik embodies that notion.\n\nWith the world firmly placed on pause during the period of COVID-19, restrictions have shut down the normality of life around the globe.\n\nBeing in lockdown with your thoughts to keep you company can be in equal parts challenging and invigorating. For Emily Gielnik, isolation has been a time for reflection and consideration.\n\n\u201cI saw the light; you communicate more and you get to look at life from a different perspective,\u201d she said from her apartment in Munich, Germany.\n\n\u201cI was actually feeling quite fortunate. Even though football is my job, my career, my life and it\u2019s hard to go from doing what you love to not be doing it at all, but watching the news really put things into perspective for me.\u201d\n\nA TIME OF REFLECTION\n\nAfter returning from the AFC Women\u2019s Olympic Qualifiers, Emily Gielnik and her Bayern Munich teammates soon found themselves returning to their homes as COVID-19 restrictions came into effect in Germany.\n\nFor the 28-year-old, the restrictions occurred at a fortuitous time with both her mum and partner on hand to ride out the opening weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to have her [Mum] here,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201c[We were] just sharing some good quality time. There was definitely a lot of laughs and a lot of cooking happening!\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter years of intermittent separation, the time mother and daughter spent together away from reality was a blessing.\n\n\u201cWhen you go over to their [her parents] house and you see them on the weekend, it\u2019s so rushed and you're not really there. You're replying to people and on social media. I feel like she was here, and I was actually engaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been in quarantine, it would have been a lot different if she was here. I was at full time training and I would have only seen her a little bit in the morning and a little bit in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nFATHER & FRIEND\n\nEmily Gielnik admits that her life story is much like her football story; a tale of a late bloomer.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, with basketball and rugby being her first loves, Gielnik didn\u2019t playing football until the age of twelve. Even then, it was after much encouragement on the part of the teenager to coax her parents to let her take to the pitch.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of persuading in terms of my Mum and her letting me play soccer because she thought it's such high injury sport - although I played rugby against boys so I can't comprehend it,\u201d she laughed.\n\nGielnik made the switch from rugby to football and never looked back (Supplied: Emily Gielnik)\n\nWhile her Mum may have been apprehensive about those first steps, Gielnik\u2019s Dad was right beside her every step of the way.\n\n\u201cI had that Dad that was always taking me to every sporting event possible,\u201d she remembered fondly.\n\n\u201cHe would watch all my basketball games; all my football games and he was without a doubt that man that is running up and down the sidelines of the game and yelling at you to stop watching the play.\u201d\n\nGielnik credits her father\u2019s patience and support for pushing her to the next level. Criticism, no matter how constructive, can be a difficult to take on as a teenager. Looking back with the time and distance, Gielnik has no doubt his influence shaped her into the player she needed to be in order become a professional player.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be pro one day,\u201d she said \u201cI didn't grow up with this those skills or that coaching, I just had my Dad,\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he could sense that I wanted to get there so then he was criticising me, maybe at times he was criticising me too tough.\u201d\n\nHe just wanted to make me better because maybe he could see that I could make it to the top and he knew I could be good.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 15, Gielnik made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour but as her friends and teammates made their way into the Queensland Academy of Sport, Gielnik never received a letter.\n\nOpportunities can pop up in the strangest of places and while on a school trip where she visited the Australian Institute of Sport, Gielnik got her chance to train with the Westfield Matildas. Her letter from QAS came shortly after.\n\nThat finally put Gielnik on the path she had wanted for so long. A season with the QAS resulted in the striker earning a contract the following year with a star studded Brisbane Roar outfit.\n\nGielnik settling into the Matildas (Photo Credit: Rachel Bach / By the White Line)\n\nAfter a successful 2011/12 season with Roar, where she earned the moniker of \u2018super sub\u2019, Gielnik finally earned a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nHer first appearance for the Westfield Matildas came in Japan in 2012. While it might have been an ocean away, her father wasn\u2019t far away from her thoughts. These days he is a fixture Westfield Matildas home matches and proudly boasts the number 15.\n\n\u201cHe wears that jersey with pride\u2026you can\u2019t miss him!\u201d Gielnik laughed.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the starting line-up whomever is next to me is like \u2018oh my god Em, that\u2019s your Dad\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm actually playing for two people. Sometimes he lines up a shot and fully kicks like an air swing on the sideline. He's got like that as if he's kicked it. He's a part of the game, like he's a part of us.\u201d\n\nREDEFINING SUCCESS\n\nIn a scripted Disney production, realising a dream and playing for the Westfield Matildas should have been the beginning of a long and steady stint in the senior national team.\n\nHowever, in real life, Gielnik\u2019s ride was set to be a rollercoaster instead. That first run with the national team was followed by long periods away, and more frustrating periods of being close but not quite close enough.\n\n2015 saw her omission from the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and 2016 resulted in heartbreak after being a part of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification campaign.\n\nEach time, the Queenslander has dusted herself off \u2013 although it has not been without some soul searching and exploring different outlets for self fulfillment.\n\n\n\n\"After I got cut from the Olympics, I started to realise that I\u2019ve got to do something that makes me happy now and I opened the gym [ShredEm Fitness],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverything just went so well, and I had never been so happy so of course my football just skyrocketed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like obsessed with helping people. I was obsessed with helping someone from being so miserable and not comfortable at any other gyms and then they came and gave me a shot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI wasn't then putting so much pressure about making the Matildas squad or proving myself that stage I was like I got this gym now I'm just going to play W- League enjoy it and love it.\u201d\n\nOf course I was missing and craving the Matildas, but I stopped putting so much heavy pressure on myself thinking that that's all I wanted. I had the gym and so that created some happiness and some drive for me.\u201d\n\nEventually the off the field success began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it. A breakthrough 2017 Algarve Cup, a brilliant Westfield W-League season with Melbourne Victory in 2018/19 culminated in being named to her first major tournament squads for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2019.\n\nFinding her confidence and goal scoring touch for the Westfield Matildas saw big clubs around the world begin to take notice of the powerful forward.\n\nAfter stints in the United States, Japan and Norway, Gielnik joined Frauen Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.\n\n\u201cI heard from KK and Emily (Van Egmond), and people that have played in Germany, that their regiment was just craziness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor some reason I was longing for that environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoving halfway across the world with a language barrier was a welcome challenge for Gielnik but the move has also tested her in ways that were unforeseen. It has also precipitated further introspection from a larger than life figure.\n\nWhatever the level of football, success is a personal and intimate topic. It is one that, in her quiet times, she has had to grapple with and redefine to her own satisfaction.\n\n\u201cTo put it this way, I don't personally feel like I've accomplished everything I wanted to at this club,\u201d Gielnik said quietly.\n\n\u201cI got to play for this club but in all fairness, I don't feel like I've been successful at this club. I haven't come here and scored a ton of goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to overcome the feeling of failure and that's how I've actually felt here at Bayern and although I had a massive part of the team and I work hard \u2026 I don't feel as part of the success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe physical challenges are what I thought I was getting here, but I'm getting the mental challenge here as a footballer.\u201d\n\nOn her own personal football journey, Bayern has proved to be one of the biggest challenges and the most instructive.\n\nGielnik\u2019s time in Germany over the last year has become her greatest learning experience, demonstrating that perseverance and determination aren\u2019t easily earned traits.\n\n\u201cI could have left on several occasions and I had offers in the transfer window to great clubs, but I thought about it and you know that\u2019s just not me.\u201d\n\nLeaving and giving up and quitting it wasn\u2019t me. I still wanted the opportunity to turn it around and see the light and to make the best of it and that's just like a part of my personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success, I will say, is that I came here as a player that the coach wanted. He wanted me because I was that different player but then wanted me to adjust adapt to the German style football and that's not in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to stay true to myself.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik is not sure what her next move will be. What is certain that wherever she goes she will once again be better equipped to face it.\n\nAfter all, they do say good things come to those who are wait \u2013 or a late bloomers."}], "Emily Gielnik plays for Melbourne Victory in the W-League.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/australian-a-league/story/3643449/emily-gielnik-makes-w-league-switch-from-brisbane-roar-to-melbourne-victory", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nMatildas attacker Emily Gielnik has ended a nine-year association with the Brisbane Roar to sign with W-League rivals Melbourne Victory.\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old has played for the Roar since 2009 but has opted for a change of scenery and will link up with her former coach Jeff Hopkins at Victory.\n\n\n\nCapped 20 times for Australia, Gielnik shapes as a handy addition for a Victory outfit that hasn't qualified for the W-League finals since cross-town rivals Melbourne City entered the competition.\n\n\n\nCity have since dominated women's football in Australia while Victory have finished ninth, ninth and seventh on the ladder in those three seasons.\n\n\n\nEmily Gielnik Jono Searle/Getty Images\n\n\"This decision to leave was most certainly not taken lightly,\" said Gielnik, who was born in Melbourne but moved to Brisbane at age seven.\n\n\n\n\"It was a very tough and emotional decision because orange has always been in my blood.\n\n\n\n\"I leave on a good note and I wish the staff, the players and the club all the best wishes and success for the upcoming season.\"\n\n\n\nThe Roar have also lost another Matildas regular in Tameka Butt, who's off to an undisclosed club.\n\n\n\nButt said the only reason she was departing was to take up an internship opportunity interstate.\n\n\n\nButt, 27, has played for the Roar for the past 10 years."}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/player-profile-emily-gielniks-lifelong-olympic-dream", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik has been to a FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and an AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and can now finally add the Olympics to her resume.\n\nHer career is defined by perseverance and grit. Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/24747289/victory-sign-matildas-forward-gielnik", "page_content": "Matildas attacker Emily Gielnik has ended a nine-year association with the Brisbane Roar to sign with W-League rivals Melbourne Victory.\n\nThe 26-year-old has played for the Roar since 2009 but has opted for a change of scenery and will link up with her former coach Jeff Hopkins at Victory.\n\nCapped 20 times for Australia, Gielnik shapes as a handy addition for a Victory outfit that hasn't qualified for the W-League finals since cross-town rivals Melbourne City entered the competition.\n\nCity have since dominated women's football in Australia while Victory have finished ninth, ninth and seventh on the ladder in those three seasons.\n\n\"This decision to leave was most certainly not taken lightly,\" said Gielnik, who was born in Melbourne but moved to Brisbane at age seven.\n\n\"It was a very tough and emotional decision because orange has always been in my blood.\n\n\"I leave on a good note and I wish the staff, the players and the club all the best wishes and success for the upcoming season.\"\n\nThe Roar have also lost another Matildas regular in Tameka Butt, who's off to an undisclosed club.\n\nButt said the only reason she was departing was to take up an internship opportunity interstate.\n\nButt, 27, has played for the Roar for the past 10 years."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/w-league/emily-gielniks-move-to-melbourne-victory-is-paying-off-as-the-matilda-looks-to-lock-in-a-world-cup-spot/news-story/4ed1095158941733f24e097ec4ca275b", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik had a decision to make.\n\nLess than a year out from the Women\u2019s World Cup, the dynamic winger had two options: stay at W-League powerhouse Brisbane Roar, the club she\u2019d joined as a teenager \u2014 or take on a new challenge.\n\nThe latter option was joining her former Roar manager Jeff Hopkins at Melbourne Victory \u2014 a club trying to return from three years in the finals wilderness.\n\nWith the pain of missing out on the Matildas\u2019 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics squads still burning fiercely, Gielnik turned her back on the comfort of home and threw herself headlong into a move interstate.\n\n\u201cWell to be honest, Jeff has asked me (to come to Victory) the last couple of years and it wasn\u2019t until this year I made the move,\u201d Gielnik told foxsports.com.au.\n\n\u201cI think I personally needed a bit of a challenge, a change of environment, just being around a different diverse of players and I just really needed to challenge myself in football.\n\n\u201cSo I really feel like I just needed something new to be honest, I just didn\u2019t want to become stagnant and be at the same place for such a long time.\n\n\u201cBut my loyalty was really, really important to me. If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve stayed at Brisbane for the rest of my life, the rest of my football career.\n\n\u201cBut I really think that looking at the bigger picture in terms of the World Cup, this was a really critical move for me and \u2026 when I made the decision, it wasn\u2019t overnight it was weeks and weeks and it was an emotional one.\n\n\u201cSo it was a really calculated decision and I think so far for me, it\u2019s proven to be a good one.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nSix weeks into the W-League season, Gielnik is reaping the rewards of her bold move.\n\nVictory is sitting pretty, undefeated and outright top of the table, with the winger nominated for the PFA\u2019s recent W-League player of the month award.\n\nIn her five appearances for Victory, Gielnik has scored one goal, assisted one, made 10 key passes, created 11 chances and provided 23 crosses.\n\nShe\u2019s also combined beautifully with captain Natasha Dowie and star playmaker Christine Nairn, with the trio comprising one of the W-League\u2019s most intimidating attacks.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at it in the perspective of a couple of weeks, it feels really good, obviously because of where we are as a team and everything,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd me personally, I\u2019ve already felt a lot of improvement. Most importantly, it\u2019s just in my happiness and my mentality more than anything and I\u2019ve got a really good support network in terms of leaving home as well.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the staff here is great and obviously Jeff has the best intentions for me, so they\u2019re really going above and beyond to try and cater for everything that I need football-wise. So that was really important to me in the lead up to making that decision to play for Victory.\n\n\u201cBut obviously I already feel a really good shift and a good change for me so far but I think there\u2019s still over half a season to go and much more improvement that I\u2019m longing for, definitely, with the World Cup being obviously in my sights but the team being the priority of course at the moment.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik. (AAP Image/Julian Smith) Source: AAP\n\nIf moving states was one sacrifice that\u2019s paid off, then Gielnik\u2019s other big call was at least as significant.\n\nThe Matilda recently made the decision to end the lease on the gym she\u2019s owned and run for several years \u2014 and admits pulling the pin on that ambition to focus solely on her football has lifted a weight off her shoulders.\n\n\u201cTo cut a long story short \u2014 I honestly just feel like things in my life are going good and I have such a great support network and I have really, really good friends and I started to really put football first,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMy gym actually, ShredEm Fitness, that had been a lifelong dream for me that I opened before I was in the Matildas, I\u2019ve actually just ended the lease there and decided to put all my focus into football. So that was a big thing for me.\n\n\u201cPurely because football is not forever and that dream job is something I can always come back to, no matter the age. So I really just want to \u2014 after years and years of sacrifice to football, I thought this was really the ultimate thing to do just to give it everything that I\u2019ve got and enjoy every single challenge and experience because I\u2019m obviously lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a contracted Matilda at the moment.\n\n\u201cSo I weighed up some options and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t take it (football) seriously before, it\u2019s just more that I\u2019ve really made it a massive part of my life, which it has been for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve been a lot happier and a lot more focused and I\u2019ve really dedicated a lot of my time to it off the field as well now, more from a mental aspect and keeping myself in good condition and in other parts of fitness to make sure that I\u2019m physically good on the park.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

(Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been obviously great \u2014 she\u2019s obviously such a good player and technically a lot more advanced than I am in terms of football smartness,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cSo she\u2019s always a step ahead of me and she gives me the balls that no other teams or the other opponent doesn\u2019t usually expect. And we\u2019ve been on a really good wavelength and the same page recently, so I just think the good thing for me is still the best is yet to come and you know what finals football is like and that\u2019s when you see everyone\u2019s best football.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m super excited for that and it\u2019s just so important and so good to have those kinds of dynamic players in midfield \u2026 so it\u2019s been a joy and there\u2019s nothing better than when you\u2019ve got good players around you, I feel like it helps you and just brings confidence to the team and brings confidence to me.\n\n\u201cHopefully on Sunday she can put a bit of her magic to work and hopefully I can get on the end of some.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Gielnik has found a good wavelength with Dowie and regularly creates golden opportunities for her Victory captain \u2014 something she credits to her past experience playing as a No.9.\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate.

(Photo by Kelly Defina/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nEarlier this season, Gielnik detailed to foxsports.com.au the sacrifices she\u2019d made for football \u2014 which included shutting down her long-running gym in Queensland in a bid to throw everything at her dream of making a World Cup squad.\n\nNow, in a rich vein of form, the winger looks to have projected her name right up the Australian pecking order \u2014 and those sacrifices are bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cObviously it feels like that cliche saying \u2018hard work pays off\u2019 but I feel like I have made a lot of sacrifices but I haven\u2019t really made those sacrifices without those good people around me. There\u2019s a lot of people behind the scenes that have dug deep in lots of different respects to help me close that gym and to get me mentally where I am today,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the change of club and the faith that I had in the change has really paid off for me, especially with where we are now, it\u2019s even more rewarding \u2014 to (get to) where we are and where we\u2019ve become.\n\n\u201cBut yeah, look, I see it all as one door shuts and another one opens in other ways but I thought football is the now and with the form that I\u2019m in and with the World Cup coming up, and I wanted to give myself the best chance (to be selected).\n\n\u201cSo it is rewarding and it\u2019s a nice feeling to know that the hard work is paying off and (so are) the sacrifices of me just making football my full time commitment.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure it\u2019s once I\u2019m on that plane and playing in the World Cup, that will be obviously a dream come true and it\u2019ll all be worth it.\n\n\u201cBut now obviously the W-League is the priority for now, winning that grand final. And then more importantly for one of my dreams, to be on that World Cup flight.\u201d\n\nAnd while that dream is an ongoing motivator, right now, Gielnik has her eyes firmly focused on the path to more W-League silverware.\n\nAnd this time, she\u2019s got no plans of a semi-final heartbreak getting in the way."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/emily-gielnik", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nEmily Gielnik was born on 13 May, 1992 in Melbourne, Australia.

But football was definitely the right choice.\n\n\u201cMy Mum didn\u2019t want me playing football initially, she thought basketball was a safer option, I loved it, but then it became too much once I played football as well at the age of 12, I had to decide, and football took over.\u201d\n\nA good choice. Gielnik's gilded, and nomadic, career has taken her to the top flights in Canada, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Germany - where she played for Bayern Munich - as well as Australia. Now she intends to make Villa a more permanent home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a personal preference of mine, I\u2019ve always only signed a one-year contract,\u201d Gielnik added. \u201cThis is the first year where I\u2019ve signed a 1+1. That\u2019s a big shift for me, which means I\u2019ve had a good feeling about this club.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to really experience all the different styles of football and the different cultures, and where I can develop in different countries, so I\u2019m pretty fortunate that I\u2019ve been around the world. That was my decision, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve done it that way, I\u2019ve definitely grown from having been in all those situations, and now I\u2019ve landed here.\u201d\n\nYet, Gielnik is not a Women\u2019s Super League debutant. Her goal for Villa at Brighton was her first in the WSL for more than nine years, since she netted for Liverpool in a 3-3 draw away at Notts County in 2012. She spent one season on Merseyside, but knows she returns now transformed as a player, and to a completely changed league.\n\n\u201cIt was always on my radar, to end up back in the WSL, but I don\u2019t really want to count it as being in the WSL 10 years ago, because that was not the league it is now. The WSL has come on leaps and bounds. Back then with Liverpool, I was only training twice a week, so I\u2019m kind of treating this as my first time here.\"\n\nLife at Villa - who host league leaders Arsenal on Saturday - is going well so far, as they have seven points from their opening three goals, boosted by her strike at Brighton, a calm finish into the corner after being played through one-on-one.\n\n\u201cGetting the winner and getting my first goal, I felt I kind of needed to get that one out of the way,\" she said. \"Those first few games, you want to start strong and get some points on the board early.\u201d\n\nThe English league looks set to suit Gielnik's strong, quick and clinical style. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the most technical striker but I\u2019m a very counter-attacking, ball-in-behind, fast-paced, off-the-shoulder kind of player,\" she added. \"I\u2019m not much of a dribbler, but I love on the end of crosses and I also love delivering crosses, breaking the lines and getting in behind.\u201d\n\nHer move to Villa was one that almost didn\u2019t happen, after multiple approaches from the West Midlands club, before she was ultimately persuaded to move on September\u2019s deadline day after a short spell with Swedish top-tier side Vittsjo GIK.\n\nGielnik explained: \u201cI\u2019d had several conversations with my agent, just telling him to politely decline any others that had come through during the Olympics, so there were a few knock-backs already to Carla [Ward], but she was pretty persistent and that actually worked on me in the end because I actually needed a change. Carla had belief in me and wants me to progress.
