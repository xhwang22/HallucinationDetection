They can influence the course of natural forces, and human events.\n\nShinto tradition says that there are eight million million kami in Japan.\n\nConcepts of kami\n\nShinto belief includes several ideas of kami: while these are closely related, they are not completely interchangeable and reflect not only different ideas but different interpretations of the same idea.\n\nKami can refer to beings or to a quality which beings possess.\n\nSo the word is used to refer to both the essence of existence or beingness which is found in everything, and to particular things which display the essence of existence in an awe-inspiring way.\n\nBut while everything contains kami, only those things which show their kami-nature in a particularly striking way are referred to as kami.\n\nKami as a property is the sacred or mystical element in almost anything. It is in everything and is found everywhere, and is what makes an object itself rather than something else. The word means that which is hidden.\n\nKami have a specific life-giving, harmonising power, called musubi, and a truthful will, called makoto (also translated as sincerity).\n\nNot all kami are good - some are thoroughly evil.\n\nKami as 'God'\n\nThe idea that kami are the same as God stems in part from the use of the word kami to translate the word 'God' in some 19th century translations of the Bible into Japanese.\n\nThis caused a great deal of confusion even among Japanese: the Shinto theologian Ueda Kenji estimated in 1990 that nearly 65% of entering students now associate the Japanese term kami with some version of the Western concept of a supreme being.\n\nThe next section shows that kami are actually very different from the Western concept of God.\n\nKami as beings\n\nThe concept of kami is hard to explain.\n\nShintoists would say that this is because human beings are simply incapable of forming a true understanding of the nature of kami.\n\nTo make understanding easier kami are often described as divine beings, as spirits or gods. But kami are not much like the gods of other faiths:\n\nKami are not divine like the transcendent and omnipotent deities found in many religions.\n\nKami are not omnipotent.\n\nKami are not perfect - they sometimes make mistakes and behave badly.\n\nKami are not inherently different in kind from human beings or nature - they are just a higher manifestation of the life energy... an extraordinary or awesome version.\n\nKami don't exist in a supernatural universe - they live in the same world as human beings and the world of nature\n\nKami include the gods that created the universe, but can also include:\n\nThe spirits that inhabit many living beings\n\nSome beings themselves\n\nElements of the landscape, like mountains and lakes\n\nPowerful forces of nature, like storms and earthquakes\n\nhuman beings who became kami after their deaths\n\nThe term kami is sometimes applied to spirits that live in things, but it is also applied directly to the things themselves - so the kami of a mountain or a waterfall may be the actual mountain or waterfall, rather than the spirit of the mountain or waterfall.\n\nNot all kami are sufficiently personalised to have names - some are just referred to as the kami of such-and-such a place.\n\nThree types of kami are particularly important:\n\nUjigami, the ancestors of the clans: in tribal times, each group believed that a particular kami was both their ancestor and their protector, and dedicated their worship to that spirit\n\nKami of natural objects and creatures, and of the forces of nature\n\nThe souls of dead human beings of outstanding achievement\n\nA Japanese description of kami\n\nMotoori Norinaga (1730-1801) was one of the most distinguished Japanese scholars of religion and enthusiasts for Shinto revival. He described kami like this:\n\nI do not yet understand the meaning of the word 'kami'. In the most general sense, it refers to all divine beings of heaven and earth that appear in the classics. More particularly, the kami are the spirits that abide in and are worshipped at the shrines. Motoori Norinaga\n\nIn principle human beings, birds, animals, trees, plants, mountains, oceans - all may be kami. According to ancient usage, whatever seemed strikingly impressive, possessed the quality of excellence, or inspired a feeling of awe was called kami."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shinto", "page_content": "Shint\u014d , indigenous religious beliefs and practices of Japan . The word Shint\u014d, which literally means \u201cthe way of kami \u201d (generally sacred or divine power, specifically the various gods or deities), came into use in order to distinguish indigenous Japanese beliefs from Buddhism , which had been introduced into Japan in the 6th century ce. Shint\u014d has no founder, no official sacred scriptures in the strict sense, and no fixed dogmas , but it has preserved its guiding beliefs throughout the ages.\n\nShint\u014d can be roughly classified into the following three major types: Shrine Shint\u014d , Sect Shint\u014d, and Folk Shint\u014d. Shrine Shint\u014d (Jinja Shint\u014d), which has been in existence from the beginning of Japanese history to the present day, constitutes a main current of Shint\u014d tradition. Shrine Shint\u014d includes within its structure the now defunct State Shint\u014d (Kokka Shint\u014d)\u2014based on the total identity of religion and state\u2014and has close relations with the Japanese Imperial family. Sect Shint\u014d ( Ky\u014dha Shint\u014d ) is a relatively new movement consisting of 13 major sects that originated in Japan around the 19th century and of several others that emerged after World War II . Each sect was organized into a religious body by either a founder or a systematizer. Folk Shint\u014d (Minzoku Shint\u014d) is an aspect of Japanese folk belief that is closely connected with the other types of Shint\u014d. It has no formal organizational structure nor doctrinal formulation but is centred in the veneration of small roadside images and in the agricultural rites of rural families. These three types of Shint\u014d are interrelated: Folk Shint\u014d exists as the substructure of Shint\u014d faith , and a Sect Shint\u014d follower is usually also a parishioner (ujiko) of a particular Shint\u014d shrine.\n\nShint\u014d consists of the traditional Japanese religious practices as well as the beliefs and life attitudes that are in accord with these practices. Shint\u014d is more readily observed in the social life of the Japanese people and in their personal motivations than in a pattern of formal belief or philosophy. It remains closely connected with the Japanese value system and the Japanese people\u2019s ways of thinking and acting.\n\nHistory to 1900\n\nMuch remains unknown about religion in Japan during the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages. It is unlikely, however, that the religion of these ages has any direct connection with Shint\u014d. Yayoi culture, which originated in the northern area of the island of Kyushu in about the 3rd or 2nd century bce, is directly related to later Japanese culture and hence to Shint\u014d. Among the primary Yayoi religious phenomena were agricultural rites and shamanism.\n\nEarly clan religion and ceremonies In ancient times small states were gradually formed at various places. By the middle of the 4th century ce, a nation with an ancestor of the present Imperial Household as its head had probably been established. The constituent unit of society at that time was the uji (clan or family), and the head of each uji was in charge of worshiping the clan\u2019s ujigami\u2014its particular tutelary or guardian deity. The prayer for good harvest in spring and the harvest ceremony in autumn were two major festivals honouring the ujigami. Divination, water purification, and lustration (ceremonial purification), which are all mentioned in the Japanese classics, became popular, and people started to build shrines for their kami. Ancient Shint\u014d was polytheistic. People found kami in nature, which ruled seas or mountains, as well as in outstanding men. They also believed in kami of ideas such as growth, creation, and judgment. Though each clan made the tutelary kami the core of its unity, such kami were not necessarily the ancestral deities of the clan. Sometimes kami of nature and kami of ideas were regarded as their tutelary kami. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now Two different views of the world were present in ancient Shint\u014d. One was the three-dimensional view in which the Plain of High Heaven (Takama no Hara, the kami\u2019s world), Middle Land (Nakatsukuni, the present world), and the Hades (Yomi no Kuni, the world after death) were arranged in vertical order. The other view was a two-dimensional one in which this world and the Perpetual Country (Tokoyo, a utopian place far beyond the sea) existed in horizontal order. Though the three-dimensional view of the world (which is also characteristic of North Siberian and Mongolian shamanistic culture) became the representative view observed in Japanese myths, the two-dimensional view of the world (which is also present in Southeast Asian culture) was dominant among the populace.\n\nEarly Chinese influences on Shint\u014d Confucianism, which originated in China, is believed to have reached Japan in the 5th century ce, and by the 7th century it had spread among the people, together with Daoism and yinyang (harmony of two basic forces of nature) philosophy. All of these stimulated the development of Shint\u014d ethical teachings. With the gradual centralization of political power, Shint\u014d began to develop as a national cult as well. Myths of various clans were combined and reorganized into a pan-Japanese mythology with the Imperial Household as its centre. The kami of the Imperial Household and the tutelary kami of powerful clans became the kami of the whole nation and people, and offerings were made by the state every year. Such practices were systematized supposedly around the start of the Taika-era reforms in 645. By the beginning of the 10th century, about 3,000 shrines throughout Japan were receiving state offerings. As the power of the central government declined, however, the system ceased to be effective, and after the 13th century only a limited number of important shrines continued to receive the Imperial offerings. Later, after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the old system was revived."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/soul-religion-and-philosophy", "page_content": "soul, in religion and philosophy, the immaterial aspect or essence of a human being, that which confers individuality and humanity, often considered to be synonymous with the mind or the self. In theology, the soul is further defined as that part of the individual which partakes of divinity and often is considered to survive the death of the body.\n\nMany cultures have recognized some incorporeal principle of human life or existence corresponding to the soul, and many have attributed souls to all living things. There is evidence even among prehistoric peoples of a belief in an aspect distinct from the body and residing in it. Despite widespread and longstanding belief in the existence of a soul, however, different religions and philosophers have developed a variety of theories as to its nature, its relationship to the body, and its origin and mortality.\n\nMore From Britannica Christianity: The immortality of the soul\n\nAmong ancient peoples, both the Egyptians and the Chinese conceived of a dual soul. The Egyptian ka (breath) survived death but remained near the body, while the spiritual ba proceeded to the region of the dead. The Chinese distinguished between a lower, sensitive soul, which disappears with death, and a rational principle, the hun, which survives the grave and is the object of ancestor worship.\n\nThe early Hebrews apparently had a concept of the soul but did not separate it from the body, although later Jewish writers developed the idea of the soul further. Biblical references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks and were introduced into Christian theology at an early date by St. Gregory of Nyssa and by St. Augustine.\n\nAncient Greek concepts of the soul varied considerably according to the particular era and philosophical school. The Epicureans considered the soul to be made up of atoms like the rest of the body. For the Platonists, the soul was an immaterial and incorporeal substance, akin to the gods yet part of the world of change and becoming. Aristotle\u2019s conception of the soul was obscure, though he did state that it was a form inseparable from the body.\n\nIn Christian theology St. Augustine spoke of the soul as a \u201crider\u201d on the body, making clear the split between the material and the immaterial, with the soul representing the \u201ctrue\u201d person. However, although body and soul were separate, it was not possible to conceive of a soul without its body. In the Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas returned to the Greek philosophers\u2019 concept of the soul as a motivating principle of the body, independent but requiring the substance of the body to make an individual.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nFrom the Middle Ages onward, the existence and nature of the soul and its relationship to the body continued to be disputed in Western philosophy. To Ren\u00e9 Descartes, man was a union of the body and the soul, each a distinct substance acting on the other; the soul was equivalent to the mind. To Benedict de Spinoza, body and soul formed two aspects of a single reality. Immanuel Kant concluded that the soul was not demonstrable through reason, although the mind inevitably must reach the conclusion that the soul exists because such a conclusion was necessary for the development of ethics and religion. To William James at the beginning of the 20th century, the soul as such did not exist at all but was merely a collection of psychic phenomena.\n\nJust as there have been different concepts of the relation of the soul to the body, there have been numerous ideas about when the soul comes into existence and when and if it dies. Ancient Greek beliefs were varied and evolved over time. Pythagoras held that the soul was of divine origin and existed before and after death. Plato and Socrates also accepted the immortality of the soul, while Aristotle considered only part of the soul, the no\u00fbs, or intellect, to have that quality. Epicurus believed that both body and soul ended at death. The early Christian philosophers adopted the Greek concept of the soul\u2019s immortality and thought of the soul as being created by God and infused into the body at conception.\n\nIn Hinduism the atman (\u201cbreath,\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d) is the universal, eternal self, of which each individual soul (jiva or jiva-atman) partakes. The jiva-atman is also eternal but is imprisoned in an earthly body at birth. At death the jiva-atman passes into a new existence determined by karma, or the cumulative consequences of actions. The cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) is eternal according to some Hindus, but others say it persists only until the soul has attained karmic perfection, thus merging with the Absolute (brahman). Buddhism negates the concept not only of the individual self but of the atman as well, asserting that any sense of having an individual eternal soul or of partaking in a persistent universal self is illusory.\n\nThe Muslim concept, like the Christian, holds that the soul comes into existence at the same time as the body; thereafter, it has a life of its own, its union with the body being a temporary condition."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eucharist", "page_content": "Eucharist , also called Holy Communion or Lord\u2019s Supper , in Christianity , ritual commemoration of Jesus \u2019 Last Supper with his disciples . The Eucharist (from the Greek eucharistia for \u201cthanksgiving\u201d) is the central act of Christian worship and is practiced by most Christian churches in some form. Along with baptism it is one of the two sacraments most clearly found in the New Testament .\n\nHistorical development\n\nIt is clear that the earliest Christians regularly enacted the Eucharist. Originally, the rite was a repetition of the common meal of the local group of disciples with the addition of the bread and the cup signifying the presence of Jesus. St. Paul\u2019s earliest record of the ordinance in his first letter to the Corinthians, written about 55 ce, suggests that some abuses had arisen in conjunction with the common meal, or agap\u0113, with which it was combined. It had become an occasion of drunkenness and gluttony. To rectify this, St. Paul recalled and reestablished the original institution and its purpose and interpretation as a sacrificial-sacramental rite. Fellowship meals continued in association with the postapostolic Eucharist, as is shown in the Didach\u0113 (a Christian document concerned with worship and church discipline written c. 100\u2013c. 140), and in the doctrinal and liturgical development described in the writings of the early Church Fathers little was changed. During the late 2nd century the meal became vestigial and was finally abandoned. The Eucharist was originally celebrated every Sunday, but by the 4th century it was celebrated daily. The eucharistic formula was set in a framework of biblical readings, psalms, hymns, and prayers that depended in form somewhat on the synagogue service. This remained one basis of the various liturgies that arose, including the Roman rite.\n\nThe \u201cpresence\u201d of Jesus in the elements of bread and wine has been variously interpreted in actual, figurative, or symbolic senses, but the sacramental sense, as the anamnesis, or memorial before God, of the sacrificial offering on the cross once and for all, has always been accepted. A eucharistic theology gradually took shape in the apostolic and early church without much controversy or formulation. Not until the beginning of the Middle Ages did controversial issues arise that found expression in the definition of the doctrine of transubstantiation at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. This definition opened the way for the Scholastic interpretation of the eucharistic presence of Christ and of the sacramental principle, in Aristotelian terms. Thus, St. Thomas Aquinas maintained that a complete change occurred in the \u201csubstance\u201d of each of the species, while the \u201caccidents,\u201d or outward appearances, remained the same. During the Reformation, though the medieval doctrine was denied in varying ways by the reformers, it was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent in 1551. Holy Communion was retained as a sacrament by most of the Protestant groups, except that those churches that see the supper solely as a memorial prefer to speak not of a sacrament but of an ordinance."}, {"url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology/Ritual_and_Religion", "page_content": "Ritual, Religion and Myth [ edit | edit source ]\n\nReligion changes across the globe. Different parts of the world have different beliefs and rules that maintain their religion. Not all religions follow the same practices but there are some similarities between most, if not all, religions. Religions have their own rituals attached to their beliefs. Some rituals across religions (like fasting) are specific to one religion while others are practiced throughout. Religions incorporate myths into how they practice, and why they practice by conveying messages about the supernatural through stories or metaphors. They are used to help express ideas and concepts as well as help the followers achieve spirituality. Religion can help people find peace of mind, give them hope, turn their life around, and change their point of view. Religion can be used to justify things and to motivate others. Rituals and ceremonies are practiced to show dedication and faith to a religion.\n\nOrigin of Religion [ edit | edit source ]\n\nJames Frazer's ethnology of religion entitled The Golden Bough, published in 1890 and again in 1922, offered a thorough review of the cross cultural variation in ideas related to magic, myth and religion that were known to Europeans at the time. Taking an evolutionary approach to spirituality, he proposed that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, which was displaced by religion, which in turn was replaced by science.\n\nThere are two types of known magic: imitative and contagious.\n\nImitative Magic\n\nVoodoo doll with pins in it.\n\nImitative magic (also known as Similarity Magic) Is a form of magic in which an object, act, etc. that is similar to the desired goal can be used to influence an outcome(e.g. a rain dance to bring rain to dry crops). This is a religious cult practiced in the Caribbean and Southern USA (mostly by afro-americans, immigrants and descendants), combining elements of Roman Catholic rituals with traditional African magical and religious rites, and characterized by sorcery and spirit possession.. Voodoo, an example of similarity magic, has a negative connotation because of the misconception that it is associated with evil. In this practice, the Voodoo doll is used as a symbolic representation of another person. A person that practices Voodoo magic may stick pins into a doll in order to inflict harm or put a curse on another individual; it is thought that by harming the Voodoo doll, one can manipulate the physical or emotional state of the person that the doll is meant to represent.\n\nHowever, the use of Voodoo is not purely negative. Voodoo is often used to heal relationships or other personal issues. An example of this is found in the book Mama Lola: A Voodoo Priestess in Brooklyn by Karen McCarthy Brown. Brown studies the priestesses daily practices, and finds that Mama Lola uses imitative magic to help people's lives. In one instance, she helps a young women's relationship with her husband. The husband is cheating on his wife, so Moma Lola tells her to write his name on a piece of paper, tear it up, and speak his name. By doing this, he will hear her and come back to her.\n\nContagious Magic\n\nContagious magic is often associated with witchcraft and sorcery. Witchcraft uses magic by casting spells, sometimes affiliated with spirits. Despite the stereotypes of European American witchcraft, most witchcraft is quite tame and does not involve the hurting of others.[1] Contagious magic is still practiced today throughout the world. Many people still use puppets (much like voodoo dolls) or make symbolic offerings (images, money, candles and representations of babies or body part or a myriad of other public displays of devotion (the supplicants to the which are made with someone's personal possessions in order to draw positive energy into that person's life. The ability that a Navajo Witch has to cause you physical pain because they have a piece of your hair is an example of contagious magic.\n\nFunctions of Religion [ edit | edit source ]\n\nReligion and its purpose varies depending on who you ask, but in a general sense, religions are societal groups of individuals with like-minded values and beliefs about the world. Most use religion as a way to achieve and ensure salvation in the afterlife, or to receive assurance of the purpose of their own lives. Spirituality often provides its followers with moral standards or expectations of how they should live and treat others. A religious group can bring people together, but religion also has a violent history as the driving force behind acts of genocide and oppression. For example, the Crusades were some of the most famous instances of the use of religion to justify violence, the Holocaust being another example. Both are historically significant, and while these are drastic examples, we still see prejudice today with attacks on Muslims based solely on religious ignorance. Anthropologically, religion has many purposes in society and its study can tell much about a culture that is not otherwise understood.\n\nConcepts of Supernatural Beings [ edit | edit source ]\n\nThere are many different ways cultures conceptualize their spiritual beings. These include, but are not limited to: Animatism, Animism, Anthropomorphism, Dualism, Euhemerism, Totemism, and Zoomorphism.\n\nA Polynesian carving, spirits are said to be able to manifest themselves in any object.\n\nMana is conveyed trough tiki statues in Polynesian culture\n\nAnimatism is the belief in a supernatural power that is able to be something other than a person or animal. In this sense, it is the belief that the supernatural is all around you and could be anything. Individuals that hold these beliefs explain a powerful unseen force that can potentially be found all around us; in people, animals, plants and features of nature such as volcanoes and the ocean, for example, Mother Earth (believing in the non-living). The belief of animatism doesn't assign a spiritual identity but instead believes in a single unified power that can manifest itself into objects or be acquired by and controlled by certain individuals. The term was coined by the British Anthropologist Robert Ranulph Marett as \"a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control\" Animatism is the cause of consciousness and personality to natural phenomena such as thunderstorms and earthquakes and to objects such as plants and stones. Inanimate objects, forces, and plants have personalities and wills, but not souls. These forces are inanimate and impersonal, This is not true for those beliefs relating to animism. In the South Pacific Polynesian cultures, the power of animatism is commonly referred to as \"Mana\". For them, it is a force that is inherent in all objects, plants, and animals (including people) to different degrees. Some things or people have more of it than others and are therefore, potentially dangerous. Often a chief must have some with him at all times. Dangerous places, such as volcanoes, were considered to have concentrated amounts of mana. Mana is a spiritual quality considered to have supernatural origin \u2013 a sacred impersonal force existing in the universe. Therefore to have mana is to have influence and authority, and efficacy \u2013 the power to perform in a given situation. Mana, Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success. For example, the Polynesians, believe in mana as a force inherent in all objects. This essential quality of mana is not limited to persons \u2013 folks, governments, places and inanimate objects can possess mana.\n\nAnimism is one of the oldest beliefs, dating back to the Paleolithic age (a prehistoric period distinguished by the earliest known primitive tools about 2.5 million to 40,000 years ago), Cruzbub (discuss \u2022 contribs) 06:20, 12 December 2017 (UTC) it is greatly associated with primitive peoples, those without a written tradition. Animism believes that natural objects, natural phenomena, and the universe all possess individual souls. It is derived from the Latin word anima, meaning a breath or soul.Sir Edward Burnett Tylor was one of the first Anthropologists to study animism, believing it to be a \u201cminimum definition of religion\u201d, he theorized that all globally recognized religions had some aspects of animism^ . Tylor posted that animism was birthed by primitive cultures mistaking their dreams for reality.[2] It is believed that animism was first constructed out of a need to explain natural phenomena such as sleeping, dreaming, and death. In classical animism, it is said that spirits are a separate entity from the body, and cause life in humans by passing through bodies and other inanimate objects. Robert Ranulph Marett, another Anthropologist of Tylor\u2019s time, suggested that the earliest forms of animism were created based on emotion and intuition, rather than sacred practices, and written word. He believed that the earliest animists based their religion on inanimate objects acting strangely, or uniquely giving them the illusion of life alike to humans, trees blowing in the wind for instance. Contrary to Tylor, Marett believed that animists did not separate between the body and the soul, claiming them to be a single entity living and dying as one^ .\n\nIn terms of practices, many animistic cultures worshiped plant life, including trees and plants, because of their beauty, strength, and life. It is thought that all beings, including plants, have a soul. This is why in many Native American cultures totem poles are a major symbolic structure, and the main focus of many rituals. Centuries ago the Coast Salish Indian Tribe was well known for its belief in spiritual transmutation between humans and animals, a trait of animistic culture. Living in Cowichan Valley, on Vancouver Island they created hundreds of totem poles in order to showcase the spirits believed to be living in the animals portrayed upon the totems, and the trees the totems themselves were made out of. Now, the remnants of these totems are on display in both museums, and in their original locations in the city of Duncan, now known as \u201cTotem City\u201d because of the animistic art left over by the Coast Salish Indians.\n\nTotem poles at the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia.\n\nAs mentioned, animism is greatly associated with more primitive cultures. However, \u201cnew animism\u201d a more symbolic and less literal form of animism is still found in many different cultures worldwide^ . This form of the religion is focused on the different types of souls in different types of people from all different cultures. It is more acutely understood as the teaching of how to have respectful relationships with human beings, as well as the natural world. It is also to be understood, that not all things have a truly human soul, including humans, and part of animism is distinguishing what/who is truly human, and what/who is not. The basic idea is that showing respect for relationships is vital to survival. ^ .\n\nAnthropomorphism is the concept of attributing human characteristics or behaviors to a non-human being. This can mean animals, plants, and almost anything else taking on the personality of a human. It can mean that any object can be given human traits by a person, such as a dog feeling guilty for stealing food, or the gurgling of a stream sounding happy. Different religions have different interpretations of anthropomorphism, but in general, it is to show their God as something or someone else. In Greek mythology anthropomorphic animals are representations of their Gods. The Greeks show that the gods are different from us by attributing them to the features of being \u2018immortal and ageless.\u2019 [3]\n\nIn the anthropology of religion, the primary use of anthropomorphism is to embody the supernatural in human form. An example that is most defined in Western culture is in Judaism and Christianity, God has given human feelings of anger and jealousy or compassion and forgiveness. All human qualities that have been given to God in human settings that surround humanity, where these feelings are all emotions that humans have observed and none that we haven't. A functional analysis of anthropomorphism proposes that when the supernatural takes human form, it may be easier for people to relate to the concepts promoted by religion.\n\nThe term dualism was originally coined to denote co-eternal binary opposition. A meaning that is preserved in metaphysical and philosophical duality discourse but has been more generalized in other usages to indicate a system which contains two essential parts. Bitheism/Ditheism are two forms that both involve the two gods. Bitheism implies that the gods live in peace and Ditheism implies that their in opposition. This means that a Ditheism system would have one good and one evil god or one god that listened and helped and one that ignored. A god of life and one of death is another example. An example of a Bitheism system would be something like one god is of the sky and one of the wind. It is not always easy to distinguish between the two, like a sky god who brings storms and rain and an earth god who brings fertility and tremors. In a moral sense Christianity is a dualism religion with the opposition of God and Satan.[3]\n\nHercules Clubs the Hydra.\n\nEuhemerism is a rationalizing method of interpretation that was named after the Greek mythographer (compiler of myths) Euhemerus. Euhemerism is the idea that a real person can become a deity or a supernatural immortal being through the constant telling and re-telling of their stories that leads to the distortion of the actual story. For example, many people believe that Hercules was a real person but was deified through the stories of his life and after some time the embellished story became the accepted story. Therefore, Hercules was remembered as a deity. Euhemerism is the worship and belief in an ancestor or historical being who is thought to have supernatural power. Euhemerus believed that every Greek god was someone that actually lived long ago and was immortalized in myth through their actions in life.[4]\n\nVictoria's \"World's Tallest Totem Pole.\"\n\nTotemism is a religious practice in which a family is seen to have a close kinship with a particular spiritual being, such as an animal or plant. The entity, or totem, is thought to interact with a given kin group or an individual and to serve as their emblem or symbol.[4] Each spirit can be associated with an animal of some kind as a symbol of power or any other type of attribute. Masks are sometimes used as well to recreate the spirit or being. Usually seen through the use of Totem poles. with Native American families in traditional societies. Though this is usually seen in Native American traditional societies, this is something that is practiced all over the world. The term totem is derived from the Ojibwa word ototeman, meaning \u201cone\u2019s brother-sister kin.\u201d The grammatical root, ote, signifies a blood relationship between brothers and sisters who have the same mother and who may not marry each other.[5]\n\nThe zoomorphic deity Anubis.\n\nZoomorphism is the attribution of animal qualities or characteristics to a God. Many times it is mistaken for anthropomorphism, which attributes human characteristics or qualities to things that are not human. Zoomorphic supernaturals can be found in many religions, such as Hinduism with the deity Ganesha. Other examples include images of male deities with antlers that appeared in prehistoric art in countries as far apart as France, Australia, Canada, and China.\n\nAn example of zoomorphism can also be found Egyptian mythology with the god Anubis. In Egyptian mythology, Anubis was the god that protected the dead and brought them to the afterlife until Osiris took over the position and then Anubis became the gatekeeper of the dead. In Egyptian Mythology Anubis has the head of a jackal with the body of a human. His head is the color black because black is the color associated with death and the rotting color of flesh and the black soil of the Nile valley. The head of a jackal is significant because in ancient times jackals would hunt at the edges of deserts near the necropolis and cemeteries and ravage the desert graves throughout Egypt. Anubis was not the only zoomorphic god of Egypt. Horus was often drawn as a falcon on the shoulder of a ruler and he is typically depicted as having the head of a falcon when drawn alone. He was often used to show a ruler's connection to the Gods. Other examples in Egyptian mythology include Hathor, who is often depicted as a cow, and the warrior goddess Sekhmet, who is depicted as a lioness in human form.[6]\n\nHow Beliefs Are Expressed [ edit | edit source ]\n\nA myth is a commonly held but false belief; misconception, a traditional story, specifically about history of a people, often explaining a phenomenon that usually has supernatural beings or events. \u201cProduct of a man\u2019s emotion and imagination, acted upon by his surroundings.\u201d E. Clodd, Myths & Dreams (1885). Myths often have extraordinary characters or stories that seem impossible in the real world, but these feats and traits only seem possible because it explains some of the growth and development of civilizations. Myths are passed down stories or events within time. In turn, over periods of time myths tend to change slightly and also change within certain cultures. Myths tend to be expressed through rituals or completely through faith.\n\nOne of most well-known kinds of myths is creation myths, which describe how the world began, and often where people fit into this scheme. An example of this comes from the Haida, an indigenous nation located on the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. According to this myth, Sha-lana ruled a kingdom high in the clouds which looked down on a vast, empty sea that stretched in all directions. When Sha-lana\u2019s chief servant, the Raven, was cast out of the kingdom, he was so distraught that he flapped his wings in despair. By doing so, he stirred up the ocean, causing rocks to grow. He then created human beings from shells and introduced the sun and fire (which he stole from heaven). [8]\n\nOnce we understand the term myth and their reason for society we need to identify some characteristics of a myth. Not all of these characteristics are all absolute or all-encompassing.\n\n1. A story that is or was considered a true explanation of the natural world (and how it came to be).\n\n2. Characters are often non-human \u2013 e.g. gods, goddesses, supernatural beings, first people.\n\n3. Setting is a previous proto-world (somewhat like this one but also different).\n\n4. Plot may involve interplay between worlds (this world and previous or original world).\n\n5. Depicts events that bend or break natural laws (reflective of connection to previous world).\n\n6. Cosmogonic/metaphysical explanation of universe (formative of worldview).\n\n7. Functional: \u201cCharter for social action\u201d \u2013 conveys how to live: assumptions, values, core meanings of individuals, families, communities. 8. Evokes the presence of Mystery, the Unknown (has a \u201csacred\u201d tinge).\n\n9. Reflective and formative of basic structures (dualities: light/dark, good/bad, being/nothingness, raw/cooked, etc.) that we must reconcile. Dualities often mediated by characters in myths.\n\n10. Common theme: language helps order the world (cosmos); thus includes many lists, names, etc.\n\n11. Metaphoric, narrative consideration/explanation of \u201contology\u201d (study of being). Myths seek to answer, \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d \u201cWho are we?\u201d \u201cWhat is our purpose?\u201d etc. \u2013 life\u2019s fundamental questions.\n\n12. Sometimes: the narrative aspect of a significant ritual (core narrative of most important religious practices of society; fundamentally connected to belief system; sometimes the source of rituals)\n\n(Magoulick) https://faculty.gcsu.edu/custom-website/mary-magoulick/defmyth.htm\n\nMyths will never go away within society and cultures. Myths have placed a firm foundation on how people view the world. Some myths are still being used to explain things all across the world and within certain religious beliefs. Also, myths can be used as a teaching aid for kids or young adults. For example, campfire stories about wandering in the woods alone or picking up hitchhikers. Where you should strike to be like the hero and beware of the villains. Furthermore, allowing myths to be used daily within modern society.\n\nDoctrine is a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group. This section focuses on religious doctrine, which is the oral and written body of teachings of a religious group that is generally accepted by that group. Doctrine not only focuses on large scale teachings, but daily moral codes as well, like appropriate dress attire, or what social networks to involved in or separated from, and acceptable communication between individuals. Many types of religious doctrine play a key part in shaping a religion and its beliefs. Some examples are Roman Catholicism, Islam and First Baptist.\n\nRoman Catholic Doctrine\n\nThe Roman Catholic doctrine states that Jesus is the Son of God and was sent to die for the sins of the world. A person is granted eternal life only by accepting God into their lives. Additionally, penance and the Eucharist or Communion are required at least once a year. There is the trinity that consists of God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe B\u00edblia of Christian III of Denmark, the first Danish translation, is an example of a religious doctrine.\n\nIslamic Doctrine\n\nIslam doctrine states that Allah is the one true God, and Muhammad is his prophet. People who practice the Muslim faith are also required to perform The Five Pillars of Faith. These pillars are Kalima, the testimony of faith; Salat, praying five times a day; Zakat, giving alms; Sawm, fasting during the holy month of Ramadan; and Hajj, which is a pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nFirst Baptist Doctrine\n\nThe First Baptist Doctrine states that God is the Father for those who accept Jesus. God directly created the heavens and earth. Faith in Jesus is the only condition of salvation. Also, Jesus will return in the Rapture for sinners.\n\nDoctrine Determined by Culture [ edit | edit source ]\n\nChristina Toren is a professor at the University of St. Andrews and did a study of Christianity in Fiji. She found that people had morphed the Christina doctrine to suit their cultural needs. Through participant observation, Toren concluded ritual Christian observance was a crucial sign of a person's belief in God. Belief that a person can be saved was not based on a person\u2019s acceptance of God, but on their attendance to God, meaning a person must be seen praying or giving to the Church. Christians in Fiji are able to follow the doctrines of their religion while maintaining their cultural values.\n\nIn contrast, Western culture views doctrine differently. Westernized Christianity believes it is the acceptance of God, not just the attendance on God, that saves or ensures a place in Heaven. While there is still an emphasis on prayer and tithing, Westernized Christianity also emphasizes the importance of doing this in private as well.\n\nWhile these are not the complete set of doctrines for each of the types, they help paint a picture of each religion and their belief system. This in return, gives more insight into the inner workings of religion, and the cultures' impression of that religion. In this way, religious doctrines give anthropologists more information for why people believe what they do and how it affects their lives, which could change their anthropological view from etc to mic.\n\nSacred Spaces [ edit | edit source ]\n\nSacred space is any place that has a special significance to a group or an individual, normally linked to religious or other cultural dogmas of an emotional nature. Knowledge concerning these special places is often passed down through generations imbued with a sense of awe and reverence and plays a significant role in the identity of a people. Sacred spaces can help connect people as they anchor them to their cultural and religious traditions by providing a focus point where the divine and the mundane intersect and interact on a ritual level.\n\nSacred spaces can be public places of worship and pilgrimage as well as private spaces of ancestor veneration or personal spiritual refuges. It can be a place where something of significance has happened, a place said to be the point of origin of a group of people, their burial grounds, or even individual remains of ancestors. For example, the birth or death place of a person deemed especially blessed by a divinity can be made into a shrine and place of veneration for succeeding generations. Even areas that differ significantly from its surroundings can be viewed as sacred in the proper cultural context, such as a clearing in a dense forest, a lake, or unusual rock formations.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in Europe, South America, and the Middle East, many churches have been built on top of places sacred to older rites. This shows that the importance of these spaces in the cultural memory supersedes the religious significance. They are then usually absorbed, often intentionally, into the new religious traditions that arrive and settle into an area.\n\nSyncretism and Exclusivism [ edit | edit source ]\n\nAn image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nSyncretism is the process by which elements of one religion are assimilated into another religion, resulting in a change in the fundamental beliefs of those religions. This change does not always result in a total fusion of the religions but bits and pieces that one religion has adopted from another. In some cases, deities or influential figures are blended and called by one name but retain attributes, images, symbols and sometimes holy sites from the original religions.\n\nAn ethnographic example of syncretism is The Virgin of Guadalupe appearing to Juan Diego, a Nahuati speaking man, at Tepeyac hill near Mexico City. This was the site of the temple or the Aztec mother goddess Tohantizin. Mary requested a church be built on that site. When Juan Diego visited the Bishop and told him what Mary had said, the Bishop requested a sign that Juan Diego was telling the truth. Juan Diego returned to the hill where Mary told him to collect roses and bring them to the Bishop. When he returned to the bishop with roses in his timla, he dropped the roses at the feet of the Bishop, and on the tilma appeared the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This merged the pre-Christian goddess Tohantizin with the Catholic saint the Virgin of Guadalupe, creating a way through which the local people could practice their faith through a Catholic conduit.\n\nExclusivism is the view that one's own religion is inerrant and all others are in error. Exclusivism may also relate to practice, as in the way the gods, dietys, etc. are revered, rather than mere belief.\n\nAn example of exclusivism is the Ancient Greek Religion, which combined many local deities, such as nymphs and other divinities connected to nature, into the myth system of the Greek Pantheon. The Decree of Diopithes of 430BCE forbade the worship or introduction of and the belief in deities other than the Greek Pantheon and made it an offense punishable by death.\n\nAnother form of exclusivity can be seen through Christianity, by way that they do not promote syncretism, but instead contextualization. 21st Century Christians consider syncretism as a Christian exhibiting actions that do not reflect Christian beliefs, yet proclaim themselves as such. Christians discourage syncretism because Christians are supposed to live out their beliefs and lead a life that confirms their belief. Contextualization is when Christians associate with non-believers yet exhibit their beliefs, which is encouraged in place of syncretism.\n\nIn its more extreme form, religious exclusivism teaches that only the members of one religion or sect will reach Heaven, while others will be doomed to eternal damnation. In the past there was the saying in relation to the belief in God that was often used saying 'if you don't believe in God you will go to hell'. The opposite of religious exclusivism is universalism, the teaching that all will eventually share in the eternal blessings of God or the heavenly realm.\n\nReligious Specialists [ edit | edit source ]\n\nShaman from an equatorial Amazonian forest. June 2006\n\nA shaman is a part-time religious practitioner who acts as a medium between the human and spirit world. A shaman is believed to have the power to communicate with supernatural forces to intercede on the behalf of individuals or groups. The term shaman,as defined in Schultz and Lavenda,\"comes from the Tungus of eastern Siberia, where it refers to a religious specialist who has the ability to enter a trance through which he or she is believed to enter into direct contact with spiritual beings and guardian spirits for the purposes of healing, fertility, protection, and aggression, in a ritual setting .\" Shamans are generally thought of as healers, and yet they may also be feared or mistrusted by their own people because of their supernatural capabilities. Although having the power to converse with spirits may make them subject to suspicion, shamans are usually considered to be powerful, influential and valuable members of their society. There are even some tales among the peoples of North America about shamans succeeding in bringing the souls of the dead back to earth. Shamans are often prevalent among hunter-gatherer societies. A shaman must typically endure intense training which may take over a decade and involve the use of psychotropic drugs to attain an altered state of consciousness. Shamanic activity is said to take place while the shaman is in a trance. Typical methods for inducing a trance involve:\n\nfasting\n\nthe use of psychedelic mushrooms, peyote, cannabis, ayahuasca, salvia, tobacco\n\ndancing, singing or drumming to a hypnotic rhythm\n\ndeadly nightshade\n\nsweat lodges\n\nvision quests\n\nincense and plants such as morning glory, sage, and sweet grass\n\nShamans have been an integral part of hunter-gatherer societies for thousands of years. In prehistoric North America, for example, evidence of shamanic activity has been discovered in the form of rock art. Archaeologist David Whitley explains that \"shamans would often record their spiritual journeys symbolically by carving or painting rock surfaces in a sacred place. For instance, among the Numic people and in south-central California, rock art was created by shamans the morning after a vision was received, in order to preserve it for posterity. This was necessary because forgetting the details of a vision would result in the shaman's death or serious illness .\" Whitley also points out that, \"there is extensive and compelling ethnohistorical evidence from throughout far western North America that the rock art in this region was made after the conclusion of ASCs (altered state of consciousness) to portray shamans' and puberty initiates' visions of the supernatural realm .\" Shamanic art is often characterized by geometric patterns and or images of death, flight, drowning and sexual intercourse. Some researchers advocate that rock art is symbolic of the visual imagery and sensations a person experiences on hallucinogenic drugs. Shamanic activity is still practiced among North American tribes today, although it has drastically declined since European colonization (only around 500 of the 2,000 tribes remain that were present in the 17th century).[7][8]\n\nPriest and Priestess [ edit | edit source ]\n\nA priest or priestess, male and female respectively, is a person within a religion that has special authority to perform religious rituals. Different religions have different rules about men or women being excluded from the priesthood or to what degree. Priests and Priestesses differ from shamans in that it is often a full-time occupation. Being a priest is an institutional result through social aspiration and belief. Priests generally hold a higher position and status in society over those they preside over. A priest's power comes from the recognized influence of their religious organization and the hierarchy. A form of priesthood exists in many religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Shintoism, and Hinduism. For many religions being a priest or priestess is a life-long commitment and can be left only either voluntarily or by excommunication.\n\nPriest's main duties consist of-of guiding other believers in worship, knowledge of the religion, and spiritual guidance. They spread a word of their religious beliefs and mediate contact between individuals and their deity. These rites are carried out for the benefit of the believers such as with healing or absolution granted by the higher powers. The priests are connected to the deity of their beliefs through numerous different systems based upon the religion. Some believe there are oracles or prophets while others achieve a connection to higher forces through direct contact.\n\nOther societies in ancient history were affiliated with priests and priestesses. Ancient Egypt was among one of the first cultures to use priests to carry out sacred rituals rather than having a shaman. Becoming a Priest was often passed down from father and son rather than being appointed like many other cultures. Duties of Egyptian priest were to care for the gods and goddesses as well as attend to the needs of them. Unlike how the priest is seen today, as only being close to the gods and having the rapport with them, the job was more like an everyday job. The duties of the priest were more than just preaching and religious practices. They taught in schools, assisted artists and their works, and guided people through their problems. Egyptian priest believed in many ritual taboos, some of these were that the priest must be circumcised. Many priests also wouldn't wear wool or any animal products because it was seen as unclean. PRIESTS also would bath 3 to 4 times a day in sacred pools, and shave off all of their body hair.\n\nRoman Catholic priests in clerical clothing, Vienna, Austria, 2005\n\nPastors, Ministers, and Reverends [ edit | edit source ]\n\nPastors (also known as Ministers or Reverends) are generally known as ordained leaders within the Christian church. Unlike priests, pastors do not serve the role of mediating between a person/group and God; instead, they are in charge of leading and mentoring the church towards developing and deepening a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Not only do pastors help people develop a deep relationship with Jesus, but they also help with marriage counseling and other types of counseling for everybody and anybody in the church.\n\nIf a church is already developed but does not have a pastor (or minister/reverend) yet, often the other leaders or elders of the church will determine pastoral qualifications which they feel are vital to being a good leader of the congregation. Churches may look more closely at other qualifications of the pastor, in order to find a leader who will have the same core beliefs, values, and goals that the church has already set in place.\n\nQualifications to be a good pastor: Love for their people, A positive attitude and approach, people skills, an intimate relationship with god, priority on teaching, leadership and focus.[15]\n\nThe prophet Abraham of Judaism who was to sacrifice his son for God.\n\nThe basic definition of the word \"prophet\" is someone who has encountered the supernatural or divine. Prophets are often regarded as someone who has a role in their society in which they are able to promote change due to their messages and/or actions. However, the word \"prophet\" is extremely subjective, depending on which religious context it is being used in. To some, an individual may be considered an \"authentic prophet\", while to others that same individual may be considered a \"false prophet\"(regardless of their religious background). Some religions that include the use of prophets are Christianity, Judaism, Islam, the Sybilline and Delpich Oracles practiced in Ancient Greece, and Zoroaster.\n\nIn regards to the non-religious use of the word in the late 20th century, \"prophet\" refers to either people who are successful in analyzing the field of economics (the \"prophets of greed\") or to those who are social commentators that suggest there may be an escalating crisis within their environment and society due to others' lack of compassion (\"prophets of doom\"). In more modern times, however, the concept of \"prophets\" as a whole has come under scrutiny, passing off the visions that the prophets have as cases of Schizophrenia.\n\nJudaism\n\nProphets are heavily intertwined with Judaism. In this religion, a prophet is an individual who is selected by God to act as a representation. The prophets intend their messages to cause social changes among people, in order to conform to God's desires for humanity. Currently, the Talmud recognizes 48 male prophets and 7 women prophets. Non-Jewish prophets have a much lower status than Jewish prophets in the eyes of those who adhere to the Jewish traditions. A few prophets that are referenced in the Jewish religion are Abraham, Job, Samuel, Miriam, Moses, Isaiah, Ezekial and Malachi. Judaism is not only about being religious and reading the Talmud, there are many cultural aspects of Judaism. For example, Jewish principles consist around G-d and how you act to benefit others as yourself. It also has to do with the arrival of the Messiahhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam as well as the resurrection of the dead.\n\nIslam\n\nIslam was founded in 610 A.D and is a major world religion promulgated by the Prophet Mohammed. In Islam, Mohammed is considered the last of a series of prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus), and his message simultaneously consummates and completes the \u201crevelations\u201d attributed to earlier prophets. During Prophet Mohammed\u2019s time, polytheism reigned. His people were worshipping multiple gods. The religion taught by Mohammed to a small group of followers spread rapidly through the Middle East to Africa, Europe, the Indian subcontinent, the Malay Peninsula, and China. By the early 21st century there were more than 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. Although many sectarian movements have arisen within Islam, all Muslims are bound by a common faith and a sense of belonging to a single community. During one of Prophet Mohammed\u2019s trips as a trader, he had a vision from a being he perceived to be an angel who said, \u201cThere is only one God, and His name is Allah. Worship Him.\u201d \u201cIslam has seven fundamental beliefs that every Muslim must accept as a part of his/her religion (the Emanul Mufassil, or Faith Listed in Detail). Every Muslim learns this formula as a part of his/her religious training.\u201d *\n\nSt. Anthony the Great, considered the Father of Christian Monasticism\n\nThe term \"monk\" is used to describe a religious specialist who conditions the mind and body in favor of the spirit. This conditioning often includes seclusion from those who do not follow the same beliefs, abstinence, silence, and prayer. Monks were originally present solely in Christianity, but through a looser definition created by modern Westerners, the term has been applied to more religions (ex. Buddhism). The term is also often used interchangeably with the term \u201cascetic,\u201d which describes a greater focus on a life of abstinence, especially from sex, alcohol, and material wealth. In Ancient Greece, \u201cmonk\u201d referred to both men and women, as opposed to modern English, which uses the term \u201cnun\u201d to describe a female monk. Before becoming a monk in a monastery, nearly every monk must take some sort of vow, the most famous being the Roman Catholic vow of \u201cpoverty, chastity, and obedience.\u201d It is also common to have a hierarchy within a monastery through which monks can rise over time with the growth of spiritual excellence. Monks are often confused with friars. Although they are very similar, the main difference between the two terms is the inclusion of friars in community development and aid to the poor.\n\nWhile two of the more known types of monks are Orthodox and Roman Catholic, a recently created sect of monasteries is Anglican. Roman Catholic monks were common throughout England until King Henry VIII broke off from the Roman Catholic Church and later ordered the razing, demolishing or removal, of all monasteries. Centuries later during the 1840s, a Catholic revitalization movement began in England, prompting Anglicans to believe that a monastic life should become not only part of England again, but also part of the Anglican Church. John Henry Newman started the first Anglican monastery in Littlemore, near Oxford. Since then, Anglican monasteries have spread throughout England and have been known to lead a \u201cmixed\u201d existence by taking traditions from different religions and religious specialists. They daily recite the Divine Office in a choir and follow services from the Book of Common Prayer and Breviary. The also celebrate the Eucharist daily, and like Roman Catholic monks, take a vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The Anglican\u2019s service to the local community, as a friar might do, sets them apart from other monks. However, during the past century and especially the past few decades, Anglican monasteries have lost support and are becoming extinct.\n\nSaints are individuals who have died but, in Catholicism, have lead virtuous lives and have gone through the process of canonization. Canonization is the act when a Christian church declares that a person who has died was a saint, and said person is added to the list of recognized saints after an investigation of two miracles (one during the person\u2019s life and the second after their death). Christian saints are most commonly individuals of excessive holiness who had done amazing things in their lifetime and after. Commonly have followed in the teachings of Christ, though not all were Christian. The lives and teachings of saints has been used to further the examples of the a persons faith. They are essentially experts on the ways of holiness and their lives are to be used as examples making them in a way a religious expert. Some defining characteristics of saints are as follows:\n\nexemplary model\n\nextraordinary teacher\n\nwonder worker or source of benevolent power\n\nintercessor\n\nselfless, ascetic behavior\n\npossessor of a special and revelatory relation to the holy.[9]\n\nThere are currently over 10,000 saints. Many saints also have an associated item they are recognized for or something which they protect. Many saints also have a day associated for a feast in their honor. For the Catholic Church a saint is \"recognized\" by them, usually through the pope, as a saint and therefore is guaranteed passage into heaven. Then also Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam, Buddhism, Sufism all have saint like figures. A saint is known for doing a task that is for the better of others. Saints wants to be a good person and want to help others, as they do so in the name of a religion.\n\nWhat Are Rituals? [ edit | edit source ]\n\nAccording to Cultural Anthropology: A Perspective on the Human Condition; by Emily Shultz and Robert Lavenda, a ritual must fit into four categories. These four categories are:\n\na repetitive social practice\n\ndifferent from the routines of day to day life\n\nfollows some sort of ritual schema\n\nencoded in myth\n\nRituals often have its roots in myth and religion, tying itself to ancient practices between the divine and humans. However, a ritual does not have to be religious in nature; graduation ceremonies and birthday parties are rituals as well.[10] Religion can be defined as concepts or ideas and the practices associated with them. These practices hypothesize reality beyond that which is instantly available to the senses. Religion is a type of worldview, a collective picture of reality created by members of a society, and exists in many forms. As time passes and cultures change, religions evolve and change as well. In many cultures, religion is practiced through rituals.\n\nEvery society has their own rituals; an action performed as a common practice. Some of these practices can be a result of religion beliefs, or society ideas or expectations. For example, in the United States, when a person dies, family members and friends of the person attend a funeral; a ceremony in which they honor the dead person right before they are buried or cremated. Rituals can vary by geography, culture or personality and are practiced just as varied.\n\nAncestor worship [ edit | edit source ]\n\nConfucian temple in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\nAncestor Worship is defined as a religious or spiritual practice which revolves around the belief that the deceased continue to have a presence after they die, and contribute to the spiritual quality of their living relatives. Most religions have some form of ancestor worship, and consider the connection they have to their ancestors a significant component of their belief systems. This type of worship can often be confused with the worshiping of gods and deities, but it is an entirely separate practice. Many cultures see ancestor worship as non-religious; something that simply strengthens bonds with family and offers the proper respect for deceased loved ones. Others base a person\u2019s social status on who their ancestors were and how high on the social hierarchy they were in life. Ancestor worship is mainly performed so that, by placating one\u2019s ancestors, they may be taken care of in life and death. In return for the blessing by ancestors, worship insures that the ancestor\u2019s spirits may be at peace. Other rituals that can sometimes accompany this type of worship include: sacrifice, elaborate burial ceremonies and the preparation of specific food dishes.\n\nA couple at their traditional Thai wedding ceremony, an example of a commonly prevalent life-cycle ritual.\n\nJewish Mourning Rituals [ edit | edit source ]\n\nMany different religions or cultures have varying rituals following the death of a person. Burial and mourning rituals may differ even among the same religion. The following are commonly accepted burial and mourning practices in Judaism:\n\nAfter people have died, their eyes and mouths are closed. They are then placed on the floor and covered with a sheet, while a lit candle is placed by their head. The body is not to be left alone until burial, and it is seen as a good deed to sit with the body and to read psalms. Before burial the body is cleansed and clothed in a simple white shroud. The coffin is traditionally a simple cedar casket constructed without the use of metal due to the belief that people should decompose back into the earth, returning to dust after death.\n\nThe mourning process is divided into three sections, each increasing in time and lessening in intensity. The first period of mourning is called \"Shiva.\" This period of mourning lasts seven days starting from the day of burial. This mourning period applies to the immediate family of the decease. It involves mourners rending their clothes in an outward sign of mourning. This is often the time when friends prepare meals for the family of the deceased and sit with them to comfort them. A second period of mourning is called \"Sheloshim\" and takes place from the 7th day after the burial till the 30th day. During this time the immediate family of the deceased should not cut their hair, shave or attend parties. The third mourning period lasts until the anniversary of the death. During this time mourners do not attend public parties or celebrations, but can cut their hair. However, mourning may be suspended during important Jewish holidays in order to take place in the celebration and prayer.\n\nThe Components of Rites of Passage [ edit | edit source ]\n\nRites of passage are rituals in themselves. Rituals that mark a person's transition from one social state to another. So, the following components help in the ritual of passing from one state in life to another.\n\nThe Elders, Knower\u2019s or Guides: [that help the novice during the parts of or all throughout the liminal stages]\n\nThe Separation: from home or community; in route to the sacred place, in which the novice experiences his or her ordeal.\n\nThe Sacred Place: can be a recreation of the original archetype, it is the place where human and the spiritual will commune.\n\nTrials and Tribulations: are those hardships that the novice will endure, such as disorientation, chaos, training, deprivation, chanting and-or altered states of consciousness.\n\nRevelation: the revealing of inner meanings, the explanation of myths and transcendental knowing.\n\nSymbolic Death: the personal identity of the novice in the pre-liminal stage has been transformed, the old identity of the novice has died and no longer exists.\n\nResurrection and Rebirth: the novice has been recreated, with a new identity and status.\n\nReincorporation: where the novice returns home or enters into a new community, along with their new status.\n\nA celebration is often common to commemorate the completion of the rite.\n\nIn the 2002 film Whale Rider, a story of modern day rite of passage in a traditional Maori village and into the Whangara culture of modern day New Zealand. In the Whangara myth, their presence on the island dates back a thousand years to one single ancestor \u201cPaikea\u201d, who escaped death when his canoe capsized by riding the back of the whale to the village shore. Since then, the chiefly leadership role has been passed down to the firstborn male of the first born male, establishing a patriarchal society. \u201cPai\u201d is the film's 12-year-old protagonist, who after the death of her twin brother, and her mother at childbirth is now in her own mind, destined to be the next Whangara chief. Pai\u2019s father has exchanged his traditional culture for a life in Europe. In her quest to fulfill her destiny Pai faces the many challenges of this patriarchal tribe and all the elements of the rite of passage are in the plot of the film: The \u201celders\u201d or \u201cknowers\u201d: Pai\u2019s elders are her grandfather, her grandmother Nanny Flowers and her uncle Rawiri.\n\nThe separation: Pai\u2019s grandfather, \"Koro\" who is the tribal chief, blames her for the death of the chosen one and as the personification of the curse upon the tribe whose ancestral chain has been broken. The grandfather ignores her at home and further alienates Pai by forbidding her from participating in the warrior rituals with the rest of the male initiates.\n\nThe sacred place: There are two sacred places in this film; the first one is the unfinished chief\u2019s canoe of her father and the beach. The canoe stands above land on blocks. This is where Pai seeks refuge and calls out to her ancestors. She is visited by an elder, her grandmother, Nanny who unlike her grandfather, supports Pai\u2019s quest. The second sacred place is the beach, where she has her sacred encounter with the whale.\n\nTrials and tribulations: Pai sets out to seek the ways of the warrior by sneaking onto the training compound, only to be caught by her grandfather, and to be humiliated in front of her male initiates. In one very important scene, Pai is being honored at school and dedicates as a gesture, a traditional tribal performance to her grandfather. Her heart is broken when he fails to show up.\n\nRevelation: A truth is revealed to her Uncle Rawiri one afternoon, as Pai retrieves the lost sacred artifact (the whale tooth) of her grandfather. (The \u201ctooth\u201d was tossed into the bay, during a training session with the aspiring young chefs.) \u2018The one who gets my tooth back to me is the one\u201d \u201cKoro\u201d announces (Whale Rider, 2002.)\n\nSymbolic death: Near the end of the film, Pai has her sacred encounter with the beached whale. She climbs up onto the back of the lead whale, in an attempt to get the whale to re-enter the water. The whale responds and off she goes with the whale into deeper waters. She almost drowns and is hospitalized for a few days. This is Pai\u2019s symbolic death. It is during this time that her family is remorseful, especially her grandfather and reconsiders his point of view on who should be chief. Resurrection and rebirth: The film fades from a lonely scene of Pai in her hospital bed to a vibrant ceremony of Pai in the finished canoe of her father. With her grandfather by her side, the fully crewed canoe is ocean bound. Pai is dressed in traditional clothing and proudly wearing her grandfather\u2019s whale tooth necklace.\n\nReincorporation & Celebration: The film stops at the re-birth stage, but the last scene in the film doubles to fulfill the stage of celebration. It is safe to assume Pai will fulfill her duties as the new chief.\n\nA pilgrimage is a journey on behalf of ritual and religious belief. Often pilgrims try to obtain salvation of their soul through this physical journey. Most times the journey is to a shrine or a sacred place of importance to a person's faith. The institution of pilgrimage is evident in all world religions and was also important in the pagan religions of ancient Greece and Rome. Pilgrimages attract visitors from widely dispersed cultural backgrounds and physical locations, offering them the opportunity to be brought together because of the origins of their faith.\n\nRelevant to so many different cultural contexts, there is no single definition to describe to the act of pilgrimage. However, similarities are noticeable. Pilgrimage usually requires separation from the common everyday world, and in displaying that separation pilgrims may mark their new identity by wearing special clothes or abstaining from familiar comforts. Frequently, pilgrimages link sacred place with sacred time (i.e. The hajj always occurs on the 8th, 9th, and 10th days of the last month of the Muslim year).\n\nThe location of sacred sites and shrines often represent some great miracle or divine appearance, they may also appropriate the places that are holy to older or rival faiths. A factor that unites pilgrimage locations across different religions is the sense, variously expressed, that a given place can provide privileged access to a divine or transcendent state. Some of the most visited religious pilgrimage sites in the world are The Vatican in RomeRoman Catholic Church, the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico Catholic Church, and Mecca in Saudi Arabia Islam.\n\nPilgrim at Mecca.\n\nThe hajj is the fifth pillar of faith in the Islamic faith. It occurs on the 8th to 12th day of Dhul-Hijah, which is the 12th month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Members of the Islamic faith are encouraged to perform the hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in their lifetime. However, religious law allow exclusions on grounds of hardship. It is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world. Once a person has successfully completed the pilgrimage to Mecca he/she will receive the status of Hajji. Mecca is known by Muslims as the dwelling place of Adam after his expulsion from paradise and as the birthplace of Muhammad (570\u2013632), the prophet of Islam. Its yearly observance is held on the holy day Eid al-adh'ha as a memorial of Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son on Divine orders. Millions of Muslims from around the globe gather to perform practices which are must not for choice.\n\nPilgrims converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform the following rituals:\n\nThey walk counter-clockwise seven times around the Ka'abaa\" the black box\" which acts as the Muslim direction of prayer\n\nThey kiss the Black Stone in the corner of the Kaaba\n\nThey run back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah\n\nThey drink from the Zamzam Well\n\nThey go to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil\n\nThey throw stones in a ritual Stoning of the Devil.\n\nThey shave their heads and.\n\nThey perform a ritual of animal sacrifice.\n\nThey celebrate the three day global festival of Eid al-Adha.\n\nThe Huichol's Pilgrimage for Peyote [ edit | edit source ]\n\nThe Huichol are an indigenous group of maize (corn) farmers who reside in Sierra Madre of northern Mexico. Maize, along with deer and peyote-which the Huichol have linked together-are key ingredients for their way of life. Peyote is a rare cactus found in Mexico containing the chemical mescaline which induces hallucinogenic experiences if ingested properly. \"In Huichol religious thought, deer, maize, and peyote fit together: Maize cannot grow without deer blood; the deer cannot be sacrificed until after the peyote hunt; the ceremony that brings the rain cannot be held without peyote; and the peyote cannot be hunted until maize has been cleaned and sanctified.\" [11] Here, Schultz shows the connection between three of the most prominent cultural symbols for the Huichol; and of those items, peyote seems to act as the metaphorical backbone that triggers the Huichol's religious practice. However, a pilgrimage must be first undertaken to find the peyote; beginning an approximate 350 mile trek.\n\nThe location the pilgrims of Huichol are destined to find the peyote is a representation of \"Wirikuta, the original homeland where the First People, both deities and ancestors, once lived.\" [12] After they have \"captured\" the peyote plant -shooting two arrows into it- a shaman places peyote buttons, a piece of the plant located in the very center of the cactus, in each pilgrims mouth. The pilgrim then chews the peyote button to ingest the mescaline. The group then begins to gather peyote for the rest of the community.\n\nThe pilgrimage for peyote is an example of a culture actively holding onto their past. Instead of allowing their traditions to fall through the cracks, the Huichol use a holistic experience to preserve their religion and culture.[13]\n\nRituals of Inversion [ edit | edit source ]\n\nWhere the standards of everyday society are inverted and/or suspended, otherwise solid social codes are ignored. Two examples include Carnival and Halloween\n\nCarnival\n\nThe Carnival celebration occurs as a way to let loose before the strict rules of religion are set in place for lent. Typically, during Carnival everyday customs, rules, and habits of the community are inverted. Kings become servants, servants become kings, women dress as men and vice versa. The normal rules are overturned and indulgence becomes the rule. The body is granted freedom and obscenity are expected. Work and diets are omitted as people take to the streets to eat and party the days away. [23] A common thing to find during Carnival are masquerade balls, where men and women can wear masks of animals, creatures, and other people and in trying to figure out who the various attendees are, a risqu\u00e9 behavior is to be expected.\n\nCarnival is a festival traditionally held in Roman Catholic and, to a lesser extent, Eastern Orthodox societies. Regardless, many people participate in the carnival tradition today. The Brazilian Carnaval is one of the best-known celebrations today, but many cities and regions worldwide celebrate with large, popular, and days-long events. Festivities are held in hundreds of different countries worldwide.\n\nAn example of Carnival in the United States is Mardi Gras. Mardi Gras occurs in February right before the season of Lent. It was first introduced by the Le Moyne brothers, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to the territory of Louisiane which now includes the states Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Ever since its introduction Mardi Gras has been celebrated in that area of the United States for many years. It's common to see people wearing minimal clothing, flashing for beaded necklaces, and partying in the streets. Much of this behavior is overlooked by police who only react when it is taken to the extreme or is in the more \"family friendly\" areas.\n\nHalloween\n\nInversion on Halloween\n\nThe Celtic celebration Samhain, pronounced \u201csow-in\u201d, was the yearly culmination of the summer and harvest months and the beginning of the winter season marked by cold and death.[14] This \u201cFeast of the Sun\u201d was a time for all Celtic clans spanning across Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France to gather comfort and support while giving thanks to their many divine beings. Traditionally, large bonfires were built and people gathered to offer food and animals as sacrifice to the many deities. The Celts, pronounced Kelts, were polytheistic and offered gifts to specific Pagan Gods throughout the year. After the celebration had ended, people would relight the hearth in their homes with fire from the communal and sacred bonfire. This fire was thought to protect the people especially on the night of October 31, when the ghosts of the dead and otherworldly spirits were believed to return to earth.\n\nAll Saints in Poland\n\nAs Christianity and Roman rule began to spread through the Celtic lands, the holiday of Samhain or \u201cHalloween\u201d would be reinterpreted and designated as three holidays known as the Eve of All Saints\u2019, All Saints\u2019, and All Souls\u2019 Day. All Saints\u2019 Day, November 1, was created as a memorial for all saints and martyrs recognized by the Roman Catholic Church while All Souls\u2019 Day, November 2, is a day to honor the dead. These church-sanctioned holidays were similarly celebrated with bonfires, parades, and costumes consisting of saints, angels, and devils. The idea of Satan is a Christian concept that did not exist in pagan beliefs. In order to believe in one idea of ultimate evil (the Devil) the Celts would have had to believe in one concrete idea of ultimate good (God), but they worshiped several Gods. These traditions went under further construction as further generations began to relocate away from ancestral grounds.\n\nA sacrifice is an offering of something of value to an invisible force, and is done in many cultures and religions. To thank the invisible or cosmic forces in hopes of getting them to perform in a certain way or to gain merit in their religious group (Shultz & Lavenda, 2009) are some reasons to perform sacrifices. Sacrifices are also made out of selfless good deeds. The word \"sacrifice\" in Latin means \"to make sacred.\" Some examples of sacrifices are: Money, goods, services, animals and humans.\n\nIn pre-Columbian Mexico, the Aztecs sacrificed hundreds of humans in accordance with their ritual calendar in what is referred to as a human sacrifice.[15] It was thought that in order for the sun to shine everyday a certain amount of human hearts had to be sacrificed. The most common sacrifice was for the sun God, Huitzilopochtli, in which a knife is used to cut under the ribs to get to the human heart, which was then forcibly removed.\n\nDuring the Bronze period of ancient China, sacrifices were very common in the worship of ancestors. It was believed that when a person died their fate was decided by spirits. In order to invoke these spirits a beautiful bronze vessel was filled with wine and water as an offering. It was to be placed outside of the city during a time of need as a offering to the Heavens. This is an example of a goods sacrifice.[24]\n\nIn the Hmong Shamanism tradition, shamans would sacrifice animals to try and retrieve lost souls from the clutches of evil spirits. This was because animal souls were thought to be linked with human souls. In their tradition, evil spirits, known as dabs, would steal a persons soul and make them ill. When this happens, a chicken, pig, goat, or cow would be sacrificed and the animal's soul would be given to the evil spirits in exchange for the human soul, and this would make the person well again.[16]\n\nAltered States of Consciousness and Trance States [ edit | edit source ]\n\nAltered States of Consciousness(ASC\u2019s) is any state of awareness that deviate from ordinary waking consciousness. These hypnotic states may be induced by therapists, magicians, and/or spirit guides conducting seances, practicing meditation, or drug-induced hallucinatory experiences. This form of ritual and healing practice is typically not embraced by mainstream North American cultures as a part of typical, everyday life meaning altered states are not institutionalized.\n\nTrance States or Behaviors are more difficult to characterize. Other than an altered state an often inward oriented states of thought, there is most times a change in body image, emotional expression, rejuvenating feelings, and increased sense of self. \"There is evidence for shared physiological processes during different forms of trance as well as other ASCs... Trance states involve both amplification of certain internal cognitive processes as well as a decoupling of sensory processing.\" [17] Trance states usually involve a journey of the soul.\n\nTrance and Healing [ edit | edit source ]\n\nAll cultures have developed practices to heal the ill. In many cultures, when home remedies fail people often turn to a specialist of some sort. Many cultures including those exposed to Western medicine resort to \"magico-religious\" healers such as Shamans or spirit guides. Trances and various altered states of consciousness are mainly associated with shamanistic healing practices. Trance states can be induced by a variety of activities such as singing, drumming, dancing, chanting, fasting, sleep or sleep deprivation, and psychoactive drugs.After a person is in a trance state, they may collapse and have intense visual experiences and hallucinations while unconscious.\n\nExamples in History [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCannabis Sativa has been found in charred vessels and pouches in burial sites of Indo-European groups in the iron age such as the Dacians and the Scythians. It is believed that Cannabis Sativa and melilot(Melilotus sp.) was used for spiritual purification processes.\n\nIn the Southern Pacific, Maori shamans or religious specialists used \u201cMaori Kava\u201d(Macropiper excelsum) in religion based rituals. Polynesian groups like the Hawaiians and Tongans employed \u201cawa\u201d(Piper methysticum) to aid in communicating with late ancestors.\n\nThe Olmec used hallucinogens like the psychoactive venom found in the marine toad \u2018\u2019Bofus Marinus\u2019\u2019 parathyroid gland or used native tobacco (\u2018\u2019Nicotiana rustical\u2019\u2019). Bones from this extremely inedible toad have been discovered in trash deposits in San Lorenzo, while the kneeling figure known as \u2018Princeton Shaman\u2019 has one of these amphibians depicted on top of his head.\n\n[18]\n\nWorld Religions [ edit | edit source ]\n\nCelebration of Ganesh, Paris.\n\nFile:RadheShyam07.jpg Krishna (left), the eighth incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu or svayam bhagavan, with his consort Radha, worshiped as Radha Krishna across a number of traditions - traditional painting from the 1700s.\n\nHinduism [25] is also called Sanatana Dharma (Eternal religion) and Vaidika Dharma(Religion of the Vedas). Overall, adherents to Hinduism make up around 15% of the global population with over a billion members, and approximately 95% of those live in India. There are two major divisions within Hinduism: Vaishnavaism and Shivaism. Hindus believe in the repetitious Transmigration of the Soul. This is the transfer of one's soul after death into another body. This produces a continuing cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth through their many lifetimes that's called Samsara. Karma is the accumulated sum of ones good and bad deeds. Karma determines how you will live your next life. Through pure acts, thoughts and devotion, one can be reborn at a higher level. Eventually, one can escape samsara and achieve enlightenment. Bad deeds can cause a person to be reborn as a lower level, or even as an animal. Hindus body of scriptures is divided into Sruti and Smriti. Hindus organize their lives around certain activities (Purusharthas). These are called the Four aims of Hinduism or \"The doctrine of the fourfold end of life.\" They are:\n\nDharma: righteousness in their religious life. This is the most important of the three.\n\nArtha: success in their economic life; material prosperity.\n\nKama: gratification of the senses; pleasure; sensual, sexual, and mental enjoyment.\n\nThe main goal for the \"Nivritti,\" those who renounce the world. is:\n\nMoksa: Liberation from \"samsara.\" This is considered the supreme goal of mankind.\n\nHinduism is unique due to the fact that there is no real distinction between beings divine and human. In Hinduism humans can appear divine, and gods human. Also, unlike most religions such as Christianity, there are two supreme gods Vishnu and Shiva, who are equal in power. Hinduism also has other gods such as Lakshmi and Parvati, who are wives to Vishnu and Shiva. A staple of Hinduism is greetings. Many times Hindu\u2019s will bow their heads or raise heir hands as a sign of greeting and respect. It is this same raising of the hands which Hindu\u2019s praise and worships their gods. In most pictorials of the deities, the divine are often showing this same way of greeting, showing that the divine must show respect.[19]\n\nHinduism today is seen and argued as being polytheistic or monotheistic. In fact they would both be right. They do worship many deities, but they believe that each one is part of a whole unity. This is the panentheistic principle of Brahman: that all reality is a unity. The entire universe is one divine entity that is at one with the universe. Strictly speaking, most forms of Hinduism are henotheistic, meaning they recognize a single deity, and recognizes other gods and goddesses as facets, forms, manifestations, or aspects of that God.\n\nThe mantra Om mani padme hum written on rocks. Chanting mantras has been a feature of Ayurveda since the Atharvaveda\u2014a largely religious text\u2014was compiled.[20]\n\nViashnavism is a tradition of Hinduism distinguished from other schools by its worship of Vishnu or his manifestations, principally as Rama and Krishna, as the original and supreme God. Viashnavism is seen as monotheistic, since adherents to this form of Hinduism believe in one Supreme God. They believe that the living entity (or soul) is eternal, and that the purpose of life is to be free from reincarnation through spiritual practices. Bhakti Yoga (the spiritual practice of fostering loving devotion to God) is seen as the most direct method to achieve this. Desire is seen as the root of all evil, and thus a great deal of importance is assigned to the control of the senses, mainly through meditation and yoga practice. Material nature is seen as temporary, and is said to contain 3 modes: Goodness, Passion, and Ignorance. Desire, or lust, is said to be the result of material contact with the mode of passion, which is inevitably transformed into ignorance. The Supreme Personality Of Godhead is Omnipotent, Omniscient, and Omnibenevolent. He is male, and eternal. He is the Creator and the Destroyer. It is said that He created the material world by impregnating it with His eyes. The Material Universe is said to last 311 trillion 40 billion years and then die. At this point the devastation takes place, which means that the energy manifested by the Lord is again would up in Himself. Then Creation follows, and material energy is let loose once again. This cycle repeats infinitely...\n\nThe monotheistic worship of Vishnu was already well developed in the period of the Itihasas. Hopkins says \"Vishnuism, in a word, is the only cultivated native sectarian native religion of India. Vaishnavism is expounded in a part of the Mahabharata known as the Bhagavad Gita, which contains the words of Krishna, one the avatars of Vishnu.\n\nVaishnavism flourished in predominantly Shaivite South India during the seventh to tenth centuries CE, and is still commonplace, especially in Tamil Nadu, as a result of the twelve Alvars, saints who spread the sect to the common people with their devotional hymns. The temples which the Alvars visited or founded are now known as Divya Desams. Their poems in praise of Vishnu and Krishna in Tamil language are collectively known as Naalayira (Divya Prabandha).\n\nIn later years Vaishnava practices increased in popularity due to the influence of sages like Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Manavala Mamunigal, Vedanta Desika, Surdas, Tulsidas, Tyagaraja, and many others.\n\nLarge Vaishnava communities now exist throughout India, and particularly in Western Indian states, such as Rajasthan and Gujarat and north eastern state Assam. Important sites of pilgrimage for Vaishnavs include: Guruvayur Temple, Sri Rangam, Vrindavan, Mathura, Ayodhya, Tirupati, Puri, Mayapur and Dwarka. Krishna murti with Radha Bhaktivedanta Manor, Watford, England\n\nSince the 1900s Vaishnavism has spread from within India and is now practiced in many places around the globe, including America, Europe, Africa, Russia and South America. This is largely due to the growth of the ISKCON movement, founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966.\n\n1 ^ His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivadanta Swami Prabhupada., \"The Bhagavad Gita As It Is\"\n\n(Pujio) Bhai Sahib Norang Singh Ji doing Ard\u0101s.\n\nSikhism is a religion based in Punjab, India. It is the fifth-largest world religion. It is founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak Guru Nanak, along with ten successive Sikh Gurus. Guru Nanak founded the religion in 1469 CE. The principle belief of Sikhism is faith in Waheguru, which refers to God or Supreme Being. It means \"wonderful teacher\" in the Punjabi language. Sikhism promotes the idea of salvation through disciplined and personal meditation on the name and message of God. The concept of God in Sikhism is oneness with the entire universe and its spirit. Sikhs must eliminate ego to be able to find God. Sikhs do not believe in heaven or hell. \"Heaven\" can be attained on earth by being in tune with God while still alive. The suffering and pain caused by ego is seen as \"hell\" on earth. They believe that upon death, one merges back into universal nature. Sikhs view men and women as equal in the world. Women are expected to participate in the same religious life as men are. In Sikhism, every person is fully responsible for leading a moral life. Sikhs have no priestly class. Therefore, those who are educated in the ways of the religion are free to teach others about Sikhism, however, they cannot claim to have access to God. The only religious text of the Sikhs is Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, which contains hymns written by Guru Nanak and the other Gurus. Sikhs believe they have no right to impose their beliefs on others or to cajole members of other religions to convert. All individuals, regardless of race, gender, or nationality, are eligible to become Sikhs.\n\nZoroastrianism is one of the oldest recorded monotheistic religions. It originated from Persia and is based on the teachings of Zoroaster, a prophet of the early 5th century BCE. Many present day theologians point to Zoroastrianism as the influence for many of today's monotheistic world religions like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism etc. Zoroaster preached the following of Ahura Mazda which equates to God. Ahura Mazda is the supreme being of good whose enemy is represented by \"druj\" which is the power of evil. Zoroastrianism asks its followers simply to do good and to go through life with good thoughts, good words, and good deeds as these are necessary to create happiness and to keep the \"druj\" at bay. Pre-Islam Iranian governments promoted the teaching of Zoroastrianism during that time. Zoroastrianism was extremely popular to the Iranian people and was considered a state religion until it was marginalized by other religions in the 7th century. However it is still significant due to its history, the possible influence it had on other religions, and its followers who still are around today. Currently there are approximately 200,000 Zoroastrians in the world.\n\nGandhara Buddha (1st-2nd Century CE) at the Tokyo National Museum.\n\nBuddhism is a religion based on personal spiritual development with some atheistic characteristics formed by a man named Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly called \"the Buddha\" (which is actually a title that means \"the Enlightened One\"). He was believed to be born in Nepal around 563 BCE. Buddhism was formed after Siddhartha came to disagree with the practices and beliefs of asceticism. Born into a royal family, he became aware of suffering after taking a trip outside of the palace. Here, he encountered people suffering from disease, old age, and death. At the age of 29, having witnessed such sufferings, he decided to leave his life of comfort and become an ascetic in an attempt to find the solution to end suffering. For six years he ate only tiny handfuls of rice each day and did little besides meditating, in an attempt to free himself of bodily concerns. It is said that after those six years, he ran into a little girl by a river, who offered him a bowl of rice to feed his famished body. At this same time, a man (so the story goes) was traveling down the river playing a stringed instrument. Here Siddhartha came to a realization, which he later explained as: \"Look at the lute. If its strings are too tight, they will break. If they are too loose, it cannot be played. Only by tuning them neither too tight nor too lose will the lute work.\" The Buddha later called this the Middle Way, the path of neither giving in to one's desires nor walking the line of extreme self-deprivation. After this realization, he broke away from his ascetic practices and sat under a tree (latterly called the Bo-tree, or Tree of Enlightenment), entering a deep meditation. This act is what is known as Jiriki or self-power. At the age of 35, after meditating for 49 days, he attained Enlightenment and was henceforth called \"the Buddha\" . After attaining enlightenment, he went on to help others reach nirvana. During his experience of enlightenment, Siddhartha came to realize the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Buddhism also splits into three subcategories, the first being Theravada Buddhism (which is found in South East Asia), Mahayana Buddhism (found throughout East Asia), and Vajrayana Buddhism (this includes many subcategories of Buddhism including Tantric Buddhism and Mantrayana)[21] . Zen is another school of Buddhist thought that developed in China during the 7th century, by an Indian Buddhist monk named Bodhidharma, from a combination of Mahayana Buddhism and Daoism. Practitioners of Zen aim to see the world as it truly is, without lasting thoughts or feelings but instead as a constant stream of unconnected thoughts. Zen is predominantly practiced in China, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea but in recent years has gained popularity in the western world. It is estimated that there are currently 365 million people who practice Buddhism today. This makes the religion the fourth largest in the world.[1]\n\nConcepts of Buddhism\n\nFour Noble Truths and The Eightfold Paths\n\nThe Dharma Wheel is often used to symbolize the Eightfold Path\n\nThe Four Noble Truths deal with the nature, origin, cessation, and path to the cessation of suffering. These four things are the core of Siddhartha's message, and presumably expresses what he learned while meditating under the Bo-tree.\n\nLife leads to suffering\n\nSuffering is a result of a craving of worldly pleasures in any form\n\nSuffering ends when this desire is gone\n\nWhen one follows the path described the Buddha, one can be relieved of desire and achieve enlightenment\n\nThe Eightfold Path is part of the Fourth Noble Truth, or the path leading to the cessation of suffering. It is referred to as the Eightfold Path because of the eight categories or divisions that it is composed of, those being:1. Right Understanding\n\nRight Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration\n\nThese paths are used to avoid two extremes: one extreme being the search for happiness through the pleasures of the senses; the other being the search for happiness through self-mortification in different forms of ascentism peterson9949 (talk). It should not be thought that the categories should be followed by the numerical order above, but should instead be used more or less simultaneously, according to the capacity of each individual.\n\nThe Concept of Rebirth and Samsara\n\nThe Tibetan Wheel of Life containing the different levels of rebirth as well as Samsara\n\nLike Hinduism, Buddhists believe in a rebirth of oneself. Rebirth is the idea that one goes through a series of lifetimes. When one dies, he or she moves to another body. However, Buddhism rejects the idea of an eternal soul such as in Christianity. It is an ever-changing process that is regulated by karma, the laws of cause and effect. Karma dictates the context of one\u2019s rebirth. Besides the immediate effect of an action in this world, karma helps dictate the rebirth process. Possessing good karma will allow for a better realm of rebirth than bad karma. Buddhism says that the cycle of rebirth takes within one of five or six realms depending on the type of Buddhism one practices and within these realms, there are 31 planes of existence.\n\nNaraka Beings: those who live in one of the many hells of Buddhism\n\nAnimals: They live among humans but are separate kind of life\n\nPreta: Shares place with humans but is often invisible, (hungry ghosts)\n\nHuman beings: a realm in which Nirvana is attainable\n\nAsuras: demons, titans, antigods, and lowly deities and is not recognized by some schools of Buddhism\n\nDevas: gods, deities, spirits, and angels.[22]\n\nSamsara is a Buddhist concept that directly related to this cycle of rebirth. It is the world in which the human race currently resides and in which there is much pain, suffering, and sorrow. One can only leave Samsara once they have reached nirvana.\n\nThe Ten Fetters is a series of items that keep a person in Samsara.If one possesses any of these, he or she will remain in Samsara. One, according to Buddhist thought, should strive to overcome these things.[23]\n\nBelief in a separate individuality or personality\n\nDoubt without desire for satisfaction\n\nAttachment to rules/rituals without a critical perspective\n\nCraving of sensuous things\n\nWishing harm or ill will on others.\n\nDesire for more material items or greater material existence\n\nDesire for non-material existence\n\nEgo\n\nRestlessness\n\nIgnorance[24]\n\nPilgrimage in Buddhism\n\nLumbini, The birthplace of Siddartha Gautama\n\nBuddhists take part in religious travels to sacred sites called pilgrimages. Similar to the travels to Mecca in Islam or the Vatican in Catholicism, Buddhists travel to four main sites in Northern India and Southern Nepal. These sites are significant places in the life of Siddartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. Gautama taught that these four main sites would make his followers feel a sense of spiritual urgency, as they coincide with the life and spiritually significant experiences of the religious leader. The four significant places are as follows: Lumbini, where Siddartha Gautama was born, Bodh Gaya, where he was enlightened, Sarnath, where he gave his first teaching, and finally Kusinara, where Siddartha died.\n\nThe sacred site Lumbini, the birthplace of Siddartha Gautama is surrounded by an area called a monastic zone, or, an area in which only monasteries can be built. The site is visited by many looking to meditate and chant near the exact place of Siddartha's birth, and the sacred Bodhi tree. The site was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\n\nLumbini, The Sacred Bodhi Tree at the birthplace of Siddartha Gautama\n\nTraveling on a pilgrimage is an act Buddhists believe will earn them merit for future incarnations. The farther and longer the journey, and the more humble the mind of the person traveling, the greater the merit will be. Going on a pilgrimage is also a way for Buddhists to practice becoming free from worldly attachments. They might aim to no long feel so attached to an old home, to old relationships, or too old desires. By dedicating oneself to the pursuit of a holy place in a humble mindset, one comes closer to walking the Eightfold Path. The traveling of many monks over the centuries is attributed as one of the main causes of the spread of Buddhism.[25]\n\nThe Dalai Lama\n\nThe Current Dalai Lama, photo by Luca Galuzzi 2007\n\nThe Dalai Lama is the head monk of Tibetan Buddhism and traditionally has been responsible for the governing of Tibet. However, the Chinese government established control in 1959. The Dalai Lama's official residence before 1959 was the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. However, after his exile, the 14th Dalai Lama sought refuge in India. The then Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was instrumental in granting safe refuge to the Dalai Lama and his fellow Tibetans. The Dalai Lama has since lived in exile in Dharamsala, in the state of Himachal Pradesh in northern India, where the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government-in-exile) is also established.\n\nThe Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, which is the largest and most influential tradition in Tibet. The institution of the Dalai Lama is a relatively recent one. There have been only 14 Dalai Lamas in the history of Buddhism, and the first and second Dalai Lamas were given the title posthumously.\n\nAccording to Buddhist belief, the current Dalai Lama is a reincarnation of a past lama who decided to be reborn again to continue his important work. The Dalai Lama essentially chooses to be reborn again instead of passing onward. A person who decides to be continually reborn is known as Tulku. Buddhists believe that the first tulku in this reincarnation was Gedun Drub, who lived from 1391\u20131474, and the second was Gendun Gyatso. However, the name Dalai Lama meaning Ocean of Wisdom was not conferred until the third reincarnation in the form of Sonam Gyatso in 1578. The current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso.\n\n\"Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural & spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity\" A widely cited, but apparently spurious quotation attributed to Albert Einstein [26]\n\nCommonly translated as \"The Way of the Gods,\" by combining the borrowed Chinese ideograms for 'gods' or 'spirits' (shin) and 'philosophical path' (t\u014d).[27]\n\nShinto is a form of animism that is the indigenous religion of Japan. It is a form of worship that is based upon nature. It teaches that every living or non living object in the world contains \u201ckami\u201d. \u201cKami\u201d can be most easily explained as an inner spirit or god within that object. So any tree, rock, car, dog, cat, person, or anything else has a Kami. Kami also means 'paper' in Japanese, so the usage of it is a common theme in marking shrines and divine objects. In Japan, it typically is practiced alongside Japanese Buddhism. Since Buddhism focuses primarily on the afterlife, Shintoism focuses on the present.[28] Unlike most other religions, Shinto has no real founder, no written scriptures, no body of religious law, and only a very loosely-organized priesthood. [29]\n\nThere are 4 affirmations to Shintoism that include 1)Tradition and family, 2)Respect of nature, 3)Physical cleanliness, 4)and the celebration of festivals (matsuri) for the various kami.[30]\n\nShinto is centered on `KAMI' (innumerable gods or spirits) of places, families, communities who interact with us. Kami are:\n\n\u2022 Mostly associated with some particular place - a grove of impressive trees, a waterfall, a town, village, valley, etc. The kami are believed to move among their shrines and to reside in a small house-shaped box built for them at the shrine (or jinja).\n\n\u2022 Usually beneficent, but not always. Occasionally they may be vengeful.\n\n\u2022 Many kami are the spirits of deceased ancestors, emperors, prominent military figures, important animals (tiger, fox, etc), waterfalls, forests, distinctive rocks, rivers, etc.\n\n\u2022 No `allpowerful god' in Shinto - only lots of little ones. Each has limitations. But the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, is dominant however. She gave birth to the first emperor. Her main shrine is called Jingu and is located in a forest at Ise in western Japan.\n\n\u2022 No concrete visual representation. No paintings, sculptures, masks, etc. of the kami themselves. Only Buddhist temples use physical representations (in painting and sculpture) of the Buddha and the Boddhisatvas.\n\n\u2022 Religious ceremonies are attempts to please and entertain the kami. For example, sumo wrestling matches and the many local festivals, called matsuri, began as means of entertaining local kami.[29]\n\nJudaism is the first monotheistic religion and is a product of Abraham\u2019s covenant with God. Judaism is based on the laws and principles of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). Tanakh is a Hebrew acronym for Torah (\u201cTeachings\u201d), Nevi\u2019im (\u201cProphets\u201d) and Ketuvim (\u201cWritings\u201d). Within the Tanakh there are a total of twenty-four books. According to Judaism, God created a covenant with the Israelites when Moses brought the Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai. Judaism\u2019s values stand on three things: Torah and the commandments, the study and doing of good deeds (mitzvah). Their Holy land is Israel, but their perceived right to the land is great source of controversy between the Jews and their Muslim neighbors.\n\nBecause of their banishment from the land of Israel in ancient times, Jews now live all over the world. There are approximately 14 million practicing and secular Jews today. The United States is home to around 5,602,000 Jews, New York alone has some 1,654,000 Jews, and Israel has about 4,390,000 Jews.[31] Since 250 AD, Jews have been kicked out of 109 countries total. Throughout history, many Christians have blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus. During the high Middle Ages, Jews were expelled, massacred, and forced to convert to Christianity. In the mid-14th century, as the Black Death devastated Europe, rumors spread that the Jews had caused the disease by poisoning the wells. In Strasbourg, a city that hadn't yet been affected by the plague, 900 Jews were burnt alive. Jews would face much more persecution throughout the next few centuries, such as the Holocaust that lead to the death of 6 million Jews and the displacement of most of Europe's Jews. After such a tragedy, the Jews saw to the formation of a recognized Jewish State known as Israel in 1948.\n\nA Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a kippah skullcap, prayer shawl and tefillin.\n\nSects/Branches of Judaism [ edit | edit source ]\n\nThere are three main sects in Judaism: Orthodox, Conservative and Reform. Jewish men and women wear special clothing during times of prayer and other religious practices. While praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, a round brimless (for the most part) skull cap called a kippah or yarmulke is worn. The tzitzit are special knotted tassels that are worn on the four corners of a prayer shawl; different Jewish customs explain when these should be worn. Tefillin are two square leather boxes that contain bible verses and are worn during the weekday morning prayers. A kittel is a white knee-length overgarment that is worn by prayer leaders on the high holidays and the head of the household wears this at the Passover seder. The tallit is similar to the kittel and is worn in similar situations as well as by boys and girls becoming bar/bat mitzvahs when they turn 13 and become adults in the eyes of the Jewish community.\n\nOrthodox Jews traditionally pray three times a day, and on holidays a fourth prayer is added. Prayers are typically recited throughout the day upon waking, and before and after eating a meal. Although most prayers can be recited in solitude, communal prayer is often preferred. In many reform temples, musical accompaniment such as organs and choirs are used. Further, a fifth prayer service, Ne'ilah (\"closing\"), is recited only on Yom Kippur.[32]\n\nThe Jewish religion can be categorized into six major branches in America. They are the Reform, the Conservative, the Modern Orthodox, the Re-constructionist and the Ultra Orthodox or Haredim, which breaks into two separate groups called the Hasidim and the Mitnaggedim. Reform is the largest branch in America and is the most liberal. Between 1885-1930, immigrating Jews decided that Jewish law is a personal idea and not a requirement. These changes were made in an attempt to keep Jewish people Jewish as there was no longer a pressure to remain Jewish once people assimilated to American culture. The Reform, Conservative, Modern Orthodox and Re-constructionist function as denominations or different branches of the same religion. The Haredim are a community based group and culturally connected. These are those who live in strict adherence to the Halacha.[33]\n\nThe cross is a common symbol for Christians and Christianity.\n\nOne of five major world religions, Christianity is a monotheistic religion made up of roughly 2 billion people,[34] and is considered one of the Abrahamic religions, which originally began as a movement from Judaism. Where Christianity and Judaism depart from one another is in the Christian belief that Jesus of Nazareth (Christ or simply Jesus) was divine and was literally the \"Son of God.\" Christians believe that God sent His \"one and only son\" to Earth to die as a perfect sacrifice for the sins of humanity, in order to \"pay\" the price of sin and death. Jesus mainly taught about God's love and mercy, but also taught about forgiveness, charity, and treating yourself well.[35] Jesus was crucified on a cross by the Romans in His act of sacrifice. Christians also believe that Jesus rose from the dead, and when He did, He allowed the Holy Spirit to \"enter\" into anyone who chose to believe in Him so that they may have eternal life with God in Heaven after their physical bodies die on earth. There are many branches of Christianity that are not the same. Christians believe in one God and one God only, it is just how they express their love and grace for him. This ranges differently from the vast amount of Christian groups.\n\nThe Ten Commandments, which are found in the Old Testament, Exodus Chapter 20 are the basis for the Christian faith, but when Jesus Christ came to earth as a man. He came not to destroy those laws (Ten Commandments), but to fulfill those laws as stated in Matthew 5:17-48.[36] He fulfilled those laws by showing perfect love through dying on the cross, which was the ultimate sacrifice, and abiding by those laws. Therefore, fulfilling the law is Jesus Christ living out the laws perfectly, so that his followers will also be able to do the same.[37]\n\nThe Ten Commandments are as follows: \"And God spoke all these words, saying: 'I am the LORD your God\u2026 'You shall have no other gods before Me.' 'You shall not make for yourself a carved image--any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.' 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.' 'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.' 'Honor your father and your mother.' 'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.' 'You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.'\n\nChristians use the bible as a tool to communicate to God. The bible is where Christians get all of their wisdom on how to live their life for God. Another name for the bible is the \"Word of God\". Another way Christians practice their faith is by going to church. The church is somewhere Christians can go to worship and dive deeper into God's word. The church can also be a safe place for people to go if they are feeling any sort of pain. The main way Christians practice their faith and live for God is to show everyone God's love.\n\nOne way of connecting to God is though the ritual of holy communion where participants consume symbolic representations of the body and blood of Christ. This is an example of unity of consciousness in which the consumption of the body (bread) and blood (wine) brings the participant and God closer together by letting God become one with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crucifix\n\nCatholicism, made up of about 1.2 billion members[38] is a form of Christianity that focuses on understanding and commitment to tradition; the believers live a Christian lifestyle but obtain a catholic perspective. Catholics believe that people are good but corrupted by a sin nature and the only way to redeem people from that sin is divine grace from the sacraments. However, unlike non-Catholic Christianity, some Catholic sects do not believe that salvation is obtained solely through accepting Jesus Christ as ones Savior, but believe that good works are required to obtain salvation and are a visible manifestation of faith in Christ.\n\nCatholic Churches are unified under the Pope in Rome. Under him are Cardinals, Arch bishops, Bishops, and Priests. Priests preside over individual churches also known as parishes. Catholicism entails that God created everything, nothing is outside of God\u2019s jurisdiction and that includes the believers\u2019 thoughts, word, and deed all of the time. Although there is very important aspect of Christianity that believes in Free Will. The term free will implies that although God rules all things, he wants humans to make their own choices, we can choose to sin or to turn away from sin. Unlike Non denominational Christians, Catholics are involved in using the Sacraments. Sacraments of the Catholic belief consists of: Baptism, Holy Eucharist, Reconciliation, Confirmation, Marriage, Anointing of the sick, and also Holy Orders.\n\nThe Vatican is located in the Vatican City, a sovereign country of which the Pope is the sovereign leader. The history of the Catholic Church starts from apostolic times making it the worlds oldest and largest institution covering nearly 2,000 years.\n\nThe Pope is recognized by Catholics of the world as the successor to Saint Peter who was an early leader of the Christian church and had a large part in writing the New Testament. Peter was the first official Bishop of Rome, making all of his successors superior to any other worldly Bishop. The current pope is Pope Benedict XVI, making him the current leader of the Catholic Church. He was elected April 19, 2005, and took office April 24th 2005. He succeeded Pope John Paul II.\n\nProtestantism began in Europe during the 16th century with the Protestant Reformation, which began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church. The name Protestant comes from those who \"protested\" against the Catholic Church and therefore were named Protestant by the church. It is believed that the Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther when he published his Ninety-Five Theses against the Catholic Church. This religion then moved to the Americas during colonization by the English. The religion originated out of the belief that the covenant was broken by Adam and Eve and was then recovered by Jesus. So they believe that they owe God their obedience do to the recovery of the covenant. When things in their lives are going well it shows Protestants that they are fulfilling the covenant with God. It is the opposite when things in their life begin to go wrong, they must not be fulfilling the covenant. Basic beliefs consist of the Bible holding all truths and that God has a set hierarchy; God, King, fathers/husbands, wives, children, and lastly animals. Another basic belief is that the individual must subject themselves for the good of the whole, because even though there is a set hierarchy each individual needs each other for the strength as one. This being said everyone in their society has set re"}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-theology/", "page_content": "First published Mon Oct 24, 2011; substantive revision Tue Nov 16, 2021\n\nFurthermore, even though most theological interactions with cosmology have taken place within the Christian tradition, it has rarely\u2014if ever\u2014been the case that the defining feature of Christianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any explicit role in these interactions.\n\nOur subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to the case of western monotheism\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\u2014and even more specifically to variants of Christianity. Even so, we note a wide range of diversity among Christian beliefs and Christian attitudes towards science in general, and towards scientific cosmology in particular. At one extreme, we find ultra-traditional versions of Christianity that emphasize literal interpretation of Scripture, and that often interpret theological doctrines in terms of ancient Greek philosophical categories (e.g., God as eternal, unchangeable, etc.). Even within this more traditional camp, we find differences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount of flexibility with regard to traditional theological doctrines. (e.g., there are ongoing debates among traditional theologians about the relation of God to time.) At another extreme, we find more recent incarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on ideas from German idealism and/or process philosophy. There are also subtle, but not negligible, differences in attitude among Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not think of theism as one fixed set of doctrines that is simply consistent or inconsistent with scientific cosmology.\n\nBut the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of cosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the demarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific cosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is formalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What has this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often theistic) cosmologies? Has the new cosmology replaced the older cosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older cosmologies?\n\nAs long as humans have been trying to make sense of the universe, they have been proposing cosmological theories. Furthermore, the notion of a deity often plays a central role in these cosmological theories. According to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole creator and sustainer of the universe.\n\nChristianity and other monotheistic religions (Islam and Judaism) assume a transcendent and sovereign God who created the universe and continually maintains its existence. The world only exists because of an ultimate and supernatural cause which is, as Newton said, \u201cnot blind and fortuitous, but very well skilled in Mechanicks and Geometry\u201d (Cohen 1978, 282). Whether in a general philosophical sense or in a scientific sense, cosmology has always been part of theism, but it is only relatively recently that cosmology based on physics and astronomy has entered the discussion concerning the existence and role of God. A limited application of physics to the study of the universe can be found in the second half of the nineteenth century when the cosmological consequences of the law of entropy increase were eagerly discussed in relation to the Christian doctrines of a world with a beginning and end in time. However, physical cosmology is essentially a twentieth century science which emerged as a result of the discovery about 1930 that the universe is in a state of expansion that possibly started a finite time ago. Cosmology as a subdiscipline of physics differs in some respects from mathematical, philosophical and classical observational cosmology, but of course the different approaches are in constant interaction. In a modern sense, physical cosmology became established after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 which quickly turned the hot big bang model into the standard model of the universe. Jim Peebles\u2019 Physical Cosmology of 1971, possibly the first book with this title, may be taken as the beginning of modern physical cosmology.\n\nAlthough physical cosmology based on general relativity theory and elementary particle physics is thus a modern science, many of the theologically relevant questions related to current cosmology are old. Did the universe come into existence a finite time ago? Will it come to an end? Why are the cosmic evolution and the laws of nature of just such a kind that they permit intelligent life to exist? These and other questions of obvious relevance to theism are currently being discussed in the light of the most recent cosmological theories and observations, but the questions themselves (and, indeed, many of the answers) were familiar to medieval philosophers and theologians. This is also the case with the question that is sometimes considered the ultimate one: Why is there a cosmos? There is no reason to expect that today\u2019s advanced physical cosmology, or the even more advanced of tomorrow, will provide final answers that satisfy theists and atheists alike.\n\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity shows that the structure of spacetime is itself a dynamical variable, subject to causal influence by the material constituents of the universe. Indeed, Einstein immediately saw the potential to apply general relativity to large-scale cosmological questions. The first cosmological model of Einstein (1917) described a static universe, i.e. one whose spatial geometry is constant over time. However, Einstein\u2019s static universe was empirically inadequate: it could not account for the redshift data gathered by Edwin Hubble and others in the 1920s. The redshift data indicated that distant stars are moving away from us, and moving faster in direct proportion to their distance. Thus, the data indicated an expanding universe.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a number of cosmological models of general relativity were proposed that predict the expansion of the universe. The most accurate account of the data is given by the family of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The key characteristic of these models is that space is homogeneous, and hence isotropic (i.e. looks the same in all directions). From the homogeneity assumption, it follows that the entire 4-dimensional spacetime divides neatly into a stack of 3-dimensional \u201cspaces\u201d each of which has constant curvature. The three possibilities for this curvature correspond to the three classical geometries: Euclidean (flat), spherical (positive), or hyperbolic (negative). In a given FRW spacetime, the geometry of space at one time is related to the geometry at any other time by means of a scale factor S(t). Indeed, pick a reference time T, such as 2021, pick two reference galaxies, and let d(T) be the distance between these galaxies at time T. Then the distance between the two galaxies at any other time t is given by d(t)=S(t)d(T), where we set S(T)=1. This number S(t) is called the scale factor, and its behavior encodes the dynamics of a FRW universe.\n\nIn those FRW spacetimes that can reasonably be thought to model our cosmos (e.g., those with massive objects), the time parameter t has an absolute lower bound t 0 . In particular, as t decreases towards t 0 , the scale parameter S(t) goes to zero. What happens when t reaches t 0 ? In short, these models cannot say what happens, because there are no points of spacetime with time coordinate t 0 . That is, t 0 is an ideal point that is never reached: the universe exists at all times after t 0 , but not before or at time t 0 . A spacetime model with this feature is called singular, and the ideal point that is never reached is called a singularity. In other words, the big bang is a singularity in a FRW spacetime.\n\nThe FRW spacetimes are extremely accurate descriptions of the large scale structure of our universe. Since these models describe a universe with a finite lifetime, it is reasonable to conclude that the universe has not always existed.\n\nBut many physicists and philosophers hesitate to draw this conclusion. In fact, the standard view in the 1950s and early 1960s was that the singularities of the FRW models were consequences of false idealizing assumptions, namely assumptions of perfect isotropy and homogeneity. But this escape route from singularities was definitely closed when Robert Geroch, Stephen Hawking, and Roger Penrose proved the \u201csingularity theorems,\u201d according to which almost all spacetimes are singular, and in particular, almost all cosmological models describe a finitely old universe.\n\nA number of theists take the past-singular nature of cosmological models as confirmation of the claim that God created the universe ex nihilo. The list of advocates of this \u201cbig bang theology\u201d includes Pope Pius XII, Francis Collins (director, US National Institutes of Health), and apologists William Lane Craig and Hugh Ross. And indeed, big bang cosmology does provide prima facie support for theism. After all, big bang cosmology says that the universe has a finite age, and (traditional) theism says that God created the universe out of nothing. Does big bang cosmology not confirm traditional theism? We give several reasons to be cautious about such claims.\n\nAdvocates of big bang theology are most interested in the claim that the universe is finitely old. Thus, the chain of inferential support should run as follows:\n\nBig Bang Model \u2192 supports \u2192 Universe Finitely Old \u2192 supports \u2192 Theism\n\nBefore discussing the first supposed inferential relation, we note that not all theists are committed to the claim that the universe is finitely old. For example, Aquinas claims (in several places, including the Summa Theologica) that Reason cannot demonstrate the finitude of the universe. But Aquinas also thinks that Reason can demonstrate the existence of God; therefore Aquinas does not think that the very concept of God as creator implies that the universe is finitely old. (Contrary to some contemporary theologians, Aquinas claims that a Christian theist should believe that the universe is finitely old. For Aquinas, the finite age of the universe is a revealed doctrine, like the divinity of Christ.)\n\nContemporary theologians Arthur Peacocke and Ian Barbour also claim that the doctrine of the \u201ccreation\u201d of the universe is best interpreted as one of the universe\u2019s timeless dependence on God, and that such dependence does not demand a temporal creation event. This is also the view of William Stoeger (2010), a Jesuit priest and cosmologist, who argues that scientific cosmology can purify theology but never be in conflict with what theology legitimately asserts. For the remainder of this article, we will not discuss further the question of whether theism requires, or strongly supports, the claim that the universe is finitely old. (Arguments for this claim are assessed in (Copan & Craig 2004).) For now we focus on versions of theism that are committed\u2014in a perhaps naive way\u2014to creation ex nihilo. Even on this understanding of theism, there are still reasons to exercise caution in seeing the big bang as confirming the prediction that God created the universe.\n\nThe big-bang theologian argues that the claim\n\n\u201cThe universe is 13 billion years old\u201d\n\nprovides evidential support for theism. But there are many theists for whom the discovery that the universe is 13 billion years old would actually serve as a disconfirmation of their theistic belief. For example, Bishop Ussher of Ireland (1581\u20131656) claimed to derive from the Bible that the universe was created in 4004 B.C.; and even in the twenty-first century, some Christian thinkers claim Biblical warrant for an age of the universe much less than 13 billion years (see Kelly 2000 and Byl 2001). For these thinkers, then, the big bang would disconfirm theism\u2014or at least their version of theism, which is committed to the literal accuracy of the Biblical account of creation. More strongly, it seems that Christian theism is committed to a belief in a finitely old universe primarily on the basis of its commitment to the accuracy of Biblical accounts of creation. Thus, if a theist comes to believe the big-bang account of the universe\u2019s origin, and hence to doubt the literal Biblical account, then she will lose one reason\u2014and possibly her only reason\u2014for believing that the universe is finitely old.\n\nOf course, there are also theists who interpret Genesis metaphorically as implying that the universe was created, but not indicating a specific age for the universe. For these theists, finding that the universe is finitely old might confirm rather than undermine their belief.\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theism, creation ex nihilo is miraculous\u2014something which the laws of nature cannot explain. But then why should a theist expect to be able to derive creation ex nihilo from the laws of nature? Compare with other supposed miracles, e.g., within Christianity the claim that Jesus changed water into wine. Do Christian theists claim that chemistry should predict that water can transform into wine? Of course not: God is supposed to be able to transcend the laws of nature, and the laws of nature are defeasible when it comes to describing what actually did happen (since God could have intervened). But then couldn\u2019t the best (most explanatory, most elegant) cosmological theory posit an infinite past, whereas in reality God created it some finite time in the past?\n\nThe puzzle we have just encountered trades on the special status of cosmology as a historical, yet law-based science, with only one actual model. While theists would certainly not expect the laws of chemistry to predict that water can transform into wine, they do believe that an accurate historical account would include reference to those miracles that did occur. So, is cosmology more like history, or more like chemistry? If God did create the universe, should a cosmological theory report (or predict or entail) such a fact? Or should cosmology only be required to provide laws for universes, laws which might in fact have been broken in our universe?\n\nSuppose that the theist takes a harder line and says that theism requires (or favors) cosmological models with a finitely old universe. In this case, the time parameter in our cosmological models should never take values lower than some fixed number, which we can conveniently set to zero.\n\nBut the interval (0,t) is topologically isomorphic to (\u2212\u221e,t), suggesting that duration of time (finite versus infinite) might lack intrinsic physical or theological significance. Such a point was made already by E.A. Milne in 1935, and then independently by Charles Misner in 1969. In particular, Misner replaces the time parameter t with the negative of its logarithm (i.e., \u2212log t) in order to assuage worries that a bounded time parameter makes no sense. According to Misner (1969, 1331), even in models that begin with singularities, \u201cthe Universe is meaningfully infinitely old because infinitely many things have happened since the beginning.\u201d Interestingly, Misner\u2019s move can hardly be motivated by a desire to obviate the need for a creator: Misner is a self-described Catholic Christian.\n\nThe possibility that the finite/infinite time distinction is conventional was noted by the Catholic philosopher of science Ernan McMullin, who concludes that the theological doctrine of creation ex nihilo must not be given a metric interpretation (McMullin 1981). Rather, claims McMullin, the ex nihilo doctrine should be interpreted order-theoretically: the time series has a first point. But this order-theoretic criterion will not help theism, at least not in regard to current cosmological models. On the one hand, FRW cosmological models fail the order-theoretic criterion: they have no first moment of time. On the other hand, an ideal first moment of time could be adjoined to any spacetime, even those that have a metrically infinite past (see Earman 1995). Thus, a simple order-theoretic criterion is a bad guide to whether cosmological models are consistent with the doctrine of creation ex nihilo.\n\nA more adequate criterion of when a cosmological model is consonant with creation ex nihilo would require a detailed analysis of singular spacetimes (for extensive discussion of the latter topic, see Earman 1995). The best current account of when a spacetime is truly singular (as opposed to merely being described with inadequate coordinates) is when it contains inextendible geodesics of finite length. Intuitively, a geodesic is the path that would be followed by a clock in freefall. If a clock were travelling on a past-inextendible geodesic, then at some finite time in the past, the clock did not exist; more strongly, spacetime itself did not exist. Thus, the big-bang theologian would do best to claim that creation ex nihilo is confirmed precisely by those cosmological spacetimes that have inextendible geodesics. (Indeed, this criterion does hold for FRW models.) The main problem with such a proposal is that it ties a robust, intuitive theological doctrine down to an extremely precise technical feature of Lorentzian manifolds (as described by differential geometry). The risk then is that by doing so, one would add extraneous content to the theological doctrine: a future model might fail the technical criterion while still being consistent with the theological doctrine. Furthermore, many Christian theists claim that core theological doctrines are perspicuous\u2014in particularly, not understood exclusively by an elite class of priests or scholars. But the notion of a Lorentzian manifold having incomplete geodesics can hardly be said to be accessible to the average layperson.\n\nFinally, big-bang theology overreaches if it says that general relativity and the singularity theorems have settled once and for all that the universe had a beginning in time. In fact, relativistic cosmology predicts its own invalidity for times close to a dynamic singularity, such as the big bang. (For a dissenting opinion, see Misner 1969.) The reason that relativistic cosmology predicts its own own invalidity is that in the neighborhood of singularities, gravitational effects are intense, and quantum effects can be expected to play a predominant role. But general relativity does not incorporate quantum effects, and indeed it is untested in such regimes of intense gravitational force. Thus, there is little reason to believe that the singularity theorems make a valid prediction about the structure of a future successor theory of general relativity that includes quantum effects. We discuss this issue further in Section 4.\n\nMost philosophers and physicists have thought that big bang cosmology is either neutral towards, or supportive of, traditional theism. Thus, atheists have usually taken a defensive stance, trying to defeat the arguments of the big-bang theologians. But a vocal minority\u2014we might call them \u201cbig-bang atheologians\u201d\u2014have made the stronger claim that big bang cosmology disconfirms theism. The most visible proponents of this big-bang atheology are the philosophers Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum and Quentin Smith. In the case of Smith, quantum cosmologies are taken to provide even stronger evidence against theism.\n\nIn putting forward their arguments, big-bang atheologians make a number of points that seem to have been overlooked by their theistic counterparts. One such point is that FRW cosmological models have no first state. Thus, a theist who invokes the big bang cannot say that there is a state of the universe, say \u0391, such that God created the universe in state \u0391. He or she will have to invoke a more sophisticated notion of God creating initial temporal intervals, or something like that. Are these more sophisticated developments still consonant with traditional theology?\n\nBig-bang atheologians also argue that it makes no sense to accept both that there were no times before the big bang (since time itself comes into existence with the universe) and that the universe was caused. Of course, many theists claim that God causes the universe timelessly, and they would attempt to defend the coherence of such a notion in the face of these criticisms.\n\nThe case of quantum cosmology provides further complications for theology. Without going into excessive detail of specific proposals, a common theme of many quantum cosmologies is that they postulate a probability distribution over universes themselves. In other words, quantum cosmologies provide a measure of likelihood that certain sorts of universes exist. Some older quantum cosmologies (e.g., Hawking\u2019s early proposals) still predict that the universe is finitely old. And yet, one might consider their further explanatory power\u2014over and above classical general relativity\u2014as undermining theistic explanations of the universe. In particular, quantum cosmology predicts with a high probability that a universe like ours would exist. Seen from this perspective, one might take quantum cosmologies to offer a competing, non-theistic explanation for the origin of the universe.\n\nTheists have argued, in response, that quantum cosmologies do not provide unconditional probabilities for the existence of the universe. For example, Craig (1997), Deltete & Guy (1997), and Oppy (1997) argue that quantum cosmologies provide only conditional probabilities for the existence of some universe configurations given other universe configurations. Smith (1998) responds by defending the claim that the probabilities in quantum cosmology are unconditional. But neither side of this debate has attended to the special complications involved in interpreting quantum, rather than classical, probabilities. For example, Smith treats the universal wavefunction \u03a8(h i j , f) as providing a probability distribution over universe configurations (h i j , f). But we know, from elementary quantum mechanics, that it is literally inconsistent (i.e., leads to contradictions) to treat a wavefunction as giving probabilities in an absolute sense. (This contradiction is derived by the famous Kochen-Specker theorem.) We conclude that in order for the metaphysical significance of quantum cosmologies to be assessed, a more nuanced consideration of the interpretation of quantum mechanics will be required.\n\nAristotle\u2019s cosmology belonged to the class of steady-state theories in so far that his universe was changeless and eternal. When Einstein in 1917 proposed the first relativistic model of the universe, he unwittingly pictured a universe which had qualitative features in common with Aristotle\u2019s: it was finite in space, but infinite in time. The discovery of the expansion of the universe excluded the steady state from relativistic cosmology, but not from other forms of cosmology. Robert Millikan, Nobel laureate and famous physicist, was among those who in the 1930s favored an eternally recurrent universe with a continual creation of matter and energy to counter the increase of entropy. He thought that such an eternal and evolving universe revealed the creator\u2019s continual activity and explicitly presented his cosmological view as support for the doctrines of Christianity in general and for the immanence of God in particular.\n\nContrary to the earlier ideas of a steady-state universe, the theory that Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold introduced in 1948 accepted that the universe is expanding. Conceptually the theory was founded on the \u201cperfect cosmological principle,\u201d that is, the postulate that the universe in its large-scale features is not only spatially but also temporally homogeneous. Although this classical steady-state theory was abandoned in the 1960s because of its inability to account for new discoveries (such as the cosmic microwave background and the redshifts of quasars), it remains an instructive case in the cosmology-theology discussion. Moreover, the theory is not quite dead yet, as some of its characteristic features survive in the quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) still defended by Jayant Narlikar and a few other cosmologists. This model does not satisfy the perfect cosmological principle, but it assumes an indefinite cosmic time scale during which matter is continually created. In this respect it is an alternative to the big-bang theory and its supposed association with divine creation. In 1994, at a time when he was developing the QSSC model, Hoyle referred to big-bang cosmology as \u201ca form of religious fundamentalism\u201d (Hoyle 1994, 413). According to the classical steady-state theory, the universe has expanded for an infinity of time and will continue to do so for ever; yet the average density of matter remains constant because matter, or rather matter-energy, is continually being created out of nothing. (In later versions of the theory, matter creation was not ex nihilo.) Both features\u2014the infinite time scale and the continuous creation of matter\u2014were controversial and caused concern of a philosophical and also a theological nature.\n\nIt was widely assumed in the 1950s that the steady-state universe was contrary to theism or at least made God superfluous as a creator of the cosmos. After all, how can God have created a universe which has existed in an infinity of time? According to the astronomer, science popularizer and non-believer Carl Sagan, \u201cthis is one conceivable finding of science that could disprove a Creator\u2014because an infinitely old universe would never have been created\u201d (1997, 265). However, although the argument may seem to pose a real problem for theism, the theologians were well prepared\u2014it had been discussed since the thirteenth century when Thomas Aquinas suggested that God could indeed have created an infinitely old universe. Moreover, theological responses to an infinitely old universe were far from new, for they had already been developed in relation to eternally cyclic models, either in the more speculative versions of the nineteenth century or the relativistic models that were proposed in the 1930s onwards.\n\nAccording to the Thomistic doctrine of creatio continuans, God causes things to exist in the sense that their existence depends wholly on his power. If they were left to themselves they would turn into, or return into, nothingness. From this point of view creation is basically a metaphysical rather than a physical and temporal concept, and an eternal yet created universe is perfectly possible. Interestingly, the leading steady-state physicist William McCrea was also a devout Christian who argued that cosmology, in whatever form, must necessarily include the postulation of a divine creator. As theologians in the 1950s, both Protestants and Catholics, were quick to point out, Hoyle\u2019s eternal universe was not particularly heretical, for it was still in need of a creator. Not only did they mobilize the old concept of continual divine creation, emphasizing that cosmic creation is primarily about the ontological dependence of the world on God, they also stressed that faith in God has little to do with physical cosmology in whatever of its versions. Erich Mascall, a priest and philosopher of religion, saw no reason why the steady-state model should cause worry among the faithful. As he said in 1956, \u201cThe whole question whether the world had a beginning or not is, in the last resort, profoundly unimportant for theology\u201d (Mascall 1956, 155).\n\nViews similar to Mascall\u2019s have been held by many later theologians and Christian philosophers, but not by all. There is disagreement about how solidly based in the Bible the concept of atemporal continual creation is, and also about the significance of an absolute beginning of the world (for opposite views, see Copan and Craig 2004 and May 1994). The view that cosmology is essentially irrelevant to Christian belief has not gone uncontested. As Ernan McMullin has pointed out, Christian doctrines are more than metaphysics and codes for moral conduct; they are also cosmic claims that say something about the universe and what it contains of things. For this reason theologians need to pay attention to cosmology in particular and to science in general.\n\nSome Christian scientists and philosophers have seen the continual creation of matter, as posited by the steady-state theory, as a manifestation of perpetual divine creation. Thus, the Catholic philosopher Philip Quinn (1993) adopted the old notion of creatio continuans to the case of steady-state cosmology. The argument is essentially that since ex nihilo creation of matter violates energy conservation, there must be an external creative cause that accounts for the violation, and this cause he identifies with perpetual divine creation. This kind of reasoning has been severely criticized by Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum, who flatly dismisses the claim that underlies the idea of perpetual divine creation, namely that nothingness is the natural state of the universe. This claim has also been argued in detail by Richard Swinburne (1996), who finds it extraordinary that there exists anything at all and from the fact that something exists infers the existence of God. But according to Gr\u00fcnbaum there is no room for divine creation in either big-bang or steady-state cosmology. \u201cSteady-state cosmology,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis indeed logically incompatible with [the] claim that divine creative intervention is causally necessary for the nonconservative popping into existence of new matter in the steady-state universe\u201d (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1996, 529).\n\nWhereas steady-state cosmology is at least problematical from the point of view of traditional theology, it goes well together with the ideas of process theology or philosophy, where God is seen as interacting creatively and incessantly with natural processes. In a general sense, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy is more in harmony with the steady state than the big bang universe. The prominent British astronomer Bernard Lovell (1959), a devoted Christian inspired by process thinking, was in sympathy with the steady-state theory and saw no reason why it should be a threat to belief in a divine being. To him, the creation of matter was a sure sign of God\u2019s activity.\n\nAs we mentioned previously, there are reasons to suspect the invalidity of classical general relativity in regions near a singularity\u2014most importantly, for times very close to the big bang. In particular, when lengths are very small, and curvature and temperatures are very high, then\u2014if the gravitational force behaves like all other known forces of nature\u2014quantum effects will take over, and we should accordingly expect different outcomes. This observation is itself sufficient to destroy the aspirations of big-bang theology\u2014unless there are good reasons to think that the finite-age prediction of relativistic cosmology will be preserved in a quantum gravity or in string theory. In this section, we briefly review the known data about singularities in theories that attempt to unify gravity and quantum mechanics. Our review supports two conclusions: (1) We do not know yet if the best model will predict a finitely old universe, but (2) there are good reasons to think that the big bang is not necessarily an absolute beginning.\n\nThere have been a number of proposed theories of quantum cosmology. Perhaps best known of these is the proposal of Stephen Hawking, which results in a universe with no boundary\u2014motivating the famous question, \u201cwhat place, then, for a creator?\u201d The bearing of Hawking\u2019s cosmology on theism has already been discussed extensively by Craig & Smith (1995), Deltete & Guy (1997), Craig (1997), and Smith (1998). But it would be ill advised to take Hawking\u2019s theory as giving the final version of quantum cosmology. As noted by Drees (1990), Hawking\u2019s approach is just one among several competing attempts to incorporate quantum effects into relativistic cosmology, and we are not compelled to accept its idiosyncratic metaphysical picture. More to the point, Hawking\u2019s cosmological model is ad hoc in the sense that it does not flow from a more comprehensive unification of general relativity quantum theory. In this section we turn to two cosmological theories that do result from systematic and comprehensive unifications of general relativity and quantum theory: loop quantum cosmology and string cosmology.\n\nLoop quantum cosmology (LQC) is an approach to cosmology within the framework of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) program (Rovelli 2004), which itself starts with the idea that unifying quantum theory and general relativity will require \u201cquantizing\u201d the gravitational field\u2014and hence the structures of spacetime itself. Roughly speaking, to quantize a theory means that the quantities (e.g., position, momentum, scalar curvature, etc.) are replaced by \u201cmatrices,\u201d or more generally with \u201coperators on a Hilbert space.\u201d This replacement can have profound physical consequences, most particularly the spectrum of a quantity (i.e., the numerical values it can possess) can become discretized where it was previously continuous, or bounded where it was previously unbounded, and quantities can be forced to obey a Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nFor our purposes, the important question is what happens to those quantities (e.g., spatial curvature) that grow unboundedly large in classical FRW spacetimes as the time parameter t approaches the initial boundary time t 0 ? To answer this question requires going through intricate technicalities involving domains of definition of operators, etc.. To summarize, however, the most prominent proposal (championed primarily by Martin Bojowald and collaborators; see Bojowald 2009) results in a scale parameter S(t) that is bounded away from zero, entailing that curvature is bounded from above. More is true: the dynamical equations of LQC extend through the big bang, i.e., the universe existed before the big bang.\n\nIt would be premature to take loop quantum cosmology as having decisively overturned the big-bang, finite-age cosmological model. Nonetheless, there is a non-negligible probability that it will do so in the near future; and hence there is a non-negligible probability that the big bang is not the beginning of the universe, and a fortiori, not the creation event (even if there was one).\n\nHowever, loop quantum gravity is not the most popular\u2014in terms of sheer number of researchers\u2014approach to unifying quantum theory and gravity. The title of most popular belongs to string theory, and so string theory\u2019s perspective on the big bang event is of crucial interest for those wishing to assess the bearing of physical cosmology on traditional theological doctrines.\n\nAll indications from string cosmology point to the fact that the universe existed before the big bang. In particular, string theory claims that if we apply fundamental symmetry transformations to cosmological models of the recent universe, then we get a copy of the universe (with important quantities inverted) that might be called the \u201cpre-big-bang universe.\u201d In this scenario, the absolute big bang disappears and is replaced by a saddle point in the dynamical evolution of spacetime curvature: before this point, curvature is increasing, and after this point, it is decreasing.\n\nAccording to Gasperini (2008), string cosmology\u2019s prediction of a pre-big-bang universe results from a principled application of symmetry principles. Furthermore, string theory has a built in mechanism (namely a minimum string length) that seems to rule out singularities of infinite curvature or spatial length shrinking to zero. As was the case in LQC, the values of physical quantities in string theory are constrained by quantum mechanical laws; and so some quantities that grew beyond bounds in classical theory are well-behaved in quantized versions of that theory.\n\nWe currently lack the empirical data that would distinguish between competing models of quantum cosmology. But these models make different empirical predictions from each other, and they also make different predictions from classical relativistic cosmology. Hence, it is an empirical, rather than a metaphysical, question whether the big bang was the beginning of the universe.\n\nHowever, just as the big-bang is not unambiguously friendly to theism, so quantum cosmology is not unambiguously hostile to theism. Indeed, Chris Isham (1993, 405) has suggested that quantum cosmology\u2019s description of a boundary-free universe accords quite well with theism\u2019s insistence that God sustains the universe at all times. (See also the discussion in Drees 1988, 1990, 1991.) Clearly, theism has shown some flexibility in integrating its doctrines with prevailing scientific worldviews\u2014as evidenced, e.g., in the integration of Aristotelian cosmology, and in the exploitation of big-bang cosmology. Should we expect the situation to be any different with quantum cosmology?\n\nApart from the quantum-based cosmologies mentioned above, there are several other theories of the universe that differ from the generally accepted big bang theory and are, in this sense, \u201cnon-standard.\u201d A few of these models have been discussed within a religious context. We shall limit ourselves to two groups of theories, cyclic cosmologies and multiverse theories.\n\nOrigen, a third-century Christian philosopher, speculated that God, before he created our universe, had busied himself with the creation of an endless series of earlier worlds. His idea of an eternal cyclic universe was however condemned by the church and has since then generally been regarded as associated with atheism and materialism. Indeed, from about 1850 to 1920 the classical cyclic or recurrent universe was popular among many atheistic thinkers who found it to be incompatible with Christian doctrines. Nonetheless, some theists have endorsed such a universe, e.g., Joseph Smith\u2019s claim that \u201cas one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come\u201d (Mormon Book of Moses 1:38).\n\nAlthough Einstein\u2019s cosmological field equations do not justify a series of pulsating universes, many cosmologists have suggested ways in which a collapsing universe can reappear from a nonsingular state and thus give birth to a new universe, perhaps ad infinitum. It should be pointed out that Lema\u00eetre, the cosmologist-priest, did not suggest such a \u201cPhoenix universe,\u201d in spite of numerous claims to the opposite. In some cases atheism has been part of the motivation for proposing singularity-free models with an unlimited past and future. For example, the British physicist William Bonnor considered the new big bang theory \u201cthe opportunity Christian theology has been waiting for ever since science began to depose religion from the minds of rational men\u201d (Bonnor 1964, 117). His own favored candidate, a universe oscillating smoothly and eternally between two states of finitely high density, avoided a divine miracle and theistic exploitation of cosmology, in which respect it was similar to the steady-state theory. Steven Weinberg noticed the similarity: \u201cSome cosmologists are philosophically attracted to the oscillating model, especially because, like the steady-state model, it nicely avoids the problem of Genesis\u201d (Weinberg 1977, 154).\n\nClassical-relativistic cyclic models presupposed a closed universe disagreeing with current observations, for which reason they are no longer considered viable alternatives. But the twenty-first century has witnessed several new proposals, of which we shall mention only two: the \u201cconformal cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Roger Penrose, and the \u201cnew cyclic cosmology\u201d developed by Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok.\n\nIn his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, Penrose claims that as the big bang is approached, massive objects play a negligible role, so that the physics is governed by degrees of freedom that are invariant under rescaling of lengths and times. Such degrees of freedom are called \u201cconformal invariants.\u201d Thus, Penrose claims, we make a mistake to model the early universe by a Lorentzian manifold with a metric (as is done in classical general relativity). Rather, spacetime should be described by a conformal manifold, which is essentially a conformal equivalence class of general relativistic spacetimes. The \u201ccyclic\u201d part of Penrose\u2019s cosmology comes from noticing that the future of one ever-expanding universe can be smoothly bridged to the past of another big-bang universe by means of such a conformal manifold. In this case, the big bang is not a true beginning, but only a sort of phase change from one \u201cepoch\u201d to another (Penrose 2010).\n\nThe new cyclic cosmology of Steinhardt and Turok develops ideas from string theory to describe a universe without inflation going through an endless sequence of cycles\u2014in which case, the big bang is not the beginning of time (Steinhardt and Turok 2007). In this respect the model is similar to the steady-state model, and Steinhardt and Turok have indeed described it as a \u201cremarkable reincarnation\u201d of Hoyle\u2019s old theory. Although the new cyclic model has attracted a fair amount of attention, it is not widely accepted. Nor is this the case with the pre-big-bang bouncing cosmology advanced by Gabriele Veneziano and Maurizio Gasperini on the basis of string theory. According to the pre-big-bang model the universe is not only eternal into the future, it is also eternal into the past, the two cosmic phases (contracting and expanding) being separated by a non-singular big bang.\n\nEternal bouncing models qualitatively similar to the pre-big-bang scenario have been proposed earlier, either on the basis of the relativistic field equations or on the idea of a plasma universe. According to the Swedish physicist Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, a Nobel laureate of 1970 who developed the latter idea, the plasma universe was an alternative to the theistic big bang theory. Since none of the models considered in this section operate with an absolute beginning, they may seem to be problematic from a theistic point of view. However, the theist can always appeal to perpetual divine creation, just as in the case of the steady-state universe.\n\nThe modern idea of the multiverse is theologically more controversial. In its so-called landscape version, which since 2002 has been promoted and developed by Leonard Susskind and many other physicists, it is based on the apparent non-uniqueness of the equations of string theory. The solutions of the equations describe, in a sense, possible worlds with different physical parameters, interactions, types of particles, and even dimensionality; the multitude of solutions are then identified with really existing worlds which generally are causally separate from ours. As a mechanism for generating the huge number of universes, multiverse physicists make use of the eternal inflation scenario. Moreover, the multiverse is closely associated with anthropic reasoning: we find ourselves in our universe, with its particular physical laws and content of particles, not because other universes are impossible or improbable, but because our kind of life cannot exist in other universes. The theory of the multiverse has seductively great explanatory power (while it has almost no predictive power), which is a major reason why many physicists and cosmologists find it attractive. On the other hand, other physicists dismiss it as pseudoscience because it is practically untestable.\n\nIt is common among supporters of the multiverse to conceive it as an alternative to a divinely created world and ideas of natural theology. Because it represents our universe as a chance universe, special only by the fact that we live in it, the multiverse has been likened to another and more famous anti-design theory, neo-Darwinianism. Weinberg puts it as follows: \u201cJust as Darwin and Wallace explained how the wonderful adaption of living forms could arise without supernatural intervention, so the string landscape may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator\u201d (Weinberg 2007, 39). At least to some theists, the multiverse stands in sharp contrast to Christian belief. As Richard Swinburne sees it, \u201cTo postulate a trillion trillion other universes, rather than one God in order to explain the orderliness of our universe, seems the height of irrationality\u201d (Swinburne 1996, 68).\n\nSwinburne joins several other philosophers and physicists in seeing physical cosmology as providing key data for a new design argument. The strength of such fine-tuning arguments continues to be a hotly contested issue among philosophers (see Collins 2009, Colyvan et al. 2005, McGrew et al. 2001, White 2000).\n\nOn the other hand, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the multiverse and belief in a divine creator. Several philosophers have argued that if theism is true, we should expect the actual world to be a multiverse: being a perfect being, God would create a multiverse rather than just a single universe (Kraay 2010). It is possible to answer affirmatively to the question, \u201cdoes God love the multiverse?\u201d, such as the physicist Don Page did at a symposium in 2008 (see Page 2008). Even if there are 10500 universes (but not, perhaps, if there are an infinite number of them), they could have been providentially created by the almighty God with a purpose we cannot fathom. Why not? It has even been suggested (by Paul Davies) that multiverse explanations are reminiscent of divine explanations and unintentionally reintroduce a transcendent creator.\n\nMormon theology differs in several respects drastically from the theology of traditional Christianity. Not only is God personal and held to have been created by a prior god (who was again created by a prior god, etc.), according to the central doctrine of \u201ceternal progression\u201d human beings will ultimately become like God himself. There is an infinite number of beings and it takes an eternity for them to become gods. Standard big bang cosmology, based as it is on a universe of finite age, is incompatible with Mormonism, where existence has neither beginning nor end. Whereas traditional theologians have no problem with a universe created ex nihilo, and many subscribe to this doctrine, Mormons flatly reject it. In order to overcome the conflict with physical cosmology, some Mormon thinkers have turned to the multiverse. Realizing that the attempt to harmonize the Mormon dogma of eternal progression with modern cosmology is problematic, Kirk Hagen says: \u201cFor Mormonism, a compelling reason to consider a multiverse cosmology is to attempt a reconciliation of modern cosmological ideas and the central tenet of Mormon doctrine\u201d (Hagen 2006, 28).\n\nThe anthropic principle, an integral part of multiverse cosmology, has similarly been discussed in theological contexts and, again similarly, without any consensus emerging from the many discussions. In its most common version, called the weak anthropic principle, it states that what we observe is selected by our existence in a universe with just such properties that allow us to exist. Swinburne and some other theists in favor of design arguments find the anthropic principle to be, at best, unnecessary and obfuscating. To them, the values of the cosmic parameters and constants of nature appear to be fine-tuned because they are fine-tuned, the designer being God. The atheist Richard Dawkins goes further, arguing that the anthropic principle is an alternative to the design hypothesis and provides strong evidence for a world without God. However, theists do not generally see anthropically based arguments as a problem for a divinely created world. William Lane Craig and John Polkinghorne are among those who hold that the anthropic principle is compatible with divine design and can even be seen as indirect support for theism. According to the South-African cosmologist (and Quaker) George Ellis, anthropic fine-tuning is the result of a purposeful design of the universe. He has suggested a \u201cChristian anthropic principle\u201d as the basis for an ultimate understanding of the universe that combines scientific and religious perspectives (Ellis 1993).\n\nIn relation to the design argument, as reinvigorated by the discussions of the anthropic principle, some physicists and philosophers have returned to an old objection to it, namely that it is not an argument for the Christian God; it is at best an argument for a cosmic architect in a deistic sense, or for that matter several such architects. On the other hand, theists have replied that even if this objection be true it does not constitute a proof that the God of theism does not exist. Although design arguments frequently occur in connection with the anthropic principle, it needs to be said that they were not part of the original anthropic program initiated by Brandon Carter in 1974.\n\nCosmological theory has gone through many phases and proposals over the past 100 years. Some have included universes with infinite pasts and these were mentioned previously. However, for the past forty years there has been a strong consensus on the modern big bang theory which has a finite past. But even if the universe is temporally finite in the past, it may well be spatially and materially infinite. If space is infinite and the cosmological principle is assumed to be valid, the universe will contain an infinite number of galaxies, stars, atoms and everything else. Such actual infinities not only cause philosophical and logical problems, they may also cause problems of a theological nature. In his thought experiment known as \u201cHilbert\u2019s hotel\u201d the famous mathematician David Hilbert argued that (countable) actual infinities are so bizarre that they cannot have anything to do with the real world we live in. In this thought experiment, Hilbert imagines that he arrives at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied. The desk clerk claims nonetheless that there is a vacancy. He then proceeds to ask each guest to move to the room with the next highest number in the sequence (see Oppy 2006, 8; Kragh 2014, Other Internet Resources).\n\nHilbert himself was uninterested in religion, but later philosophers and theologians have occasionally used his peculiar hotel apologetically, as an argument for the existence of God and also for the finitude of the universe.\n\nThe theological problems related to an infinitely large universe are not specifically related to modern physical cosmology but have been discussed since the early days of Christianity. On the other hand, they may be seen as even more relevant today, when the favored cosmological model has zero curvature, meaning that space is flat. Although a flat cosmic space does not necessarily imply an infinite universe, many cosmologists assume that the universe is indeed spatially infinite.\n\nThe theological implications of an infinite universe were discussed by the church fathers and, in greater detail, by Johannes Philoponus in the sixth century. Many of the arguments were of the same kind as those used in the attempts to prove the impossibility of a temporal infinity. At the time of the scientific revolution it was commonly assumed that physical space cannot be truly infinite, only indefinitely large. Infinity was seen as a divine attribute not to be found elsewhere; to claim that nature is infinite would be to endow it with divinity, a heretical view characteristic of pantheism. While the generally accepted view among theists was, and to some extent still is, that an infinite universe is philosophically absurd and theologically heretical, there was no consensus on the issue. In fact, several Christian thinkers, from Descartes in the seventeenth century through Kant in the eighteenth to Edward Milne in the twentieth, have argued that an infinite universe is in better agreement with God\u2019s will and omnipotence than a finite one. According to Milne, \u201cIt requires a more powerful God to create an infinite universe than a finite universe; it requires a greater God to leave room for an infinity of opportunities for the play of evolution than to wind up a mechanism, once and for all\u201d (Milne 1948, 233). The correlation between finitism and theism, and infinitism and atheism, should be seen as historically contingent rather than justified by either scientific or theological reasons.\n\nDuring the early period of modern cosmology, relativistic models with zero or negative curvature were sometimes associated with materialism and atheism because they implied a universe of infinite size. Conversely, Einstein\u2019s closed and finite universe was welcomed by theists. According to Ernest W. Barnes, the mathematically trained bishop of Birmingham, infinite space was \u201ca scandal to human thought,\u201d (Barnes 1931, 598). His argument was epistemic as well as theological: only if God\u2019s universe is finite can we hope to understand the full range of his activity. Lema\u00eetre thought likewise that the universe had to be finite in order to be comprehensible. In agreement with his later warning against the \u201cnightmare of infinite space\u201d (Kragh 2004, 139), both of his two innovative cosmological models, the expanding model of 1927 and the big-bang model of 1931, were spatially closed. The steady-state model of the 1950s was not only unpopular among Christians because of its lack of a cosmic creation, but also because it implied a homogeneous universe of infinite extent. According to Stanley Jaki, a Benedictine priest and historian of science, the infinite universe is a scientific cover-up for atheism. Mormons do not agree, though, for they need a universe which is infinite in both time and space.\n\nThe present consensus model of a geometrically flat accelerating universe is usually taken to imply an infinite cosmos. The general attitude of cosmologists is to ignore the troublesome philosophical problems and speak of the infinite universe as just an indefinitely large one. They rarely reflect on the weird epistemic consequences of an actual infinity and even more rarely on the theological consequences. Ellis is an exception to the rule. He and his collaborators have argued forcefully against an infinite universe, suggesting that the flat space of the consensus model is probably an abstraction that does not hold physically (Ellis, Kirchner and Stoeger 2004). If the universe is really infinite and uniform it can be (and has been) argued that there will be an infinity of identical copies of all human beings and indeed of everything. Such a consequence, as discussed by Ellis, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth and others, clearly is theologically disturbing.\n\nEven more disturbing, says Ellis, is that God may then not be able to keep track of and give attention to the infinite number of beings in the universe. Moreover, if there is a multitude of cosmic regions, each of which is inhabited with intelligent beings, one may need to contemplate a multitude of Christ-figures, incarnations and crucifixions. Ellis was not only willing to consider such a scenario, he also thought that it strengthened the case for a finite universe, for then \u201cwe would have to countenance only a finite number of civilizations needing redemption. Surely an infinite number of Christ-figures must be too much, no matter how one envisages God\u201d (Ellis 1993, 394).\n\nThe cosmological field equations are time-symmetric and the fundamental laws of physics are assumedly valid at any time. Thus, modern cosmology is not only about the past of the universe, it also offers scenarios about its far future, including speculations about the fate of intelligent life. Given that the apocalyptic passages in the Bible speak of an end of the world and a possible new creation (e.g., 2 Peter 3:10\u201313), the cosmic future may seem to offer another point of contact between cosmology and theistic religion. But can there be a secular or scientific eschatology?\n\nScientifically based speculations about the state of the cosmos in the far future and the possibility of endless life were first discussed in the late nineteenth century in connection with the controversy over the heat death predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Some of the German scientists involved in the controversy argued that life might persist even in the very high-entropic environment of the far future, and they explicitly referred to the eschatological aspects of cosmology. Characteristically, while the heat death scenario was welcomed by Christian authors, it was vehemently opposed by materialists and atheists who argued for an eternal universe with eternal life. As Eddington, a Quaker and an advocate of the inevitable heat death, later asked: \u201cSince when has the teaching that \u2018 heaven and earth shall pass away\u2019 become ecclesiastically un-orthodox?\u201d (Eddington 1935, 59).\n\nSince the 1970s \u201cphysical eschatology\u201d has emerged as a new subfield of astrophysics and cosmology, pioneered by Freeman Dyson, Jamal Islam and others (see the survey in Kragh 2011, 325\u2013353). The field deals primarily with the state of the universe in the remote future as based on extrapolations of cosmological models and the assumption that the presently known laws of physics will remain indefinitely valid. The favored scenario is the open ever-expanding universe where extrapolations typically result in an ultimate future (at about 10100 years from now!) in which the universe consists of nothing but an exceedingly thin electron-positron plasma immersed in a cold radiation of neutrinos and photons. Other studies presume a closed universe collapsing in a big crunch and others again investigate the nearer future of humankind, say a few million years from now. While many of these studies are not concerned with the final state of life, some are, and it is this latter group that constitutes physical eschatology proper. According to John Barrow and Frank Tipler, the research field is, \u201cthe study of the survival and the behavior of life in the far future\u201d (Barrow & Tipler 1986, 658).\n\nPhysical eschatologists usually ignore the religious associations of their studies or deny that they exist. Tipler is a controversial exception, however. Not only does he argue that some kind of life can continue forever in a closed universe, he also claims that it is the very collapse of the universe that permits eternal life. When the final eternity has been reached at what he calls the \u201comega point,\u201d life becomes omniscient and the temporal becomes atemporal. According to Tipler, the final singularity is God and \u201ctheology is nothing but physical cosmology based on the assumption that life as a whole is immortal\u201d (Tipler 1995, 17). In his book The Physics of Christianity (Tipler 2007), he continues his idiosyncratic exploration of modern cosmotheology according to which theology is merely a branch of physics. Tipler\u2019s views are undoubtedly extreme, but (and perhaps for this reason) they have caused much discussion among theologians.\n\nThe term physical eschatology indicates a connection to biblical eschatology, but it is far from clear that the two are related in any meaningful sense. The message of the Bible is not so much the end of the physical universe as it is about the imminent return of Christ, the transformation of humans from flesh to spirit, and the final kingdom of God. It is about the ultimate destiny and goal of humans, not of self-reproducing robots. As Jefferson Davis (1999) notes, the ultimate hope which is crucial in theology cannot be supplied by the laws of physics. The scenario of a closed universe, such as argued by Tipler, may appear to be more compatible with the biblical view than the case of the ever-expanding universe, but even in the former case it is hard to establish a meaningful connection. While the end of the world does not conflict with the Bible, the claims of immortality of intelligent life forms (not necessarily humans) do. The Bible says that God alone is immortal and that all his created beings are doomed to extinction unless God decides otherwise.\n\nSeveral theologians have expressed concern about the cosmologists\u2019 scenarios of the end of the universe and stressed that there is a world of difference between these scenarios and proper eschatology. According to Wolfhart Pannenberg the Christian affirmation of an imminent end of the world is scarcely reconcilable with the cosmological extrapolations of the state of the universe zillions of years ahead. Karl Peters probably speaks for the majority of theologians when he writes: \u201cIf the expanding universe is indeed open, expanding forever, then how can one speak of God recreating the universe? If the universe is closed, then it is likely to end in a \u2018big crunch\u2019 of mammoth black-hole proportions. Again, it is difficult to see how a new creation can take place\u201d (Schwarz 2000, 180). According to Peters, the physical end of the universe would in effect imply the non-existence of God as understood in the Christian tradition. Whereas Pannenberg, Peters, Arthur Peacocke and others tend to think that physical and Christian eschatology are either contradictory or incommensurable, Craig has taken a more reconcilable view. According to him, the cosmologists\u2019 versions of secular eschatology furnish grounds for taking seriously the hypothesis of a transcendent creative and omnipotent agent. This agent may not be the classical God, but more likely God in a panentheistic version.\n\nFinally, Robert Russell (2008) argues that the potential conflict might be resolved by appealing to God\u2019s omnipotence and freedom to perform miracles: the future of the universe would have been what science predicts had God not decided to act at Easter and bring about, and will continue to bring about, the new creation. This view is allegedly not in conflict with science, but only with the philosophical assumption that the events predicted by science must happen, and this assumption Russell sees no reason to accept.\n\nThe question, \u201cwhy does the universe exist?\u201d admits of answers from traditional religions as well as from contemporary cosmological theories. However, according to Bede Rundle (2004), neither of these answers are needed, for philosophical analysis is sufficient to prove the existence of a physical universe. While some claim that the scientific answer has superseded all theological answers, others claim that the scientific answer reinforces the claim that God created the universe. Indeed, the story of the interaction between scientific cosmology and theology is by no means a simple tale of a better theory replacing an inferior; nor a simple tale of the convergence of diverse sources of knowledge. A naive or ideological reading of twentieth century cosmology might count big bang cosmology as providing new support for theism, and alternatives such as steady-state cosmology as atheistic backlashes. (And of course, the work of apologists such as W.L. Craig lends credence to this sort of picture.) But such a view misses many nuances, both in the historical record, as well as in the logical structure of these issues. From a historical point of view, there has been little correlation between religious views of scientific cosmologists and their proposed cosmological models. From an epistemological point of view, there are numerous obstacles to claiming that the big bang confirms the hypothesis that God exists. And from a metaphysical point of view, God\u2019s hand is not manifest even in big bang models: these models have no first state for God to create, and these models have no time for God to exist in before the big bang.\n\nBy pointing out some of the subtleties in the relationship between scientific cosmology and theology, we do not intend to claim that the two are nonoverlapping magisteria (to borrow a phrase from Stephen Jay Gould). To the contrary, contemporary cosmology is fascinating precisely because it has such intricate logical relations with traditional metaphysical and theological issues."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/dualism-religion", "page_content": "dualism , in religion , the doctrine that the world (or reality) consists of two basic, opposed, and irreducible principles that account for all that exists. It has played an important role in the history of thought and of religion.\n\nNature and significance\n\nIn religion, dualism means the belief in two supreme opposed powers or gods, or sets of divine or demonic beings, that caused the world to exist. It may conveniently be contrasted with monism, which sees the world as consisting of one principle such as mind (spirit) or matter; with monotheism; or with various pluralisms and polytheisms, which see a multiplicity of principles or powers at work. As is indicated below, however, the situation is not always clear and simple, a matter of one or two or many, for there are monotheistic, monistic, and polytheistic religions with dualistic aspects.\n\nVarious distinctions may be discerned in the types of dualism in general. In the first place, dualism may be either absolute or relative. In a radical or absolute dualism, the two principles are held to exist from eternity; for example, in the Iranian dualisms, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, both the bright and beneficent and the sinister and destructive principles are from eternity.\n\nIn a mitigated or relative dualism, one of the two principles may be derived from, or presuppose, the other as a basis; for example, the Bogomils, a medieval heretical Christian group, held that the Devil is a fallen angel who came from God and was the creator of the human body, into which he managed by trickery to have God infuse a soul. Here the Devil is a subordinate being and not coeternal with God, the absolute eternal being. This, then, is clearly a qualified, not a radical, dualism. Both radical and mitigated types of dualism are found among different groups of the late medieval Cathari, a Christian heretical movement closely related to the Bogomils.\n\nAnother and perhaps more important distinction is that between dialectical and eschatological dualism. Dialectical dualism involves an eternal dialectic, or tension, of two opposed principles, such as, in Western culture, the One and the many, or Idea and matter (or space, called by Plato \u201cthe receptacle\u201d), and, in Indian culture, maya (the illusory world of sense experience and multiplicity) and atman-brahman (the essential identity of self and ultimate reality). Dialectical dualism ordinarily implies a cyclical, or eternally repetitive, view of history. Eschatological dualism\u2014i.e., a dualism concerned with the ultimate destiny of humanity and the world, how things will be in the \u201clast\u201d times\u2014on the other hand, conceives of a final resolution of the present dualistic state of things, in which evil will be eliminated at the end of a linear history constituted of a series of unrepeatable events instead of a cyclical, repetitive one. The ancient Iranian religions, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, and gnosticism\u2014a religio-philosophical movement influential in the Hellenistic world\u2014provide examples of eschatological dualism. A type of thought, such as Platonism, that insists on a profound harmony in the cosmos, is thus more radically dualistic, because of its irreducibly dialectical character, than Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, with their emphasis on the cosmic struggle between two antithetical principles (good and evil). Midway between these extremes is gnostic dualism, which has an ontology (or theory of being) of an Orphic-Platonic type (see below Among ancient civilizations and peoples) but which also affirms the final disappearance and annihilation of evil with the eventual destruction of the material world\u2014and thus comprises both dialectical and eschatological dualism.\n\nIn philosophy, dualism is often identified with the doctrine of transcendence\u2014that there is a separate realm or being above and beyond the world\u2014as opposed to monism, which holds that the ultimate principle is inside the world (immanent). In the disciplines concerned with the study of religions, however, religious dualism refers not to the distinction or separation of God and the world but to the doctrine of two basic principles, a doctrine that, moreover, may easily be compatible with a form of monism (e.g., Orphism or the Advaita school of Vedanta) that makes the opposition between the One and the many absolute and sees in multiplicity merely a fragmentation (or illusory obliteration) of the One."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/", "page_content": "First published Fri Oct 15, 2021\n\nPhilosophical critics of contemporary analytic philosophy of religion (APR) are often struck by just how Christian and theological much of it seems. This criticism expresses the worry that APR as such looks too much like Christian philosophical theology. At the same time, theological critics often fault APR for lacking theological sophistication ( Section 3 ). In order to understand both poles of criticism, it is useful to have a better sense of the relevant historical background ( Section 1 ). But it is also important to appreciate what the best contemporary work in analytic philosophical theology actually looks like ( Section 2 ).\n\nBecause its twin foci are so broad, an encyclopedia entry on \u201cPhilosophy and Christian Theology\u201d could legitimately go in many different directions. This entry has two related aims. First, the entry discusses methodological questions about how philosophy and theology should be related. Accordingly, it surveys some of the most important ways they have been related in the history of the Christian tradition ( Section 1 ), before turning to contemporary debates about the way Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion interacts with theology ( Section 3 ). Second, in between these two methodological sections, the entry also discusses recent work in analytic philosophical theology ( Section 2 ). Note that the previous version of this entry (Murray and Rea 2008 [2021]) focused on topics in contemporary philosophical theology. That version is archived and available via the Other Internet Resources but see, also, the topic-focused entries linked in the Related Entries for additional coverage.\n\nAs a general, formal matter, this point holds even though different Christian groups disagree about what the constraints of orthodoxy actually are. So Roman Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians will accept different constraints about, say, the nature of the Eucharist, and rival Protestant Christian groups will differ with each other in a similar way. But as a formal matter, Christian thinkers who think philosophically about Christian doctrines typically do so inside the intellectual framework provided by what they regard as authoritative Christian orthodoxy. Obviously, it is not the case that everyone who wants to think philosophically about Christianity must accept the constraints of Christian orthodoxy, even in this more relativistic sense of \u201corthodoxy\u201d. Some modern and contemporary thinkers still identify as Christians even though they reject the very idea of normative orthodoxy, for example. And, of course, non-Christian thinkers, including non-theists, will reject any notion of Christian orthodoxy in its entirety. Yet they can still think philosophically about Christian doctrines.\n\nYet even after the parameters of orthodoxy were established, Christian thinkers continued to face difficult philosophical questions about the meaning, coherence, and plausibility of settled Christian doctrines. They continued to try to answer those questions using the best philosophy of their day\u2014from Scholastic Aristotelianism in the Medieval period to analytic metaphysics today. For Christian thinkers, the already settled doctrines of Christian orthodoxy provide a normative framework within which this philosophical reflection occurs, by demarcating the logical space that constrains the field of acceptable solutions. For example, it is not open to an orthodox Christian thinker to dispel the logical problem of the Trinity (the problem of how God can be both three and one) by arguing that there is in fact no God, or that God is not triune, or that the Father and the Son are two stages in the temporal life of the one God. These theoretical options are ruled out by virtue of the philosopher\u2019s own orthodox Christian commitments.\n\nOver the course of the Patristic period, as the early Church successfully established its own intellectual framework, it formally defined the boundaries of Christian orthodoxy through a series of ecumenical councils. These councils\u2014including the Councils of Nicaea (325 CE), Constantinople (381), and Chalcedon (451)\u2014established the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and its corollary, the doctrine of the Incarnation (see Kelly 1978).\n\nChristian thinkers have always drawn on philosophy to help answer these kinds of questions. In the earliest years of Christianity, running roughly from the second to the seventh centuries CE, and often called the \u201cPatristic\u201d period, the emerging Christian Church faced the daunting task of defining doctrinal orthodoxy in the face of internal and external challenges. In pursuing this task, Patristic thinkers typically did not understand themselves as \u201ctheologians\u201d in contrast to \u201cphilosophers\u201d. Indeed, they may not have endorsed any sharp distinction between philosophy and theology at all. But they still reasoned about their Christian commitments in the intellectual idiom of the ancient Mediterranean world, which was the idiom of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic philosophy.\n\nMany Christian doctrines raise difficult philosophical questions. For example, Christians have traditionally insisted that they worship a single God, while simultaneously identifying that God with a trinity comprised of three numerically distinct, fully divine persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not easy to see how three divine persons add up to one God. Similarly, Christians have also asserted that a human man, Jesus of Nazareth, is also God-the-Son, the second person of the divine trinity. It is not easy to see how a human man, who is born, lives, and dies, could also be a fully divine being. Consider also the relationship between divine providence and human freedom. Are human beings free to accept or reject God, or does God alone decide who will accept or reject God? Any answer to this theological question will also assume some specific philosophical account of human freedom and moral responsibility.\n\n1. The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition\n\nAlthough modern thought tends to assume a sharp disjunction between philosophy and theology, it is not at all obvious how to distinguish them in a principled way. Suppose that we take philosophy in the broadest sense to be the systematic use of human reason in an effort to understand the most fundamental features of reality, and suppose that we take theology in the broadest sense to be the study of God and all things in relation to God. Then we should expect to see considerable overlap between the two: after all, God, if there is a God, is surely one of the fundamental features of reality, and one to which all the other features presumably relate.\n\nIn practice, when we survey the history of Christian thought, we do see considerable overlap between philosophy and theology. With respect to their topics of inquiry, philosophers and theologians alike ask questions about epistemology, axiology, and political theory, as well as about metaphysics and fundamental ontology. Similarly, with respect to their methods of inquiry, philosophers and theologians alike interpret authoritative texts, deploy arguments, and marshal evidence to support their conclusions. Here one might insist that Christian theological claims are grounded by appeals to \u201cfaith\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d, whereas philosophical claims are grounded by appeals to \u201creason\u201d. This contrast is promising when suitably developed, but it is not as sharp as one might initially suppose. Theology also makes appeals to common sense and ordinary human reason, and philosophy also has its versions of faith and authority.\n\nOf the making of typologies there is no end, but it is still worth examining some of the most common ways that Christian thinkers throughout the centuries have understood the relationship between philosophy and theology. Without this historical background, it becomes all-too-easy to draw the relationship in na\u00efve, anachronistic, and overly simplistic ways. In fact, no single interpretation of the relationship between philosophy and theology can claim overwhelming support from the Christian tradition. From outside the Christian tradition, while many non-Christian thinkers see philosophy and theology as quite distinct, others deliberately blur the distinction between them\u2014because they think that theology is actually just misguided philosophy.\n\nAt the top-level of the proposed typology, we can distinguish between \u201cIntegration\u201d and \u201cContrast\u201d views. Integration views do not distinguish philosophy and theology at all, whereas Contrast views do. We can disambiguate the \u201cContrast\u201d category into \u201cCooperation\u201d views, \u201cDisjunction\u201d views, and \u201cConflict\u201d views. The most prominent Cooperation views treat philosophy as a valuable, perhaps even necessary, tool for theological inquiry, and still allow some degree of overlap between the two. Disjunction views, by contrast, regard philosophy and theology as non-overlapping forms of inquiry, which feature distinct and ultimately unrelated goals and methods. \u201cConflict\u201d views treat philosophy and theology as not only distinct but mutually antagonistic. In fact, however, few Christian thinkers have endorsed outright conflict between philosophy and theology. But it is still worth discussing the Conflict view explicitly, because some prominent Christian theologians throughout history\u2014for example, Tertullian, Martin Luther, or Karl Barth\u2014initially seem to advocate Conflict. Upon closer inspection, however, their views are closer to those in the Disjunction category.\n\nThese categories are crude. They could each be further divided, and subdivided again. They focus mainly on different Christian attitudes toward the interaction of philosophy and theology, rather than on the attitudes of non-Christian philosophers. Some non-empty categories are omitted altogether. But these categories do capture much of the landscape, and at least show that there are more options available than a na\u00efve conflict between faith and reason.\n\n1.1 Integration\n\nThe Integration model treats philosophy and Christian theology as continuous, integrated activities. On this model, rational inquiry about God does not sharply divide into discrete activities called \u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d. Instead, there is simply the single, continuous intellectual task of trying to understand God, and all things in relation to God, using all of one\u2019s intellectual resources. This account does not deny the importance of faith or revelation to the Christian intellectual life; rather, it denies that faith and revelation properly belong to a separate activity called \u201ctheology\u201d in distinction from another activity called \u201cphilosophy\u201d. According to this view, when we engage in rational inquiry of any sort, we should draw on every available source of knowledge that is relevant to that inquiry. So when we engage in rational inquiry about Christian topics, we should draw on scripture, Church tradition, and other such sources of knowledge, whether we call the resulting inquiry \u201ctheology\u201d, \u201cphilosophy\u201d, or something else. To do anything else would be to hobble our inquiry from the outset, according to the Integration view.\n\nThis account of the relationship between philosophy and theology has deep roots in the Christian tradition. Before the rise of the medieval university, it was the dominant view, and it still has contemporary defenders (discussed below). Patristic thinkers did not typically describe their own intellectual work as \u201ctheology\u201d. The term \u201ctheology\u201d already had a fixed meaning in late antiquity. It meant \u201cpoetic speech about the gods\u201d, and was in general associated with pagan story-telling and myth-making: the great \u201ctheologians\u201d, were Homer and Hesiod. Even though Christian thinkers like Gregory of Nazianzus sometimes acquired the honorific title \u201cTheologian\u201d, they did so because of the lyrical and poetic quality of their writing, not because they wrote about Christian doctrinal topics (Zachhuber 2020; McGinn 2008).\n\nThe general term that early Christian thinkers used to describe their intellectual work was, more often than not, simply \u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cChristian philosophy\u201d. Christianity was regarded as the \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d over against the false philosophical schools associated with pagan thought. (See Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 8.1; Clement of Alexandria, Stromata 1.28.3, 1.28.4 1.80.5,6; Augustine of Hippo, Against Julian, 4.14.72.) This usage is consistent with Pierre Hadot\u2019s (1995) claim that in Greco-Roman antiquity philosophy was understood as a comprehensive way of life. Christianity, on this model, is analogous to a philosophical school, in Hadot\u2019s sense (see also Zachhuber 2020).\n\nThe Integration account continued to be the default account of the relationship between philosophy and theology into the early Medieval period. Before the rise of scholasticism in the great Western universities, there was no sharp distinction between philosophy and theology. Anselm of Canterbury, for example, certainly has the concept of a line of inquiry that proceeds using reason alone, without appealing to revelation, but he does not label that inquiry \u201cphilosophy\u201d in distinction from \u201ctheology\u201d. Moreover, in his own writings, he frequently blurs any such distinction, as he seamlessly moves between rational reflection and argument, on the one hand, to prayers, meditations, and exclamations of thanksgiving, on the other (e.g., Proslogion 1\u20134). Like many premodern Christian thinkers, Anselm also held that intellectual inquiry and personal holiness are linked, so that the more one grows in Christian virtue, the more rationally one is able to think about God (Adams 2004; Sweeney, 2011). This understanding of inquiry and virtue is also a hallmark of the Integration account.\n\n1.2 Contrast\n\nUnlike the Integration model, the Contrast model insists that philosophy and theology are fundamentally different forms of inquiry. Strictly speaking, there can be many different Contrast models, because the relevant sense of \u201ccontrast\u201d comes in degrees. I focus on three: Cooperation, Disjunction, and Conflict. On the Cooperation account, philosophy and theology remain close cousins. When rightly pursued, they cannot really conflict, and they can even overlap in their respective topics of inquiry, sources, and methods. Nevertheless, the Cooperation account holds that the overlap between philosophy and theology is only partial, because they each begin from different intellectual starting points and appeal to different sources of evidence (Baker-Hytch 2016; Chignell 2009: 117; Simmons 2019). On another version of the Contrast model, Disjunction, philosophy and theology are even further apart: although they still do not conflict, and may even consider the same topics in an attenuated sense, their starting assumptions and methods of investigation are different enough that they share no significant conclusions. Finally, Conflict accounts assert that the conclusions of Christian theology are positively irrational from the point of view of philosophy. Although some historically important Christian thinkers might seem to endorse Conflict, closer inspection shows that they do not. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, a persistent assumption holds that Christianity requires a sharp conflict between theology and philosophy\u2014or at least faith and reason\u2014and so it is worth briefly discussing why Conflict has had few traditional defenders.\n\n1.2.1 Cooperation\n\nOn the Cooperation account, philosophy and theology are understood to be different, but mutually supporting, intellectual activities. For Christian thinkers who advocate Cooperation, philosophy and theology form a coherent, mutually supportive whole. They are not in conflict with respect to their conclusions, since truth cannot contradict truth, but they differ with respect to their foundational axioms, goals, and sources of evidence. Philosophy is understood as a preamble to theology, while theology completes and fulfills philosophy. Thomas Aquinas is a foundational advocate of the Cooperation account (Summa Theologiae 1.1.1\u20138, Summa Contra Gentiles 1.1.1\u20139, Hankey 2001). Often the relationship between philosophy and theology is described in hierarchical and instrumental terms: theology draws on philosophy as needed, because philosophy is instrumentally useful to theology. According to a traditional metaphor, philosophy is the servant of theology (ancilla theologiae, literally \u201chandmaid\u201d of theology; see Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 1.1.5). In a more contemporary idiom, theology uses conceptual tools provided by philosophy in the pursuit of its own distinctive intellectual task: elucidating the meaning and truth of revealed Christian doctrines.\n\nOn the Cooperation account, theology differs from philosophy chiefly because theology assumes the truth of divine revelation, whereas philosophy does not. Philosophy takes its foundational axioms and assumptions from generally available truths of human reason and sensory experience. Philosophy and theology also differ in the way they argue and in the kinds of intellectual appeals that are proper to each. Theologians can appeal to revelation\u2014scripture and authoritative Church tradition\u2014in order to generate new lines of inquiry, and can treat revealed truths as evidence in their investigations. For their part, philosophers must appeal only to premises and evidence that are in principle available to any rational inquirer.\n\nThis distinction between \u201crevealed truths\u201d and \u201ctruths of reason\u201d implies that at least some revealed truths are not also truths of reason. By hypothesis, such truths would have remained unknown and unknowable had they not been revealed by God. (It therefore follows that without revelation, Christian theology could not exist, on the Cooperation account.) Paradigmatic instances of revealed truths are the doctrine of the Trinity, and the doctrine of the Incarnation. Throughout the centuries, most, though not all, broadly orthodox Christian thinkers have held that human beings could not reason their way to the truth of these doctrines without the aid of divine revelation.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, theologians use the conceptual tools furnished by philosophy to elucidate the contents of revelation. Just like philosophers, theologians make arguments, and their arguments appeal to common standards of logic and rigor, even though they also draw on theology\u2019s own unique (revealed) axioms and sources of evidence (Summa Theologiae 1.1.1). Philosophical arguments cannot prove the foundational truths of revelation, according to Aquinas, but at the same time, revelation and reason cannot conflict. (That God exists is a truth of reason, not revelation, for Aquinas\u2014see Summa Theologiae 1.2.2, reply to obj. 1.) Theologians can therefore use common standards of philosophical reasoning to answer any putative objections to their theological claims, by showing that any alleged conflict is only apparent. So, for example, even though it is not possible to establish that God is triune by means of philosophical arguments, it is possible to use philosophical arguments in a defensive mode, to answer objections alleging that the doctrine of the trinity is logically incoherent. When arguing with other Christians, theologians can appeal to revelation to support their claims. When arguing with opponents who do not accept revelation, they cannot (Summa Theologiae 1.1.8). Yet this restriction is not really a disciplinary maxim designed to oppose philosophy to theology, but a pragmatic admission that one cannot successfully persuade opponents by appealing to premises they deny.\n\n1.2.2 Disjunction\n\nLike Cooperation, the Disjunction view holds that philosophy and theology are different forms of inquiry. Similarly, like Cooperation, the Disjunction view also that agrees that there can be no real conflict between the conclusions of philosophy (when true) and those of theology. But the Disjunction view goes further: Disjunction advocates deny that there is any significant overlap between philosophy and theology at all.\n\nDisjunction does not subordinate philosophy to theology or treat philosophy as an essential tool for theology. Instead, to borrow a term from contemporary science and religion debates, philosophy and theology are \u201cnon-overlapping magisteria\u201d (Gould 1997). In particular, Cooperation\u2019s appeal to the distinction between truths of reason and truths of revelation does not suffice to distinguish philosophy from theology, according to Disjunction advocates, who instead appeal to various more fundamental distinctions of method or approach (see discussion below). Of course, even those who explicitly advocate Disjunction will occasionally deploy some methods associated with philosophy: carefully defining terms, making formally valid arguments, uncovering contradictions in opposing views, etc. Yet these methods are found in any form of rational inquiry, and so (presumably) they do not belong to philosophy alone.\n\nAny given thinker\u2019s view of Disjunction will of course depend on their underlying construal of philosophy and theology. Some thinkers\u2014even some Christian thinkers\u2014endorse the Disjunction view because they deny that theology is really a propositional, truth-apt discourse that proceeds by way of arguments and evidence. Instead, theology is something else entirely\u2014poetry, perhaps; or a form of worship, praise, or prayer (Caputo 2015). This view of theology implies a sharp contrast with Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy, modern philosophy, and contemporary Anglo-American Analytic philosophy, though perhaps not with philosophy tout court. Philosophers might associate this view with the \u201cexpressivist\u201d or \u201cemotivist\u201d critiques of theology that were common in the heyday of logical positivism. But in fact, versions of the \u201ctheology as poetry\u201d view are found throughout the history of Christian thought (Beggiani 2014).\n\nOther versions of the Disjunction view figure even more prominently in the Christian tradition. The foundational Protestant reformers, Martin Luther and John Calvin, both advocate Disjunction, in part because they both reject the synthesis of philosophy and theology that characterized late medieval scholasticism. According to Luther, philosophy and theology proceed from entirely different perspectives, with different starting points and different goals (1539 [1966: 244]; Grosshans 2017). Philosophy considers its objects of inquiry from the perspective of common human reason and sense experience, with the goal of trying to understand things as they actually are in the real world. Theology considers its objects of inquiry from a creational and eschatological perspective, with the goal of trying to understand them in relation to God as their creator and final end. Furthermore, for Luther, \u201ccreation\u201d and its cognates are properly theological terms whose meaning derives from scripture and revelation, and which should not be identified with any philosophical notion of a first cause or prime mover; mutatis mutandis, the same point hold for creation\u2019s final end in God (1539 [1966: 245, 248]).\n\nEven when philosophy and theology do consider the same object of inquiry\u2014for example, the human being\u2014this difference in perspective ensures that the lines of inquiry remain completely separate. Luther\u2019s 1536 \u201cDisputation Concerning Man\u201d, for example opens with the thesis that \u201cPhilosophy or human wisdom defines man as an animal having reason, sensation, and body\u201d and then goes on to explore this definition. But his exploration only serves to contrast this philosophical view of the human being with the perspective of theology. Theology,\n\nfrom the fulness of its wisdom, defines man as whole and perfect\u2026 made in the beginning after the image of God\u2026 subject to the power of the devil, sin and death\u2026freed and given eternal life only through the Son of God, Jesus Christ. (1536 [1966: 137\u2013138])\n\nLuther\u2019s theological account of the human being does not contradict the philosophical account, but it also does not complete or augment that account, because (according to Luther) properly theological claims are simply unintelligible to philosophy (1536 [1966: 137\u2013140]; 1539 [1966: 240\u2013241, 242]). They do not belong to the same universe of discourse.\n\nCalvin shares Luther\u2019s basic understanding of the disjunction between philosophy and theology. Like Luther, Calvin holds that the Fall has corrupted the power of human reason, but has not destroyed it altogether (Institutes 2.2.12\u201317). When restricted to its proper sphere\u2014matters pertaining to the natural world\u2014philosophy remains valuable. But as a result of the Fall, \u201cheavenly things\u201d are inaccessible to unaided human reason (Institutes 2.2.13). By \u201cheavenly things\u201d, Calvin means the saving truths of the Gospel.\n\nSo far, Calvin\u2019s understanding might seem quite similar to the Cooperation view, which also denies that revealed truths are accessible to human reason. But Calvin further distinguishes philosophy from theology at the level of method, by denying that true theology engages in abstract, speculative reasoning, which he associates with philosophy, and insisting that any legitimate knowledge of God must be practical and affective (Institutes 1.12.1, 1.5.10). For example, according to Calvin, it would be impious and dangerous to speculate on all the actions that God could possibly do\u2014God\u2019s absolute power. Instead, we should focus our loving attention on what God has actually done, paradigmatically in the person and work of Christ (Institutes 3.24.2; Helm 2004: 24\u201326). Theology presupposes Christian faith, which is an affective response to Christ, and which requires \u201cconfidence and assurance of heart\u201d (Institutes 3.2.33). Yet scholastic philosophy, with its \u201cendless labyrinths\u201d and \u201cobscure definitions\u201d, has \u201cdrawn a veil over Christ to hide him\u201d (Institutes 3.2.2).\n\nFor Luther and Calvin, then, there can be no genuinely philosophical theology. Even though both agree that philosophical speculation can arrive at some limited truths about, e.g., a first cause, or about the nature of human beings, those truths are of no theological interest; even as bare propositional claims, they are already better and more fully known in theological inquiry. From the other direction, the properly Christian notions of God as creator and of the human being as imago dei, e.g., resist all philosophical speculation. Of course, Luther and Calvin can only hold these views because of the way they understand philosophy and theology. They both identify philosophy with late medieval scholasticism, and they both understand theology as a kind of existential encounter with God and Christ, as revealed in the scriptures. Different accounts of philosophy and theology would yield different construals of the underlying disjunction, or no disjunction at all.\n\n1.2.3 Conflict\n\nNone of the three views considered so far\u2014Integration, Cooperation, and Disjunction\u2014assume any real, essential conflict between philosophy and theology. All three views allow for apparent conflict, due to errors of reasoning or interpretation, or when either discipline departs from its own proper sphere, but they do not assert that Christian theology or Christian faith is irrational from the point of view of philosophy, nor do they hold that any significant Christian doctrinal claims can be falsified by sound philosophical reasoning. Throughout the history of Christian thought, many prominent Christian philosophers and theologians have criticized philosophy, or fulminated against what they regard as philosophical overreach, but few if any have regarded philosophy and theology as essentially incompatible, in the sense just outlined. Popular understandings of \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201creason\u201d often posit a deep and abiding conflict between the two, and so it is important to emphasize just how rare that position has actually been among major Christian philosophers and theologians. Key figures who are often regarded as Conflict advocates, turn out, upon closer inspection, to hold a different view.\n\nFor example, the Patristic theologian Tertullian famously asks \u201cWhat has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d but he never actually asserted the irrationalist credo \u201cI believe because it is absurd\u201d (De praescriptione haereticorum 7; De carne Christi 5.4; see also Harrison 2017). Instead, like all the Patristic fathers, Tertullian regarded human reason as one of God\u2019s greatest gifts; ratio (reason) is one of his most frequently used nouns, and his own writing draws heavily on the stoic philosophy of his day (Osborn 1997).\n\nTurning to a putative modern irrationalist, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard presents the incarnation as a paradox that offends human reason in his (pseudonymous) 1844 Philosophical Fragments, but close reading shows that \u201cparadox\u201d and \u201coffence\u201d do not equate to \u201cformal contradiction\u201d (1844 [1985: 53, 101]; Evans 1989). Rather, the incarnation seems paradoxical only to fallen, sinful human reason (1844, [1985: 46\u201347]). So the \u201coffence\u201d of the incarnation resolves into the claim that the doctrine of the incarnation had to be revealed, because its truth exceeds the limits of fallen reason. But, as discussed above, accepting this claim about the incarnation has been the norm throughout the Christian tradition. Moreover, according to Kierkegaard, even though the truth of the incarnation exceeds the limits of human reason, the claim that reason has limits is itself one that can be assessed by human reason (1846 [1992: 580]; Evans 1989: 355).\n\nFinally, the twentieth century theologian Karl Barth\u2019s famous \u201cNo!\u201d to philosophical reasoning about God is also best understood as a rejection of philosophical overreach rather than a rejection of philosophy per se (Brunner & Barth 1946). According to Barth, we cannot establish the truth of theological claims using generally persuasive arguments available to any rational enquirer. But Barth had no quarrel with using philosophy in an Anselmian mode, to elucidate and clarify the implications of divine revelation, and in principle he even allows that there could be a genuinely Christian philosophy (1932 [1975: 6]; Diller 2010).\n\nThese prominent Christian thinkers all criticize what they see as philosophical hubris, but they do not set philosophy and theology as such in essential opposition, and they do not agree that any belief-worthy Christian doctrines actually are irrational\u2014still less that they can be falsified by sound philosophical reasoning. In a way, this conclusion should be unsurprising. It is a basic claim of Christian orthodoxy that God is the very summit and source of rationality, and that human reason is one of God\u2019s greatest gifts (Turner 2004; A. N. Williams 2007; Crisp et al. 2012). Christian thinkers have differed about the degree to which sin and the Fall have caused human reason to malfunction, but the suggestion that theological truths conflict with properly functioning human reason is alien to the orthodox Christian tradition, and so it is unsurprising that few major Christian thinkers have endorsed it. Far more common is the claim that some theological truths are inaccessible to philosophy because they somehow surpass human reason. On this line, when there is an apparent conflict between a philosophical conclusion and some Christian truth, the conflict is treated as a sign that philosophy has overstepped its own proper boundaries, not a sign that Christian truth actually conflicts with human reason. By and large, even the sharpest Christian critics of philosophy have held this view.\n\n1.3 From Historical Models to Contemporary Philosophical Theology\n\nThis historical survey has focused on prominent models of the relationship between philosophy and theology in the history of Christian thought. The survey also illuminates some contemporary philosophical and theological debates about how to understand this relationship.\n\nNotwithstanding its Patristic origins, the Integrationist view has been especially prominent in recent philosophy of religion. For example, Alvin Plantinga\u2019s (1984) programmatic essay \u201cAdvice to Christian Philosophers\u201d intentionally blurs the distinction between philosophy and theology. Plantinga argues that Christian philosophers qua philosophers are entitled to base their arguments on revealed truths, and urges them to investigate distinctively Christian questions that may be of no interest to the wider philosophical community. More recent defenders of \u201canalytic theology\u201d have also taken an integrationist line. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of Enlightenment-style foundationalism has thoroughly blurred the distinction between philosophy and theology:\n\nWhat difference does [this distinction] make, now that analytic philosophers no longer believe that for some piece of discourse to be a specimen of philosophy, the writer must base all his arguments on public philosophical reason? Call it what you will. (Wolterstorff 2009: 168; see also Stump 2013: 48\u201349; Timpe 2015: 13)\n\nYet this prominent Integrationist line has been strongly criticized by other philosophers of religion, who implicitly endorse some version of the Contrast view, on which philosophy cannot legitimately appeal to theological sources of evidence like revelation and Church authority (Simmons 2019; Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2\u20134). At the same time, according to many Christian theologians, analytic philosophy as such is almost uniquely unsuitable for investigating properly theological questions (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013: 123\u2013134). On the view of these critics, analytic philosophical theology does not revive the Patristic integration of philosophy and theology at all; rather, it remains a distinctly anti-theological form of modern philosophy.\n\nContemporary philosophers and theologians continue to debate the proper relationship between philosophy and theology. Before considering these debates in further detail (in Section 3), however, it is useful to briefly survey recent work in analytic philosophical theology. The fact that the Integrationist view has been so prominent among contemporary analytic philosophers of religion has helped shape a philosophical climate in which self-identified philosophers, working in departments of philosophy, find it completely natural to investigate explicitly Christian theological questions, from within the framework of normative Christian orthodoxy, in the course of their academic work.\n\n2. Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology\n\nRecent work in analytic philosophical theology has engaged with nearly every major Christian doctrine. But work has focused on the most central doctrines: Trinity, Incarnation and Christology, Salvation and Atonement, and Sin and Original Sin. This section lays out the most significant philosophical problems associated with each doctrine and identifies some of the foundational philosophical responses from contemporary thinkers.\n\n2.1 Trinity\n\nAnalytic philosophical theology on the Trinity has focused primarily on the \u201clogical\u201d problem of the Trinity, the problem of how the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014construed as three really existing, really distinct divine entities\u2014can also be exactly one God (Cartwright 1987). The Church\u2019s first two ecumenical councils defined the orthodox terminology now used to state the doctrine, but the councils did not attempt a philosophical solution to the logical problem. In the traditional terminology, the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct divine persons (personae in Latin; hypostases in Greek) who share a single divine nature (substantia in Latin; ousia in Greek; see Tanner 1990: 5, 24, 28). The logical problem then becomes the problem of how three divine persons (whatever we mean by \u201cpersons\u201d) can instantiate a single divine nature (whatever we mean by \u201cnature\u201d) while remaining numerically distinct.\n\nResponses to the logical problem can be grouped into several families, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. \u201cSocial\u201d trinitarians defend an account of the Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct centers of consciousness, with three distinct centers of knowledge, will, and action, who nevertheless count as a single God. Social trinitarians attempt to secure the divine unity by arguing that a single divine nature can support three separate consciousnesses. They may also claim that the three persons necessarily love each other so perfectly and act in such harmony that they are properly regarded as a single God. Prominent social trinitarians include Richard Swinburne (1994), William Lane Craig (2006), Keith Yandell (2009), and William Hasker (2013).\n\nBy contrast, \u201cLatin\u201d trinitarians deny that the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinct centers of consciousness. On Latin trinitarianism, even though the Father, Son, and Spirit are numerically distinct persons, they are not numerically distinct divine agents. When they act, they do not merely act in perfect harmony (as on social trinitarianism). Rather they are (somehow) a single actor, with a single will, carrying out a single action. The special challenge for Latin trinitarianism is to explain how it can be the case that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so construed, really do exist as concrete, distinct entities, and are not just different names for the same entity, or different phases in the life of a not-essentially triune God. Brian Leftow offers the most well-developed Latin model, which appeals to an extended analogy to a time-travelling chorus-line dancer (2004).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the sharpest critics of Latin trinitarianism are those who advocate a social trinity, and vice-versa: each side insists that the theoretical costs of the opposing view are too great. So Latin trinitarians charge that social trinitarians do not escape tri-theism (Leftow 1999; see also Merricks 2006); social trinitarians argue that their Latin counterparts cannot explain how the Father and Son could have a genuine, \u201cI\u2013you\u201d, personal relationship, as the Biblical account seems to suggest (e.g., Matt 3:17, Mark 14:36; Hasker 2013: 114\u2013118; McCall 2010: 87\u201388).\n\nPhilosophical responses to the logical problem of the Trinity do not divide exhaustively into social models and Latin models. \u201cRelative identity\u201d theorists argue that identity is kind-relative, so the Father can be the same God as the Son without being the same person as the son (van Inwagen 1995). \u201cConstitution\u201d theorists make a similar claim by drawing on the metaphysics of constitution. According to constitution theorists, a lump of bronze can constitute a statue without being identical to it, since we can destroy the statue (by melting it down) without destroying the bronze. So too, they argue, the divine nature can constitute the three divine persons without being identical to them, or without entailing that they are identical to each other (Brower & Rea 2005). The metaphysics of constitution requires a coherent notion of \u201cnumerical sameness without identity\u201d. The sharpest criticism of relative identity accounts of the Trinity takes aim at the underlying notion that identity is kind-relative in the relevant sense. Similarly, the sharpest criticism of constitution views expresses doubts about the cogency and usefulness of the metaphysics of constitution (Merricks 2006).\n\nScott Williams defends a hybrid \u201cLatin social\u201d model of the Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are each constituted by the single divine nature, without being numerically identical to the divine nature or to any other person (2013, 2017). Unlike other Latin models, on Williams\u2019s account each of the persons is a distinct agent; unlike other social models, they share numerically one set of powers, including one will (2017). Even so, according to Williams, the persons can each token the indexical \u201cI\u201d with different senses. Critics argue that Williams\u2019s model falters at precisely this point (Hasker 2018b; see also S. Williams 2020).\n\nFor an extended discussion, see the entry, Trinity.\n\n2.2 Incarnation and Christology\n\nBy the close of the fourth century, the early Church had agreed that God the Son, the second person of the Trinity, is no less divine than God the Father. But this Trinitarian settlement led directly to another, equally vexing question: how could Jesus of Nazareth, a human man, also be identical to God the Son? After another period of intense debate, the Church defined the doctrine of the Incarnation, which asserts that Christ is one person (or one hypostasis) who exists in two natures, one fully human, the other fully divine (Tanner 1990: 83; Kelly 1978: 338\u2013343). Yet, as with the doctrine of the Trinity, on its own, this conciliar terminology does not attempt to solve the underlying philosophical problem.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, this problem has been called the \u201cfundamental philosophical problem of Christology\u201d. As Richard Cross puts it:\n\nhow is it that one and the same thing could be both divine (and thus, on the face of it, necessary, and necessarily omniscient, omnipotent, eternal, immutable, impassible, and impeccable) and human (and thus, on the face of it, have the complements of all these properties)? (Cross 2009: 453)\n\nIn other words, the fundamental philosophical problem of Christology is the problem that arises when a single subject bears incompatible properties. Christ seems to be both necessarily omniscient, as the divine Son, the second person of the Trinity, and yet also limited in knowledge, as the human man, Jesus of Nazareth\u2014and so on for other divine and human attributes. Yet Christ is one person, not two: he just is the divine Son and he just is Jesus of Nazareth. On standard interpretations of logical consistency, nothing can have logically incompatible properties at the same time and in the same respect\u2014hence the problem.\n\nA venerable attempted solution to the problem of incompatible properties makes use of grammatical modifiers to index Christological predications to their respective natures: Christ is limited in knowledge qua his human nature, and omniscient qua his divine nature, where \u201cqua\u201d means \u201cwith respect to\u201d or \u201cin virtue of\u201d. More simply: Christ qua human is limited in knowledge; Christ qua divine is omniscient. The thought of Thomas Aquinas furnishes a foundational source for this solution (Summa Theologiae 3.16.1\u201312; for broader discussion of patristic and medieval uses, see Cross 2002: 192\u2013205). Thomas Senor forcefully argues that this grammatical solution does not work, for it cannot block the relevant entailment: since the one Christ really is human and really is divine, it follows that the one Christ is also limited in knowledge (qua human) and omniscient (qua divine), and so the contradiction remains (Senor 2002; see also Morris 1986).\n\nKenotic Christologies hold that at the point of incarnation, in order to become a human being, God the Son relinquished the divine attributes (Forrest 2000; Evans 2002, 2006). In a way, the kenotic option neatly solves the problem of incompatible properties, since Christ is not omnipotent and omniscient (etc.) at the same time as he is limited in power and knowledge. Kenotic Christologies have a venerable pedigree, as well as some clear Biblical warrant (Philippians 2; for discussion see Evans 2006; McGuckin 1994 [2004: 189]. But if omnipotence and omniscience are essential divine attributes, then it is not possible for God the Son to relinquish them during the incarnation and regain them after the incarnation while remaining self-identical.\n\nCompositional Christologies try to solve the problem of incompatible properties by appealing to the various \u201cparts\u201d that together compose the whole Christ. According to Thomas V. Morris, Christ is composed of the divine mind of God the Son, a human mind, and a human body. On his telling, Christ counts as fully divine, because he has a divine mind, which is the seat of his omnipotence and omniscience; he also counts as fully human because he has a human mind and a human body (Morris 1986). Morris seeks to dispel the contradiction between divine and human attributes by revising our understanding of Christ\u2019s human attributes. Morris denies that human beings as such are essentially limited in power and knowledge (etc.). This move clears the way for attributing omnipotence and omniscience (etc.) even to the human, incarnate Christ, while also denying that the human, incarnate Christ is limited in power and knowledge. Richard Swinburne (1994) defends a similar Christology, but according to Swinburne, Christ is composed only of God the Son and a human body, which together constitute both a human way of thinking and acting and also a divine way of thinking and acting.\n\nOther compositional Christologies appeal to supposed mereological facts about the incarnation to ground a more sophisticated version of the \u201cqua move\u201d (discussed above). If God the Son has human parts and divine parts, then perhaps the whole mereological composite can borrow properties from its constituent parts without violating the law of non-contradiction. Analogously, we might say that an apple is both colored and not colored, since it is red (colored) with respect to its skin, but white (not colored) with respect to its flesh. There is a sense in which the apple as a whole is both colored and not colored because it borrows properties from its parts. Perhaps something similar can be said about Christ, understood as a mereological composite of God the Son, a human body, and a human soul. Leading advocates of this sort of view include Brian Leftow (1992, 2011) and Eleonore Stump (2002).\n\nTimothy Pawl (2014, 2016) seeks to dispel the fundamental problem by revising the truth conditions of Christological predications like \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d and \u201cChrist is limited in knowledge\u201d. According to Pawl, it is incorrect that \u201cbeing omniscient\u201d and \u201cbeing limited in knowledge\u201d are logically contradictory properties at all. In fact, according to Pawl, once we correctly understand their truth conditions, we can see that they can both be true of the same subject after all. On Pawl\u2019s account, \u201cChrist is omniscient\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is omniscient and \u201cChrist is limited in knowledge\u201d is true just in case Christ has a nature that is limited in knowledge. Because Christ, and only Christ (so far as we know) has two natures, only Christ can be both omniscient and limited in knowledge. At first glance, Pawl\u2019s proposed solution might seem to be the \u201cqua move\u201d once again, in different dress. But it is importantly different: Pawl is content to affirm the very entailments (e.g., \u201cChrist is omniscient and limited in knowledge\u201d) that the qua move seeks to block; he simply denies that this entailment is logically contradictory.\n\nJc Beall goes a step further and argues that some predicates really are both true and false of Christ, because Christ really is a contradictory being (2019, 2021). Beall defends a contradictory Christology because he accepts a non-standard model of logic, one on which some predicates can be neither true nor false of a subject, and other predicates can be both true and false of a subject. According to Beall, logic as such\u2014that is, his favored account of logic\u2014is neutral about whether any given substantive theory contains true contradictions. To determine whether it does, we must examine the theory\u2019s axiomatic statements. When we examine the axioms of orthodox Christology, according to Beall, we find that they include authoritative conciliar statements that are most naturally read as contradictory\u2014e.g., \u201cChrist is passible and impassible\u201d (2019: 415). Rather than revise or reinterpret such statements so that they are not contradictory, we should accept that they are.\n\n2.3 Atonement and Salvation\n\nArguably, the deepest and most fundamental Christian affirmation is that Christ saves. In traditional terminology, another way to express the same affirmation is that Christ \u201catones\u201d for the sins of human beings. Unlike the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation, however, the early Church never formally defined a single orthodox account of exactly how Christ saves or what it is about his life, death, and resurrection that accomplishes that saving work. As a result, a variety of theories or models of atonement have proliferated throughout the centuries. Contemporary work in analytic philosophical theology typically builds on these models, reformulates them in contemporary language, and seeks to defend them from criticism.\n\nSatisfaction models argue that as a result of their sinfulness, human beings have a debt or obligation to God that they cannot possibly repay. By becoming incarnate, living a sinless life, and voluntarily dying for the sake of humanity, Christ successfully discharges the debts and obligations that human beings owe to God. Anselm\u2019s \u201cWhy God Became Human\u201d (Cur deus homo) is the locus classicus for the satisfaction theory, which has more recently been defended by Swinburne (1988). Closely related to satisfaction models, penal substitution models claim that human beings deserve punishment from God as a result of their sinfulness. Christ saves by freely agreeing to be punished in their place. Mark Murphy (2009) proposes a similar model of \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d, on which Christ\u2019s suffering actually counts as the required punishment for guilty human beings, since knowing that a loved one suffers in one\u2019s place is itself a form of punishment.\n\nSatisfaction and penal substitution theorists must explain why a perfectly merciful God would require satisfaction or punishment from human beings at all, and why a perfectly just God would allow an innocent person to play the required role (Porter 2004). Accordingly, satisfaction and penal substitution views have been heavily criticized by modern and contemporary theologians for depicting God as a petty, wrathful tyrant. Adolph von Harnack\u2019s nineteenth-century criticism of Anselm remains representative. According to Harnack, Anselm\u2019s account depends on a\n\nmythological conception of God as the mighty private man, who is incensed at the injury done to His honor and does not forego His wrath till He has received an at least adequately great equivalent. (1899: 77)\n\nMore recently, feminist theologians and philosophers have criticized satisfaction and penal substitution views for valorizing suffering (Brown and Parker 1989).\n\nEleonore Stump (2018) argues that typical satisfaction and penal substitution accounts cannot address the sinner\u2019s persistent dispositions toward wrongdoing and concomitant feelings of shame. She dubs her positive proposal the \u201cMarian\u201d interpretation of atonement, and argues that it can explain how sinners are freed from shame and restored to fellowship with God. The proposal defies easy summary but it advances an account of atonement as union with God that is further explained using second-personal, psychological notions like \u201cmind-reading\u201d and empathy (2018: 138\u2013139). Christ on the cross mind-reads\u2014that is, psychically experiences\u2014the mental states of every human sinner. Sinful human beings are thereby united to Christ, and so to God. When the indwelling Holy Spirit leads sinners to respond to Christ with love, they also will what God wills. The resulting state of union with God also heals the stain on the soul that is the sinner\u2019s shame.\n\nSeveral other models, also prominent in the Patristic and medieval tradition, have so far received little attention from analytic philosophers of religion. These include \u201cransom\u201d theories on which human beings are freed from Satan\u2019s grasp, and especially \u201ctheosis\u201d or \u201cdivinization\u201d accounts of atonement and salvation, on which Christ\u2019s saving work consists in perfecting human beings so that they become as divine as a creature can be. (Jacobs 2009 and Mosser 2021 are important exceptions). Similarly, few contemporary philosophers defend the modern \u201cmoral exemplar\u201d model, on which Christ saves by being a perfect moral example for other human beings to imitate. (Quinn 1993 offers a highly qualified defense, but holds that Christ is more than just a moral exemplar).\n\n2.4 Sin, Original Sin, and the Fall\n\nThe doctrine of sin and the doctrine of atonement are correlative in the same way that a disease and its remedy are correlative. If sin is that from which Christ saves us, then the strength of the remedy (atonement) must vary according the severity of the disease (sin). As a first approximation, a sinful act can be thought of as a morally bad act for which the sinner is responsible. But the language of \u201csin\u201d adds something to the language of moral wrongdoing: a sin is a failure or fault with respect to God. Like other Christian doctrines, the doctrine of sin poses tricky philosophical problems. To see those problems more clearly, it is useful to disambiguate the doctrine of sin into several distinct components: the first sin, the Fall, original sin, and personal sin.\n\nFor extended discussion, see the entry sin in Christian thought.\n\n2.4.1 The First Sin\n\nThe problem of the first sin is the problem of how the very first sinful act is even possible, given various Christian axioms about the goodness and creative power of God, and various philosophical assumptions about the nature of freedom and moral responsibility. The problem of the first sin is sometimes treated as a question about the fall of Satan. It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to explain how Satan\u2014by hypothesis, an angel created by God with a rational intellect, an upright will, and wholly good desires and dispositions\u2014could ever make the sinful choice to reject God. Augustine (City of God, Book 12), Anselm (\u201cOn the Fall of the Devil\u201d De casu diaboli), and Duns Scotus (Ordinatio 2, dist. 6, q. 2 ) all wrestle with this problem. Contemporary philosophers who try to improve on their efforts include Barnwell (2009, 2017), MacDonald (1999), Rogers (2008), and Timpe (2012). Their responses all seek to explain how Satan\u2019s choice is metaphysically possible, by appealing to their own favored accounts of human freedom and conscious attention. Wood (2016) further distinguishes between the \u201chard problem\u201d of how Satan\u2019s sinful choice is metaphysically possible, and the \u201charder problem\u201d of how it can be subjectively rational\u2014rational from the point of view of Satan himself.\n\n2.4.2 The Fall of Adam and Eve\n\nThe biblical story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) recounts the story of the first human sin and its consequences. The traditional story of the fall of Adam and Eve does not seem consistent with either an evolutionary account of human origins or what we know about human history more generally. On some understandings, questions about the historicity of the Fall are not properly philosophical questions at all. Yet it does seem like a properly philosophical task to articulate a doctrine of the fall that is both internally consistent and consistent with other things we know to be true. Moreover, the doctrine of the Fall is conceptually connected to other aspects of the doctrine of sin as well as to the doctrine of salvation.\n\nPeter van Inwagen presents an account of the Fall that maintains many of its most important elements and, he claims, is consistent with evolutionary theory. Importantly, van Inwagen does not assert that this account is true, but only \u201ctrue for all we know\u201d (2004). In a similar vein, Hud Hudson (2014) offers an ingenious defense of a literal reading of the Genesis account that appeals to contemporary \u201cgrowing block\u201d theories of time. Despite initial impressions, neither van Inwagen nor Hudson are really concerned with defending quasi-literal readings of Genesis. Instead, they want to show that objections to those readings presuppose highly contestable philosophical\u2014rather than empirical or scientific\u2014assumptions.\n\n2.4.3 Original Sin\n\nIn Christian theology, \u201coriginal sin\u201d in the strictest sense refers to the human condition after the Fall and not to the first human sin itself. The fall is the cause of the condition of original sin: because of Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, subsequent human beings somehow \u201cinherit\u201d a disposition toward sin and an attraction toward evil that makes it inevitable that they will sin. On some stronger interpretations, all subsequent human beings are also justly regarded as guilty by God from birth, even before they have sinned themselves. Even apart from worries about the historicity of the fall, the philosophical challenges posed by this doctrine are obvious. How can people living now be morally responsible for the sins of the first human beings? What is the mechanism by which sin and guilt are \u201cinherited\u201d from past generations? If it is inevitable that all human beings will sin, can God justly punish them?\n\nSome Christian philosophers have simply rejected the stronger versions of the doctrine of original sin as incoherent. Swinburne, for instance, denies that all human beings are born guilty as a result of the sin of their first parents and argues that the condition of original sin only makes it very likely, rather than inevitable, that they will sin themselves (1989: 141\u201343). Other philosophers have attempted to show that even a strong doctrine of original sin can be philosophically coherent, given the right metaphysical framework. Michael Rea, for instance, draws on fission theory and the metaphysics of temporal parts to suggest a way that contemporary humans might bear responsibility for the sin of Adam by virtue of being counterparts or stages of Adam himself (2007). He also argues that a Molinist-inspired doctrine of \u201ctransworld depravity\u201d might accomplish much of what Christians want from the traditional doctrine of original sin (2007). John Mullen (2007) also constructs a Molinist account of original sin and inherited guilt. On Molinism, God knows all the true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, which means that God knows every free choice that every human being would make in every possible situation. According to Mullen, if it were true that every free creature would sin in an ideal, garden of Eden situation, then God could justly punish them in the actual world for what they would have done in that counterfactual world.\n\n2.4.4 Personal Sin\n\n\u201cPersonal sin\u201d refers to individual sinful acts. Because the philosophical problems associated with personal sin initially seem very similar to the problems associated with moral wrongdoing, there has been comparatively little philosophical work on personal sin. Still, important definitional questions remain about exactly how, if at all, sin should be distinguished from moral wrongdoing, whether there are sinful actions that are not immoral actions, and, conversely, whether there are immoral actions that are not sinful (Mitchell 1984; Dalferth 1984; Adams 1991; Couenhoven 2009).\n\n2.5 Other Topics\n\nThere are philosophical questions raised by nearly all Christian doctrines and practices, and so there are many fertile areas of inquiry that still remain comparatively underexplored. This brief survey has focused on the most widely treated areas of analytic philosophical theology. But some of the most creative work has branched out into other domains including the Eucharist (Arcadi 2018; Pickup 2015); liturgy, ritual, and worship (Cuneo 2016); bodily resurrection and personal identity (van Inwagen 1978; Merricks 1999; Zimmerman 1999; Rudder Baker 2001); heaven (Walls 2002; Ribeiro 2011), hell (Walls 1992; Adams 1993; Kvanvig 1993; Sider 2002; Buckareff & Plug 2005) and purgatory (Walls 2011; Dumsday 2014).\n\n2.6 The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n\nIn 2009 Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea published their edited volume Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology. The volume\u2019s contributors collectively try to make the case that analytic philosophy offers a valuable and neglected resource for Christian theologians. A new research program developed in its wake, and the ensuing years have seen the rise of a self-identified school of \u201canalytic theologians\u201d, who use the tools and methods of analytic philosophy to address Christian theological topics.\n\nAt present, it is not clear whether there is any meaningful difference between Christian \u201canalytic theology\u201d and Christian \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d, which has been treated as a kind of philosophy. As the discussion above indicates, analytic philosophical theology has been produced largely by Christian philosophers working in philosophy departments, rather than by theologians in departments of theology or divinity schools. Classic works of philosophical theology like Swinburne (1994) and Adams (2000) seem like analytic theology avant la lettre, for example, and much recent work called \u201canalytic theology\u201d seems quite similar to previous work called \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d or even \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d (e.g., Mullins 2016). Yet some self-described analytic theologians have also insisted that Christian analytic theology is really a form of theology (Torrance [Alan] 2013; Torrance [Andrew] 2019; Crisp, Arcadi, & Wessling 2019). They emphasize that Christian analytic theology is an internal project of faith seeking understanding that, as theology, holds itself accountable to scripture and Church tradition. Yet whether Christian analytic theology is properly regarded as a kind of philosophy or a kind of theology depends on how we draw the underlying distinction between philosophy and theology\u2014if indeed we draw such a distinction at all.\n\n3. Philosophy of Religion, Philosophical Theology, Christian Theology: Is There A Difference and Does it Matter?\n\nIt might seem odd that analytic philosophy of religion (APR) includes explicitly Christian philosophical theology of the sort discussed in Section 2. Yet most philosophers of religion working in the analytic tradition are Christian theists (Bourget & Chalmers 2014; De Cruz 2017). They avowedly want to explore their faith using analytic philosophical tools, and see no problem in calling their work Christian philosophy, philosophical theology, or more recently, \u201canalytic theology\u201d. Of course, philosophy of religion as such is broader than APR, and APR is broader than Christian APR. There are philosophers of religion whose work is analytic but not Christian (e.g., Lebens 2020; Mizrahi 2020; Steinhart 2020; Oppy 2018; Schellenberg 2018; Draper 2019), Christian but not analytic (e.g., Westphal 2001; Pattison 2011), and neither analytic nor Christian (e.g., Hammerschlag 2016; Burley 2016). Even so, the predominance of Christian philosophical theology\u2014or \u201cPlantinga-style Christian philosophy\u201d (Schellenberg 2018)\u2014within APR has recently reopened some contentious debates about the proper relationship between philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nThese debates can be grouped around two different\u2014and opposing\u2014lines of criticism. According to the first line, much APR is too Christian and too theological: not really philosophy at all, but a thinly-disguised form of Christian theology\u2014perhaps even a form of apologetics (Levine 2000; Knepper 2013: 9; Draper 2019: 2). Conversely, according to the second line, advanced by prominent theologians, APR is neither fully Christian nor fully theological. On this line of criticism, APR does not really wrestle with the transcendent God of Christian faith, but tends to construct and examine its own false \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d (Milbank 2009; Hart 2013; Oliver 2010; see also Harris & Insole 2005, 17). Although mutually opposing, both lines of criticism raise an important methodological question: how\u2014if at all\u2014should we distinguish philosophy about Christian topics from Christian theology? Section 1 (above) surveyed important responses to this question in the history of Christian thought. This section addresses the question in the context of contemporary challenges to analytic philosophy of religion.\n\n3.1 Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Too Theological?\n\nThe charge that APR is \u201ctoo theological\u201d can be disambiguated into two distinct worries. The first worry concerns the scope of APR when considered as a whole: APR is too narrow, because it focuses excessively on Christian theological topics, to the exclusion of other equally important matters. The second worry concerns the sources and methods of Christian APR specifically: the sources and methods of Christian APR belong more properly to theology than to philosophy.\n\n3.1.1 Narrowness of Scope?\n\nThe charge that APR as a discipline is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d or \u201ctoo theological\u201d could be understood as a worry about its scope: perhaps APR focuses too much on Christian theological topics, or at least on versions of monotheism that are compatible with Christianity, and is therefore too narrow in scope. Critics who advance the narrowness worry include Trakakis 2008, Wildman 2010, Knepper 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Lewis 2015, Jones 2019, Draper 2019, Timpe & Hereth 2019, Mizrahi 2020. Although the narrowness worry has wide currency, it is not always clear how to understand it as a properly philosophical criticism. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the narrowness worry is more often aimed at the field of APR as a whole, rather than at individual instances of APR. After all, the general claim that APR is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d does not entail that any specific argument of any specific philosopher is unsound. Similarly, even if it is true that APR as a whole should be \u201cless Christian\u201d, it is hard to see why that fact would require any individual philosopher to change her research and teaching focus (Schilbrack 2014: 12).\n\nStill, some versions of the narrowness worry are more philosophical than others. According to more philosophical versions, Christian APR frequently fails as philosophy: as a result of their Christian-theological biases, analytic philosophers of religion inadvertently make bad arguments. On this line, Christian analytic philosophers are especially likely to engage in motivated reasoning and ignore counter-arguments or alternative points of view drawn from other religious traditions. Because APR is so narrow, Christian philosophers unwittingly work in an echo-chamber or an epistemic bubble (Schilbrack 2014: 14; Draper 2019: 5; De Cruz 2020). As a result, according to critics, the conclusions of their putatively philosophical arguments are often unwarranted for anyone outside the Christian community, even when they purport to be generally probative.\n\nLess philosophical versions of the narrowness worry assert the general principle that APR should be more capacious, and should include more non-Christian voices, without explicitly challenging the soundness of specific analytic arguments (Knepper 2013; Carroll 2016; Mizrahi 2020). Here the worry is simply that APR does not\u2014but should\u2014reflect the diversity of religious and non-religious viewpoints that actually obtain in the world. Phrased differently, APR as a field wrongly excludes too much good philosophical work that just happens not to fit into the dominant Christian, monotheistic paradigm. Yet one can hold this view without also agreeing that existing APR fails on its own terms or that any specific philosophers should alter their practices.\n\n3.1.2 Inappropriate Methods?\n\nThe charge that APR is too theological could also be understood as a question about philosophical methodology. On this version of the charge, Christian APR does not begin from generally accessible assumptions and argue toward generally acceptable conclusions, as good philosophy should. Instead, it typically begins from Christian assumptions and argues toward Christian conclusions, like theology.\n\nJ.L. Schellenberg, for example, argues that philosophy must seek solutions to philosophical problems that are in principle \u201cshareable\u201d by any member of the philosophical community. Because much Christian APR assumes the truth of Christianity, its solutions cannot satisfy this condition, and should properly count as theology rather than philosophy (Schellenberg 2018). J. Aaron Simmons agrees: even though theology \u201ccan and should\u201d appeal to evidence restricted to \u201cdeterminate communities defined by revelational authorities\u201d, philosophy should appeal to \u201cevidence that is, in principle, accessible by all members of the philosophical community\u201d (2019: 147). According to Simmons, the dominant strand of APR has ignored this criterion, and threatens to \u201cbecome simply a subset of Christian theological practice\u201d (2019: 149; see also Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2).\n\n3.1.3 Responses to the Worry that APR is \u201cToo Theological\u201d\n\nAnalytic philosophers of religion have a variety of ways to respond to the charge that APR is too theological. First, with respect to the narrowness charge, they can accuse critics of mistaking the part for the whole, by denying that the charge applies to APR as such, and by pointing to those analytic philosophers of religion who neither assume nor defend the truth of Christianity. Yet this response is undercut by the fact that non-Christian practitioners of APR often make the narrowness themselves (Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019). Second, its defenders also emphasize that much Christian APR does not actually assume the truth of Christianity at all, but instead argues for that truth. (Hasker 2018a: 90; citing Swinburne is a paradigmatic example). This kind of philosophy would clear even Schellenberg\u2019s \u201cshareable in principle\u201d bar. Similarly, even those philosophical projects that eschew Swinburne-style natural theology might still clear the \u201csharable in principle\u201d bar so long as they engage only in defensive maneuvers\u2014for example, by answering philosophical objections to the plausibility of Christian claims (e.g., van Inwagen 1995; Pawl 2014).\n\nOthers argue that even explicit appeals to Christian revelation could in principle still count as philosophical appeals, albeit indirectly. Suppose we agree that theology can appeal to revelation, while philosophy trades only in \u201cgenerally accessible\u201d arguments. We still must distinguish between direct, first-order appeals to revelation, and indirect, second-order arguments that it is sometimes permissible to appeal to revelation (Wood 2021: 213\u2013215). The second-order arguments could still be generally accessible philosophical arguments, even though the first-order appeals are not. For example, a first-order \u201ctheological\u201d appeal might be: \u201cThe New Testament asserts p; therefore p\u201d. But a philosopher might offer a general epistemological argument, accessible to anyone in the philosophical community, to defend the rationality of that same first-order appeal. (For example, she might offer a general argument that it is rational to form beliefs based on testimony, and the same general argument might establish that it is rational to treat the New Testament as testimonial evidence.) In a similar vein, Plantinga\u2019s claim that belief in God may be \u201cproperly basic\u201d is not itself presented as a Christian assumption or a revealed truth, but as a specific application of his general philosophical theory of warrant, which he has defended at length (1983, 1993a, 1993b).\n\nFinally, because there is no single uncontested way to understand the boundaries between philosophy and theology, it is open to Christian philosophers of religion simply to deny the sharp distinction presupposed by critics like Schellenberg and Simmons (see, for example, Plantinga 1984, Wolterstorff 2009). In so doing, they would implicitly endorse a more Patristic \u201cIntegration\u201d model instead of either the Medieval \u201cCooperation\u201d model or the modern \u201cDisjunction\u201d model (see Section 2 above).\n\n3.2 Or Not Theological Enough? Theological Critiques of Analytic Philosophy of Religion\n\nWhile one set of critics accuse APR of becoming too theological, another set takes the opposite line. According to several prominent theologians and philosophers, something about the analytic style of philosophizing makes APR particularly unsuitable for investigating Christian doctrines. On this line of criticism, far from becoming a species of Christian theology, APR is constitutively opposed to Christian theology, and the problem with analytic philosophical theology is not that it is too theological but that it is too analytic. This criticism takes several forms.\n\nSometimes, theological objections to APR simply reiterate Barthian objections to natural theology, presumably on the assumption that most APR is really a form of natural theology (Moore 2007). Other critics charge analytic philosophers of religion with historical anachronism and ignorance of the Christian tradition. Perhaps \u201ca-historical\u201d analytic philosophers of religion do not understand pre-modern ways of thinking and reading (so runs the charge), and so they wrongly believe that their own constructive work is congruent with the historic Christian tradition, when it in fact depends modern assumptions that are inimical to the Christian tradition (Hart 2013: 123, 129; Milbank 2009: 320). Other critics press the related worry that APR ignores the real Christian tradition altogether in favor of theorizing its own abstract, self-constructed version of the Christian god. Here APR\n\ndoes not deal with the God of any tradition or encounter, but with a conceptual construct, a simulacrum or \u2018the God of the philosophers\u2019\u2026. (Oliver 2010: 467\u2013468; see also Hyman 2010)\n\nAnother multi-faceted line of theological criticism criticizes APR for \u201cidolatry\u201d, \u201cunivocity\u201d, and \u201contotheology\u201d. This line reflects the general worry that APR does not take divine mystery or transcendence seriously enough. \u201cOntotheology\u201d is a theological term of opprobrium that, in its current usage, derives from Heidegger (1957; see also Marion 1982 [1995]). It means, roughly, treating God like \u201ca being\u201d or \u201ca thing in the world\u201d. According to its theological critics, APR constitutively assumes that God is a possible object of human knowledge, even apart from revelation, and therefore treats God as fundamentally similar to any other object \u201cout there\u201d passively waiting to be discovered. Yet a God like this (so runs the worry) is not really God at all, but something else\u2014an idol.\n\nThe worry about ontotheology and idolatry is also a worry about univocity\u2014the view that our terms bear the same meaning when applied to God and creatures (Trakakis 2010). According to opponents of theological univocity, precisely because God is not \u201ca being\u201d or a \u201cthing in the world\u201d, God and creatures differ absolutely; they share no properties and so cannot be described by univocal predications. (So, e.g., the word \u201cgood\u201d cannot have the same meaning in the statements \u201cGod is good\u201d, and \u201cSocrates is good\u201d.) Worries about theological predication and univocity date back to the Patristic period, but in contemporary philosophy of religion, they are best understood as continuations of the late medieval disputes between followers of Duns Scotus, who defends univocal predication, and his Thomist opponents (T. Williams 2005; Burrell 2008; Cross 2008). As a generalization, most contemporary analytic philosophers of religion endorse a univocal account of theological language, whereas contemporary Christian theologians are more likely to deny univocity in favor of analogical or metaphorical predication, or even non-predicative forms of theological language (Pickstock 2005; Marion 1999).\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp rhetoric, there has been very little direct engagement between analytic philosophers of religion and their theological opponents on these questions. T. Williams (2005), Cross (2008) defend univocal predication, and Adams (2014) tries to rehabilitate ontotheology. Other analytic thinkers offer their own positive accounts of divine transcendence (Crisp and Rea [eds.] 2009: 9\u201311; Rea 2015, 2020; Jacobs 2015). More generally, analytic philosophers and theologians have a variety of strategies for avoiding the deleterious consequences of univocity and ontotheology (Wood 2021: 130\u201374)."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kantianism", "page_content": "Nature and types of Kantianism\n\nThe Kantian movement comprises a loose assemblage of rather diverse philosophies that share Kant\u2019s concern with exploring the nature, and especially the limits, of human knowledge in the hope of raising philosophy to the level of a science in some sense similar to mathematics and physics. Participating in the critical spirit and method of Kant, these philosophies are thus opposed to dogmatism, to expansive speculative naturalism (such as that of Benedict de Spinoza, the Dutch Jewish rationalist), and, usually, to irrationalism. The various submovements of Kantianism are characterized by their sharing of certain \u201cfamily resemblances\u201d\u2014i.e., by the preoccupation of each with its own selection of concerns from among the many developments of Kant\u2019s philosophy: a concern, for example, with the nature of empirical knowledge; with the way in which the mind imposes its own categorial structure upon experience, and, in particular, with the nature of the structure that renders human knowledge and moral action possible, a structure considered to be a priori (logically independent of experience); with the status of the Ding an sich (\u201cthing-in-itself\u201d), that more ultimate reality that presumably lurks behind the apprehension of an object; or with the relationship between knowledge and morality.\n\nA system such as the critical philosophy of Kant freely lends itself to reconstructions of its synthesis according to whatever preferences the private philosophical inclinations of the reader may impose or suggest. Kant\u2019s system was a syncretism, or union, of British empiricism (as in John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume) that stressed the role of experience in the rise of knowledge; of the scientific methodology of Isaac Newton; and of the metaphysical apriorism (or rationalism) of Christian Wolff, who systematized the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, with its emphasis on mind. Thus, it constituted a synthesis of elements very different in origin and nature, which tempted students to read their own presuppositions into it.\n\nThe critical philosophy has been subjected to a variety of approaches and methods of interpretation. These can be reduced to three fundamental types: those that conceive of the critical philosophy as an epistemology or a pure theory of (scientific) knowledge and methodology, those that conceive of it as a critical theory of metaphysics or the nature of being (ultimate reality), and those that conceive of it as a theory of normative or valuational reflection parallel to that of ethics (in the field of action). Each of these types\u2014known, respectively, as epistemological, metaphysical, and axiological Kantianism\u2014can, in turn, be subdivided into several secondary approaches. Historically, epistemological Kantianism included such different attitudes as empirical Kantianism, rooted either in physiological or psychological inquiries; the logistic Kantianism of the Marburg school, which stressed essences and the use of logic; and the realistic Kantianism of the Austrian Alois Riehl. Metaphysical Kantianism developed from the transcendental idealism of German Romanticism to realism, a course followed by many speculative thinkers, who saw in the critical philosophy the foundations of an essentially inductive metaphysics, in accordance with the results of the modern sciences. Axiological Kantianism, concerned with value theory, branched, first, into an axiological approach (properly so-called), which interpreted the methods of all three of Kant\u2019s Critiques\u2014Critik der reinen Vernunft (1781, rev. ed. 1787; Critique of Pure Reason), Critik der practischen Vernunft (1788; Critique of Practical Reason), and Critik der Urteilskraft (1790; Critique of Judgment)\u2014as normative disciplines of thought, and, second, into an eclectic or relativistic Kantianism, which regarded the critical philosophy as a system of thought dependent upon social, cultural, and historical conditions. The chief representatives of these submovements are identified in the historical sections below.\n\nIt is essential to distinguish clearly between two periods within the Kantian movement: first, the period from 1790 to 1831 (the death of the German idealist G.W.F. Hegel) and, second, the period from 1860 to the present\u2014separated by a time when an antiphilosophical positivism, a type of thought that supplanted metaphysics with science, was predominant. The first period began with the thorough study and emendation of Kant\u2019s chief theoretical work, the Critique of Pure Reason, but it soon became intermingled with the romantic tendencies in German idealism. The second period, called specifically Neo-Kantianism, was first of all a conscious reappraisal, in whole or in part, of the theoretical Critique but was also, as a total system, a reaction against positivism. Earlier Neo-Kantianism reduced philosophy to the theory of knowledge and scientific methodology; systematic Neo-Kantianism, arising at the beginning of the 20th century, expressed itself in attempts at building metaphysical structures."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics/", "page_content": "First published Tue Sep 16, 2003; substantive revision Wed Feb 1, 2023\n\nThe difficulties of assessing Plato\u2019s ethical thought are compounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to change during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there are no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes beyond the human realm. This changes in the middle dialogues, that show a growing interest in an all-encompassing metaphysical grounding of knowledge, a development that leads to the positing of the \u2018Forms\u2019 as the determinants of the true nature of all things, culminating in the Form of the Good as the transcendent principle of all goodness. Though the theory of the Forms is not confined to human values but encompasses the whole of nature, Plato in the middle dialogues seems to assume no more than an analogy between human affairs and cosmic harmony. The late dialogues, by contrast, display a increasing tendency to assume a unity of the microcosm of human life and the macrocosmic order of the entire universe, a tendency that is displayed most fully in the Philebus and the Timaeus. While these holistic tendencies appeal to the imagination, because they rely on harmonic relations expressed in mathematical proportions, the metaphysical status of the Forms is even harder to make out in the late dialogues than in the middle dialogues. Though Plato\u2019s late works do not show any willingness to lower the standards of knowledge as such, Plato indicates that his design of a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an acknowledgement that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic treatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his last political work, the Laws.\n\nPlato\u2019s so-called \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues share certain characteristics as a group. They are short interrogations by Socrates of the kind indicated in his explanation of his divine mission in the Apology. They seem designed, inter alia, to undermine unquestioned traditional views and values rather than to develop positive accounts. The positive accounts contained in the middle, the so-called \u2018Platonic\u2019, dialogues \u2013 that are grouped around the Republic \u2013 treat happiness in different ways as a state of perfection in a moral as well as in an intellectual sense. The exact nature of this state of mind is not easy to pinpoint, however, because it is based on metaphysical presuppositions that are, at least prima facie, both hazy and out of the realm of ordinary understanding. There is not, as there is in Aristotle, an explicit determination of happiness as the actualization of one\u2019s best potential in a well-organized community. Instead, at least in some texts, Plato\u2019s moral ideals appear both austere and self-abnegating: The soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the body in the pursuit of higher knowledge, while communal life demands the subordination of individual wishes and aims to the common good.\n\nLike most other ancient philosophers, Plato maintains a virtue-based eudaemonistic conception of ethics. That is to say, happiness or well-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought and conduct, and the virtues (aret\u00ea: \u2018excellence\u2019) are the dispositions/skills needed to attain it. If Plato\u2019s conception of happiness is elusive and his support for a morality of happiness seems somewhat subdued, there are several reasons. First, he nowhere defines the concept or makes it the direct target of investigation, but introduces it in an oblique way in the pursuit of other questions. Second, the treatment of the human good varies in the different dialogues, so that readers find themselves confronted with the problem of what to make of the discrepancies beween different works. This touches on a fundamental problem with Plato\u2019s work \u2013 namely whether to follow a \u2018unitarian\u2019, \u2018revisionist\u2019, or \u2018developmentalist\u2019 approach to his writings. Whereas unitarians regard the dialogues as pieces of one mosaic, and take the view that Plato in essence maintains a unified doctrine from his earliest to his latest works, revisionists maintain that Plato\u2019s thought underwent a fundamental transformation later in his life, while \u2018developmentalist\u2019 hold that Plato\u2019s views evolved significantly throughout his career. While revisionism has lost its impact in recent years, developmentalism has gained in influence. Although there is no unanimity, few unitarians nowadays deny that the character of Plato\u2019s early, middle, and late works differs in style, language, scope, and content, as is to be expected in a philosopher who was at work for more than fifty years. Most developmentalists, in turn, agree that it is impossible to line up Plato\u2019s works like pearls on a string and to reconstruct his progress from dialogue to dialogue; where the views expressed in different dialogues seem to disagree there may be complementation or supplementation at work, rather than divergence. Given that Plato never speaks in his own voice, it is important to take note of who the interlocutors are and what role is assigned to Socrates, if he is the main speaker. Plato\u2019s dialogues should never be treated in isolation when it comes to the reconstruction of his doctrine; but even the comparison and contrasting of ideas presented in different dialogues is not a safe recipe for interpreting this elusive thinker\u2019s views (for a more detailed discussion see the entry on Plato ).\n\nIf ethics is widely regarded as the most accessible branch of philosophy, it is so because many of its presuppositions are, seemingly, self-evident or trivial truths: All human actions, for example, serve some end or purpose; whether they are right or wrong depends on the agent\u2019s overall aims. At least for secularists, the attainment of these overall aims is regarded as a major condition of the good life. What we regard as a life worth living also depends on the notion we have of our own nature and of the conditions of its fulfillment. This, in turn, is determined, at least in part, by the values and standards of the society we live in. Personal ends and purposes depend in each case not only on reason, but also on the individual agents\u2019 dispositions (i.e., their ingrained likes and dislikes, which determine their personal character). The attainment of these ends can also depend at least in part on external factors, such as health, material prosperity, social status, and even on good looks or sheer luck.\n\nAlthough these presuppositions may seem self-evident, most of the time human beings are aware of them only implicitly, because they lead their lives in accordance with pre-established standards and values that are, under normal circumstances, not objects of reflection. It is only in times of crisis that a society\u2019s traditions and precepts are challenged by someone like Socrates, who sees the need to disturb his fellows\u2019 complacency. The historical Socrates was, of course, not the first to question the Greek way of life. Presocratic philosophers such as Xenophanes, Heraclitus, or Empedocles had been critics of their times, and the sophists had argued provocatively that, contrary to the na\u00efve view, it is custom and convention, rather than nature that set the standards for what is deemed right or wrong, good or bad, in every society. But if other thinkers preceded Socrates with moral and social criticism, he was certainly the first to challenge his fellows on an individual basis on the ground that \u2018the unexamined life is not worth living\u2019 (Ap. 38a). Whatever position one may take in the controversy concerning the degree to which Plato\u2019s early dialogues are true to the historical Socrates\u2019 discussions, the independent testimony of Xenophon leaves little doubt that Socrates\u2019 cross-examinations (elenchos) provoked the kind of enmity against him that led to his conviction and execution. In the eyes of conservative Athenians, Socrates\u2019 questioning undermined the traditional values of their society. As Socrates saw it, the \u2018virtues\u2019 \u2013 which is to say the social skills, attitudes, and character-traits possessed by most Athenian citizens of his time \u2013 were all too often geared towards their possessors\u2019 wealth, power, and capacities for self-indulgence, to the detriment of public morality and the community\u2019s well-being (see the entry on Socrates).\n\nThe Socratic legacy prompted Plato to engage in a thorough examination of the nature of knowledge and reality, an examination that gradually took him far beyond the scope of the historical Socrates\u2019 discussions. Nevertheless, Plato continued to present most of his investigations as dialogues between Socrates and some partner or partners. And Plato preserved the dialogical form even in those of his late works where Socrates is replaced by a stand-in and where the didactic nature of the presentations is hard to reconcile with the pretense of live discussion. But these didactic discourses continue to combine questions of ethical, political, social, or psychological importance with metaphysical, methodological and epistemological considerations. And it can be hard to assess the extent to which Plato agrees with the pronouncements of his speakers, whether that speaker is Socrates or anyone else. Furthermore, the fact that a certain ethical problem or its solution is not mentioned in a certain dialogue does not mean that Plato was unaware of it. There is, therefore, no certainty concerning the question: \u201cWhat did Plato see and when did he first see it?\u201d The lack of information about the order in which Plato wrote his works adds to this difficulty. It stands to reason, however, that he started with the short dialogues that question traditional virtues \u2013 wisdom, courage, justice, moderation, piety. It also stands to reason that Plato gradually widened the scope of his investigations, by reflecting not only on the social and political conditions of morality, but also on the logical, epistemological, and metaphysical presuppositions of a successful moral theory. These theoretical reflections often take on a life of their own. Several of Plato\u2019s later works address ethical problems only marginally or not at all. The Parmenides, the Theaetetus, and the Sophist deal primarily or exclusively with epistemological and metaphysical problems of a quite general nature. Nevertheless, as witnessed by the Philebus, the Statesman, the Timaeus, and the Laws, Plato never lost interest in the question of the conditions of the good human life.\n\nThe early \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues are not concerned with the question of the good life and its conditions in general, but rather with particular virtues. Socrates explores these virtues through discussions with persons who are regarded either as representatives of, or claim to be experts on, that virtue. Socrates\u2019 justification for this procedure is that a paragon or expert must know the property that characterizes his particular virtue, and must therefore be able to give an account or definition of it (cf. Xenophon Memorabilia I, 10; 16). Thus, in the Euthyphro, Socrates discusses piety/holiness with an alleged \u2018expert\u2019 on religious affairs. In the Laches, he discusses courage with two renowned generals in the Peloponnesian war, Laches and Nicias. Similarly, in the Charmides Socrates addresses\u2014somewhat ironically\u2014the nature of moderation with two of the later Thirty Tyrants, namely with the then very young Charmides, an alleged model of modesty, and his guardian and intellectual mentor, Critias. In the Greater Hippias Socrates raises the question of the nature of the beautiful with a producer of \u2018beautiful things\u2019, the sophist and polymath Hippias. In the Protagoras Socrates focuses on the question of the unity of virtue in a discussion with Protagoras, the most famous teacher of \u2018civic virtues\u2019 among the sophists. And in the Gorgias Socrates discusses the nature of rhetoric and its relation to virtue with the most prominent teacher of rhetoric among the sophists. Finally, in the Meno the question of how virtue as such is acquired is raised by Meno, a disciple of Gorgias and an ambitious seeker of power, wealth, and fame, who later met a gruesome death in Persia in the pursuit of those very values.\n\nSocrates\u2019 interlocutors are usually at first quite confident about their own competence in the discussion. Nor is such confidence unreasonable. If virtue is a kind of \u2018skill\u2019 or a special property that enjoys general recognition, its possessor should know and be able to give an account of that skill or proficiency. As Socrates\u2019 examinations demonstrate, however, such self-confidence is usually unfounded and the \u2018knowledge\u2019 professed by Socrates\u2019 partners is revealed to be at best an implicit familiarity. When they are confronted with their inability to explain the nature of their cherished virtue or expertise, they end up admitting their ignorance, but often with considerable chagrin or anger (on the \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues see the entry in SEP Plato\u2019s Shorter Ethical Works by Paul Woodruff). Socrates\u2019 purpose in conducting these sometimes cruel-looking games is not just to undermine the false confidence of his interlocutors, but also to pave the way towards general definitions and standards concerning the virtues. There were no widely acknowledged standards of definition in Socrates\u2019 time, but by exposing the flaws in his partners\u2019 abortive arguments in his investigations Socrates contributed significantly to the development of such standards. The respective flaws vary greatly in kind and gravity: Socrates shows that enumerations of examples are not sufficient to capture the nature or essence of the virtue in question. Definitions that consist in the replacement of the concept in question with a synonym are open to the same objections as the original definition. Definitions may be hopelessly vague or miss the mark entirely, which is to say that they may be either too wide and include unwanted characteristics or subsets, or too narrow so that they exclude essential characteristics. Moreover, definitions may be incomplete because the object in question does not constitute a unitary phenomenon. If generally accepted \u2018social excellences\u2019 are not simple conditions, they may be subject to conflicting convictions. Examples of all these problems are provided in Plato\u2019s early dialogues, where Socrates exposes the exact nature of the underlying deficiencies with more or less diagnostic transparency.\n\nGiven that the focus in the early dialogues is almost entirely on the exposure of flaws and inconsistencies, one cannot help wondering whether Plato himself knew the answers to his queries, and had some cards up his sleeve that he chose not to play for the time being. This would presuppose that Plato had not only a clear notion of the nature of the different virtues, but also a definitive conception of the good life as such. Since Plato was neither a moral nihilist nor a sceptic, he cannot have regarded moral perplexity (aporia) as the ultimate end, nor regarded continued mutual examination, Socratico more, as a way of life for everyone. Perplexity, as is argued in the Meno, is just a wholesome intermediary stage on the way to knowledge (Me. 84a\u2013b). But if Plato assumes that the convictions that survive Socratic questioning will eventually coalesce into a coherent account of the good life, then he keeps this expectation to himself. Nor would such optimism seem warranted, given Socrates\u2019 disavowal of knowledge. There is no guarantee that only false convictions are refuted in a Socratic cross-examination, while true ones are retained; for promising suggestions are often as mercilessly discarded as their less promising brethren. Perhaps Plato counted on his readers\u2019 intelligence to straighten out what is skewed in Socratic refutations, as well as to detect unfair moves, and to supplement what is missing. It is, in fact, often not difficult to make out problematic or fallacious moves in Socrates\u2019 argument and to correct them; but such corrections must remain incomplete without sufficient information about Plato\u2019s overall conception of the good life and its moral presuppositions at that point of time. It is therefore a matter of conjecture whether Plato himself held any positive views while he composed one aporetic dialogue after the other. He may have regarded his investigations as experimental stages, or have seen each dialogue as an element in a network of approaches that he hoped to integrate eventually.\n\nIf there is a general lesson to be drawn from the many failed accounts of the virtues by Socrates\u2019 different partners, beyond the particular shortcomings of individual definitions and assertions, it is that isolated definitions of single virtues, summed up in one sentence, will not do. The evidence that Plato wanted his readers to draw this very conclusion already in his early dialogues is somewhat contradictory, however. He famously pleads for the unity of the virtues in the Protagoras, and seems intent to reduce them all to knowledge. Scholars are therefore wont to speak of the \u2018intellectualistic\u2019 character of the so-called \u2018Socratic ethics\u2019, because it leaves no room for other motivational forces, such as desires and emotions. Socrates\u2019 proof in the Protagoras that reason cannot be overcome by the passions has, from Aristotle on, been treated as a denial of akrasia, of the phenomenon that was later somewhat misleadingly dubbed as \u2018weakness of the will\u2019. This intellectualizing tendency does not tell us, however, what kind of master-science would fulfill all of the requirements for defining virtues, and what its content should be. Moreover, the emphasis on knowledge does not rule out an awareness on Plato\u2019s part of the importance of other factors, even in his early dialogues. Though Plato often compares the virtues with technical skills, such as those of a doctor or a pilot, he may have realized that virtues also involve emotional attitudes, desires, and preferences, but not yet have seen a clear way to coordinate or combine the rational and the affective elements that constitute the virtues. In the Laches, for instance, Socrates\u2019 partners struggle when they try to define courage, invoking two different elements. In his attempt to define courage as \u2018steadfastness in battle\u2019, Laches, one of the two generals and \u2018experts\u2019 on courage, is faced with the dilemma that steadfastness seems not to be a satisfactory definition of courage either in itself or in combination with knowledge (La. 192a\u2013194c). His comrade Nicias, on the other hand, fails when he tries to identify courage exclusively as a certain type of knowledge (197e\u2013200a). The investigation of moderation in the Charmides, likewise, points up that there are two disparate elements commonly associated with that virtue \u2013 namely, a certain calmness of temper on the one hand (Chrm. 158e\u2013160d) and self-knowledge on the other (166e\u2013175a). It is clear that a complex account would be needed to combine these two disparate features. For moral skills not only presuppose sufficient \u2018operative\u2019 rationality but also require appropriate evaluative and emotional attitudes towards the ends to be attained and towards the means to be employed. Such an insight is at least indicated in Socrates\u2019 long and passionate argument in the Gorgias against Polus and Callicles, that the just life is better for the soul of its possessor than the unjust life, an argument that he fortifies with a mythical depiction of the soul\u2019s reward and punishment after death (523a\u2013527e). But the nature of justice, and what is required for the proper care of one\u2019s soul, is thereby illuminated only indirectly. For the most part, Socrates\u2019 interrogations focus on the incompatibility of his interlocutor\u2019 selfish aims with their more selfless and noble tendencies. In his earlier dialogues, Plato may or may not already be envisaging the kind of solution that he is going to present in the Republic to the problem of the relationship between the different virtues, with wisdom, the only purely intellectual virtue, as their basis. Courage, moderation, and justice presuppose a certain steadfastness of character as well as a harmony of purpose between the disparate parts of the soul, but their goodness depends entirely on the intellectual part of the soul, just as the virtue of the citizens in the just state depends on the wisdom of the philosopher kings (R. 428a\u2013444e). The existence of \u2018demotic\u2019 virtues of character is thus acknowledged, but they are relegated to second place (500d; 522a\u2013b).\n\nThere are at least some indications that Plato already saw the need for a holistic conception of the good life when he composed his \u2018Socratic\u2019 dialogues. At the end of the Laches, he lets Nicias founder in his attempt to define courage as the \u2018knowledge of what is to be feared and what should inspire confidence\u2019. Nicias is forced to admit that such knowledge presupposes the knowledge of good and bad tout court (La. 199c\u2013e). In a different but related way, Socrates alludes to a comprehensive knowledge at the end of the Charmides. In his final refutation of Critias\u2019 definition of moderation as \u2018knowledge of knowledge\u2019, he urges that this type of knowledge is insufficient for the happy life without the knowledge of good and bad (Chrm. 174b\u2013e). Pointing out what is wrong or missing in particular arguments is a far cry from a philosophical conception of the ultimate good in human life. But the fact that Plato insists on the shortcomings of a purely \u2018technical\u2019 conception of virtue suggests that he was at least facing up to these problems. The discussion of the \u2018unity of the virtues\u2019 in the Protagoras \u2013 regardless of the probably intentionally unsatisfactory structure of its proofs \u2013 confirms that Plato realized that a critique of the inconsistencies implied in conventional values is insufficient to justify such a unitary point of view. Nevertheless, the evidence that Plato already had a unified conception of the good life in mind when he wrote his earlier dialogues remains, at most, indirect.\n\nIt may be helpful to begin with a consideration of the method of ethical inquiry that Socrates is portrayed as using in the early dialogues. A reflection on the meaning of Socrates\u2019 quest for definitions in the early dialogues suggests that Plato cannot have been blind to the sterility of a purely negative way of argument, or if he was blind at first, his blindness cannot have lasted long; for Socrates\u2019 quest for definitions has important consequences. First and foremost, definitions presuppose that there is a definable object, that is to say, it must have a stable nature. Nothing can be defined that is of a variable nature. In addition, the object in question must be a unitary phenomenon, even if its unity may be complex. If definitions are to provide the basis of knowledge, they require some kind of essentialism. This presupposition is indeed made explicit in the Euthyphro, where Plato employs, for the first time, the terminology that will be characteristic of his full-fledged theory of Forms. In response to Euthyphro\u2019s enumeration of various examples of pious behavior, Socrates demands an account of the one feature (Euthphr. 5d: idea; 6d: eidos; 6e: paradeigma) that is common to all cases of what is holy or pious. Despite this pregnant terminology, few scholars nowadays hold that the Euthyphro already presupposes transcendent Forms, in a realm of their own \u2013 models that are only incompletely represented by their representatives under material conditions. The terms eidos and idea had preserved their original meaning of \u2018look\u2019 or \u2018shape\u2019 into the classical age, but they were also often used in the more abstract sense of \u2018form\u2019, \u2018sort\u2019, \u2018type\u2019, or \u2018kind\u2019. No more than piety or holiness in the abstract sense seems to be presupposed in the discussion of the Euthyphro. There is, at any rate, no mention of any separation of a sensible and an intelligible realm, let alone of an existence of \u2018the holy itself\u2019, as a transcendent entity.\n\nThe passage in the Euthyphro where Socrates asks Euthyphro to identify the one feature that is common to all that is holy or pious makes intelligible, however, the reason why Plato felt encouraged to develop the conception of transcendent Forms. The requisite unity and invariance of entities such as \u2018the holy\u2019, \u2018 the beautiful\u2019, \u2018the just\u2019 or \u2018the equal\u2019, necessarily prompts reflections on their ontological status and on the appropriate means of access to them. Given that they are the objects of definition and the models of their ordinary representatives, there is every reason not only to treat them as real, but also to assign to them a higher kind of unity and perfection. And once this step has been taken, it is only natural to make certain epistemological adjustments. For, access to paradigmatic entities is not to be expected through ordinary experience, but presupposes some special kind of intellectual insight. It seems, then, that once Plato had accepted invariant and unitary objects of thought as the subject of definition, he was predestined to follow the path that led him to adopt a metaphysics and epistemology of transcendent Forms. The very fact that mathematics was already an established science with rigorous standards and unitary and invariant objects seems to have greatly enhanced Plato\u2019s confidence in applying the same standards in moral philosophy. It led him to search for models of morality beyond the limits of everyday experience. This, in turn, explains the development of his theory of recollection and the postulate of Forms as transcendent immaterial objects as the basis of both reality and thought that he refers to in the Meno, and that he presents more fully in the Phaedo.\n\nWe do not know when, precisely, Plato adopted this mode of thought, but it stands to reason that his contact with the Pythagorean school on his first voyage to Southern Italy and Sicily around 390 BC played a major role in that development. Mathematics as a model-science has several advantages. It deals with unchangeable entities that have precise definitions. It also makes plausible the claim that the essence of these entities cannot be comprehended in isolation but only in a network of interconnections that have to be worked out at the same time as each particular entity is defined. Thus, to understand what it is to be a triangle, it is necessary \u2013 inter alia \u2013 to have a clear notion of the nature of points, lines, planes, and their interrelations. That Plato was aware of that fact is indicated in his introduction of the theory of recollection in the Meno, 81d: \u201cAs the whole of nature is akin, and the soul has learned everything, nothing prevents a man, after recalling one thing only \u2013 a process men call learning \u2013 discovering everything else for himself, if he is brave and does not tire of the search; for searching and learning, are, as a whole, recollection (anamnesis).\u201d The somewhat mystifying claim of an \u2018overall kinship\u2019 is then illuminated by the famous \u2018mathematical experiment\u2019 (Me. 82b\u201385c). The slave manages, with some pushing and pulling by Socrates, and thanks to some illustrations drawn in the sand, to double the area of a given square. In the course of this interrogation, the disciple gradually discovers the relations between the different lines, triangles, and squares. That Plato regards these interconnections as crucial features of knowledge is subsequently confirmed by the distinction that Socrates draws between knowledge and true belief (97b\u201398b). As he argues, true beliefs are unreliable, because they behave like \u2018the statues of Daedalus that easily run away as long as they are not tied down\u2019. The requisite \u2018tying down\u2019 happens (98a) \u201cby giving an account of the reason why. And that, Meno my friend, is recollection, as we previously agreed. After they are tied down, in the first place, they become knowledge, and then they remain in place.\u201d This explanation indicates that, according to Plato, knowledge does not consist in a mere mental \u2018gazing\u2019 at isolated models, but rather in uncovering the invariant relations and interrelations that constitute the objects in question.\n\nThe complexity underlying Plato\u2019s theory of the Forms as it surfaces in the Phaedo is easily overlooked, because its discussion initially suggests that recollection is no more than the grasping of concepts. Thus, the concept of \u2018exact equality in size\u2019 is prompted by the perception of more or less equal-seeming sticks and stones (74a\u2013e). The same condition applies to the other examples of Forms, 65d\u2013e: \u201cDo we say that there is such a thing as the Just itself or not? And the Beautiful, and the Good? [\u2026] I am speaking of all things such as Tallness, Health, Strength, and in a word, the reality of all other things, that which each of them essentially is.\u201d But Plato does not employ his newly established metaphysical entities as the basis for working out a definitive conception of the human soul and the appropriate way of life in the Phaedo. Rather, he confines himself to warnings against the contamination of the soul by the senses and their pleasures, and quite generally against corruption by worldly values. He gives no advice concerning human conduct, beyond the recommendation of a general abstemiousness from worldly temptations. This seems a rather austere picture of human life, and an egocentric one, to boot, for nothing is said about relations between human beings, beyond Socrates\u2019 exhortations that his friends should likewise take care of their souls as best they can. It is unclear whether this otherworldly and ascetic attitude is the sign of a particularly pessimistic period in Plato\u2019s life or whether it merely reflects the circumstances of the discussion \u2013 Socrates\u2019 impending death. But as long as this negative or other-worldly attitude towards the physical side of human nature prevails, no interest is to be expected on the part of Plato in nature as a whole \u2013 let alone in the principles of the cosmic order (but cf. 5.1 below). But it is not only the apparent asceticism that stands in the way of a wider perspective. Socrates himself seems to have been quite indifferent to the study of nature. While in the Phaedo Socrates confesses his inability to deal with the causes of natural processes, the Apology contains an energetic denial of any concern with natural philosophy on Socrates\u2019 side. The accusations that depict him as \u201ca student of all things in the sky and below the earth\u201d are quite unfounded (18c); he has never conversed on such issues at all, and the attribution to him of the Anaxagorean tenet that the sun is a stone and the moon consists of earth is a sign of his accusers\u2019 recklessness (26d\u2013e). Similarly, in the Phaedrus, Socrates explains his preference for the city and his avoidance of nature (230d): \u201cLandscapes and trees have nothing to teach me \u2013 only the people in the city can do that.\u201d That Plato is not distorting the facts here is confirmed by the testimony of Xenophon, who is equally emphatic about Socrates\u2019 repudiation of the study of heavenly phenomena and his concentration on human affairs (Memorabilia I 1.15\u201316). If Plato later takes a much more positive attitude towards nature in general, this is a considerable change of focus. In the Phaedo, he quite deliberately confines his account of the nature of heaven and earth, with its heavenly order and hellish geography, to the myth about the soul\u2019s afterlife (108d\u2013114c). As he states in conclusion, this mythical depiction is not to be taken literally, but as an encouragement to heed its moral message and to take care of one\u2019s soul (114d\u2013e). This is as constructive as Plato gets in his earlier treatment of the principles of ethics.\n\nIf Plato went through a period of open-ended experimentation and tentative suggestions, this stage was definitely over by the time he wrote the Republic, the central work of his middle years. Because of the Republic\u2019s importance a more detailed account will be provided here, in order to explain the ethical principles set forth in that work; for these principles are closely intertwined with Plato\u2019s political, psychological, and metaphysical conceptions. That the work represents a major change in Plato\u2019s thinking is indicated already by the dialogue\u2019s setting. The aporetic controversy about justice in the Republic\u2019s first book is set off quite sharply against the constructive discussion that ensues in its remaining nine books. Like the Gorgias, the first book presents three interlocutors who defend, with increasing vigor and contentiousness, their notion of justice against Socrates\u2019 elenchos. Of these disputes, the altercation with the sophist Thrasymachus has received most attention, because he defends the provocative thesis that natural justice is the right of the stronger, and that conventional justice is at best high-minded foolishness. The counter-arguments employed by Socrates at the various turns of the discussion will not be presented here. Though they reduce Thrasymachus to angry silence, they are not above criticism. Socrates himself expresses dissatisfaction with their result of this discussion R. 354c: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, the result is that I know nothing, for when I don\u2019t know what justice is, I\u2019ll hardly know whether it is a kind of virtue or not, or whether a person who has it is happy or unhappy.\u201d But for once, the speakers\u2019 confession of aporia is not the end of the discussion. At the beginning of the next book two members of the audience, Plato\u2019s brothers Glaucon and Adeimantus, challenge Socrates: Perhaps Thrasymachus has defended his case badly; but if Socrates wants to convince his audience, he must do better than that. The brothers demand a positive account both of what justice is and of what it does to the soul of its possessor.\n\nThe change of character in the subsequent discussion is remarkable. Not only are the two brothers not subjected to elenchos, they get ample time to elaborate on their objections (357a\u2013367e). Though they profess not to be convinced that injustice is better than justice, they argue that in the present state of society injustice pays \u2013 with the gods as well as with humans \u2013 as long as the semblance of respectability is preserved. To prove this claim the brothers play devil\u2019s advocate by unfolding a scathing picture of their society\u2019s attitude towards justice. As the story of the Ring of Gyges and its gift of invisibility proves, everyone who does not have a god-like character will eventually succumb to such a ring\u2019s temptations (359c\u2013360d). Instead of the wolf of Thrasymachus\u2019 account, it is the wily fox who is the paragon of injustice (365a-d). He will succeed at every level, because he knows how to play the power-game with cunning. The just man, by contrast, pays no heed to the mere semblance of goodness, rather than to its substance, and therefore must suffer a Christ-like fate, because he does not comply with the demands of favoritism and blandishment (361e). Even the gods, as the poets confirm, are on the side of the successful scoundrel, since they can be propitiated by honors and sacrifices. Given this state of affairs, a logic-chopping argument that justice is better than injustice is quite insufficient (367b\u2013e: log\u00f4i). Instead, Socrates must show what effect each of them has on the soul of their possessors. As this critique indicates, Plato at this point clearly regards refutation as an insufficient way to making true converts. Whether he ever had such confidence in the power of refutation must remain a moot point. But the Republic shows that the time had come for a positive account of morality and of the good life. If elenchos is used in Plato\u2019s later dialogues, it is never again used in the knock-down fashion of the early dialogues. But in his treatment of justice Plato does not directly resort to the theory of Forms. Instead, he develops a political and psychological model as a solution to the problem of the nature of justice. That there is also a metaphysical way to determine the nature of justice is indicated only briefly and enigmatically, when Plato speaks of a \u2018longer way\u2019 that would also have been possible for him to take (435d; 504b)\n\nA brief sketch of Plato\u2019s inquiry into the nature of justice must suffice here, to make intelligible his distinction of justice from the other kinds of virtue and of their role in the good life (for a more penetrating analysis see the entry Plato\u2019s Ethics and Politics by Eric Brown). This question is addressed in a quite circuitous way. Justice is first to be studied in the \u2018larger text\u2019 of the state, rather than in the hard-to-decipher \u2018small text\u2019 of the individual soul. A study of how a city comes to be will supposedly reveal the origin of justice and injustice (369a). Its founding principle is \u2013 at least at first \u2013 no high-minded concern of humankind, but mutual economic need: \u201cA city comes to be because none of us is self-sufficient (autark\u00eas), but we all need many things. \u2026 And because people need many things, and because one person calls on a second out of one need (chreia) and on a third out of a different need, many people gather in a single place to live together as partners and helpers.\u201d The \u2018need\u2019 is, at least at this point, purely economic. The minimal city is based on the need for food, clothing, shelter, and for the requisite tools. It is economic efficiency that dictates the adoption of the principle of the \u2018division of functions\u2019: It is best if everyone performs the task s/he is naturally most fit for. This principle determines not only the structure of the minimal, self-subsistent state of farmers and craftsmen, but also the subsequent division of the city\u2019s inhabitants into three classes in the \u2018fevered state\u2019 that caters to higher demands. For a more luxurious city needs protection by a professional army as well as the leadership of a class of philosopher-kings and -queens. Beyond the claim that the division of functions is more economical, Plato gives no justification for this fateful decision that determines the social order in the state, as well as the nature of the virtues. Human beings are not born alike, but with different abilities that predestine them for different tasks in a well-ordered state. This leads to Plato\u2019s principle: \u2018one person \u2013 one job\u2019 (R. 370a\u2013c; 423d).\n\nBecause the division of functions paves the way for the definition of justice as \u2018doing your own thing and not meddling with that of others\u2019 in Book IV (432d\u2013433b), it is necessary to briefly review the kind of social order Plato has in mind, the psychological principles he assumes, and the political institutions by which that order is to be secured. For this explains not only the establishment of a three-class society and the explanation of the corresponding structure of the soul, but also Plato\u2019s theory of education and the metaphysical underpinnings. That economic needs are the basis of the political structure does not, of course, mean that they are the only human needs Plato recognizes. It indicates, however, that the emphasis here is on the unity and self-sufficiency of a well-structured city, not on the well-being of the individual (423c\u2013e; 425c). This focus should be kept in mind when assessing the \u2018totalitarianism\u2019 and the rigorous cultural conservatism of the political philosophy of Plato\u2019s middle years.\n\nThe need for a professionally trained army leads to the discussion of education and moral psychology, because the preservation of internal peace and external security presupposes the combination of two quite different character-traits among the \u2018guardians\u2019 (\u2018the philosophical watchdogs\u2019, 375d\u2013376c): friendliness towards their fellow-citizens and fierceness towards their enemies. The injunctions concerning the citizens\u2019 education are very detailed, because it must combine the right kind of \u2018muses\u2019 (poetry, music, and other fine arts) with the appropriate physical training, in order to develop the right temperament and attitude in the soldiers (376d\u2013403d). The organisation and supervision of education is the special task of the third class, that of the rulers of the city (412b\u2013417b). They are to be selected through tests of both intelligence and character from among the soldiers \u2013 individuals who are unshakable in their conviction that their own well-being is intimately tied to that of the city. To ensure that members of the military and the ruling class retain the proper attitude towards their civic duties, members of both classes must lead a communal life, without private homes, families, or property. When Socrates\u2019 interlocutors object that such a life is not apt to make these citizens happy, the topic of happiness is addressed for the first time; but Socrates quickly brushes it aside at this point, on the ground that the political order is designed to make the entire city happy, rather than any one particular group (419a-e).\n\nThe division of functions that leads to the separation of the three classes for the purpose of achieving the social conditions for justice concludes the discussion of the social order (427d\u2013434c). The peculiar manner in which Socrates further develops his explation of the nature of justice can best be understood with reference to the upshot of this discussion. The catalogue of what in later tradition has been dubbed \u2018the four cardinal Platonic virtues\u2019 \u2013 wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice \u2013 is first presented without comment. Piety, as the text indicates, is n\u03bft treated as a virtue; religious practices should, rather, be left to tradition and to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi on the ground that: \u201cWe have no knowledge of these things (427b\u2013c).\u201d The definition of justice is to be discovered by a process of elimination. If there are four virtues in the city, then justice must be the one that is left over after the other three have been identified . There is no proof offered that there are exactly four virtues in a state, nor that they are items that can be lifted up, singly, for inspection, like objects from a basket. Instead, Socrates points out the role they play in the maintenance of the social order. About wisdom (sophia), the only purely intellectual virtue and the exclusive possession of the rulers, little more is said at this point than that it is \u2018good council\u2019 (euboulia) in decisions about the internal and external affairs of the city. Courage (andreia) is the soldiers\u2019 specific virtue. Socrates takes some trouble explaining its nature, because it is a mixture of belief (doxa) and steadfastness of character (s\u00f4t\u00earia). It is compared to colorfast wool: through thick and thin the guardians must be dyed-in-the-wool adherents to the laws\u2019 decrees about what is to be feared and what is to be faced with confidence. Moderation (s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) is not an intellectual excellence either, but rather a combination of belief with a certain disposition to support order. It is a conviction (doxa, 431e) shared by all classes about who should rule \u2013 a conviction based on a state of \u2018order\u2019 (kosmos), \u2018consonance\u2019 (sumph\u00f4nia) and \u2018harmony\u2019 (harmonia). The state\u2019s third class, then, has no specific virtue of its own. Finally, the identification of justice is due to the sudden insight on Socrates\u2019 part that justice is the principle that has been at work all along in the founding of the model state \u2013 namely that everyone is to \u201cdo their own thing and not meddle with that of another\u201d (433a).\n\nThe promise to establish the isomorphic structure of the city and soul has not been forgotten. After the definition and assignment of the four virtues to the three classes of the city, the investigation turns to the role and function of the soul\u2019s virtues. The soul is held to consist of three parts, corresponding to the three classes in the city. The lengthy argument for the tri-partition of the soul into a rational (logistikon), a spirited (thumoeides), and an appetitive (epithum\u00eatikon) part (434d\u2013441c), can here be neither reproduced nor subjected to a critical evaluation. That Plato lets Socrates express reservations concerning the adequacy of his own procedure, despite his unusually circumspect way of justifying the division of the soul\u2019s faculties, indicates that he regards it as an important innovation. Indeed, there is no indication of separate parts of the soul in any of the earlier dialogues; irrational desires have been attributed, there, to the influence of the body. In the Republic, by contrast, the soul itself becomes the source of the appetites and desires. The difference between the rational and the appetitive part is easily justified, because the opposition between the decrees of reason and the various kinds of unreasonable desires is familiar to everyone. The existence of a third, a \u2018spirited\u2019 or courageous part \u2013 different from both reason and appetite \u2013 is harder to prove. But the phenomenon of moral indignation is treated as evidence for a psychic force that is reducible neither to reason nor to any of the appetites; it is rather an ally of reason in a well-ordered soul, a force opposed to the unruly appetites. This concludes the proof that there are three parts in the soul, corresponding to the three classes in the city \u2013 namely the rational part representing the wisdom of the rulers, the spirited part, manifest in the courage of the soldiers, and the appetitive part that motivates the rest of the population in its quest for material gain.\n\nThe discussion of the division of the soul sets the stage for the final determination of the contrast between justice and injustice (441c-445e): There will be justice in the city if the members of all three classes mind their own business; similarly in the individual soul, there will be justice if each each part of the soul fulfills its own function properly. This presupposes that the soul\u2019s two upper parts have been given the right kind of training and education in order to control the appetitive part. The three other virtues are then assigned to the respective parts of the soul. Courage is the excellence of the spirited part, wisdom belongs to the rational part, and moderation is the consent of all three parts about who should rule and who should obey. Justice turns out to be the overall unifying quality of the soul; for the just person not only refrains from meddling with what is not his, externally, but also harmonizes the three parts of the soul, internally. While justice is order and harmony, injustice is its opposite: it is a rebellion of one part of the city or soul against the others, and it results in the inappropriate rule of their inferior parts. Justice and injustice in the soul are, then, analogous to health and illness in the body. This comparison suffices to bring the investigation to its desired result: If justice is health and harmony of the soul, then injustice must be disease and disorder. Hence, it is clear that justice is a good state of the soul that makes its possessor happy, and injustice is its opposite. As no-one in his right mind would prefer to live with a ruined body, so no-one would prefer to live with a diseased soul. In principle, the discussion of justice has therefore reached its promised goal already at the end of Book IV. Socrates has met Glaucon\u2019s and Adeimantus\u2019 challenge to prove that justice is a good, in and by itself, for the soul of its possessor, and preferable to injustice.\n\nThat the Republic\u2019s discussion does not end here but occupies six more books, is due most of all to several loose ends that need to be tied up. Apart from the fact that reason and order are to reign supreme, little has been said about the citizens\u2019 way of life. This gap will be filled, at least in part, by the description of the communal life of the upper classes without private property and family in Book V. More importantly, nothing has been said about the rulers and their particular kind of knowledge. This is a crucial point because, as the definitions of the three \u2018inferior\u2019 virtues show, their quality is contingent on the rulers\u2019 wisdom. Socrates addresses this problem with the provocative thesis (473c\u2013d): \u201cUntil philosophers rule as kings or those who are now called kings and leaders genuinely and adequately philosophize ... cities will have no rest from evils, nor will the human race.\u201d This thesis starts the discussion of the philosophers\u2019 knowledge and of their upbringing and education, which will continue through Books VI and VII. Because they also introduce the special objects of the philosophers\u2019 knowledge, these books provide the metaphysical underpinning of the entire conception of the good soul and the good state. For the \u2018Form of the Good\u2019 turns out to be the ultimate source of all being and knowledge. A short summary of the upshot of the educational program must suffice here. The future philosophers, both women and men, are selected from the group of guardians whose general cultural training they share. If they combine moral firmness with quickness of mind, they are subject to a rigorous curriculum of higher learning that will prepare them for the ascent from the world of the senses to the world of intelligence and truth, an ascent whose stages are summed up in the similes of the Sun, the Line, and the Cave (508a\u2013518b). To achieve this ascent, the students have to undergo, first, a preparatory schooling of ten years\u2019 duration in the \u2018liberal arts\u2019: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and theoretical harmonics (518c\u2013531c). Afterwards they are admitted to the training in the master-science of \u2018dialectic\u2019, a science that supposedly enables its possessor to deal in a systematic way with the objects of real knowledge \u2013 the Forms in general, \u2013 and with the Form of the Good in particular, \u2013 the principle of the goodness of all else (531c\u2013535a). This study is to last for another five years. Successful candidates are then sent back into the Cave as administrators of ordinary political life for 15 years. At the age of fifty the rulers are granted leave to pursue philosophy; but even that pursuit is interrupted by periods of service as overseers over the order of the state. This completes, in a nutshell, the description of the philosopher-kings\u2019 and -queens\u2019 education and activities (539d\u2013541b).\n\nPlato\u2019s design of an autocratic rule by an aristocracy of the mind has received a lot of flak. But our assessment of his politics must here be limited to that of the kind of happiness it supposedly provides. Regardless of whether or not we find plausible Plato\u2019s assumption of an overall principle of the Good as the basis of the political order, his model state has, at least in theory, the advantage that it guarantees both internal and external peace. That is no mean feat in a society where interstate and civil wars were a constant threat, and often enough ended in the destruction of the entire city. In addition, the division of functions guarantees a high degree of efficiency, if every citizen does what he/she is naturally suited to do. But what about the citizens\u2019 needs, beyond those for security and material goods? Are they to find their life\u2019s fulfillment only in the pursuit of their jobs? Plato seems to think so, when he characterizes each class by its specific kind of desire and its respective good (581c): the philosophers are lovers of wisdom (philosophoi), the soldiers lovers of honor (philotimoi), and the workers are lovers of material goods (philochr\u00eamatoi). That human beings find, or at least try to find, satisfaction in the kinds of goods they cherish is a point that is further pursued in the depiction of the decay of the city and its ruling citizens, from the best \u2013 the aristocracy of the mind \u2013 down to the worst \u2013 the tyranny of lust, in Books VIII and IX. A discussion of the tenability of this explanation of political and psychological decadence will not be attempted here. It is supposed to show that all inferior forms of government of city and soul are doomed to fail because of the inherent tensions between the goods that the different citizens aim for.\n\nSome brief comments on Plato\u2019s conception of happiness are in order, at this point. He clearly goes on the assumption that human beings are happy insofar as they achieve the goals they cherish. Though this notion seems to come close to the \u2018preference satisfaction\u2019 for all citizens that is nowadays regarded as the primary aim of every liberal state, Plato\u2019s restriction of each class to one type of good must seem objectionable, most obviously in the case of the citizens of the third class who supposedly covet nothing but material goods. This \u2018reductive\u2019 view of their human nature militates not only against present-day intuitions: it should also militate against Plato\u2019s own moral psychology, in that all human souls consist of three parts \u2013 a rational, a spirited, and an appetitive part \u2013 whose health and harmony constitute the soul\u2019s and the state\u2019s happiness. Why, then, reduce the third class to animal-like creatures with low appetites, as suggested by the comparison of the people to a strong beast that must be placated (493a\u2013c)? This comparison is echoed later in the comparison of the soul to a multiform beast, where reason just barely controls the hydra-like heads of the appetites, and manages to do so only thanks to the aid of a lion-like spirit (588c\u2013590d). Is Plato thereby giving vent to anti-democratic sentiments, showing contempt for the rabble, as has often been claimed? He can at least be cleared of the suspicion that the workers are mere serfs of the upper classes, because he explicitly grants them the free enjoyment of all the customary goods that he denies to the upper classes (419a): \u201cOthers own land, build fine big houses, acquire furnishings to go along with them, make their own private sacrifices to the gods, entertain guests, and also, of course, possess what you were talking about just now, gold and silver and all the things that are thought to belong to people who are blessedly happy.\u201d \u2018Appetite\u2019 is clearly not confined to food, drink, and sex. But apart from the granting of material largesse, the members of the third class are quite neglected in Plato\u2019s ideal city. Apparently no education is provided for them; for there is no suggestion that they participate in the guardians\u2019 musical and athletic training, and there is no mention that obedience to the rulers\u2019 commands is not the only source of happiness for the third class. Plato seems to sidestep his own insight that all human beings have an immortal soul and have to take care of it as best they can, as he not only demands in the Phaedo but is going to confirm in a fanciful way in the Myth of Er at the end of Republic Book X.\n\nThe life-style designated for the upper classes also seems open to objections. The soldiers\u2019 musical and physical training is strictly regimented; they must take satisfaction in the obedience to the laws for the sake of preserving the city\u2019s inner and outer peace, and in the deeds of valor in war. Theirs is an austere camp-life; not all of them will be selected for higher education. But even the philosophers\u2019 lives leave a lot to be desired, and not only because they have to starve their common human appetites and devote many years to administrative duties back in the \u2018Cave\u2019. Their intellectual pursuits are also not altogether enviable, as a closer inspection would show. Not only do the philosophers have two jobs \u2013 in violation of the rule \u2018one person \u2013 one function\u2019 \u2013 in that they are responsible for both administrative work and philosophical thought. They are also not to enjoy open-ended research, but are rather subject to a mental training that is explicitly designed to turn their minds away from the enjoyment of all worldly beauty in order to focus exclusively on the contemplation of the Forms. This is indicated by the injunctions concerning the study of astronomy and harmonics (529a\u2013531d): the students are not to crane their necks to watch the beauty of the \u201cembroidery in the heavens\u201d, but rather to concern themselves with the ideal motions of ideal moving bodies, in a purely geometrical fashion, and they are not to listen to audible sounds, but to attend to the mathematics of harmonics. The universe is not treated as an admirable cosmos, with the explicit purpose of providing moral and intellectual support to the citizens, in the way Plato is going to explain in the Philebus, the Timaeus and in the Laws. Given these limitations of the philosophers\u2019 mental exercises in the Republic, the claim that their lives are 729 times more pleasant than the tyrants\u2019 (IX 587e) seems like a gross exaggeration, even if they enjoy the pleasures of being filled with pure and unadulterated truths while everyone else enjoys only semblances of the really real (581e\u2013588a).\n\nFor all the advances that the Republic represents in certain respects, Plato\u2019s ideal city must seem to us far from ideal. The system resembles a well-oiled machine where everyone has their economic niche and function; but its machine-like character must seem repellent to us, given that no deviations are permitted from the prescribed pattern. If innovations are forbidden, no room is left for creativity and personal development. Plato seems to presuppose that the fulfillment of a person\u2019s function is sufficient to secure her happiness, or at least that is suggested by the \u2018functional\u2019 argument that defeats Thrasymachus (352d\u2013354a). It states that every object, animal, and person has a specific function or work (ergon). If it performs its function well, it does well: for a living thing, \u2018doing well\u2019 means \u2018living well\u2019 and living well is tantamount to \u2018living happily\u2019. Though Socrates\u2019 refutation of Thrasymachus is found wanting as a proof of justice\u2019s superiority, the ergon-argument is nowhere revoked. On the contrary, it is affirmed by the principle of \u2018one person \u2013 one job\u2019 that is the very basis of Plato\u2019s ideal city. But the confinement of everyone\u2019s activities to just one kind of work seems rather a narrow one in the case of the citizens of the third class, given that they are not permitted to engage in politics, even if it may be economically most efficient. These features suffice to make the ideal life in Plato\u2019s city unattractive to us, not to speak of certain other features that have not been explored here, such as the communal life envisaged for the upper classes and the assignment of sexual partnerships by a lottery that is rigged for the purposes of eugenics. But the feature that must strike us as strangest about Plato\u2019s depiction of his citizens\u2019 lives is that he does not acknowledge the one factor that could throw a more favorable light on the life of the third class, the life of tailors, carpenters, doctors, architects, sailors, i.e., that they will take pride and joy in their own work and in what they produce, given that they each in their own way make valuable contributions to the community\u2019s well-being, without which the city could not function. Plato does not seem to acknowledge this when he addresses them, rather ungraciously, as \u2018money-lovers\u2019, indicating that he regards material gain as the only motivating factors in their lives.\n\nHave these deficiencies escaped Plato\u2019s notice? Justified as this critique must seem, it should be pointed out that Plato is clearly not concerned with the conditions that would make his city attractive to all citizens. His aim is rather more limited: he wants to present a model, and to work out its essential features. The same explanation applies to his depiction of the city\u2019s and its citizens\u2019 decay in Books VIII and IX. Contrary to certain critics\u2019 assumptions, Plato is not there trying to predict and explain the course of history. Rather, he wants to explain the generation and decay typical of each political system and the psychopathology of its leaders. Plato finds the basis of both in the specific values \u2013 be they honor, money, freedom, or lust \u2013 that are embedded in the constitutions of the different types of state. It is unlikely that Plato presupposes that there are in reality pure representatives of these types, though some historical states may have been better representatives of those types than others. But the question remains whether he had a notion of the fact that his black-and-white picture of civic life in the model-state disregards the claim of individuals to have their own aims and ends, and not to be treated like automata, with no thoughts and wishes of their own. Though the Republic contains some suggestions that would mitigate this bleak picture, for the sake of balancing this picture it is more fruitful to look at other works of Plato\u2019s middle period that concentrate on and prioritize the conditions of the individual soul rather than focus on the demands of the community. These works are the Symposium and the Phaedrus. For though each dialogue should be studied as a unity of its own, it is also necessary to treat the different dialogues as part of a wider picture.\n\nThe Symposium and the Phaedrus are two dialogues that focus on the individual soul and pay no attention to communal life at all. Instead, they concentrate on self-preservation, self-improvement, and self-completion. The Symposium is often treated as a dialogue that predates the Republic, most of all because it mentions neither the immortality nor the tripartition of the soul. But its dramatic staging \u2013 the praise of Eros by a company of symposiasts \u2013 is not germane to the otherworldly and ascetic tendencies of the Gorgias and the Phaedo. In addition, Plato has good reasons for leaving aside a discussion of the soul\u2019s separability from the body in the Symposium (a feature it shares with the much later Philebus). He aims to show, there, that love is an incentive, not only for all humans, but for all other living beings as well. Contrary to all previous speakers, Socrates denies that Eros is a god, because the gods are in a state of perfection. Love, by contrast, is a desire by needy creatures (endeeis) for the beautiful and the good (199c\u2013201c). Socrates thereby corrects the previous speakers\u2019 confusion of love itself with the beloved object. This important insight is presented not as Socrates\u2019 own, but as the upshot of a \u2018lecture on the nature of love by the wise priestess Diotima\u2019 (201d\u2013212b): Eros is a powerful demon, a being between (metaxu) what is mortal and what is immortal, an ever needy hunter of the beautiful. Human beings share that demonic condition; for they are neither good nor bad, but desire the good and the beautiful, the possession of which would constitute happiness for them. Because all people want happiness, they pursue the good as well as they can (205a\u2013206b). In each case they desire the particular kinds of objects that they hope will fulfill their needs. Such fulfillment is not a passive possession; it is rather the appropriation of the objects of love that are deemed to be essential in the struggle for self-preservation, self-completion, and self-fulfillment (207d): \u201cFor among animals the principle is the same as with us, and mortal nature seeks so far as possible to live forever and be immortal. And this is possible in one way only: by reproduction, because it leaves behind a new young one in place of the old.\u201d There is, then, a constant need for self-restoration and self-improvement by procreation in the quest for an \u2018earthly immortality\u2019 manifest in all living things (206e et pass.). This need is explained by Diotima with an impressive depiction of the constant flux that all organisms undergo, that in the case of humen beings not only affects their physical constitution but their moral and intellectual condition as well. Without constant replenishment none of them even stays the same over time (207c-208b).\n\nIn the case of human beings these needs express themselves in different ways. The search for \u2018self-eternalization\u2019 may result in, or even be fulfilled by, the production of biological children or of so-called \u2018children of the mind\u2019 (e.g. works of art), or even by the creation of order in the city that is then guided by the virtues of justice and moderation (209a\u2013e). Diotima\u2019s lecture is finally crowned by a depiction of the famous scala amoris \u2013 the explanation of the refinement and sublimation that a person experiences when recognizing higher and higher kinds of beauty (210a\u2013212a). Starting with the love of one beautiful body, the individual gradually learns to appreciate not only all physical beauty, but also the beauty of the mind, and in the end she gets a glimpse of the supreme kind of beauty, namely the vision of the Form of the Beautiful itself \u2013 a beauty that is neither relative, nor changeable, nor a matter of degree.\n\nBecause beauty of the higher kind is tied to virtue, and is attained by the comprehension of what is common in laws and public institutions, it is clear that Plato does not have purely aesthetic values in mind, but the principles of good order that are ultimately tied to the Form of the Beautiful/Good. The difference between the Republic\u2019s and the Symposium\u2019s accounts lies in the fact that the scala amoris treats physical beauty as an incentive to the higher and better, an incentive that in principle affects every human being. There is no talk of a painful liberation from the bonds of the senses, or of a turn-around of the entire soul that is reserved only for the better educated. Brief as the Symposium\u2019s explanation of happiness is, it shows three things: First, all, human beings aim for their own self-preservation and -perfection. Second, this drive finds its expression in the products of their work, in creativity. Third, their respective activities are instigated by each person\u2019s own particular desire for the beautiful. There is no indication that individuals must act as part of a community. Though the communitarian aspect of the good and beautiful comes to the fore in the high praise of the products of the legendary legislators (209e\u2013210a), the ultimate assent to the Beautiful itself is up to the individual. That message of the Symposium is not unique in Plato\u2019s works. The Lysis shares its basic assumption concerning the intermediary state of human nature between good and bad, and it regards need (endeia) as the basis of friendship. Due to the aporetic character of that dialogue, its lesson remains somewhat obscure, but it is obvious enough that it shares the Symposium\u2019s general anthropological presuppositions.\n\nThe idea that eros is the incentive to sublimation and self-completion is further pursued in the Phaedrus. Although the close relationship between the two dialogues is generally acknowledged, the Phaedrus is commonly regarded as a much later work. Not only does it accept the Republic\u2019s psychological doctrine of a tri-partite soul, it also advocates the immortality of the soul \u2013 doctrines that are conspicuously absent in the Symposium. But this difference seems due to a difference in perspective rather than to a change of mind. The discussion in the Symposium is deliberately confined to the conditions of self-immortalization in this life, while the Phaedrus takes the discussion beyond the confines of this life. If it shares the Republic\u2019s doctrine of a division of the soul into three parts, it does so for reasons of its own: The three parts of the soul in the Phaedrus are not supposed to justify the separation of people into three classes. They explain, rather, the different routes taken by individuals in their search for beauty and their levels of success. If the Phaedrus goes beyond the Symposium, it does so in order to show how the enchantment by beauty can be combined with an element of Plato\u2019s philosophy that seems quite alien to the notions of self-improvement and sublimation through the love of beauty. That element is abruptly identified as dialectic, the systematic method of collection and division that is characteristic of Plato\u2019s later work. At first sight, it might seem that the dialogue\u2019s topic, Eros, is hardly the right tie to keep together the dialogue\u2019s two disparate parts \u2013 i.e. the highly poetical depiction of the enchantment by beauty and the ensuing heavenly voyage to a hyperouraneous place, and Plato\u2019s subsequent, quite pedestrian methodological explanations of the presuppositions of rhetoric (249b\u2013c). But although the coherence of the Phaedrus cannot be argued for in full here, the notion that the Phaedrus is disjointed does not do justice to the dialogue\u2019s careful composition and overall aim.\n\nRhetoric, its purpose and value, is in fact the dialogue\u2019s topic right from the start. The misuse of rhetoric is exemplified by the speech attributed to the orator Lysias, a somewhat contrived plea to favor a non-lover rather than a lover. Socrates\u2019 retort points up Lysias\u2019 presuppositions: that love is a kind of sickness, an irrational craving for the pleasures of the body; that a lover tries to dominate and enslave the beloved physically, materially and mentally; and, most importantly, that the lover tries to deprive the beloved of philosophy. Once restored to his senses the lover will shun his former beloved and break all his promises. This one-sided view of Eros is corrected in Socrates\u2019 second speech: Eros, properly understood, is not a diseased state of mind, but a kind of \u2018divine madness\u2019 (theia mania). To explain the nature of this madness, Socrates employs the comparison of the tripartite soul to a charioteer with a pair of winged horses, an obedient white one and an unruly black one. The crucial difference between the Phaedrus\u2019 tripartition and that in the Republic lies in in this: instead of a long and arduous liberation through education, the Phaedrus envisages a liberation through the uplifting force of love, a love that is \u2013 just as it is in the Symposium \u2013 instigated by physical beauty. That is what first makes the soul grow wings and soar in the pursuit of a corresponding deity, to the point where it will attain godlike insights. The best-conditioned souls \u2013 those where the charioteer has full control over his horses \u2013 get a glimpse of true being, including the nature of the virtues and of the good (247c\u2013e). Depending on the quality of each soul, the quality of the beauty pursued will also determine the cycle of reincarnations that is in store for each soul after death (248c\u2013249c).\n\nWhat is remarkable in the Phaedrus\u2019 depiction of the uplifting effect of beauty is not only its exuberant tone and imagery, which goes far beyond the Symposium\u2019s unadorned scala amoris, but also its intricate interweaving of mythical and philosophical elements. For in the midst of his fanciful depiction of the different fates that are in store for different kinds of souls, Plato specifies, in quite technical terms, that the capacity \u201cto understand speech in terms of general Forms, proceeding to bring many perceptions together into a reasoned unity\u201d (249b\u2013c: synienai kat\u2019 eidos legomenon, ...eis hen logism\u00f4i synairoumenon), is the condition for the reincarnation of individual souls as human beings. It is this capacity for abstract thought that he then calls \u201crecollection of what the soul saw when it was travelling with god, when it disregarded the things we now call real and lifted up its head to what is truly real instead.\u201d The heavenly adventure now seems to amount to no more than the employment of the dialectical method that Socrates is going to describe, without further mythical camouflage, in the dialogue\u2019s second part. The ability to work out a taxonomy, establishing the unity in a given subject-matter and dividing it up according to its natural kinds, is the art that characterizes the \u2018scientific rhetorician\u2019 (265d\u2013266b). Socrates professes the greatest veneration for such a master: \u201cIf I believe that someone is capable of discerning a single thing that is also by nature capable of encompassing many, I follow \u2018straight behind, in his tracks, as if he were a god\u2019.\u201d So the heavenly voyage has a quite down-to-earth counterpart in the dialectical method \u2013 a method that Plato regards as a \u2018gift of the gods\u2019, as he is going to confirm in the Philebus (16c). At the same time, Plato\u2019s esteem for taxonomy explains the inner unity of the Phaedrus\u2019 seemingly incongruous two parts as two sides of one coin, and it also shows why Plato no longer treats the sensory as a mere distraction and disturbance of the mind. Instead, the properly conditioned souls\u2019 sensory impressions are its first incentives to seek the higher and better.\n\nWhat concept of happiness is suggested by this \u2018divinely inspired\u2019 view of human life? Individuals do not, here, find their fulfillment in peaceful interactions in a harmonious community. Instead, life is spent in the perennial pursuit of the higher and better. But in that task the individual is not alone; she shares it with kindred spirits. The message of both the Symposium and the Phaedrus is therefore two-pronged. On the one hand, there is no permanent attainment of happiness as a stable state of completion in this life. In the ups and downs of life (and of the afterlife), humans are in constant need of beauty as an incentive to aim for self-perfection. Humans are neither god-like nor wise; at best, they are god-lovers and philosophers, demonic hunters for truth and goodness. To know is not to have; and to have once is not to have forever. In the Symposium, Diotima states in no uncertain terms that humans have a perennial need to replenish what they constantly lose, both in body and soul, because they are mortal and changeable creatures; and the Phaedrus confirms the need for continued efforts, because the heavenly voyage is not a one-time affair. On the other hand, there is also the message conveyed that the pursuit of the good and the beautiful is not a lonely enterprise. As indicated in the Symposium and further elaborated in the Phaedrus, love for a beautiful human being is an incentive to search for a higher form of life, a sacred joint journey of two friends in communion (255a\u2013256e). The need for, and also the possibility of, constant self-repletion and -perfection is a motive that will reappear in the ethical thought of Plato\u2019s late works, a motif he sometimes presents as the maxim that humans should aim at the \u2018likening of oneself to god\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4i in Theaetetus 176b; Timaeus 90c).\n\nSober philosophers have a tendency to ignore such visionary talk as a kind of Schw\u00e4rmerei that lacks the substance to be worth serious thought. That Plato, appearances notwithstanding, is not indulging in a god-besotted r\u00eaverie in the Phaedrus is indicated by his interweaving of the mythical depiction in the dialogue\u2019s first part with his specification and exploration of the dialectical method in the later part (259e-279c), where Socrates attempts to determine the requirements of \u2018scientific rhetoric\u2019 (259e\u2013279c). Artful speaking, as well as artful deception, presupposes knowledge of the truth, especially where the identity of the phenomena is difficult to grasp, because similarities can be misleading. This applies in particular to concepts like the good and the just, as witnessed by the wide disagreement about their nature (263a\u2013c). The development of the \u2018sharp eye\u2019 that is needed to assign each object to the right class is the aim of Plato\u2019s method of collection and division, a method on which he expounds at some length in the Phaedrus. He discusses the care that is needed in order to \u201csee together things that are scattered about everywhere, and to collect them into one kind (mia idea)\u201d, as well as \u201cto cut the unity up again according to its species along its natural joints, and to try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do (265d\u2013e).\u201d That this method is supposed to serve an overall ethical purpose is confirmed by the fact that rhetoric based on truth must reflect the speaker\u2019s knowlege not only of the different types of souls and the types of speech that fit them (271d), but also of the truth about just and good things (272d).\n\nThat dialectic is geared to this end is somewhat obscured in the subsequent discussion in the Phaedrus. First of all, Plato turns away from this issue in his long depiction of the iniquities of contemporary rhetoricians, when he contrasts their efforts with that of the scientific rhetorician. And Plato continues this excursion with a discussion of speaking and writing, culminating in his famous \u2018critique of writing\u2019. Second, although Plato makes ample use of the method of collection and division in later dialogues such as the Sophist and the Statesman, he seems to pay little heed, there, to problems of ethics, with the exception of the Philebus. But the aptness of the dialectical method in discerning the nature of the good has already been emphasized in the Republic (534b\u2013c): \u201c Unless someone can distinguish in an account the Form of the good from everything else, can survive all refutation as if in battle... you will say that he does not know the good itself or any other good.\u201d Brief as these remarks are, they show that the application of dialectic is of central importance to the understanding and pursuit of the good. That the Good is nowhere subjected to such treatment must be due to the enormity of the task involved in undertaking a systematic identification of all that is good, and in working out the criteria of distinction. Although it is unclear whether Plato in the Republic had already refined the dialectical method in the systematic way indicated in the Phaedrus, the hints contained about a \u2018longer way\u2019 (435d; 504b) to determine the nature of justice and that of the other virtues suggest that the development of a systematic method of collection and division was at least \u2018in the works\u2019. As a closer look at the much later Philebus will show, the determination of what is good about each kind of thing presupposes more than a classification by collection and division: the internal structure of each kind of entity has also to be determined. Knowledge is not confined to the comprehension of the objects\u2019 being, identity, difference and other interrelations that exist in a given field. It also presupposes the knowledge of what constitutes the objects\u2019 internal unity and complexity. It would, of course, be rather presumptuous to claim that Plato had not seen the need to investigate the ontological \u2018anatomy\u2019, as well as the taxonomy, of the Forms from early on. But as the late dialogues show, it took him quite some effort to develop the requisite conceptual tools for such analyses.\n\nBefore we turn to the late dialogues, a final review is in order of the kind of good life that Plato envisages in the dialogues under discussion here. In the Symposium, the emphasis is on the individual\u2019s creative work, which involves others at least as catalysts in one\u2019s efforts to attain self-perpetuation and self-perfection. The quality of life attainable by each person differs, depending on the kind of \u2018work\u2019 each individual is able to produce. This is what the scala amoris is all about. In the Phaedrus, the emphasis is on the \u2018joint venture\u2019 of two kindred souls. True friends will get to the highest point of self-fulfillment through the joint insights that they attain. Just as in the Symposium, the philosophical life is deemed the best. But then, this preference is found everywhere in Plato and it is not unique to him: all ancient philosophers regard their own occupation as the true fulfillment of human nature \u2013 as they saw it. If there are differences between them, they concern the kinds of study and occupation that they deemed appropriate for the philosopher. The more individualistic view of happiness espoused in the Symposium and in the Phaedrus need, however, not be seen as a later stage in Plato\u2019s development than the Republic\u2019s communitarian conception. They may present complementary, rather than rival, points of view, and no fixed chronology need be assumed in order to accommodate both.\n\nMost modern readers of Plato tend to ignore the significance of Plato\u2019s late dialogues for his ethical views. For late dialogues such as the Timaeus appear to concentrate on nature and metaphysics \u2014 and for the most part drop questions such as the nature of the virtues, and the moral psychology of the soul. This appears to be a shift in emphasis, since nature and natural things are not among the objects that concern Plato in his earlier and middle philosophical investigations. Thus, in the Republic, he dismisses the study of the visible heaven from the curriculum of higher learning, along with the study of audible music. But such generalizations about Plato\u2019s intentions may be misleading. What he denigrates is not the study of the heavenly order as such, or that of harmonics; it is rather the extent to which humans must necessarily rely on their eyes and ears in those concerns. Students of philosophy are, rather, encouraged to work out the true intelligible order underlying the visible heaven and audible music. Not only that: the ascent out of the Cave does include recognition of objects outside, especially \u201cthe things in the sky\u201d (R. 516a\u2013b). If Plato is critical of natural science, it is because of its empirical approach. This echoes the Phaedo\u2019s complaint that one ruins one\u2019s eyes by looking directly at things, most of all at the sun (Phdo. 99d\u2013e), while ignoring the \u2018binding force\u2019 of the good. But what kind of \u2018binding force\u2019 does Plato attribute to \u2018the Good\u2019? His reticence about this concept, despite its centrality in his metaphysics and ethics, is largely responsible for the obscurity of his concept of happiness and of what it is to lead a good life. The philosophers\u2019 knowledge supposedly provides a solid basis for the good life of the entire community, as well as for that of the \u2013 perhaps uncomprehending \u2013 majority, because all benefit from the good order of the state. But what is \u2018the Good\u2019 that is responsible for the goodness of all other things? A lot of ink has been spilt over the following passage in Republic book VI, 509b: \u201cNot only do the objects of knowledge owe their being known to the Good, but their being (ousia) is also due to it, although the Good is not being, but beyond it (epekeina) in rank and power.\u201d The analogy with the sun\u2019s maintenance of all that is alive suggests that the Good is the intelligent inner principle that determines the nature of every object that is capable of goodness, in the sense that these objects fulfill their respective functions in the appropriate way. Plato does not attempt to state how such a principle of goodness works in all things, in the Republic, nor does he indicate whether he has in mind a unifying principle in a strong sense. That he is indeed thinking of an internal \u2018binding force\u2019 for all kinds of things is indicated, however, in Book X, in his elucidation of the ontological differences that exist, respectively, between the Forms as the products of a divine maker, their earthly copies, and the imitation of these copies by an artist (R. 596a ff.). According to Plato, in each case it is the use or function that determines what it is to be good (601d): \u201cAren\u2019t the virtue or excellence, the beauty and correctness of each manufactured item, living creature, and action related to nothing but the use (chreia) for which each is made or naturally adapted?\u201d Given that Plato does not limit this account to tools or instruments, but explicitly includes living things and human actions, he seems to have a specific criterion in mind for what constitutes each thing\u2019s excellence. But what determines the \u2018use\u2019 of a human being, and to what extent can there be a common principle that accounts for all good things? In the Republic, this question is answered only indirectly through the isomorphism of the just state and the just soul, based on a harmonious internal order. The postulate of such an orderly structure is not explicitly extended beyond the state and the soul. In the later dialogues, by contrast, the Good clearly operates on a cosmic scale. That such is Plato\u2019s view comes to the fore in his excursus on the philosopher\u2019s nature in the Theaetetus (173c\u2013177c). Contrary to Socrates\u2019 denial in the Apology, Socrates in the Theaetetus affirms that the philosopher is to pursue both \u201cwhat lies below the earth and the heights above the heaven\u201d (173e): \u201ctracking down by every path the entire nature of each whole among the things that are.\u201d And Socrates also concerns himself there with the question of \u201cWhat is man? What actions and passions properly belong to human nature and distinguish it from all other beings?\u201d In that connection he compares the discovery of truth with \u2018likening oneself to God\u2019 (homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4i) and indicates that there is a unitary principle of goodness. The ability to achieve this superhuman state depends on one\u2019s readiness to engage in strenuous philosophical discourse (177b).\n\nIf in the Republic the goodness of the individual soul is explained in terms of its being a smaller copy of a harmonious society, in the Timaeus Plato goes for an even larger model. The universe and its soul now supply the \u2018large text\u2019 for deciphering the nature of the human soul. The structure of the world-soul is replicated in the nature of the human soul. That there is, nevertheless, a close affinity between the Republic and the comological project that Plato means to pursue in the Timaeus and its intended sequel is clearly indicated in the preface to the Timaeus. The tale of the origin of the universe, including human nature, is presented as the first step towards fulfilling Socrates\u2019 wish to see his own best city \u2018in action\u2019 (Ti. 19b\u2013c). From antiquity on, this introduction has created the impression that the Timaeus is the direct continuation of the Republic, an impression that explains its juxtaposition in the Corpus Platonicum. Strong indications speak, however, for a much later date of the Timaeus. If Plato establishes a link between these two works, his intent is to compare as well as to contrast. The continuity consists solely in the fact that Socrates reaffirms his adherence to his ideal city\u2019s order \u2013 at least in principle (Ti. 17c\u201319b). It is this order that Critias promises to illustrate by a narration of the tale of two cities, of the war between pre-historic Athens, a city that exemplifies the ideal order, and Atlantis, a powerful tyrannical superpower (Ti. 20d\u201326e). However, Plato never completed this project: the Critias breaks off after some 15 Stephanus-pages, in mid-sentence, and the third dialogue in the series, Hermocrates, whatever was to have been its content, was never written at all. So the story of Socrates\u2019 ideal city in action and of the life of its citizens remains untold. All we have is Plato\u2019s cosmic model for such a state and the soul of its inhabitants (on Plato\u2019s cosmology see the entry Plato\u2019s Timaeus by Donald Zeyl and Barbara Sattler in SEP).\n\nA crucial difference between the philosophical approach in the Republic and that in the Timaeus lies in the fact that in the latter dialogue Plato concerns himself with the structure of the visible heaven as a model for the human soul, and also with the material conditions of human physiology. What is confined to mythology in Plato\u2019s earlier works is here worked out \u2013 though not without a caveat to the effect that Plato is merely offering a likely story rather than a scientific explanation of the structure of the universe, of the human soul, and of human physiology. Plato\u2019s choice of presenting his explanation of the order of the universe as a story of creation by a so-called demiurge or \u2018divine workman\u2019 is certainly no accident. It can be understood as a kind of \u2018retractation\u2019 of his deprecatory depiction of the divine workman\u2019s heavenly embroidery in Republic VII 528e-530d, where such a product is depreciated because of its inferiority to a model conceivable in theory. To be sure, the Timaeus presupposes the Forms as the divine workman\u2019s unchanging models and he resorts to mathematical principles to explain the cosmic order (27d\u201329d; 30c\u201331b); but the focus is almost exclusively on the construction of the visible heavens. Plato now seems to have convinced himself that in order to explain the nature of a living being, it is necessary to show what factors constitute such a live organism.\n\nThis intention explains certain peculiarities of the Timaeus that make the dialogue hard to penetrate; for it falls into three rather disparate parts. The first part describes the structure of the world-soul and its replication in the human soul in a way that combines the general principles with those of mathematics and harmonics and illustrates it with fantastic imagery (29d\u201347e). The second part consists of a rather meticulous account of the elementary corporeal constituents of nature, which are supposedly formed out of geometrically constructed atoms (47e\u201369a). The third part combines elements from the first and second parts in a lengthy explanation of human physiology and psychology (69b\u201392c). The first, cosmological, part of the Timaeus greatly taxes one\u2019s ability to relate the notion of a divinely created world-soul to the motions of the visible heavens, because Plato offers only the barest hints concerning the intelligible, mathematical and harmonic structure that is to explain these motions. By contrast, the explanations in the second and third part are hard to follow because of Plato\u2019s quite unique concern with the structure and the dynamics of the basic elements of the physical world in general and with that of human physiology in particular.\n\nBut why does Plato burden himself and his readers with such a complex machinery and what does this heavenly instrument have to do with ethics? Since the human soul is formed out of the same ingredients as the world soul (albeit of a less pure kind), and displays the same structure (41d\u2013e), Plato is clearly not just concerned with the order of the universe, but with that of the human soul as well. He attributes to it the possession of the kinds of concepts that are necessary for the understanding of the nature of all things, both eternal and temporal. The soul\u2019s ingredients are here limited to the purely general concepts and to mathematical proportions. There is no reference to a theory of recollection of the nature of all things. Rather, Plato is concerned to ascertain that the soul has all the tools for dealing with all objects: (1) the most important concepts necessary for the identification and the differentiations in the way required for dialectical procedure; (2) the numbers and proportions needed to understand numerical relations and harmonic structures of all sorts; (3) the capacity of the soul to perform and comprehend harmoniously coordinated motions. This, it seems, is all the soul needs and all it gets so that it can perform its various tasks. The unusual depiction of the soul\u2019s elements and composition makes it hard, at first, to penetrate to the rationale of its construction, and it must remain an open question to what extent Plato expects his model to be taken in a literal rather than in a figurative sense. His overall message should be clear, however: the soul is a harmoniously structured entity, that can in principle function forever, and it also comprehends the corresponding structures of other entities, and therefore has access to all that is good and harmonious. This last point has consequences for his ethical thought that are not developed in the Timaeus itself, but that can be detected in some of the other late dialogues.\n\nPlato\u2019s concern with \u2018right measure\u2019 in a sense that is relevant for ethics is, of course, not confined to his late work. It shows up rather early. Already in the Gorgias, Socrates blames Callicles for the undisciplined state of his soul and attributes it to his neglect of geometry (508a): \u201cYou\u2019ve failed to notice that proportionate equality (geometrik\u00ea isot\u00eas) has great power among both gods and men.\u201d But it is unclear whether this expression is to be taken in a more than metaphorical sense; it is, at any rate, not repeated anywhere else in Plato\u2019s earlier work. There is also no indication that Plato takes seriously the idea of a \u2018quantification\u2019 of the nature of the virtues in his middle dialogues. If mathematics looms large, then, it is as a model science on account of its exactness, the stability of its objects, and their accessibility to reason. A systematic exploration of the notion that measure and proportion are the fundamental conditions of goodness is confined to the late dialogues. Apart from the Timaeus\u2019 emphasis on a precise cosmic and mental order, there is a crucial passage in the Statesman (283d\u2013285c), where the Eleatic Stranger distinguishes two kinds of \u2018art of measurement\u2019. The first kind is the ordinary measuring of quantities relative to each other (\u2018the great and small\u2019). The second kind has a normative component: it is concerned with the determination of \u2018due measure\u2019 (to metrion). The latter is treated with great concern; for the Eleatic Stranger claims that it is the basis of all expertise, including statesmanship, the very art that is the subject of that dialogue (284a\u2013b): \u201cIt is by preserving measure in this way that they produce all the good and fine things they do produce.\u201d His point is that all good productions and all processes of generation that come to a good end presuppose \u2018right measure\u2019, while arbitrary quantities (\u2018the more and less\u2019) have no such results. The Eleatic Stranger therefore suggests a separation of the simple arts of measuring from the arts concerned with due measure (284e): \u201cPositing as one part all those sorts of expertise that measure the numbers, lengths, depths, breadths and speeds of things in relation to what is opposed to them, and as the other, all those that measure in relation to what is in due measure (to metrion), what is fitting (to prepon), the right moment (to kairion), what is as it ought to be (to deon) \u2013 everything that is removed from the extremes to the middle (meson).\u201d This distinction finds no application in the Statesman itself, except that due measure must be presupposed in the final definition of the statesman as a \u2018kingly weaver\u2019, weaving together the fabric of the state by combining the aggressive and the moderate temperaments in the population so as to produce a harmonious citizenry (305e\u2013 311c). But no mathematic procedure is specified as the condition of such a \u2018mixing together of the citizens\u2019 characters\u2019 in due measure.\n\nThe importance of \u2018measure\u2019 in a seemingly literal sense is made explicit, however, in the Philebus, the dialogue that is concerned with the question of whether pleasure or knowledge is the state of mind that constitutes happiness. In that dialogue, number (arithmos), limit (peras) and measure (metron) play a crucial role at various points of the discussion, and the Philebus is also the dialogue where Plato requires that numerical precision must be observed in the application of the \u2018divine gift\u2019 of the dialectical procedure of collection and division (16c\u201317a). The dialectician must know precisely how many species and subspecies a certain genus contains; otherwise he has no claim to any kind of expertise. Despite this emphasis on precision and on the need to determine the numerical \u2018limit\u2019 in every science, Socrates does not provide the envisaged kind of collection and division of pleasure and knowledge. He avoids that task with the pretense that he suddenly remembers that neither of the two contenders suffices in itself for the happy life, and that a mixture of the two is preferable. To explain the nature of this mixture, Socrates introduces a fourfold division of all beings (23c\u201327c), a division that uses the categories of \u2018limit\u2019 and \u2018measure\u2019 in a different way than the one suggested earlier for the \u2018divine method of dialectic\u2019. Limit now concerns the objects\u2019 internal structure. As Socrates states, all beings belong in one of four classes \u2013 namely (1) limit (peras), (2) the unlimited (apeiron), (3) the mixture (meixis) of limit and the unlimited, or (4) the cause (aitia) of such a mixture. As the subsequent explications concerning the four classes show, the unlimited comprises all those things that have no exact measure or grade in themselves, such as what is hotter and colder, faster and slower. Although at first the examples are confined to relative terms, the class of the unlimited is then extended to things like hot and cold, dry and moist, fast and slow, and even heat and frost, i.e. to all that has no fixed limit or degree. Mixture takes place when such qualities take on a definite quantity (poson) or due measure (metrion) that puts a definite limit on their variety. That only measured entities qualify as mixtures is not only suggested by the examples Socrates refers to (health, strength, beauty, music, and the seasons), but by his assertion, later in the dialogue, that a mixture without due measure or proportion does not deserve its name (64d\u2013e): \u201cit will necessarily corrupt its ingredients and most of all itself. For there would be no blending in such cases at all but only an unconnected medley, the ruin of whatever happens to be contained in it.\u201d The upshot of this discussion is that all stable entities represent a harmonious equilibrium of their otherwise limitless ingredients. Since indeterminate elements usually turn up in pairs of opposites, the right limit in each case must be the right proportion necessary for their balance. In the case of health, there will be the right balance between the hot and the cold, the dry and the moist. The cause of the proper proportion for each mixture turns out to be reason; it is the only member of the fourth class. As Socrates indicates, divine reason is the ultimate source of all that is good and harmonious in the universe, while human reason constitutes order down here (26e\u201327c; 28a\u201330e).\n\nThe adoption of this fourfold ontology allows Socrates to assign pleasure and knowledge to two of the four classes of being: pleasure turns out to be unlimited, because it admits of the \u2018more and less\u2019. Reason, by contrast, belongs to the fourth class, to the causes of good mixtures. On the basis of this classification, Socrates provides the criteria for a critical assessment of the different kinds of pleasure and knowledge (31b\u201359d) and presents happiness as a mixture of all kinds of knowledge with true and pure kinds of pleasure (59d-64b). In a final \u2018ranking of goods\u2019, measure and due proportion, unsurprisingly, get the first rank among the possessions of the soul, things in proper proportion come in second, reason is ranked third, the arts and sciences obtain fourth place, whereas the true and pure pleasures get fifth and last place on the scale of goods (64c\u201367b). If Plato in the Philebus is more favorably disposed towards a hedonist stance than in some of his earlier works, he is so only to a quite limited degree: he regards pleasure as a necessary ingredient in human life, because both the physical and the psychic equilibria that constitute human nature are unstable. In a sense that recalls the Symposium, Plato presupposes that there is always some deficiency or lack that needs supplementation. Because the range of such \u2018supplements\u2019 include learning and the pursuit of the virtues, there are some pleasures that are rightly cherished. But even they are deemed goods only insofar as they are a compensation for human imperfection.\n\nGiven the importance of \u2018measure\u2019, there is the question of how serious Plato is about such a \u2018mathematization\u2019 of his principles, quite generally. Though harmony and order have been treated as important principles in Plato\u2019s metaphysics and ethics from early on, in his late dialogues he seems to envisage right measure in a literal sense. This explains his confidence that even physical entities can attain a relatively stable state. As he suggests both in the Timaeus and in the Philebus, no"}]}
