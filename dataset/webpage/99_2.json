That woman was Hope Cooke. It was based on her autobiography.\n\nIt spoke about how the American media was enamoured with an American marrying Crown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim in 1963. The press always heavily followed any trips of theirs to the United States. Vogue wanted to know her beauty secrets. What the media did not know was that this so-called fairy tale was anything but.\n\nHope Cooke was born on 24 June 1940 in San Francisco, California to John J. Cooke and Hope Noyes. When Hope was not yet two, her mother died in a single person plane crash in 1942. Her father then moved her and her sister, Harriet, to New York City with him to an apartment that was across the hall from their maternal grandparents (who Hope claimed were aloof and refused to talk about her mother). Hope and Harriet were raised by governesses; one beat the future royal with a coat hanger when she could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Their grandfather died when Hope was 12, and their grandmother passed away just three years later when Hope was 15.\n\nFrom then, Hope and Harriet lived with their maternal aunt and uncle; the latter was the former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. Hope studied at both the Chaplin School in New York and the Madeira School in Virginia. She completed her high school education in Iran.\n\nShe chose to continue her studies and head to university. She enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in 1959 where she majored in Asian Studies. One summer she travelled to India with her later recalling, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy \u2026 India! My heart explodes \u2026 The East is my home\u2026\u201d It was in Darjeeling that she met the recently widowed Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim.\n\nThey became engaged two years later, in 1961, after bonding over what the New York Times called the \u201csimilar isolation of their childhoods.\u201d The couple did not marry until 1963 due to astrologers claiming 1962 was a bad year for marriages.\n\nThe Crown Prince and Hope wed after the latter had renounced her American citizenship, in a Buddhist monastery on 20 March 1963; their ceremony was officiated by 14 lamas \u2013 the title for a high priest in Tibetian Buddhism. Although the wedding was a Buddhist ceremony, Hope never converted from Christianity. However, she was known to have practised Buddhism from an early age.\n\nTogether, they had two children: Prince Palden Gyurmed Namgyal and Princess Hope Leezum Namgyal. Hope gained three stepchildren (Prince Tenzing Kunzang Jigme Namgyal, Prince Tobgyal Wangchuk Tenzing Namgyal and Princess Yangchen Dolma Namgyal) from the union who she adored. She vowed that her children would know happiness and not grow up with the sad family life like both their parents.\n\nJust two years after their nuptials, the Crown Prince was proclaimed Sikkim\u2019s monarch (Chogyal or King) on 4 April 1965. His reign would be short, as he was deposed ten years later on 10 April 1975. He was put under house arrest in the palace. Not long after, Hope and Palden separated with Hope returning with their two children to the United States.\n\nHope later described her ex-husband as a heavy-drinker, sexist and philanderer. He continued his affair that started before he married Hope with a Belgian woman during their marriage. However, she was not innocent as she was also having an affair with an American man.\n\nHer popularity waned with Newsweek even calling her the Himalayan Marie-Antoinette after Sikkim was annexed into India. A US Representative and US Senator co-sponsored a bill to give Hope her American citizenship back, but the bill would not pass until the language was altered to only give her permanent residence status. President Ford signed it in 1976. She and the Chogyal divorced in 1980. He died just two years later of cancer.\n\nIn 1983, she married for a second time to Mike Wallace, but this union did not last. She resided in London for a time, but she eventually returned to the United States. Hope now works as a writer and lecturer and lives in Brooklyn, New York."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html", "page_content": "Hope's loneliness and confusion grow over the years, and so does her spiritual quest. Grandfather dies when she's 12, Granny dies three years later. She goes to live with her aunt and uncle, Mary and Selden Chapin, then the ambassador to Iran, and finishes high school there. One summer in her late teens she travels to India: ''I've never been so happy ... India! My heart explodes ... The East is my home ... I must stay near India somehow ...''\n\nHope Cooke is majoring in Asian studies at Sarah Lawrence when she meets the recently widowed Crown Prince of Sikkim in Darjeeling (where, with typical eccentricity, she is taking a course in typing). Two years later they are engaged. The writer immediately hints at the complex pragmatism of this alliance: Her impulse toward him may be inspired by her fascination with Indian spirituality and her desire for some kind of rootedness; his impulse toward her is in part prompted by his need to find a mother for his children. Both are also driven toward each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. ''Even more than me,'' Hope muses about the Prince's ''Chaplinesque loneliness,'' ''when he was small he had a rather sad life.''\n\nHope Cooke is an exceptionally chaste adventuress who seeks the tamer shores of security rather than the wilder shores of love. She's perhaps more infatuated with the prospect of nesting in her little Oriental palace than she is with the moody king. ''I want a family so much. I want to fill this nest, make it a real home.'' One of the most touching aspects of this story is her delight in recapturing childhood through her affection for her three stepchildren, whom she seems to love quite as much as she will later love her own son and daughter. She exults when her modest (five-bedroom) palace explodes with offspring and the family consumes 12 dozen eggs a week. She has made a fierce resolution to reverse the karma that had saddened her childhood and her husband's.''These children will be happy. The wheel of unhappiness that both my husband and I grew up on will not go to this generation.''\n\nBut the monsters lurking in Hope's fairy tale appear soon after her marriage. The Crown Prince may well have been one of the Far East's most enlightened rulers, as both the author and the historical record confirm: He shaped a model Asian state whose literacy rate and per capita income were twice as high as the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan and India; he retained a measure of independence for a tiny country threatened on two sides, by an India intent on annexation and an equally aggressive Communist-dominated Tibet. Yet, as Hope Cooke describes him, he was also a heavy-drinking philanderer with an odious streak of macho sexism. Notwithstanding his strained finances, the Crown Prince managed to maintain a love affair with a married woman in Belgium before and during his marriage to Hope; he even flew to visit her a few weeks before Hope's first child was born. The lover wrote letters to the Prince on ''crisp rustling paper'' that Hope could hear crinkling in her husband's bathrobe when he hugged her at night. If a letter dropped to the floor, she read it while he went to the altar to perform his Buddhist prayers.\n\nWhen Sikkim's independence was endangered by the death of Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's autonomy under the terms of a protectorate, the Crown Prince began to drink more and throw temper tantrums. During one such tantrum, he tosses Hope's record player, her ''lifeline to the West,'' out the window. Fairy tale turns to nightmare as Indira Gandhi conspires to deprive Sikkim of the little independence it has. While Hope entertains visiting reporters interested in ''My Thirty Ways of Preparing Yak,'' she is secretly tippling beer in the morning, living on whisky, Valium and cigarettes from noon on. She begins to realize that the manic fervor with which she'd developed Sikkim's cottage industries and helped her husband fight Indian domination is a substitute for a love that barely exists, if it ever existed. On one of her yearly trips to New York, she has an affair with a man who had been a friend during her lonely adolescence, and the memory of this affair haunts her for the rest of her stay in the Far East. She lies in bed more dazed than ever by whisky and Valium, listening to Joan Baez sing freedom songs."}, {"url": "https://fampeople.com/cat-hope-cooke", "page_content": "Hope Cooke : biography\n\nHope Cooke (born June 24, 1940) is an American woman who was the \"Gyalmo\" () (Queen Consort) of the 12th Chogyal (King) of Sikkim (Palden Thondup Namgyal).

My aunt by marriage, Lydia Kirk, who had written about diplomatic life in Moscow in the late 1940s as well as several smart detective books, pointed me there when I confided my intent to do a research project on the Punic Wars for a freshman course at Sarah Lawrence College. The reason I was so involved in early Punic issues was I had conceived a crush on a handsome Tunisian delegate in the then (c. 1959) very glamorous United Nations. I routinely went to the visitors' gallery to hear him abstain. I unfortunately never got to hear him say \"oui\" or \"non\" but melted over his seductive abstentions. Regrettably, I never got to drop my newly minted Carthegania-Hannibalia since the delegate was reassigned soon after. I did, however, have my tie to the Library.\n\nIn 1973, the Library became my home when I returned to New York with my children and stepdaughter from Sikkim, where I'd been married. We'd left Sikkim under traumatic conditions, near the beginning of India's annexation of the country. We arrived in the city as virtual refugees after more than a month of siege by pro-annexation demonstrators around the \"royal palace,\" the defenseless house, where we lived. Our new apartment held no furnishings other than a small orange carpet from Sikkim, many mattresses, a TV and later some rough two-by-four bookcases. The Library's wood-paneled reading room assuaged loss; the velvety-soft, shallow marble steps melded to my gait; the pear trees outside the Members' Room long windows dazzled in spring and reminded me in winter of how much I'd missed seasons\u2014at least my familiar seasons\u2014in the Himalayas.\n\nIn Sikkim we had had fireplaces in each room, which I missed sorely in our New York apartment. In the Members' Room I could configure flames below the beautifully mantled chimney. The room itself, with its rust and rose furnishings, glowed like embers. The room's oak doors swung shut with satisfying authority.\n\nThe traumas that had begun before I left Sikkim continued here. One of my children suffered a life-threatening organ failure, I had too little money, scant health insurance, and no job. The world of books I was discovering in the Library stacks dispelled threat, mitigated sorrow -at least day to day. I started reading my way through all the plastic-wrapped books, especially the ones on history and sociology. The stacks taught me to learn my way home, as did my tactile explorations of the city, my physical scourings.\n\nIn 1975, in the Members' Room, I began a penciled short story about my nine-year-old son during the first Sikkim siege. It became the nucleus of my book Time Change. Mark Piel was my book's champion and we became good friends. Later, he was to ask me to lead discussions of Asian and Asian-American literature and on biography and autobiography.\n\nSometime after finishing Time Change, I read a book I'd found by chance in the stacks by Raymond Mohl on poverty in New York from 1783 to 1825. I was off and running on a new mission to learn everything I could about New York past to present. I learned a lot. A book on the city, Seeing New York, followed. Today, as I sit in the Library, I feel a tie between myself and the readers and writers who have been cosseted, even blessed, in this dear, affordable sanctum."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/hope_cooke/early_life_and_family", "page_content": "\u201c... goodness is of a modest nature, easily discouraged, and when much elbowed in early life by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that it is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old gentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments based on his personal acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\u2014George Eliot [Mary Ann (or Marian)\n\n\u201cThe secret of heaven is kept from age to age.

She wrote a weekly column, \"Undiscovered Manhattan\", for the Daily News. Her books include an award-winning memoir of her life in Sikkim, Time Change: An Autobiography (1981), an off-the-beaten-path guide to New York, Seeing New York,[28] developed from her walking tours, and, with Jacques d'Amboise, she published Teaching the Magic of Dance.[8]\n\nCooke remarried in 1983 to Mike Wallace, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and Distinguished Professor of History at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.[8][29] They later divorced. Hope Cooke's son, Prince Palden, a New York banker and financial advisor, married Kesang Deki Tashi and has a son and three daughters. Cooke's daughter, Princess Hope, graduated from Milton Academy and Georgetown University, and married (and later divorced) Thomas Gwyn Reich, Jr., a US Foreign Service officer; she later remarried, to Yep Wangyal Tobden.[citation needed]\n\nCooke lived in London for a few years before returning to the United States, where she now lives in Brooklyn and currently works as a writer, historian, and lecturer.[8] She was a consultant for PBS's New York: A Documentary Film (1999\u20132001).[30] Cooke is a regular contributor to book reviews and magazines and also lectures widely.[citation needed]\n\nPublications\n\nReferences"}]}
