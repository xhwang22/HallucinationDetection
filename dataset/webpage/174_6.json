{"The Vagos have a presence in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and are estimated to have over 2,000 members.": [{"url": "https://www.history.co.uk/shows/outlaw-chronicles-hells-angels/articles/history-of-the-vagos-mc", "page_content": "History of the Vagos MC\n\nThe year is 1965. USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://markozen.com/2021/10/12/notorious-motorcycle-gangs-in-the-united-states-and-canada/", "page_content": "\n\n10 most infamous gangs in the United States\n\n#10 Vagos\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club was started in San Bernardino, CA in the 1960\u2019s. Members of the club often wear green and bear a patch of the Norse god Loki riding a motorcycle. The club has approximately 24 chapters spread across the western United States in states such as Arizona and Nevada and also 3 in Mexico.\n\nThe Vagos have been the subject of several investigations by the FBI and the ATF for illegal activity such as the production and distribution of methamphetamine, murder, money laundering and weapons violations. A highly coordinated investigation in March of 2006 led to the arrests of 25 Vagos members and their associates in what has been labeled as the largest investigation in Southern California\u2019s history.\n\n#9 Free Souls\n\nThis particular motorcycle gang was started in the state of Oregon in the late 1960\u2019s. Their patch consists of an ankh, an ancient Egyptian symbol in the shape of a cross, in the center of a motorcycle rim and tire. All of their chapters, with the exception of one in Vancouver, Canada, are located within the state of Oregon.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, three members of The Free Souls Motorcycle Club were arrested and charged with various crimes. Amongst the evidence were illegal drugs, weapons and stolen motorcycles all of which were seized as part of the investigation and arrests.\n\n#8 Bandidos\n\nFounded in San Antonio, TX in 1966 The Bandidos are among the more notorious of American Motorcycle Clubs. The gang\u2019s patch bears a cartoon-ishly obese Mexican wearing a large sombrero and carrying a machete in one hand and a pistol in the other. The colors of gold and red were adopted as the club\u2019s colors due to the fact that their founder was a former Vietnam Marine veteran. The Bandidos have around 90 chapters spread across the U.S. alone, but they have also branched out as far as Asia, Germany and Australia.\n\nThe Bandidos gang has a long and brutal history of illegal activity. A member of The Bandidos was arrested, tried and convicted of the 2006 murder of a well known flyweight boxer and a member of the rival Hell\u2019s Angels Motorcycle Club was sniped while leaving a restaurant in March of that same year during The Bandidos 40th Anniversary of the clubs annual birthday celebration. Police suspect that members of The Bandidos are responsible for the murder. Other members have been arrested from anything from murder to drugs and illegal weapons possession as well as assault and racketeering charges.\n\n#7 Highwaymen\n\nThe Highwaymen were formed in Detroit, MI in 1954. Their chapters have spread across the state of Michigan as well as other U.S. states and have reached as far as Norway and England. Their club colors are black and silver and their insignia is a winged skeleton wearing a motorcycle cap and a leather jacket. The Highwaymen also have their own mottos which are: \u201cHighwaymen Forever, Forever Highwaymen\u201d and \u201cYea, though we ride the highways in the shadows of death, we fear no evil, for we are the most evil mother fuckers on the highway.\u201d\n\nDespite being the largest motorcycle club in the city of Detroit, they are not acknowledged in the Detroit Federation of Motorcycle Clubs due to their violent and criminal reputation. In May 2007, after a two year investigation into the gang\u2019s activities, the FBI raided homes and chapter clubhouses resulting in the arrests of 40 Highwaymen and associates. The charges included insurance and mortgage frauds, murder for hire, cocaine trafficking, police corruption and racketeering.\n\n#6 Warlocks\n\nThe Warlocks were founded in 1967 in Philadelphia, PA and gained a large number of members after the end of the Vietnam War. Consisting only of white males, The Warlocks have spread through the state of Pennsylvania and a good portion of the northeastern United States and also have chapters in the southeast United States as well as overseas in Germany and England. Their club colors are red and white and they use the Greek mythological figure of a winged Harpy as their insignia. Members often adorn themselves and their vests with white supremacy insignia as well.\n\nIn 2008, Tommy Zaroff, a former President of the Bucks County, PA chapter was arrested on suspicion of possessing 10 pounds of methamphetamine. In October of the same year four members of The Warlocks were arrested and charged with producing, transporting and distributing methamphetamine throughout Berks and Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania. It is alleged that they sold over 500 lbs. of methamphetamine worth approximately $9 million.\n\n#5 Sons of Silence\n\nThe Sons of Silence are another \u201c1%er\u201d motorcycle gang that was founded in Niwot, Colorado in 1966 and featured in a 2009 episode of Gangland on The History Channel. Since 1966 The Sons of Silence have spread across the United States, with concentrations in the eastern U.S. They also have several chapters spread throughout Germany.\n\nThe Sons of Silence have adopted the motto \u201cDonec Mors Non Seperat\u201d, which is Latin for \u201cUntil Death Separates Us\u201d. The club patch has been adopted from the American Eagle logo used by the Budweiser beer company and bears an eagle superimposed over the letter A with their motto underneath.\n\nIn October of 1999, 37 members of the Sons of Silence were arrested on drug trafficking and illegal weapons charges during one of Denver\u2019s largest federal undercover operations. During the raids, The ATF seized 20 lbs. of methamphetamine, 35 firearms, four hand grenades, 2 silencers as well as cash and motorcycles.\n\n#4 Outlaws\n\nThe Outlaw Motorcycle Club is one of the more notorious and oldest clubs on this list. The gang started in Matilda\u2019s Bar on old Route 66 in McCook, IL in 1935. Using the insignia on Marlon Brando\u2019s leather jacket in The Wild One as inspiration, the club adopted the skull with cross pistons as their official club patch. Since the club began over 70 years ago their chapters have spread widely across the United States and have been well established in Australia, Asia, Europe and North and South America.\n\nHarry Joseph Bowman, The World Leader of The American Outlaw Association (A.O.A.), was the international president of The Outlaws Motorcycle Club and presided over 30 chapters in the U.S. and 20 chapters in 4 other countries until he was sent to prison for 3 murders in 1999 after being on the F.B.I\u2019s Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive list in 1998. Across the globe members of The Outlaws have been suspected, arrested, tried and convicted of countless crimes from prostitution, trafficking in narcotics and stolen goods, arms dealing, extortion and murder.\n\n#3 Pagans\n\nThe Pagans formed in Maryland in 1959 and by 1965 had expanded rapidly. Their patch depicts the Norse fire giant Surtr sitting on the sun wielding a sword with the word Pagans in red, white and blue. Members are known to wear their patches on cut-off denim jackets with accompanying white supremacist and Nazi insignia patches. The club\u2019s members have also been seen with tattoos of ARGO (Ar Go Fuck Yourself) and NUNYA (Nun\u2019Ya Fuckin\u2019 Business). Their territory seems to be confined strictly to the eastern coast in the United States.\n\nAside from their history of violent rivalry with the notorious Hell\u2019s Angels Motorcycle Club, The Pagans have been associated with numerous crimes including murder, arson, drug smuggling and have been linked to organized crime in the upper northeastern United States. In February of 2002, seventy-three members of The Pagans Motorcycle Club were arrested in Long Island, NY after violence erupted at a motorcycle and tattoo ball. The Pagans allegedly went to the ball specifically to confront members of The Hell\u2019s Angels MC resulting in 10 wounded bikers and one murdered Pagan member. Then in 2005, members of The Pagans allegedly shot and killed the Vice-President of the Philadelphia Chapter of The Hell\u2019s Angels.\n\n#2 Mongols\n\nThe Mongols, also known as Mongol Nation or Mongol Brotherhood, were formed in 1969 in Montebello, California from Hispanic bikers who were refused entry into The Hell\u2019s Angels MC due to their race. Their colors are black and white and their insignia bears the name Mongols in large black letters above a pony-tail sporting man riding a motorcycle wearing a leather vest and sunglasses while carrying a scimitar or cutlass. Mongol chapters are concentrated in the western United States, but have also opened in Canada, Mexico and Italy.\n\nIn 2008, the ATF coordinated a sting against The Mongols MC where 4 agents went undercover to become fully patched members while gaining intelligence about the gang\u2019s activities. This operation resulted in 38 arrests including the arrest of the club\u2019s president, Ruben \u201cDoc\u201d Cavazos. As part of the operation 160 search warrants were served and 110 arrest warrants were carried out. As part of the operation, members of The Mongols MC are now prohibited by law from the use of the Mongol MC logo and insignia including wearing the patches on vests or any other garb.\n\n#1 Hell\u2019s Angels\n\nProbably the most well known American biker gang, The Hell\u2019s Angels have a long and thorough history on American highways. Much information concerning their origins is hazy due to their long-standing code of secrecy. Sometime within the 1940\u2019s or 1950\u2019s in California Hell\u2019s Angels MC was formed. Their insignia is the \u201cdeath\u2019s head\u201d logo which is copied from the insignia of the 85th Fighter Squadron and the 552nd Medium Bomber Squadron. Red lettering over white backgrounds stands for the club\u2019s colors. With so much popularity, Hell\u2019s Angels chapters have sprung up across the Untied States as well as Russia and New Zealand and the continents of North America, South America, Europe and Australia.\n\nThe Hell\u2019s Angels MC have gained mass notoriety in the U.S. due to their involvement in many highly publicized run-ins with the law and rival biker gangs. The most note-worthy of publicized events happened during the Altamont Free Concert at Altamont Speedway in December of 1969 where it is alleged that The Rolling Stones hired members of The Hell\u2019s Angels to stand-in as bodyguards for the band. Violence erupted in the crowd and also onto the performance stage and as a result one male was stabbed to death after brandishing a pistol.\n\nAnother publicized incident occurred in Laughlin, Nevada in Harrah\u2019s Casino and Hotel. A violent confrontation in the casino between rival Mongols MC resulted in one fatally stabbed Mongol gang member and two fatally shot Hell\u2019s Angels members.\n\nHonorable mention: The Pissed off Bastards of Bloomington\n\nThe Pissed Off Bastards of Bloomington (POBOB) is a motorcycle club that, in 1947, along with the Boozefighters and the Market Street Commandos, participated in the highly publicized Hollister riot (later immortalized on film as The Wild One).\n\nAfter the Hollister incident, a prominent Pissed Off Bastard named Otto Friedli (28 Jun 1931 \u2013 17 Mar 2008) split with the club and formed his own group on March 17, 1948 in Fontana, just west of San Bernardino. He called it the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. In 1954 Otto\u2019s new club merged with the Market Street Commandos to become the Hells Angels San Francisco Chapter.\n\nCanada\n\nHells Angels\n\nCriminal Intelligence Service Canada describes the Hells Angels as the largest \u201coutlaw motorcycle gang\u201d in the country, with active chapters concentrated mostly in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.\n\nIn its 2004 report, CISC said the Angels derives \u201csignificant financial income\u201d from criminal activities such as prostitution, fraud and extortion but primarily relied on drug trafficking for income.\n\nThe gang moved into Ontario in 2000. Before that, its only presence in the province was with a chapter of the Nomads, the club\u2019s elite branch. The Nomads doesn\u2019t tie itself to geographical locations and doesn\u2019t have formal clubhouses, like other chapters.\n\nWithin a year, the Angels had absorbed members of the Para Dice Riders, Satan\u2019s Choice and Last Chance, giving them at least 100 members in the Toronto area \u2014 the highest concentration of Hells Angels in the world.\n\nIn mid-April 2009, police targeted more than 150 people linked with the Hells Angels in early-morning raids mostly in Quebec, but also in New Brunswick, France and the Dominican Republic. They also seized four suspected Hells Angels bunkers.\n\nBandidos\n\nIt\u2019s considered world\u2019s second-most powerful criminal biker gang, with more than 2,000 members in 14 countries, according to NGIC\u2019s 2009 report, which describes the Bandidos as a \u201cgrowing criminal threat.\u201d\n\nThe Bandidos was founded in the 1960s in Texas. The club\u2019s old guard was said to be against its absorption of the Rock Machine\u2019s Ontario branches for fear of igniting the same kind of war with the Hells Angels that gripped Quebec for much of the 1990s and left at least 150 people dead.\n\nIn April 2006, eight people \u2014 all Bandidos members or associates \u2014 were found dead in a farmer\u2019s field near the small town of Shedden, Ont., about 30 kilometres southwest of London. Police said the killings virtually wiped out the Toronto chapter of the Bandidos.\n\nOutlaws\n\nFirst established in the United States in 1935, the gang came to Canada in 1978 when several chapters of Satan\u2019s Choice in Montreal changed allegiance and set up shop as the Outlaws Motorcycle Club of Canada. The group is known to detest members of the Hells Angels.\n\nRock Machine\n\nSecond only to Hells Angels in Quebec. A long-running turf war with the Angels left more than 150 people dead as the two fought over the lucrative trade in illegal drugs. The war also led to the passage of anti-gang legislation by the federal government.\n\nAs the Hells Angels expanded into Ontario, so did the Rock Machine. The organization established three chapters. In 2001, it aligned itself with the Bandidos.\n\nSatan\u2019s Choice\n\nOnce one of Ontario\u2019s strongest motorcycle gangs, Satan\u2019s Choice became part of the Hells Angels\u2019 2000-2001 expansion into Ontario. Satan\u2019s Choice had branches in Keswick, Kitchener, Oshawa, Sudbury, Simcoe County, Thunder Bay and Toronto \u2014 but nothing outside the province.\n\nPara Dice Riders\n\nAnother group that was once among Ontario\u2019s strongest biker gangs. Its membership was limited to the Toronto area. The group was absorbed by the Hells Angels in 2001, when the Angels moved into Ontario.\n\nLast Chance\n\nAnother small Ontario-based biker gang that agreed to switch over to the Hells Angels when the world\u2019s most power biker gang moved into the province\n\nLobos\n\nOriginally concentrated in the Windsor, Ont., area, the Lobos motorcycle gang decided to take up the Hells Angels on its offer of merger in 2001.\n\nLoners\n\nThe Loners Motorcycle Club was founded in Ontario in 1979 with a handful of chapters, including a now-defunct one in southwestern Ontario that was headed by Wayne Kellestine. As part of its Ontario expansion drive, the Hells Angels tried to persuade the St. Thomas Loners chapter to join the Angels. Kellestine \u2014 who was injured in an assassination attempt in 1999 \u2014 resisted.\n\nThe club has expanded to the United States and Europe, but in Ontario, its highest profile in recent years was a legal fight by a Toronto chapter to keep its mascot on its property north of the city, in 2001. The neutered, declawed lion named Woody was moved to an animal sanctuary.\n\nVagabonds\n\nAnother Ontario-based motorcycle gang that was more or less absorbed by the Hells Angels when it expanded into Ontario in 2000-2001.\n\nThe Red Devils\n\nSaid to be the oldest motorcycle gang in Canada, the group is made up of a couple of dozen members concentrated in the Hamilton, Ont., area."}, {"url": "https://www.motorcycledigital.com/vagos-motorcycle-gang-members/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nFor more than 50 years, the Vagos Motorcycle Gang (Vagos) have been a menacing force in organized crime. The gang is active in several countries around the world, but it\u2019s most notorious for its presence in the United States. The group has been linked to numerous high-profile crimes, from drug trafficking to weapons possession and even murder.\n\n\n\nThe Vagos emerged in the 1970s as a faction of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, the largest and most notorious outlaw biker gang in the world. Since then, they have grown into an international presence with over 4,000 members spread across the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Europe. While the majority of their members are still based in the US, Vagos has been linked to organized crime operations in various countries.\n\n\n\nTheir criminal activities range from drug trafficking to extortion, and their violent tactics have earned them a fearsome reputation. In addition to their traditional criminal activities, Vagos is also known for its involvement in illegal street racing, motorcycle rallies, and other forms of illegal activity. Despite their notoriety, the gang has managed to remain largely below the radar in recent years, thanks to their increasingly sophisticated tactics and well-organized structure.\n\n\n\nVagos is one of the most powerful and dangerous gangs operating today, and their presence should not be taken lightly. Those caught up in the gang\u2019s activities are at risk of serious harm or even death.

Allegedly, the AMA (American Motorcycle Association) had commented that 99% of motorcycle riders were citizens who conformed to the law and that only 1% were outlaws (not to be confused with Outlaws Motorcycle Club).\n\n\n\nMany motorcycle clubs that have been associated with organized crime, and have had run-ins with law enforcement agencies use the 1% diamond patch and are commonly referred to as the one percenter motorcycle club (also called an outlaw biker group); More about this here. Some popular 1% clubs are Outlaws MC (a very dominant club), Hells Angels (the main rival group of the outlaws), Pagan Motorcycle Club and Black Pistons MC.\n\nMC (Motorcycle Club): The term Motorcycle Club (MC) does carry a meaning outside and beyond the usual English definition of it. It is a popular term in the Outlaw and 1% motorcycling subculture, where it is often used by motorcycling clubs that have had a history in organized crime. Such clubs (MCs) often denote these by wearing colors \u2014 essentially a 3-piece patchwork.\n\n\n\nHowever, not all motorcycling clubs that use the term MC are necessarily an Outlaw motorcycle club or a 1% club. But it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that all dangerous biker gangs are one percenters.\n\nHarleys: It goes without saying that most riders in various clubs swear by their Harley Davidson Motorcycle or a custom chopper. Harley-David Motorcycles enjoy a disproportionately high popularity among MC riders who, in mainstream culture, are known to promote cruiser motorcycles."}, {"url": "https://onepercenterbikers.com/vagos-mc-motorcycle-club/", "page_content": "Vagos MC is a one percenter motorcycle club founded in San Bernardino, California in 1965.

Like many other motorcycle clubs of the time, the Vagos Motorcycle Club was founded by a group of members who had returned from World War II and enjoyed riding their Harley Davidson motorcycles. This particular group were originally members of a different motorcycle club, the Psychos (Redlands) Motorcycle Club. After some infighting a few of the members decided to leave and form their own club, which then became the Vagos Motorcycle Club.\n\nThe original members were Rudy \u201cPuro\u201d Esparza (President), Gil Carrasco (Vice President), Whitey (Secretary/Treasurer), Lucky (Sgt. at Arms), Freddy Ruiz, Harley Hog, Animal, Crazy John Estrada, Tom Tom, Moose, Squirrel, Alex Estrada, and Little John Bocanegra.\n\nThe founders of Vagos Motorcycle Club had a Mexican heritage, which led to the color green being selected for the club.

Two other names for the club were considered, Coffin Dodgers MC and Satan Saints MC.\n\nThe first chapter to open was in San Bernardino, California, which is nicknamed the \u201cBerdoo\u201d chapter.

The Vagos Motorcycle Club patch was designed by a member of the Berdoo chapter who was in prison at the time.\n\nThe Vagos MC motto is \u201cWe Give What We Get\u201d.\n\nOne of the Vagos Motorcycle Club abbreviations is 22, as the 22nd letter in the alphabet is the letter \u201cV\u201d.\n\nThe Vagos Motorcycle Club colors are green, which links back to the Mexican heritage of the Vagos Motorcycle Club founder.\n\nVagos also use the motto \u201cVFFV\u201d, meaning \u201cVagos Forever, Forever Vagos\u201d.

We derive posterior estimates of the state vector and the associated error covariance matrix by analytical solution to the Bayesian optimization problem (Sect. 2.5). Our base inversion uses GOSAT + in situ observations and our best choices of inversion parameters. We also present results from an ensemble of sensitivity inversions using observation subsets (in situ or GOSAT) and varying inversion parameter assumptions (e.g., different error distributions). We attribute inversion results to different methane emission sectors with the methodology described in Sect. 2.6.\n\n2.1 In situ methane observations We use the comprehensive database of in situ (surface, tower, shipboard, and aircraft) methane observations over North America for 2010\u20132017 from the GLOBALVIEWplus CH 4 ObsPack v1.0 product compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory (Cooperative Global Atmospheric Data Integration Project, 2019). Following Lu et al. (2021), data from surface and tower sites are sampled only during daytime (10:00\u201316:00 LT) and averaged as daytime mean values on individual days for use in the inversion. For sites with standard deviations larger than 30 ppb, we exclude data points that depart by more than 2 standard deviations from the mean because such local extreme conditions are difficult to simulate with the chemical transport model. For other sites we exclude data points that depart by more than 3 standard deviations from the mean. We also exclude aircraft measurements higher than 9 km a . s . l . as these measurements would have weak sensitivity to surface fluxes. The in situ observations thus include 49 742 data points from surface sites, 15 285 from towers, 56 from ship cruises, and 26 620 from aircraft campaigns over North America and adjacent waters (Fig. 1a). The number of available in situ observations per year increases from 10 830 in 2010 to 13 593 in 2017. All these in situ data points are used in the base inversion to optimize methane emissions for individual years. We also conduct sensitivity inversions by only using surface and tower sites with continuous 8-year records for trend analyses.\n\n2.2 GOSAT satellite methane observations The GOSAT satellite launched in 2009 measures the backscattered solar radiation from a sun-synchronous orbit at around 13:00 LT (Kuze et al., 2016). Methane is retrieved in the 1.65 \u00b5m shortwave infrared absorption band. We use the column-averaged dry-air methane mixing ratios from the University of Leicester version 9.0 Proxy XCH 4 retrieval (Parker et al., 2020a). Comparison with ground-based methane observations from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) shows that the retrieval has a single-observation precision of 13 ppb and an overall global bias of 9 ppb that is removed from the Proxy XCH 4 data (Parker et al., 2020a). Here we use a total of 205 875 (25 734 per year on average) GOSAT retrievals for 2010\u20132017 over North America in the inversion, excluding glint data over the oceans and data poleward of 60\u2218, which are not representatively sampled and for which errors are large (Fig. 1b).\n\n2.3 Prior emission inventories We use as prior estimates of anthropogenic methane emissions the gridded versions of the official national inventories for the US (EPA, 2016), Canada (ECCC, 2020a), and Mexico (INECC and SEMARNAT, 2018) (Maasakkers et al., 2016; Scarpelli et al., 2020, 2021). These emissions are listed in Table 1 for individual countries, and the spatial distributions for major sectors are shown in Fig. 2. We assume no year-to-year trend in the prior emissions so that trends from the inversion are solely driven by observations. Prior anthropogenic emissions for the contiguous US (CONUS) are 28.7 Tg a\u22121. Anthropogenic US emissions outside CONUS (mostly Alaska, not optimized in the inversion) account for only 0.3 Tg a\u22121 according to Maasakkers et al. (2016). The latest GHGI report from the EPA (2021) gives mean emissions of 26.0 Tg a\u22121 for 2010\u20132017. Prior anthropogenic emissions for Canada are 3.7 Tg a\u22121. The most recent 2021 version of the ECCC NIR gives a mean of 4.0 Tg a\u22121 for 2010\u20132017 (ECCC, 2021). Mexico anthropogenic emissions are 5.0 Tg a\u22121, and 2015 is the latest available year from INECC. Download XLSX Prior methane emissions from wetlands are the 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.5 \u2218 gridded mean monthly values for 2010\u20132017 from the nine highest-performance members of the WetCHARTs v1.3.1 inventory ensemble (Ma et al., 2021), selected for their fit to the global GOSAT inversion results of Zhang et al. (2021). This choice of prior estimate effectively corrects the large overestimates of wetland emissions for North America previously found in inversions of GOSAT and aircraft data when using the overall mean of the WetCHARTs v1.0 ensemble (Sheng et al., 2018b; Maasakkers et al., 2021). We do not include interannual variability from WetCHARTs because it is highly uncertain and we prefer to have it informed by the observations. Unlike in our global inversion (Lu et al., 2021), we do not optimize the relative seasonal variation of wetland emissions and instead have it imposed by the prior estimate (Parker et al., 2020b). Prior estimates of open fire emissions are the daily values for individual years from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) version 4s (van der Werf et al., 2017). Other small natural emissions (seepages, termites) are as described in Lu et al. (2021).\n\n2.4 The GEOS-Chem forward model We use the nested version of the GEOS-Chem 12.5.0 chemical transport model (http://geos-chem.org, last access: 6 April 2021) (Wecht et al., 2014) as the forward model for the inversion. The model is driven by MERRA-2 re-analysis meteorological fields at their native 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.625 \u2218 resolution (Gelaro et al., 2017). Methane loss from atmospheric oxidation is as described in Lu et al. (2021) but is inconsequential here because it is negligibly slow compared to the timescale for ventilation of the North American domain. Soil uptake of methane is from the MeMo model v1.0 (Murguia-Flores et al., 2018) but is very small and therefore not optimized in the inversion. The GEOS-Chem model simulation is conducted at 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.625 \u2218 resolution over the North America domain (130\u201355\u2218 W, 15\u201365\u2218 N) (Fig. 1) for the 2010\u20132017 period, with dynamic boundary conditions archived every 3 h from a global 2010\u20132017 simulation at 4 \u2218 \u00d7 5 \u2218 resolution using methane emissions and sinks previously optimized with GOSAT observations (Lu et al., 2021). This means that GOSAT observations over North America are used twice: once for the global inversion (along with other observations worldwide) and once for the North American inversion, but this is inconsequential because the sole purpose of the global optimization is to avoid biases in boundary conditions that would cause spurious corrections to emissions within the inversion domain (Wecht et al., 2014). Lu et al. (2021) show that their optimized simulation is unbiased in comparison to global zonal mean observations for 2010\u20132017, but we still find some residual biases for individual years up to 5 ppbv. We therefore optimize the mean boundary conditions for individual years on each side of the domain (north, south, west, east) as part of the North American inversion. The initial methane concentration fields on 1 January 2010 are from Lu et al. (2021), which have been adjusted to have an unbiased zonal mean relative to GOSAT observations such that model discrepancies with observations over our 2010\u20132017 simulation period can be attributed to model errors in emissions instead of errors in initial conditions.\n\n2.5 Inversion procedure Our state vector x to be optimized in the inversion includes spatially resolved emissions in North America and boundary conditions for each year of 2010\u20132017. Although we could technically optimize methane emissions for each of the 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.625 \u2218 native model grid elements, the observations do not have sufficient coverage to constrain emissions everywhere at that resolution, and doing so would introduce large smoothing errors in the inversion (Wecht et al., 2014). Following Turner and Jacob (2015) and Maasakkers et al. (2021), we use instead a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to determine the emission patterns that can be constrained effectively by the inversion. This is done by projecting the native-resolution methane emissions onto 600 Gaussian functions optimized to fit the location, magnitude, and distribution of methane emissions for different sectors as given by the prior estimates. Optimal construction of the GMM aggregates regions with weak or homogeneous emissions while preserving native resolution for strong localized source regions. The Gaussian functions overlap, providing additional high-resolution structure in the inverse solution on the 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.625 \u2218 native grid. The state vector x for individual years is defined as the emission of each of the 600 Gaussians, plus the correction to the model boundary conditions as described earlier, for a total dimension n=604. The inversion finds the optimal estimate of x by minimizing the Bayesian cost function J(x) (Brasseur and Jacob, 2017): J ( x ) = x - x A T S A - 1 ( x - x A ) (1) + \u03b3 ( y - F ( x ) ) T S O - 1 ( y - F ( x ) ) , where x A is the prior estimate of x, S A denotes the prior error covariance matrix, y is the observation vector, S O denotes the observation error covariance matrix, \u03b3 is a regularization factor (see below), and F(x) represents the GEOS-Chem simulation of y. The GEOS-Chem forward model F(x) as implemented here is strictly linear (because methane sinks are not optimized) so that the model can expressed as y = K x + c , where K = \u2202 y / \u2202 x represents the Jacobian matrix and c is a constant. Minimizing the cost function (Eq. 1) by solving \u2207 x J(x)=0 yields closed-form posterior estimates of the state vector x ^ , its error covariance matrix S ^ , and the averaging kernel matrix A (Rodgers, 2000; Brasseur and Jacob, 2017): (2) x ^ = x A + G ( y - K x A ) , (3) S ^ = ( \u03b3 K T S O - 1 K + S A - 1 ) - 1 , (4) A = \u2202 x ^ \u2202 x = I n - S ^ S A - 1 , where G in Eq. (2) is the gain matrix, (5) G = \u2202 x ^ \u2202 y = \u03b3 K T S O - 1 K + S A - 1 - 1 \u03b3 K T S O - 1 . The averaging kernel matrix A in Eq. (4) quantifies the sensitivity of the posterior estimate to changes in the true value and therefore measures the information content provided by the observing system for correcting the prior estimates and returning the true values as posterior estimates. We refer to the diagonal elements of A as the averaging kernel sensitivities and to the trace of A as the degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) representing the number of pieces of independent information on the state vector obtained from the observing system (Rodgers, 2000). Our inversion returns the posterior estimates of mean emissions and averaging kernel sensitivities for each Gaussian, and these can be mapped additively to the 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.625 \u2218 grid using their spatial distributions on the grid. The analytical solution to Eq. (2), and inference of error statistics and information content from Eqs. (3) and (4), requires explicit construction of the Jacobian matrix K. We construct K by conducting GEOS-Chem simulations in which each element of the state vector (methane emission and model boundary correction) is perturbed separately. This is readily done computationally as an embarrassingly parallel problem. The analytical solution has several advantages relative to the more widely used variational (numerical) approach. (1) It identifies the true minimum in the cost function. (2) It provides complete explicit forms of the posterior error covariance and averaging kernel matrices. (3) It enables a range of sensitivity analyses at no significant computational cost by modifying the inversion parameters and adding or subtracting observations. To construct the prior error covariance matrix S A , we assume a 50 % error standard deviation for individual Gaussians in the base inversion (and we test the sensitivity to that assumption, as will be described later), with no spatial error covariance so that S A is diagonal. There is necessarily some spatial covariance in the prior estimates since the Gaussians have spatial overlap, and there is also some spatial covariance in the forward model error contributing to S O , but these are difficult to quantify. The former would underestimate the information content of the observations, while the latter would overestimate it. We effectively correct for this using the regularization parameter \u03b3 as described below, and we further rely on our inversion ensemble rather than the posterior error covariance matrix to characterize the error in our posterior solution. The standard assumption of Gaussian error statistics in the cost function of Eq. (1) is required to achieve an analytical solution but may lead to unphysical negative emissions (Miller et al., 2014) and fail to capture the heavy tail of the emission distribution (Zavala-Araiza et al., 2015; Frankenberg et al., 2016; Alvarez et al., 2018). We solve this problem by optimizing for ln (x) instead of x, with the error on ln (x) following a normal Gaussian distribution, i.e., lognormal errors for x (Maasakkers et al., 2019). The forward model is then nonlinear so that the solution must be solved iteratively with a transformed Jacobian matrix K N \u2032 = \u2202 y / \u2202 ln ( x ) at each iteration N. Once the original Jacobian matrix K = \u2202 y / \u2202 x for the linear model has been computed, we can derive K N \u2032 immediately at any iteration by \u2202 y i / \u2202 ln ( x j ) = x j \u2202 y i / \u2202 x j , where i and j represent the indices of the observation and state vector elements, respectively. The iterative solution is obtained with the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method (Rodgers, 2000) for each iteration N: x N + 1 \u2032 = x N \u2032 + \u03b3 K \u2032 N T S O - 1 K N \u2032 + 1 + \u03ba S \u2032 A - 1 - 1 (6) \u03b3 K \u2032 N T S O - 1 y - K x N - S \u2032 A - 1 x N \u2032 - x A \u2032 , where x \u2032 = ln ( x ) with the initial value x 0 \u2032 from the prior estimate, and \u03ba=10 is a coefficient for the iterative approach to the solution (Rodgers, 2000). S A \u2032 (with diagonal elements denoted by s A \u2032 ) is the prior error covariance matrix for the inversion in log space and can be derived from the original prior error covariance matrix S A (with diagonal elements denoted by s A ) following (Maasakkers et al., 2019) (7) s A \u2032 = ln x A + s A x A + ln x A - s A x A 2 2 . We adopt as a convergence criterion that the maximum difference between x N + 1 \u2032 and x N \u2032 elements be smaller than 5 \u2030, at which point we adopt x ^ \u2032 = x N + 1 \u2032 as our posterior solution. The posterior error covariance and averaging kernel matrices S ^ \u2032 and A\u2032 on the log solution are obtained by replacing S A and K with S A \u2032 and K\u2032 in Eqs. (3) and (4). Optimization of emissions in log space means that x ^ \u2032 is a best estimate of the median of the lognormal error distribution rather than the mean. The mean values for spatial and sectoral aggregation purposes can be inferred from the properties of the lognormal distribution as x j ( mean ) = x j ( median ) e s ^ j j \u2032 / 2 , where s ^ j j \u2032 is the corresponding diagonal element of the posterior error covariance matrix in log space, i.e., the geometric error standard deviation. The boundary conditions are still optimized with normal error distributions, assuming an error standard deviation of 10 ppb. The above describes our base inversion. We also conduct sensitivity inversions using different error assumptions. This includes (1) using the quadrature sum of error variances for all sectors contributing to a given Gaussian with a cap of 50 % following Maasakkers et al. (2021), resulting in a 43 % error on average; (2)\u2013(4) using the normal error distributions (then with the linear Jacobian matrix) with 50 %, 95 %, and the quadrature sum of errors for individual Gaussians as error variances; and (5) assuming an error standard deviation of 5 ppb for boundary conditions. The observation error covariance matrix S O includes contributions from measurement and forward model errors. We compute it following the residual error method originally described by Heald et al. (2004) and previously used by Lu et al. (2021). A GEOS-Chem simulation with prior emission estimates yields a prior model estimate F(x A ) of concentrations at the observation points. The mean 2010\u20132017 discrepancy between the observations and the prior model, y - F ( x A ) \u203e , is determined for each grid cell (for GOSAT), individual observation site (surface and tower), and observation platform (shipboard and aircraft). y - F ( x A ) \u203e is taken to represent the systematic bias in the prior emissions to be corrected in the inversion. The residual term, \u03b5 O = y - F ( x A ) - y - F ( x A ) \u203e , represents the random observation error including contributions from the measurements, the forward model, and the representation of the observation points on the model grid (Heald et al., 2004). The variance of \u03b5 O provides the diagonal terms of S O . The resulting observation error standard deviations average 13 ppb for GOSAT, 26 ppb for surface sites, 39 ppb for towers, 19 ppb for ships, and 22 ppb for aircraft. The observation error is larger for in situ than for satellite observations, even though the in situ measurements are more precise, because the forward model error is larger for vertically resolved points (particularly for surface air in source regions) than for atmospheric columns (Cusworth et al., 2018). The observation error for in situ observations is dominated by the forward model error, while that for GOSAT is dominated by the measurement error. We do not have sufficient objective information to quantify the error correlation structure of S O , and we therefore assume it to be diagonal. This may underestimate S O because of correlated transport and source aggregation errors in the forward model, as noted above. We follow Zhang et al. (2018) to introduce a regularization factor \u03b3 for the observation terms in the cost function J(x) (Eq. 1) to avoid either overfits or underfits that would result from missing covariant (off-diagonal) structure in S O and S A , respectively. Lu et al. (2021) showed that the optimal value of this regularization factor can be selected such that the sum of the n prior terms in the posterior estimate of the cost function ( J A ( x ^ ) = ( x ^ - x A ) T S A - 1 ( x ^ - x A ) ) has a value \u2248 n , which is the expected value from the chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom. Here we determine the regularization factor \u03b3 separately for in situ and GOSAT data following Lu et al. (2021) and find that \u03b3=1 is best for both. We also conduct a sensitivity inversion using \u03b3=0.5 for the GOSAT observation terms (while keeping \u03b3=1 for in situ data terms in the joint inversion) as adopted in Maasakkers et al. (2021).

The ensemble comprises 33 inversions using the different combinations of settings in the table. The base inversion including GOSAT and in situ data represents our best estimate, but we will compare it prominently to the GOSAT-only and in-situ-only inversions with the same inversion parameters in order to evaluate the contributions from the different observing platforms for optimizing emissions. We will use the other ensemble members to discuss the sensitivity of inversion results to the choices of observations and inversion parameters, as well as to define the range of uncertainty in the inversion results."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/united-statesmexicocanada-agreement-a-glimpse-into-the-geoeconomic-world-order/055695FD26B96374402A0FFF52915F52", "page_content": "The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) differs in a few important ways from prior trade deals signed by the United States but reveals a glimpse of the infrastructure for a new era in international economic governance.Footnote 1 This new \u201cGeoeconomic World Order,\u201d will be characterized by great power rivalry between the United States and China, the intense use of protectionist tools to achieve strategic and political goals, and the diminished role of legal adjudication.Footnote 2 This approach to trade policy will likely outlast the autocratic and/or nationalistic governments emerging around the world, including the current Trump administration. While international trade law will recover, it will look different in key respects\u2014it will be less multilateral, predictable, justiciable, and enforceable. This more transactional view of international trade law implies a limit on the role of law and an increase in the use of power. Footnote 3 It may force a retrenchment of international interdependence and a revival of zones of influence prevalent during the Cold War era.\n\nThe Context of the Negotiation Donald Trump's campaign soundbites of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d \u201cmake them pay,\u201d \u201csend them back,\u201d and other offensive harangues against Mexicans were followed by demands to terminate a twenty-five-year-old trade deal if renegotiations were not to his liking. Given its dependency on access to U.S. markets, Mexico had to capitulate to the demands, and in so doing became the first nation to succumb to Trump's \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d The resulting agreement, timed around electoral concerns and politics on both sides of the border, may well illustrate the elements of a new era in international economic governance. There should be no surprise that Mexico was the first to agree to sign a trade deal with the Trump administration. More than 80 percent of Mexican exports go to the United States. If the United States had suddenly terminated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it would have crippled Mexico's economy by deterring productive investment and tanking Mexico's long-term growth. This would have been particularly damaging at a time when the unilateral U.S. tariffs adopted in the name of national security on aluminum and steel had already affected Mexico. The new USMCA\u2014which is practically, albeit not technically two bilateral deals signed by the United States\u2014is expected to take effect January 1, 2020. Legislative bodies in the three countries will have to approve the deal, a process that may take some months and could be upended by the Democrat's takeover of the House of Representatives in the United States.Footnote 4\n\nUSMCA and the \u201cNew Normal\u201d One way to understand the USMCA is as a small element in a changing global environment. While it is the product of a negotiation, key features of the agreement squarely reflect U.S. interests (some of which align with Mexican and Canadian interests) because the (still) biggest economy in the world enjoys considerable leverage over Canada and especially Mexico. In the differences with its direct predecessors\u2014namely NAFTA, but also the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (which until January 2017 also involved the three countries)\u2014the USMCA reveals some of the pillars of a new Geoeconomic World Order. This order is: characterized by great power rivalry between the United States and China and the clear use of economic tools to achieve strategic goals. This increased convergence of economic and security thinking and strategies is likely to lead to a significant restructuring of the laws and institutions that govern international trade and investment.Footnote 5 In essence, the post-WWII liberal era that drifted into the neoliberal world is rapidly evaporating and new institutions that will manage the future of economic interdependence are emerging. Many states are adapting in part by pushing decision-making towards the realm of national discretion and away from international oversight. This results in the curtailment of key features of the liberal order, primarily international legal adjudication. Especially in the United States, concerns over the security risks posed by interdependence and China's economic ambitions are enhancing state control of the economy (chiefly, the general desirability of free trade and foreign investment in key sectors), and perhaps a more isolationist version of self-sufficiency and resilience.Footnote 6 The USMCA reflects this shift. Combined, its features reduce the role of law\u2014or, at the very least, the role of international adjudication\u2014and increase the role of power\u2014or, at the very least, the use of raw economic power. The ultimate goal may be to expand flexibility, policy space, or discretion to implement trade measures to protect the industrial and manufacturing base on national security grounds, to expand screening of foreign investments in critical infrastructure, and to impose new export constraints with respect to key, cutting-edge technologies\u2014all with little risk of meaningful accountability or legal challenges on international law grounds. For instance, in the realm of trade, one of the major shortcomings of NAFTA was its incomplete state-to-state dispute settlement process, under which a dispute settlement panel could only be established with the consent of the parties. Chapter 31 of the USMCA, which addresses dispute settlement, looks similar. It requires that by the date of entry into force of the agreement \u201ca roster shall be appointed by consensus and remain in effect for a minimum of three years or until the Parties constitute a new roster.\u201dFootnote 7 Nothing ensures that the parties will follow through with such commitment and do more than they did under NAFTA\u2014making the obligations of the treaty hard to enforce. In fact, the situation is worse than it was when NAFTA entered into force, given that by the time USMCA enters into force the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) dispute settlement mechanism will likely no longer be functioning and thus will not provide Canada and Mexico with a consequential alternative process. Further, the treaty mandates a review process, plus eventual automatic expiration if the review does not confirm the parties\u2019 desire to extend the agreement. This may increase the role of power when disagreement ensues, especially if dispute settlement is unavailable.Footnote 8 Turning to foreign investment, the treaty significantly scaled back the role of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), an imperfect mechanism, but one whose use until recently had been a well-established policy of the U.S. government.Footnote 9 In principle, there is no more general recourse to ISDS between the United States and Canada (with some exceptions for Legacy Investment Claims and Pending Claims). The agreement maintains a limited version of ISDS between Mexico and the United States.Footnote 10 Notably, in many instances, claims alleging the failure to provide a minimum standard of treatment or an indirect expropriation are not allowed. Establishment and acquisition claims are generally barred, and exhaustion of local remedies is almost always required. As a result, it is unlikely that a government's decision to unfairly block foreign investment will ever be reviewed by USMCA arbitrators. In fact, the United States\u2019 Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act approved in October 2018 has increased investment surveillance and national executive discretion in this realm. Therefore, such a decision is unlikely to be significantly reviewed under U.S. domestic law either.Footnote 11 At the same time, the USMCA maintains a trend towards regulatory harmonization, the regulation of e-commerce, and free transfer of data reflected in the TPP Agreement. These areas are also interesting examples of balancing \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d law. This balancing is done by promoting the particular policy preferences within international law, but insulating decisions from international adjudicatory review. For example, the USMCA prevents parties from restricting \u201cthe cross-border transfer of information,\u201d with limited exceptions.Footnote 12 Additionally, it prevents parties from requiring firms \u201cto use or locate computing facilities in that Party's territory as a condition for conducting business.\u201dFootnote 13 These provisions advance the interests of larger technology companies in sustaining an unregulated internet by preventing protectionist data localization requirements that inhibit the flow of data across borders. However, like the chapter on regulatory harmonization, which emphasizes science-based risk assessment, it has very limited judicial bite.Footnote 14 In fact, the treaty provides that no party to the agreement shall have recourse for dispute settlement for a matter arising under the regulatory harmonization provisions, except to address a sustained and recurring course of action or inaction.Footnote 15 Even the most \u201cprogressive\u201d elements of the USMCA show similar geoeconomic impulses and a general distaste for legal adjudication. For instance, the much-needed anticorruption provisions are nonjusticiable, evidence that the United States will continue to rely on corruption allegations at a political level\u2014when the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and its disparate effects) is inapplicable\u2014to embarrass foreign authorities.Footnote 16 To be sure, the higher environmental standards or explicit protection of indigenous and labor rights prominently covering violence against workers, migrant workers, and sex-based discrimination should be celebrated, although these obligations will be difficult to enforce.Footnote 17 Even the much-touted automobile provisions demanding that a percentage of a vehicle be built by workers earning at least US$16 an hour may be of little help. Both countries negotiated a side letter allowing exports at a lower tariff rate to allow U.S. cars continued access to the U.S. market\u2014including vehicles built with low wages\u2014to avoid any dispute.Footnote 18 With unprecedented unilateral actions against China in the background (a 25 percent tariff on US$50 billion and an additional 10 percent tariff on US$200 billion of Chinese goods) and the threat of more to come, the USMCA seeks to help reconfigure supply chains.Footnote 19 In addition to reestablishing lower tariffs and regulatory harmonization in the region, U.S. policymakers are using the treaty to sketch a new approach in which production location should be subjected to higher levels of state oversight, making these measures harder to challenge before international mechanisms. In an island of optimism amidst profound uncertainty, Mexico and Canada stand to win something under this new framework, as the treaty may force the relocation of manufacturing to North America. But if there were any doubt as to the new approach behind the USMCA, two clauses aimed at China discourage partners from establishing free trade agreements with a \u201cnon-market economy\u201d or granting similar enforceable investment benefits to that economy's investors.Footnote 20 This could also prove to be a costly constraint on economic policy for Mexico and Canada."}, {"url": "https://seguridadinternacional.es/resi/html/u-s-mexico-drug-trafficking-globalization-cooperation-and-challenges/", "page_content": "JUAN CARLOS GACH\u00daZ MAYA\n\nUniversidad de las Am\u00e9ricas Puebla, M\u00e9xico\n\nT\u00edtulo: Tr\u00e1fico de drogas en Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico: globalizaci\u00f3n, cooperaci\u00f3n y desaf\u00edos\n\nSummary: Criminal organizations have taken advantage of some of the benefits of the globalization process, have expanded their networks and have become groups that operate regionally and transnationally.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18847/1.9.3\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of transnational organized crime is not clear-cut or straightforward. There is no standard definition for it in criminological or criminal law theories. Moreover, transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) differ substantially from each other in terms of organizational structure, types of activities, and size, for instance. Despite this lack of consensus on the definition of transnational organized crime, several crucial elements are evident in all cases.\n\nFirst, such organizations conduct criminal acts, violating legal frameworks and making profits outside the legitimate procedures of law enforcement. Individuals who intentionally join the groups operate under the direction of established leaders and execute their activities efficiently. These groups are well organized and their structure is more or less permanent, even when they are not composed of rigidly subordinated groups. Transnational organized crime sometimes occurs through a network of homogeneous groups linked to one another across borders by various forms of solidarity, complicity, and one hierarchical order (Fulvio, 1997).\n\nAdditionally, TCOs are active in a variety of fields. The full spectrum of their activities includes bank fraud, cybercrime, and the illegal trafficking of goods and people. Moreover, TCOs are willing to use violence, bribery, and other such means in order to achieve their goals and protect their interests. And, of course, a main characteristic of these groups is that their criminal practices are not limited by national boundaries (Voronin, 2000). The U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime states that an offense is transnational in nature if:\n\n(a) it is committed in more than one nation; (b) it is committed in one nation but a substantial part of its preparation, planning, direction, or control takes place in another; (c) it is committed in one nation but involves an organized criminal group that engages in criminal activities in more than one nation; or (d) it is committed in one nation but has substantial effects in another nation (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2004).\n\nTransnational crime: a negative externality of globalization\n\nThere has been some discussion of the relationship between globalization and organized crime. According to Phil Williams, professor at the University of Pittsburgh, globalization has been beneficial to transnational organized crime. He argues that while globalization facilitates international trade and the exchange of goods, it also increases the difficulty of regulating other activities such the trade of illegal goods and of enforcing laws intended to stop them. In the same context, since the 1980s the global financial system has undergone widespread deregulation, which facilitates money laundering to hide the ill-gotten profits of organized crime. In other words, financial deregulation benefits criminal actors because it allows them to launder money through its placement, layering, and ultimately integration into the legitimate financial system. Moreover, the negative externalities of globalization may have contributed to expanding the ranks of organized crime. As Williams says:\n\nIn terms of sociological impacts, globalization has also brought about some negative effects [\u2026]. The process of globalization generated not just winners, but also losers. Its disruptive effect, causing higher inequality and poverty for many across the globe, led some people into engaging in organized crime and criminal activities, mainly as the result of a lack of opportunities and an extreme unequal income distribution (Williams, 2012).\n\nThere has been also relevant discussion on the impact of technology and its relationship with global crime. Broude and Teichman (2008) argue that in taking advantage of globalization processes, TCOs also expanded their networks not only at regional levels but globally as well, drawing particular attention to technological developments. They state that:\n\nillicit activities have flourished, as have legal international business transactions, due to technological advances in transportation and telecommunications that facilitate the freer movement of goods, services, money, and people. Just as there are direct links between technological progress and economic liberalization, the removal of barriers to the international trade of goods and the free flow of funds has also facilitated illicit cross-border trade (Broude and Teichman, 2008).\n\nIn other words, there is no reason to believe that these developments would exclusively benefit only legal activities and not become instruments for illegal transactions as well. Transnational networks now have access to state-of-the-art technologies for the transport of illicit drugs (planes, submarines, drones, etc.), and use complex cyber operations for money laundering and financial activities. The power of transnational crime has grown dramatically in recent years; based on available academic research, organized crime now accounts for perhaps as much as 15 percent of the world\u2019s GDP (Misha, 2009). Additionally, the transnational trade in illicit drugs also fuels organized crime and corruption across regions that are incorporated into transnational supply chains (Gomis, 2014).\n\nIllegal drug traffic across the U.S.-Mexico border\n\nOne of the major current challenges in U.S.-Mexico relations is the illegal trafficking of drugs and weapons across the border. This illicit trade has a significant impact on the economic, political, and social sectors of the two countries. The U.S. is the biggest consumer of illegal drugs than any other nation in the world and, as a result of sharing a border, demand is inextricably tied to Mexico (Liu and Taylor, 2012).\n\nCriminal organizations have established binational coordinated structures. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) states that TCOs pose the greatest threat to the United States in terms of illegal drug trafficking.\n\nMexican TCOs remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. The Sinaloa Cartel maintains the most expansive footprint in the United States, while Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion\u2019s (CJNG) domestic presence has significantly expanded in the past few years (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: VI).\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Justice, Mexican criminal groups control the supply and wholesale distribution of most of the illicit drugs in the United States and have a presence in more than 1,000 U.S. cities (Beittel, 2015). Such organizations are not only found in \u201ctraditional\u201d places such as the border states of Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and California, but also in cities like Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In Boston, for example, local distribution groups are increasingly receiving cocaine directly from the Mexican cartels through their bases in the border states.\n\nThe DEA has confirmed that the most powerful Mexican cartels now have a presence in U.S. territory:\n\nSinaloa Cartel, CJNG, Juarez Cartel, Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas Cartel, and Beltran-Leyva Organization (BLO). Each of these TCOs maintains drug distribution cells in designated cities across the United States that either report directly to TCO leaders in Mexico or indirectly through intermediaries (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: 97).\n\nPerhaps because of its operational structure and logistical and financial capacity, the Sinaloa Cartel is considered the most active drug supplier. This organization is dominant in much of Mexico and has managed to spread its influence north of the border. Each of the previously mentioned TCOs has sought ways to penetrate the black market and gain more territory both domestically and abroad by making use of fear and violence (Beittel, 2015). In this struggle for influence, the CJNG has increasingly acquired power that allows it to challenge the Sinaloa Cartel for dominance over trafficking operations in Asia, Europe, Oceania, and especially the United States.\n\nThere are relevant points of entry of illicit drugs into the U.S., such as Tijuana\u2013San Diego, Mexicali\u2013Calexico, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez\u2013El Paso (Liu and Taylor, 2012). Most cocaine enters the United States through its southwest border and is then transported and distributed by Mexican drug cartels, which have monopolized the transportation of drugs within the U.S. Likewise, the majority of the methamphetamines available in the U.S. is clandestinely produced in Mexico and smuggled across the southwest border (Liu and Taylor, 2012).\n\nAccording to The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA):\n\nMexican TCOs will continue to produce and traffic high-purity, high-potency methamphetamine across the Southwest Border into the United States. Mexican TCOs will continue to adapt their production methods as restrictions are placed on precursors, or precursor chemicals become temporarily unavailable or cost-prohibitive (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: 75).\n\nCriminal organizations in the border region have become binational and, in some cases, multinational in nature. These groups first gain control over national-level neighborhoods in strategic areas, and then expand to transnational illegal activity. Through their ties to TCOs, both Mexican cartels and U.S. gangs distribute and move the drugs across the country, ensuring payment for and protection of the merchandise during the trip. Moreover, these links have allowed the highest-ranking members of Mexican TCOs to continue operating in the U.S. without detection by law enforcement.\n\nTable 1 shows that drug trafficking in the U.S. does not have its origin only in Mexican criminal groups, many U.S. gangs participate directly in criminal activities with Mexican counterparts. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary shows a list of connections between U.S. street gangs and Mexican cartels. These regional connections tend to grow and expand all over the U.S.\n\nTable 1.

The DEA considers that:\n\nMexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana in the United States. Along the Southwest Border in CY 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized nearly 500,000 kilograms of marijuana in approximately 20,000 incidents. Far fewer quantities of marijuana are smuggled into the U.S. from Canada and the Caribbean (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: 77).\n\nIn addition, trafficking organizations annually smuggle $8.3 to $24.9 billion in drug proceeds into Mexico for laundering purposes (Cook, 2007). The majority of cocaine smuggled into the U.S. is transported over the southwest border, with a smaller percentage transported through the Caribbean corridor. Mexican TCOs continue to dominate cocaine transportation in the U.S. with little to no competition (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2015).\n\nU.S.-Mexico cooperation and challenges\n\nDue to the figures previously stated, the U.S. government believes that Mexican TCOs remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States, and that no other group can challenge them in the near term (Beittel, 2015). The extensive, damaging activities of TCOs have led both the U.S. and Mexico to implement policies and bilateral initiatives to address the problem. The subject of transnational organized crime has long been part of the bilateral agenda shared between the two countries, particularly since the beginning of 2000. Perhaps the most important policy to fight transnational crime in the region is the M\u00e9rida Initiative (Plan M\u00e9rida), which was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008. This initiative allowed the transfer of resources to Mexico and Central American countries with the objective of limiting the operation of criminal organizations.\n\nAs part of this program, the U.S. has provided Mexico with about $1.6 billion in kind through the donation of aircraft and equipment, as well as the transfer of technology and training. These assets have been received in Mexico by the Ministry of National Defense, the Mexican Navy, the Federal Police, the Office of the General Prosecutor, the Tax Administration Service, and the National Institute of Migration. Among the goods provided are helicopters, surveillance aircraft, vehicles with scanners, and other inspection equipment, including trained dogs. In addition to these assets, the project covers police training and investigation programs, as well as the training of judicial officials to implement the 2008 reform \u2014 through which Mexico began the transition to the accusatory and oral criminal system \u2014 as well as the infrastructure required to launch this new judicial model (Cisneros, 2017).\n\nIn this context, the M\u00e9rida Initiative continued to produce results, notably the arrests of Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n[1] in 2014 and again in 2016, as well as his extradition to the United States in 2017 (Cisneros, 2017).\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has developed a strategic approach to dismantling TCOs and fighting violence generated in both countries. With the aim of undermining the Mexican drug cartels, the DOJ strategy is based on six key strategies and serves as a support for the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy. These strategies are the following:\n\n1. Enhance intelligence capabilities associated with the Southwest border.\n\n2. Interdict drugs, drug proceeds, and associated instruments of violence at the ports of entry, between the ports of entry, and in the air and maritime domains along the Southwest border.\n\n3. Ensure the prosecution of all significant drug trafficking, money laundering, bulk currency, and weapons smuggling/trafficking cases.\n\n4. Disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations.\n\n5. Enhance counterdrug technologies for drug detection and interdiction along the Southwest border.\n\n6. Enhance U.S. \u2013 Mexico cooperation regarding joint counterdrug efforts\u201d (National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, 2009).\n\nThese strategies put particular efforts on sharing coordinated and extensive intelligence capabilities. Law enforcement agencies at the federal and local levels generate a large amount of information that is helpful for U.S. operations. In addition, the agencies seek to support Mexican authorities in their efforts to combat the cartels and internal corruption. Second, the strategy mandates that intelligence and prosecution agencies focus all their efforts, resources, and local and international capacities on investigation, extradition, prosecution, and punishment of key cartel leaders. The ultimate goals of these operations are to neutralize the cartels and bring criminals to justice (Breuer, Hoover and Placido, 2009).\n\nAnother relevant regional policy of the U.S. DEA in cooperation with Mexican and Canadian authorities was implemented in 2009. \u201cOperation Xcellerator\u201d specifically targeted the Sinaloa Cartel. The DOJ reported that 750 detained individuals were charged with multiple crimes, which included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, violating felony provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, conspiracy to import controlled substances and money laundering. (Randall, 2009). This operation has been one of the most successful and coordinated actions in the history of fighting TCOs in the region.\n\nLogistics, operations, and routes across the U.S.-Mexico border\n\nMexican TCOs have set efficient bilateral connections in most of the U.S. territory. Criminal groups have coordinated with U.S. counterparts to work as multinational organizations. (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2015).\n\nTCOs\u2019 operations have turned into sophisticated supply chains. Individuals who transport drug loads work independently and provide their services to various drug cartels. The lack of interconnection between the different links in the chain is useful to criminal organizations; since operators are insulated from one another.\n\nThe 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) states that:\n\nMexican TCOs dominate cocaine transportation throughout the United States, but rely on local criminal groups for retail level distribution (\u2026) Mexican and Colombian TCOs work to actively minimize their involvement with U.S. law enforcement and therefore primarily try to limit their roles to whole sale level transportation (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: 55).\n\nDrugs are occasionally trafficked through subterranean tunnels connected to a network of safe houses on both sides of the border (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2015). Additionally, there is new evidence of the use of submarines and drones to transport illicit drugs across the border (Millward, 2017) and (Bender, 2017).\n\nTCOs have evolved into multinational corporations that look to maximize profits and sales and expand beyond their borders. In this context, the increase in drug trafficking has led to the expansion of the routes through various territories across different regions.\n\nIn 2017, \u201cMexico emerged as the primary destination for cocaine documented departing South America mostly due to cocaine movements aboard noncommercial maritime vessels in the Eastern Pacific\u201d (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2018: 50-51). Mexican TCO\u2019s have displaced cartels from other countries (mainly Colombian) but it has been observed also that there is a new trend of cooperation between Mexican, Colombian and Central American TCO\u2019s. \u201cMexico constitutes a critical component in the overall Latin American drug trade\u201d (Chalk, 2016).\n\nInternational cooperation: approaches and policy recommendations\n\nThere is currently a debate over the different approaches of the international fight against TCOs. One approach is the official view of the U.N., based mainly on the 2000 U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The convention established the legal framework for understanding the threat and fostering international cooperation to address problems related to money laundering; corruption; illicit trafficking in substances, weapons and people; terrorism; and organized crime across national borders (United Nations, 2004). It defines terms such as \u201corganized criminal group\u201d and \u201cserious crime\u201d and states that, as criminal organizations have used the globalization process to achieve their goals, the international community can and must exploit global resources to defend human rights and defeat the forces of crime, corruption, and trafficking of human beings (United Nations, 2004). To accomplish this, the convention includes protocols related to the trafficking of persons (especially women and children); the smuggling of migrants by land, sea, and air; and the illegal manufacturing and trafficking of firearms. \u201cAccording to estimates by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the global illicit drugs market has an annual value of $320 billion, making it the third largest market in the world after oil and arms,\u201d as cited by Beno\u00eet Gomis (Gomis, 2014).\n\nA briefing paper published by Chatham House in 2014 makes some observations about the illegal drug trade that are worth mentioning. First, the paper argues that the global drug trade has been a persistent problem for several decades. It states that although an international drug control system has been built based on a number of U.N. conventions and documents, it still \u201crevolves primarily around the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs, which was complemented by the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\u201d (Gomis, 2014). Thus, the U.N. conventions have been the main source for the establishment of the drug control system; as a result, measures have focused on reducing the size of the illegal drug market with the unrealistic aim of creating a drug-free world (Gomis, 2014).\n\nAs the demand highly increases is even more difficult to control the operations of TCO\u2019s due to the growing profitability of these criminal activities. Another negative effect of these policies is related to human rights. TCOs have also and impact in failed states or regions, for example, some regions in Mexico such as Tamaulipas, Guerrero, Sinaloa, etc. or countries like Guatemala, Honduras, etc. are some cases of extreme violence and lack of governmental authority to face the growing economic power of TCOs. Failed states are a result of TCO activities and inefficient government policies (and in Mexico\u2019s case, failed allocation of public goods, or corruption).\n\nParadoxically, increasing cross-border global trade flows, pushing economic liberalization, implementing reforms, and weakening the power of the nation-state have all facilitated opportunities for transnational organized crime. Such elements of globalization provide opportunities to TCOs to flourish and expand (Hanna, 2016).\n\nA relevant concept for this discussion is the so-called policy transfer, which is defined as \u201cthe process by which knowledge about how policies, administrative arrangements, institutions, and ideas in one political setting is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting.\u201d (Hanna, 2016). In this context, TCOs can be approached from two perspectives (Figure 1):\n\nFigure 1. Approaches to Transnational Crime\n\nSource: Based on information from (Hanna, 2016) Transnational Crime & Criminal Justice, 2016.\n\nParticular problems have arisen from the lack of coordination of legal frameworks within various countries and regions. For instance, marijuana trafficking presents a challenge for state and federal laws in the United States, since marijuana remains illegal under federal law. However, numerous states have passed legislation approving the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana within their respective borders. The disparity between federal laws that prohibit the use of \u201cmedical\u201d or \u201crecreational\u201d marijuana and state laws that authorize it poses a challenge for federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement efforts, given the different legal frameworks at the state level. Additionally, the fact that most of the marijuana that is trafficked into the United States comes from Mexico makes the problem more complex, due to the differences in the legal frameworks in both countries (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2015).\n\nThe international drug control system has been ineffective in reducing the overall demand, trafficking, production, and price of drugs, and therefore the size of the global market. The global demand for drugs not only persists but has also evolved (Gomis, 2014). In Mexico alone, drug-related violence during the administration of Felipe Calder\u00f3n (2006\u20132012) reached more than 60,000 deaths. During the two first years of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration (2013\u20132014), there were 20,000 more victims recorded (Ribando and Finklea, 2016). In total, it is estimated that from 2006 through 2015, more than 80,000 organized crime-related killings have taken place in Mexico (Beittel, 2015). Transnational crime demands global justice, a term used to refer to \u201cmeasures taken to redress harm and rebuild communities following violence and conflict, and it can include criminal prosecutions via international or domestic courts\u201d (Beittel, 2015).\n\nLaw enforcement reports in the U.S. indicate that American and Mexican gang relationships are opportunistic in nature and set temporary or permanent criminal activities according to their interest. Many gangs rely on Mexican TCOs as their primary source of supply for drugs, and Mexican organizations depend on U.S. street-level gangs \u2014 many of which already have a customer base \u2014 for drug distribution. As mentioned before, this arrangement allows the highest-ranking members of Mexican cartels to remain in Mexico where they can avoid U.S. law enforcement (DEA Strategic Intelligence Section, 2015).\n\nThere is another view regarding the fight against TCOs, both regionally and globally. In a research made by Harvard, for instance, the authors recommend in a policy report that in addition to attacking the impunity of the cartels locally, the Mexican government must work to build strong communities in which people have a wide set of options for earning a living. The Mexican government should also work to subsidize education, as well as support initiatives aimed at keeping Mexican youth in school and increasing the education level of the average Mexican citizen (Liu and Taylor, 2012).\n\nApproaches of controlling drug trafficking should also take into consideration social variables that enhance the problem. For instance, low wages and poor labor conditions make preconditions for young people to enter the criminal networks. The same is true, more generally, among the less advantaged in society, who often lack employment and thereby the means to cover the basic needs of their families. Addressing these social issues is a key element in stopping people from engaging in illicit activities where criminal actors are willing to provide employment, protection, and other social services. Bodies such as the International Narcotics Control Board and UNODC are now recognizing that the past focus on supply-side issues in relation to illicit drugs has not worked (Liu and Taylor, 2012).\n\nGovernments have paid attention to the supply side while somehow neglecting the origins of the demand. Most resources are focused on law enforcement and measures to disrupt trafficking illicit goods and services. Nations should also prevent crime through a focus on social public policies.\n\nAdditionally, differences in national approaches to TCOs can be an obstacle to combatting transnational crime effectively. Nations should adopt a far-reaching strategy of institutionalized cooperation to tackle global crime (Jojarth, 2009).\n\nFighting corruption at different levels of Mexican government is also a basic requirement to achieve results in the short, medium, and long term. This in turn implies more effective mechanisms that enable greater transparency and participation by society. A precondition to control drug trafficking and criminal related activities is to eradicate corruption from the local and national governments, additionally; more efficient and better-paid law enforcement bodies will also strength the fight against TCOs.\n\nAnother policy recommendation focuses on social development in Mexico, since the building of stronger communities in which individuals have opportunities for education and job growth represents a key element in battling cartels. In consequence, this context would enable the creation of a system of self-governance, with more participation from the civil society in issues concerning education and employment (Liu and Taylor, 2012). The growing problem of transnational organized crime networks has prompted countries to cooperate in joint approaches to tackle the issue. However, these mechanisms are not enough and new reforms are needed to face the new challenges of globalized crime. States themselves need to reformulate their institutions and develop more efficient bilateral strategies to fight TCOs.\n\nFinal remarks\n\nGlobalization has brought about the need to reform the way in which institutions are structured and how they operate in different contexts. International cooperation among domestic institutions is no longer sufficient to face international challenges such as global crime. New institutional structures involving participation from states and non-state actors will be required to overcome global problems.\n\nAs Gomis states, \u201cCurrent drug policies have been counter-productive, often causing more harm than the drugs themselves through capital punishment for offences, widespread incarceration, discrimination in law enforcement, violation of basic human rights\u201d (Gomis, 2014).\n\nStates face enormous challenges due to global crime but current institutions and legal systems sometimes work either in isolation and/or at the national level. These weaknesses are used by TCOs, which freely exploit the loopholes and imperfections of state-based legal systems to extend their reach (Shelley, 2006).\n\nGlobalization processes have not only provided opportunities for the worldwide expansion of legal businesses, but for illegal businesses as well. Traditional mechanisms to control organized crime on a global scale are not enough. Nation-states must now look for new and improved ways of combatting illegal businesses, much as they seek new and innovative ways to regulate multinational corporations (Fulvio, 1997).\n\nGlobalization calls for nations to set common legal principles in order to fight crime. States need to develop new alternatives of regional and global coordination. Bilateral coordination to harmonize some aspects of national legislations is one of the main challenges in the fight against transnational organized crime within the context of globalization.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nDr. Juan Carlos Gach\u00faz is a full-time professor at the Department of International Relations and Political Science of the University of the Americas Puebla (Mexico) where he teaches the subject of International Security Theories.
