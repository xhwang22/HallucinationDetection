A forgettable chapter in the long history of the Silverstone team now known as Aston Martin it may be, but to Thomas Biagi it is a prized memory of a career that had its finest days in GT racing.\n\nThe 2003 FIA GT champion had been out of single-seaters for three years by the time he landed his long-awaited test opportunity, a decade after his last official test with Minardi at Fiorano in 1995.\n\nA stalwart of International Formula 3000 and its Italian/European cousin between 1995 and 2002, Biagi\u2019s crushing victory at Donington in 2001 \u2013 against opposition that included F1 2008's nearly-man Felipe Massa \u2013 was the exception rather than the rule.\n\nBut even at 29, Biagi never lost sight of his F1 goal \u2013 \u201cI believe in the power of your dream,\u201d he says \u2013 and despite having no manager in his corner convinced team boss Colin Kolles to give him a run out with a view to racing in 2006.\n\nWith the 2005 Toyota V10 powerplant behind his back, he completed 91 laps and lapped 1.37s quicker than new Midland signing Christijan Albers in an EJ15B with a 2006-spec V8.\n\nBiagi felt quickly at ease with the car as it was easier, he says, than his 2005 steed \u2013 the Maserati MC12 \u2013 \u201cbecause the weight of the car, the downforce, all of the electronic sup-port like traction control, differential that helps you\u201d.\n\nThomas Biagi, 2005 Midland F1 test Photo by: Motorsport Images\n\n\u201cFor me it was nice and easy for me to drive a Formula 1 car, [but] then to be world champion is another story!\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe test went extremely well, in the end they were extremely happy about my performance and my consistency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because in the end they showed me an agreement to make a full season, but I was just missing the budget. We were pretty close.\u201d\n\n\"There are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you. I miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s\" Thomas Biagi\n\nMidland used a bevy of third drivers in 2006, with Markus Winkelhock (four), Giorgio Mondini (nine), Adrian Sutil (three), Alexandre Premat and Ernesto Viso (one each) all taking their turns to drive on grand prix Fridays. Biagi wasn\u2019t among them and continued in GT1, but that wasn\u2019t the end of his F1 story.\n\nA chance paddock meeting with Kolles in 2007, when Biagi was commentating on GP2 for Sky Sport Italy, yielded an offer to sign a race-by-race deal for the renamed Spyker team in place of the cash-strapped Albers. But budget was again a stumbling block and Biagi remained in the MC12 to claim a second FIA GT title.\n\nIn his place, Winkelhock made a memorable debut at the rain-hit European GP. Thanks to a pre-race switch to wets, he was in the lead when the waterlogged track \u2013 with an expensive carpark forming in the Turn 1 gravel \u2013 caused the race to be red-flagged.\n\n\u201cWatching the race from home and seeing that the car I was supposed to drive was leading was strange!\u201d says Biagi, who would rack up further sportscar titles in Italian GT (2012) and International GT Open (2016) after prevailing in the Italian-based Superstars tin-top series in 2010.\n\nMarkus Winkelhock, Spyker F8-VII leads Felipe Massa, Ferrari F2007 Photo by: Lorenzo Bellanca / Motorsport Images\n\nA final opportunity for a crack at the F1 whip came in 2010, the year three new teams arrived on the grid, when he found a sponsor that tabled \u201ca reasonable budget\u201d. But by this point, Biagi concedes he \u201cwas definitely too late\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do a couple of races, but that\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the years after I achieved very good results in GT categories so I\u2019m happy about my career.\u201d\n\nOpportunity of a lifetime: A fallen Indycar star's Jaguar F1 test\n\nAnd he at least had the good fortune to drive a contemporary V10\u2026\n\n\u201cThere are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s, because for me, F1 is that kind of sound. It was fabulous.\u201d\n\nThomas Biagi, 2005 Midland F1 test Photo by: Motorsport Images"}, {"url": "https://us.motorsport.com/gtwce-sprint/news/hungaroring-thomas-biagi-race-report/2347339/", "page_content": "Thomas Biagi just misses out on the podium again\n\nBudapest (HU), 30 August 09 - \"I thought I would finish on the podium right until the end\", commented Thomas Biagi at the end of the two hour FIA GT race in Budapest. \"Unfortunately, we just missed out and came home in fifth. I really am disappointed because I also missed out on a top three place in the three LMS races I competed in. As ever, it just comes down to luck of the draw...\"\n\nToday's result shows just how high the standard is in the FIA GT series. Hungaroring is a very demanding circuit but all the drivers battled hard til the end and the winner was only decided at the very last minute.\n\nStill, I am happy with how my effort went. I think I was consistent and clocked very good lap times. Unfortunately, we had a little oversteer and, during my stint, I couldn't really go flat out without losing the rear end and risk handing over to Maassen a car with worn out tyres.\n\nThe positive thing from this weekend is the compliments I received from the US Corvette team and guys. Another high note is that my team mate and squad confirmed their third spot in the championship and this was our main aim. I feel very much at home at \"Luc Alphand Adventure\". I am still going for a podium finish and will try again at the final Le Mans Series event at Silverstone on 13 September\".\n\n-credit: thomasbiagi.com"}]}
