The reunion movie was a hit with fans, and it led to Stevens making three guest appearances on \u201cThe New Leave It to Beaver,\u201d which followed the Cleaver family as they navigated life in the 1980s.\n\nFor Stevens, returning to the world of \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d was a chance to reconnect with his former co-stars and revisit a beloved character from his past.

On the one hand, the show's sitcom format was foundational for the genre in a way countless other shows have emulated since.

No one has seen the child actor since. Mathers reportedly told The Pantagraph in 1982, \u201cNobody could find [Stevens] for the longest time. Everybody lost touch with him.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Mathers eventually found Stevens, who was working as a car insurance salesman in New Jersey. Mathers even convinced Stevens to participate in the Leave It to Beaver reunion movie in 1983.\n\nJerry Mathers Opens Up About Starring in \u2018Leave It to Beaver\u2019\n\nIn a 2019 interview with Classic Film TV Cafe, Jerry Mathers sat down and shared more details about his experience on the Leave It to Beaver set. \u201c\n\n\u201c[We worked for] 39 weeks a year and we\u2019d go out after that for a few weeks of promoting and meeting with advertisers in New York and Chicago,\u201d Mathers recalled. He also said that the cast and crew would come back from a short vacation and start filming a new season. \u201cWe did that for six years and 234 episodes.\u201d\n\nWhile also discussing how he and Barbara Billingsley were the only cast members retained from the Leave It to Beaver pilot, Mathers revealed the boy who played Wally had a growth spurt. \u201cWhen they brought him back several months later, he had gotten really big. And really looked like a big brother. He was almost as tall as Hugh Beaumont, who was 6\u20191.\u201d\n\nMathers then said that as for Ward Cleaver, there were several screenings for the Leave It to Beaver main cast part. \u201cThey\u2019d bring in people from outside as well as people working in other shows on the lot,\u201d the actor recalled. The producers would also administer a questionnaire asking how the actors liked each character. \u201cFor some reason, they decided to replace both of the actors who played Wally and Ward in the pilot.\u201d\n\nIn regards to his favorite Leave It to Beaver episodes, Mathers added, \u201cI like the one where I climb up into the soup bowl. That was fun. The show was just a great adventure with a lot of adults around and we just had a good time.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Rusty-Stevens", "page_content": "Robert \"Rusty\" Stevens (born November 25, 1948) is an American former child actor best remembered for his role as Larry Mondello, Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver's young friend, in the original Leave It to Beaver television series. Stevens appeared in 68 of the show's 235 episodes, between 1957 and 1960. Stevens was reported to have left the show in 1960 because his family moved from Burbank to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Barbara Billingsley, who played \"June Cleaver\" on the series, said in a TV Archive interview that Stevens was dropped because his overbearing mother caused grief for the producers of the series.\n\nContents\n\nAfter 1960, Stevens appeared in a handful of television episodes on other shows, including the NBC family drama National Velvet. He was also cast as a schoolboy bully on an episode of ABC's The Rifleman.\n\nStevens briefly returned to the screen when he reprised his role as Larry Mondello in the 1983 made-for-television reunion movie, Still the Beaver, and for three episodes of The New Leave It to Beaver."}]}
