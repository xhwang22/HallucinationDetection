His parents, John Burnham and Sarah Choate Perkins, were descended from some of the first settlers of New England including a John Burnham who came to America in 1634 from Norwich, England and fought in the Pequot Indian War of 1637.\n\nIn 1855 John moved to Barrington, Cook County, Illinois. He taught school there for two years until he had saved up enough money to come to Bloomington, Illinois and enroll at Illinois State Normal University in 1858. He would become the first student from Cook County to graduate from the school which had been founded in 1857.\n\nWhen the U.S. Civil War began with the fall of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861 several students attending ISNU immediately answered President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s first call for troops. Many joined Company K of the 8th Illinois Volunteer Infantry including Joseph Howell who was principal of the Model School. Howell asked the faculty to appoint Burnham to take his place as principal of the school, which they did. After that first call for troops Charles Hovey (first president of ISNU), and other members of the faculty decided to organize the male students into a military company. Captain John W. White was selected as a paid drill master to come and instruct those students in riflery and military marching. These young men, including Burnham, drilled every day after school and all day on Saturday. Upon graduating on July 2, 1861, Burnham and the fellow members of \u201csection A\u201d made their last parade and \u201cdissolved with the distinct understanding that\u201d they would \u201ckeep up correspondence and in case of a fresh call for troops\u201d would enlist as a company in order to form one of the best regiments in the state.\n\nThat chance came when now Colonel Charles Hovey returned to Bloomington from Washington D.C. to put together a company for the newly formed 33rd Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry. On August 20, 1861 the 46 patriotic members of the \u201cNormal Rifles,\u201d as they called their club, enlisted en masse and formed Company A of the 33rd Regiment with Col. Hovey as the commander of the entire 33rd Regiment. It was often called the \u201cTeacher\u2019s Regiment\u201d because many members of the regiment were teachers and students. Burnham began his service with the rank of a first lieutenant and was later promoted to the rank of captain on September 6, 1862. All total, 117 ISNU faculty and students fought for the Union Army. Every male student except for those with physical disabilities in the classes of 1860, 1861, and 1862 volunteered.\n\nThe regiment was first sent to Camp Butler in Springfield on September 1st. They were ordered to march to Washington D.C. on September 28, 1861. However, before they could begin their journey, they were redirected to Arcadia, Missouri where they were stationed to begin \u201clearning the duties of a soldier\u2019s life.\u201d While stationed out of Arcadia, they fought in their first battle at Fredrickstown, Missouri on October 21, 1861. After a long winter in Arcadia where a great many men either died from disease or were forced to resign due to disability, the regiment moved on to Helena, Arkansas in the spring of 1862 where they then engaged the Confederate Army at the battle of Cache River on July 7, 1862.\n\nOn March 17, 1863 Burnham was forced to resign his commission after being in poor health for over a year. This was due to a series of illnesses he had suffered from in 1861 and 1862. During the winter of 1861-62 he contracted typhoid fever in Arcadia, Missouri and then in the summer of 1862, he contracted malarial fever in Arkansas.\n\nShortly after he left the 33rd, the regiment was ordered to Mississippi where they joined with the 13th Army Corps. That summer, the 33rd fought in the battle of Vicksburg on July 3rd and 4th, 1863 where 30 officers and men were killed and 100 wounded. In 1906, the State of Illinois erected a monument dedicated to the regiment on the site of this battle. The name of every Illinois soldier engaged in the Vicksburg battles was engraved on the bronze tablets of the monument.\n\nA few months after he returned to Bloomington in 1863, Burnham was elected the Superintendent of Bloomington Public Schools. This was a two year position which he resigned after a year to become the editor of The Pantagraph, a position in which he remained for the next three years. In 1867 he became a contractor for the King Bridge Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Through this job, he was responsible for the construction of iron bridges in half of the counties in Illinois as well as many Wisconsin counties. He also acquired much knowledge about the history and geography of Illinois in his 35 years of bridge contracting.\n\nOn January 23, 1866 Burnham married Almira S. Ives. Their marriage was reported to have been a very happy one that lasted for fifty-one years. Almira was known as a talented artist, and her work hung in the home of art lovers throughout the community. She was also very active in the community and was well respected because of that. She participated on the fundraising committee to build the Episcopal Church in 1876 and was a member of the Letitia Green Stevenson Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Almira\u2019s brothers Charles and Frank Ives became important business associates of Burnham and he eventually formed a partnership with Frank, called Burnham and Ives.\n\nBut today, Burnham is perhaps best known for his love of history and contributions towards recording Illinois history. His first known project was in 1879, when he wrote \u201cA History of Bloomington-Normal\u201d in the intervals between business pursuits. Some of his historical articles also made it into The Daily Pantagraph, including one on April 17, 1870, where he refuted a previous claim that Illinois has no natural scenery worth seeing by citing beautiful Starved Rock State Park in nearby Utica, Illinois.\n\nThis love of history led Burnham to become one of the founding members of the McLean County Historical Society, founded in 1892. He held the position of treasurer in addition to editing the historical society\u2019s journals until his death in 1917. He edited the War Records of the County, published in 1902, which described the Civil War service of he and others of the county. This book became the first volume of the McLean County Historical Society\u2019s publications. He also wrote and edited several other works, including A History of the Destruction of Kaskaskia by the Mississippi River, History of an Ancient Indian Fort in McLean County, and School Records of McLean County. Burnham was also the Director of the Illinois State Historical Society as well as one of the founding members of the society in 1900.\n\nOn October 14, 1892 the same year the McLean County Historical Society was founded, a fire destroyed Burnham\u2019s house which was located on the southeast corner of Evans and Mulberry Streets. The house could not be saved due to an inadequate reaction by the fire department. However, neighbors helped the Burnhams remove their belongings including Almira\u2019s paintings. The home and barn of neighbor General George F. Dick burned as well. The cause of the fire was unknown but was thought to have been an act of arson.\n\nIn addition to his work with the historical society, Burnham participated in many other community organizations including the Masonic Lodge, Odd Fellow\u2019s Lodge, Normal College Alumni Club, various Republican political organizations, and the Board of Illinois Soldier\u2019s Orphan\u2019s Home (later renamed the Illinois Soldiers and Sailors Children\u2019s School). He was a vital member of the committee which designed Miller Park, and he personally supervised the planting of trees and building of the dam that created the lake. He was also the chairman of the first Board of Park Commissioners as well as serving on the McLean County Board of Supervisors from December 1914 until his death. One of Burnham\u2019s final projects was to assist in preparing the history of the University of Illinois.\n\nJohn H. Burnham died on January 20, 1917 at Brokaw Hospital four weeks after a major operation for an unknown chronic ailment. Funeral services were held at Second Presbyterian Church on January 22, and he was buried in Evergreen Memorial Cemetery. On June 26 of that year, the McLean County Historical Society held a joint memorial for founding members Burnham and George P. Davis. They said that \u201cas a writer, Captain Burnham was both original and resourceful. His aim was to get at the pith of the subject with as much brevity as possible. He disliked garbled or warped history in whatever form it may appear\u2026He was always an ardent seeker after truth and the marvelous things of history\u2026nothing ever daunted his courage when in the pursuit of a laudable purpose\u2026as a citizen, he was always loyal, conscientious and upright, and made for himself a good name and fame, which he spread over the entire state of Illinois\u2026He was always gentlemanly and courteous in his demeanor to others and was never accused of slighting a friend or of misleading him.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/october-2017/john-c-burnham-(1929%E2%80%932017)", "page_content": "Historian of American Psychology and Psychiatry\n\nJohn Chynoweth Burnham, professor of history at Ohio State University (OSU) from 1963 to 2002, died on May 12, 2017. Best known for his work in the history of science and medicine and described as \u201cthe dean\u201d of his fields by historian Dorothy Ross, John had a reach that far exceeded his fields of scholarly expertise.\n\nJohn was born on July 14, 1929, in Boulder, Colorado. After graduating from West Seattle High School in Washington state (he was proud of his excellent urban public-school education), he accepted a scholarship to Stanford University, where he took his bachelor\u2019s degree. He went \u201ceast,\u201d as he put it, to the University of Wisconsin for his master\u2019s degree, after which he returned to Stanford for his PhD (1958). John always talked more about his teachers than his schools. After he informed his seminar students that the course descended directly from Frederick Jackson Turner, he went through the lineage of his teachers and theirs. He taught students never to stop asking questions and searching for answers, and he expected deep research, concise writing, and historiographical significance.\n\nJohn\u2019s own work regularly disrupted traditional historiography, and altogether, he created and enjoyed an enviable career that extended far beyond his retirement. He spent most of his academic career at OSU, but he also taught and held prestigious research fellowships at the universities of Sydney, Cambridge, Chicago, and Melbourne; Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities; Bowdoin College; and numerous other institutions. He was president of the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM) from 1990 to 1992 and edited the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences from 1997 to 2000. He lectured internationally, and scholars have published anthologies and held special conferences to celebrate the significance of his pioneering work to their fields. John published 10 monographs and nearly a hundred articles over the course of his career. His last book, Health Care in America (2015), is a masterful history of medical practice in the United States that stands as a fitting culmination of his scholarship.\n\nJohn was deadly serious about his work and historical scholarship generally. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he had a tough, often unreadable shell. He was also kind, generous, and concerned about other people\u2019s happiness. Susan Reverby described him as \u201can early supporter of young scholars within the AAHM and wherever we turned up to give papers if he was at the same meetings.\u201d James Gilliam, who studied Chinese history at OSU, was John\u2019s teaching assistant during the early 1980s and said that John was \u201cas much or more responsible for my earning my PhD as anyone on my committee.\u201d John and his wife of 59 years, Marjorie Spencer Burnham, always hosted newcomers to the history department soon after their arrival. In 2001, Marjorie founded a history of medicine lecture series for the OSU Medical Heritage Center and the history department. They were also instrumental in the funding of an endowed lectureship in the medical school. When two colleagues died, John located their manuscripts and found people to finish them; both books won prizes.\n\nAs serious as John was about scholarship, he had a wicked and deadpan sense of humor. He could appreciate being the subject of the joke himself. After he told me about the fabulous prize his book After Freud Left (2012) had just won, I asked, \u201cWhich prize?\u201d He answered that it was for the cover. (The designer really was brilliant.) Although it might not have been a joke (one could not always tell with John), when it came time to talk with one of his children about sex, John presented him with a two-volume work on sex education and insisted that he would answer any questions his son had once he finished reading it.\n\nJohn will long be remembered not only for his contributions to the history of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, science, technology, and culture, but also for all the ways he supported his university, his profession, and countless individuals in and outside the profession.\n\nStephanie J.

There he continued his established trade as a joiner. We also explored how his sons and daughters continued the family joinery tradition - but also began to diversify, in particular by ventures into the licensing trade and the Royal Oak pub on Villa Street specifically. Click to read about this earlier generation.\n\n\n\nOn this page, we continue with our study of the family with something of the lives of John & Emma's children - and a little about their children, in turn. Amongst these we will find publicans, a schoolmaster and railway employees and the daughters will be seen to marry lacemakers, bakers, butchers and miners. But, throughout these generations, one constant will remain - the joinery business continued, still based on Villa Street as it was from the day the family arrived for almost 150 years, The advertisement on the right, dated from about 1935, shows the business1 then in the hands of John Burnham, born about 1884, the son of George Burnham and then the fourth generation to take the reigns. As we can see, there had been some diversification - both he and his father also practised as undertakers, the traditional other role of the joiner - but the story is generally one of continuous service to a craft by a family which must have paid a significant role in helping to build and maintain large parts of Beeston in that era.\n\n\n\nEdward Burnham's Family - as we have seen, Edward married twice. By his first wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Facer), he had two daughters. Each of them continued to live with their father and stepmother after their mother died in 1845 and he remarried almost immediately. As each became old enough, it is very likely that they helped their father in the Royal Oak - but both left Beeston after their marriage: Eliza Burnham - born in 1840,by the time she was twenty, she was living with her maternal grandfather - Thomas Facer, by then a widower - presumably keeping house for him. In 1864, she married John Wright from Carrington, Nottingham, who had first followed his father to work as a lacemaker but. after their marriage, became an engineer - probably working on lace machines. The couple settled in Bywaters Yard in Nottingham, at first with John's widowed mother, and continued living there for many years - certainly beyond 1891. It appears that there were no children of the marriage - certainly none that survived infancy.\n\n\n\nEmma Burnham - was born in 1842 and married John Hartley, a lace maker who lived on nearby Cross Street. After their marriage the couple took a pub on Pepper Street, Hyson Green but Emma died in 1879, aged only 37 - again, a childless marriage. After just over a year, John remarried,and became the landlord of the Fox & Crown Inn on Church Street, Basford, Nottingham. Edward's second wife, Ann (n\u00e9e Codling), had been briefly married to John Brewer and in 1834, they had had one daughter before what appears to be John's early death. By 1841, Ann was living in Villa Street with her younger sister and another widow, getting by working as a domestic servant - a role that probably brought Edward and her together in Edward in 1845, when they married within about three months of the death of Edward's first wife. Ann's daughter, Sarah Ann Brewer, joined the Burnham household, working in the nearby lace factories as a bobbin winder but died, aged 23 in 1857 without marrying. A surviving memorial in Beeston Churchyard tells us of her devout Christian faith.\n\n\n\nTogether, Edward and Ann had at least seven children, all born in Beeston and baptised in the Wesleyan Chapel, then on Chapel Street: Edward Burnham - the oldest son, was born in 1846 and, like most of the men in the family, trained as a carpenter and joiner. In 1867, he married Mary Bond, then aged 18, but not before their youngest daughter was born a month or two earlier. The couple seem to have been helped by Mary's parents and appear to have moved to Long Eaton - where her father was a platelayer, later an inspector, on the railways - and it was there that their first two of their children were born. By 1870, however, they had moved back to Beeston and were living on Denison Street - then a new development - with Edward working as a carpenter and joiner. Whether or not he was working for his father, this arrangement did not last long as, by 1873, Edward had moved his family to Basford, just north of the centre of Nottingham, and - following a formula that had worked for his father - took over as landlord of the Shoulder of Mutton pub on Radford Road.2 This change of career seems to have been succesful as he continued at the Basford location for over 20 years before moving to the Horse & Jockey pub in Bulwell Market Place. As the eldest son with experience in the licensed trade, it would have perhaps been expected that he would have taken over from his father when he retired from operating the Royal Oak in Beeston in the mid-1880s; in the event, it was taken over by his brother-in-law, Alfred Elliott - it seems that Edward's horizons stretched beyond Beeston.\n\n\n\nClick here to see photographs of Edward Burnham - and here for Mary Burnham\n\nClick here to see photographs of Abel & Sarah Bond\n\nEdward and Mary raised eight children : Sarah Ann Burnham - born in Long Eaton, Derbyshire in 1867 - married George Day, a Basford baker who worked with his father. For a brief period, he followed his uncle, Arthur Burnham, in running the Commercial Inn, on Wollaton Road, Beeston - serving a similar area to the Royal Oak - but soon returned to the family bakery business, and had took over its running after his father retired. The couple raised seven children.\n\n\n\nClick here to see photographs of Sarah Ann Burnham\n\n- and here for Sarah Ann with her husband, George Day and son Edward Burnham Day\n\nEdward Burnham - was born in 1868, also in Long Eaton, Derbyshire - was a plumber by trade. In 1892, he married Frances Mary Taylor who had been born into a Roman Catholic household in 1869.3 A short time after her birth, her mother had died and she had been taken in by William Daycock (a Basford milk seller) and his wife Ann, who became her adoptive parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to Mansfield, Notts where they raised five children.\n\nMaud Mary Burnham - was born in 1870 after her parents had returned to live in Beeston. In 1899, she became the second wife of John Norton Hickman who had been left with five children when his first wife died in 1897. John was a self-employed butcher who traded in premises in the Market Place, Bulwell - near to the Horse & Jockey pub where Maud was living - and probably working - with her parents. Maud was twelve years younger than John - and only twelve years older than his eldest child - but nevertheless took on the role of wife and instant mother to five and - by 1901 - had added at least one son of her own to the family.\n\nElizabeth Emma Burnham - was born in 1873, around the time that the family left Beeston for Basford.4 She married William James Clarke in 1893, a short time before the birth of their first child - who tragically died within days. The couple went on to raise at least three further children. William was a self-employed lime burner who worked with his father at Quarry Road, Bulwell where the couple made their home.\n\nAbel Burnham - named after his maternal grandfather, was born in Basford in 1878. By 1901 he was working as a plasterer's labourer.\n\nArthur Burnham - was born in Basford in 1880. By 1901 he was working as a butcher's slaughterman - more than likely for his brother-in-law, John Norton Hickman.\n\nPercy Burnham - was born in Basford in 1883. In 1901 he was boarding in Defford, Worcestershire where he was working as a railway clerk.\n\nEthel Annie Burnham - born in 1885 in Basford, was still living at home with her parents in 1901. George Burnham - the second son, was born in 1848 and worked all his life as a joiner, the main member of his generation to operate in the family business5 - although his uncle William and his sons would also have been involved during that era. In 1869 he married Mary Hannah Hudston, the youngest daughter of Francis, a Beeston coal dealer - and later a smallholder - and his wife Sarah. The couple had six children: George Arthur Burnham - born in 1870, continued the family tradition as a joiner. By 1905. he - probably in conjunction with his father - had however, diversified as an undertaker. This route for diversification was traditional in the joinery trade, probably because of the ability to provide a coffin and cart for simple funerals for those unable to afford the more formal. He and his wife Sarah Ann are themselves remembered on their memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nFrancis Edward Burnham - born in 1872, became a plumber, adding another dimension to the family trade skills.\n\nAnnie Elizabeth Burnham - was born in 1875 and, by 1901, was still with her parents working on her own account as a dressmaker. In 1919, however, she became the second wife of William Torrance, a local greengrocer. He died four years later but Annie lived on as his widow for over 47 years, and died in 1971, aged 95.\n\nAaron Burnham - born in 1878, became a painter - yet another building trade diversification within the family.\n\nAlbert Burnham - was born in 1882. Unusually, for the family, he went into the lace trade, joining Pollards as a draughtsman.\n\nJohn Burnham - born in 1884, following family tradition, he was apprenticed as a joiner by 1901. George died in 1910, survived by his wife who died in 1927. They are remembered on a modest memorial which survives in Beeston Cemetery\n\n\n\nMary Burnham - was born in 1850 and, in 1871, married Richard Wheatley, a butcher from Nottingham. By 1891 they were living at the newly fashionable Queens Road, Beeston and, for a time, took in Mary's father, by then a widower in deteriorating health. Richard later acted as a co-executor (with George Burnham) of his father-in-law's estate. Richard, who died in 1933. aged 83 and Mary, who died in 1939, aged 88, are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had five children : Arthur Wheatley (b. c1873) who became a plumber, Horace Wheatley (b. c1878), Frank Wheatley (b. c1882), Ethel Minnie Wheatley (b. c1890) and Athol Lewis Wheatley (b. c1892). Arthur Burnham - was born in 1853. In 1879, he married Emily Martin, the second daughter of David - a lacemaker - and Elizabeth Martin who lived then on Chapel Street, Beeston. Around 1888, Arthur took over the Commercial Inn on Wollaton Road but this did not last long as, by 1891, he had moved his family to Radford, Nottingham and was looking for work as a joiner. The couple had two children: Emily Burnham (b. c1882) and Arthur J. Burnham (b. c1888).\n\nElizabeth Burnham - was born in 1855 and, in 1878, married Alfred Elliott, the youngest son of Edwin Elliott, a lace maker, and Hannah who were then living in Chilwell but had started their married life in Tewkesbury and had been amongst several families who moved to Beeston from Tewkesbury in the mid-1840s to take advantage of the employment opportunities then emerging in the lace trade. Hannah (n\u00e9e Hart) was born in Tewkesbury in about 1809 and, interestingly, claimed descendency from William Shakespeare6. Before his marriage, Alfred had found work in a printing works in Preston, Lancashire where he first lived with his brother's family. By the time of their marriage, Alfred was working as a printer's assistant in the Bradford area of Yorkshire and it was here that Elizabeth and Alfred set up home. However, by 1884, they returned to Beeston to take over the running of the Royal Oak from Elizabeth's father. This change of direction was, it seems, particularly successful as Alfred, a popular and respected local figure, was to continue there as licensee, assisted by his wife and family, until his death in 1912. The couple are shown in the photograph on the left, probably taken shortly before Alfred's death in 1912. Such was his local standing that at his funeral at Beeston Cemetery, the family mourners - in six carriages - were joined in tribute by many prominent citizens from the civic and business communities, the route was lined along its length and over 600 citizens attended the cemetery itself. An full account of the funeral was printed in the local paper and was repeated the following week, such was the popular demand locally.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, with the loyal help of her daughters, continued to run the Oak, possibly until her death in 1933. By then, much of the energies and resources7 of the next generation, as we shall see, were directed towards a butchery business on the High Road family but the license at the Royal Oak was continued by their youngest son Harold Burnham Elliott until his death in 1944.\n\n\n\nAlfred and Elizabeth are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. They had six children: Alfred Elliott - was born in Bradford about 1879. In 1909 he married Sarah Eaton, the second daughter of Richard Eaton, of West Bridgford, a farmer, originally from Derbyshire, who had previously farmed at Risley and in Toton and his wife Sydney who originated from Stapleford. Alfred started his career as a butcher with William Herbert George who then operated two shops in Beeston - at 62 City Road and at 127 Queens Road. By 1913 Alfred had taken over these two shops8 and was trading on his own account and was on his way to building a business which was to become a firm favourite with Beeston families through two generations and for over 75 years. During World War 1, staff shortages forced the closure of the Queens Road shop and, by 1920, he was trading exclusively from the shop at 47 High Road, Beeston, a prime trading position on the corner of Villa Street - see picture on the right9 - where he and his sons continued to trade until 1964. His wife, Sarah died in 1933 and Alfred died suddenly in February 1947 - apparently after clearing snow during the very hard winter of that year; They are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had four children: Marjorie Elliott - was born in Beeston in 1909. After school she worked in the millinery trade, first at Meakins in Beeston Square and later at Cullens in Carrington Street in Nottingham. She then began helping her father in the butcher's shop, become even more involved after her mother died in 1933 and joined her brothers when they took over following their father's death in 1947. She never married and, after their retirement in 1964, moved with her brother to live in Whatton-in-the-Vale where she died in 1975.\n\nRosalind Elliott - was born in 1914 and died, aged four in 1918. She is remembered on her parents' memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nAlfred Richard Elliott - was born in Beeston in 1915 and joined his father in the family butchery business at 47 High Road. In 1940 he married Gladys Evelyn Hankinson. After War service, he rejoined the family business which, after their father's sudden death in 1947, he continued to run in partnership with his brother William with the help of their sister Marjorie. In 1964, the partnership was dissolved and Alfred closed the High Road shop and continued the business from premises on Chilwell Road, at the corner of Hall Croft. He died in 1989, followed by his wife in 1992.\n\n\n\nClick to see more about the Chillwell Road shop.\n\nWilliam Eaton Elliott - born in 1918, was also part of the family butchery business, joining his brother in partnership after their father's death in 1947. He never married and he and his sister retired in 1964, moving to Whatton-in-the-Vale where he died in 1995. Bertie Elliott - born in 1882 in Bradford was, like Alfred, nevertheless brought to Beeston to be baptised in the Parish Church. He joined the LMS Railway as a sheet checker, was working as a railway clerk by 1901 and finished his career with the company - in all some 45 years - as an accounts collector at Nottingham. He was highly regarded as a cricketer with a career with Beeston Town Cricket Club notable mainly for his bowling prowess - but also as a useful bat. During the 1914-18 war he served for 2\u00bd years with the Royal Engineers, assisting with the operation of a light railway on the Somme. During this time he survived a torpedo attack when the HMS Lydia - packed with troops and railway equipment was hit. He was a stalward for over 50 years at Queens Road Methodist Church where, except during his war service, he served as secretary from 1901 until his death. He was a Trustee of the church for many years and had attended a meeting of that body on the evening before his sudden death in 1953. In 1908 he married Lillie Gertrude Timmins from Staffordshire and had two children - Dorothy, who was on the staff of the Clerk to Beeston & Stapleford District Council and who married Robert Marvin, and Alfred Joseph who moved to Essex. His memorial, and that of his wife who died in 1963, can be found in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nLily Ann Elliott - was the first to be born - in January 1894 - after the family's return to Beeston. She and her sister Emma assisted their parents in the Royal Oak. In 1924, she married George Herbert James, a widower who worked as a railway clerk. She died in 1969, aged 85 and is buried in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Edward Elliott - was born in about 1886, first worked as a joiner but later became a plumber, moved to Sheffield, married and had two children. He died there in 1953.\n\nEmma Elliott - was born in about 1888 and died in 1976, having never married. Along with her sister Lily, she assisted her parents with the running of the Royal Oak.\n\nHarold Burnham Elliott - born in 1891, married Mabel Bignall, daughter of a lace maker, in 1920. He started his career in the lace industry, becoming a lace designer but, after the death of his mother in 1933, took over the licence at the Royal Oak and ran it until his relatively early death in 1944 - although his widow lived on for a further 46 years. Their only daughter, Kathleen, born in 1922, died unmarried in 1961. Harold was also a cricketer of note, once taking 10 wickets for 23 runs for Chilwell Cricket Club - and was presented with the ball. Click to see more photographs from the Elliott family album.\n\nAaron Burnham - born in 1857, was very much the exception in the family, in that he did not follow a trade but chose to be a school teacher. By 1881 he had moved to Weelsby, a village in north Lincolnshire where he had found a teaching post. In 1886, he married Miriam Dobson - a marriage which was to end in sadness a year later when Miriam died as a result of giving birth to their only child, Charles. Aaron continued to teach in the Grimsby area of North Lincolnshire assisted at home with the young Charles by a servant, Kate Moore - whom he was to marry in 1895.\n\nJohn Burnham - who was born in 1860 has not been identified after 1861. Martha Burnham's Family - as we have seen, Martha did not marry but had one daughter: Mary Burnham - was born in 1841 and died unmarried in 1859. Her memorial survives in Beeston Churchyard. Elizabeth Burnham's Family - Elizabeth married James Bates in 1841 but was widowed in 1844. Elizabeth herself died in 1857. However, in the short interval of the marriage, the couple had two children: William Bates - was born in 1842 and, initially at least, became a joiner within the Burnham family,\n\nJohn Bates - born about 1843, was brought up by his grandparents but eventually moved to Bradford, Yorkshire where he married and operated as a carter. William Burnham's Family - with his wife Eliza, William had six children: William Burnham - was born in about 1849 but is not identifiable after 1861.\n\nJames Burnham - was born in 1850 and followed the traditional family occupation by becoming a joiner and remaining in the trade throughout his life10. In 1871 he married Ada Mills, the grand-daughter of Edward Mills, a basket-maker from West Leake, Notts. Together they had five children, all born in Beeston: Ernest William Burnham - was born in 1873 and worked as a lace maker. In 1895 at Beeston Parish Church, he married Mary Hooton Goodhead who was the daughter of a Manchester grocer but who had been working in Beeston as a servant. The couple had at least one child: Ernest Goodhead Burnham - was born in 1910 who first married Edna Taylor in 1932 and then, after her death, Ivy Lilian Whiting in 1940. Ernest was a builder who, during the late 1930s built the row of houses which now makes up 174-214 Wollation Road Beeston. Edith Kate Burnham - born in 1874, died in 1878.\n\nEliza Anice Burnham - was born in 1877 and worked in the lace trade until her marriage to Walter Berryman Holmes in 1902. Walter was a foreman at Beeston Boiler Company for virtually all his working life and the couple lived on City Road during that time. An undated modest memorial from their children survives in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nJames Arthur Burnham - was born in 1883 and took up the family trade as a joiner - and apparently by 1902, was in partnership with his father. In 1902 he married Ellen Spray, the third daughter of Frederick and Mary Spray.\n\nJohn Edward Mills Burnham - was born in 1885 and was employed as a printer's clerk. He married Harriet Baker in 1907 Eliza Burnham - who was born in 1856 has not been identified after 1871.\n\nEmma Burnham - born in 1858, was a winder in the local silk and lace factories until her marriage, in 1885, to Samuel Fox, a mill engine driver. The couple lived at 55 Middleton Street, Beeston after their marriage and took in he father after he became a widower. Husband and wife died in in 1932 and 1945 respectively and are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nMartha Burnham - born in 1862 and married William Stevenson in 1882.\n\nSarah Ann Burnham - born in 1866, married John Hallam, a firemen at a coal mine, and moved to Radford, Nottingham.\n\nEmma Burnham's Family - Emma was the youngest daughter of John Wilkinson Burnham and his wife Emma. As we have seen, she married Henry Belfield, a baker, in 1845. The couple had seven children: Emma Belfield - was born in about 1847 in Radford, Nottingham where, for some reason, the couple had married and lived in the early months of their marriage. She was, however, baptised at Beeston Parish Church in 1849, along with the couple's second child. By 1871 she was working as a governess in the household of Charles - a land owner, farmer and Mayor - and Constance Brobant (or Broadbent) in Latchford, Cheshire. She served this family faithfully for upwards of twenty years before moving on to serve in the household of Edward (a cotton manufacturer) & Margaret Greg (who was probably related to the Mrs Broadbent) in Styal, Cheshire, apparently as a domestic nurse. We have not been able to find any further trace of Emma but it is likely she did not marry.\n\nAnn Belfield - was born in about 1849 in Beeston - where she was baptised with he younger sister in the same year. This date seems to mark the return of the family to Beeston. In 1872, she married Robert Baguley but died in 1876, apparently as a result of childbirth with their only child, Ann Belfield Baguley. After his wife tragic death, Robert moved away - he can be found working as a domestic butler in Matlock in 1881 - and their daughter Ann was brought up by her maternal grandparents, staying with her grandmother after she was widowed in 1887\n\nHenry Belfield - was born and died in 1854.\n\nMartha Elizabeth Belfield - born in 1855, married John Lee, a lace maker, in 1877. The couple settled first in Cottage Grove, Chilwell before moving to Middleton Street, Beeston during the 1880s. The couple had five children: Thomas H Lee (b. c1879), John Harold Lee (b. c1885), Emma Ellen Lee (b. c1887), Albert Own Lee (b. c1889) and Catherine Lee (b. c1890). John Henry Belfield - as Henry and Emma's eldest surviving son, born in 1859, it fell to him to continue the family bakery business on Chapel Street, Beeston - working first as his father's assistant and taking over after his father's death in 1877. In 1879, he married Pamela Murden, originally from Keyworth, Notts who had been working as a domestic servant at the time of their marriage. John Henry died in 1929 and his wife in the following year and are remembered on a surviving memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had one child: Henry Belfield - born in about 1889, joined his father in the bakery business, was in partnership with him by 192011, at the latest and took over after his father's death in 1929. Thomas William Belfield - born in about 1861, went into the joinery trade - presumably apprenticed to the Burnham family. In 1889 he married Selina Pare and set up home in Cottage Grove, Chilwell, Notts. The couple had one child: Thomas Henry Belfield - born in 1893 and killed in action while serving with the Grenadier Guards on the Western Front, on 23 April 1916. Catherine Mary Belfield - born in about 1864, married Henry Moss, a coal miner, in Attenborough in 1890. The couple moved to Heanor, Derbyshire and later to Henry's native Smalley, Derbyshire and raised at least three children: Henry Belfield Moss (b. 1891 in Heanor), Frederick Moss (b. c1893 in Heanor) and Emma C Moss (b. c1895 in Heanor) John Burnham's Family - John and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Cook) - who he married in 1855 - apparently had only one child: John Edward Belfield - born in 1858 and died, aged 30 months, in 1860 and remembered on a surviving memorial in Beeston Churchard. Click to read about the The Previous Generation of the Burnham Family\n\n\n\nor - Click here to go back to the beginning\n\n\n\n1\"The Business\" may be an over-simplification as it seems that, for much if not all of the time, different family members ran their own part of an overall \"family business\". The advertisment is also interesting as it states that the business - that is, the family's involvement in joinery - was established in 1817. This presumably refers to John Wilkinson Burnham's original business started in Clifton and transferred by him to Beeston about 1827.\n\n2The Shoulder of Mutton was situated on the corner of Radford Road and Valley Road (now part of the Nottingham Ring Road) and across the road from Basford Gas Works. It appears that the previous landlord was George Offiler who founded the well known brewery. The site is now occupied by a MacDonalds.\n\n3Her father was Joseph Edmund Taylor. At the time of his wife's death and Frances Mary's birth he was running the Warren Arms, a beerhouse on Derby Road, Nottingham. About two years later, he married his barmaid and had three further children. By 1901 he was working as an accountant's clerk.\n\n4It is presently unclear whether she was born in Beeston or in Basford; the evidence from census returns varies and the Registration District for both locations was the same at that time. She was, however, baptised at Beeston Parish Church in August 1873. It is interesting that the next child is not born for another five years - during which time, presumably, Edward and Mary were focused on establiishing their business in Basford.\n\n5His involvement with the business can be tracked in a series of Wrights Directories, throughout the 1880s. Curiously, he is shown then in partnership with Aaron Burnham (e.g. in 1885 as \"George & Aaron\" in 1885) - which seems unlikely, given that his brother of that name was working as a school teacher in Lincolnshire at that time and his son of the same name was only about 5 years old at the time of the first entry in 1883.\n\n6Details of this are on the Claims to Fame page (Opens in a new window)\n\n7By the time of Elizabeth Elliott's death, these resources included property she owned at 16,18 & 20 Bramcote Road, Beeston and 90 (occupied by her son Bertie's family), 104 (occupied by her daughter Lily's (Mrs George H James) family & 106 (occupied by Elizabeth herself and by her daughter Emma) on Denison Street, Beeston and property at 6 & 8 Park Street, Beeston built by her son Alfred in 1932 on land previously owned by her.\n\n8There is some confusion about the location of William Herbert George's shops compared with those acquired by Alfred Elliott. At the time of both the 1891 and 1901 census, George was operating from 80 High Road (which is on the south side and near to Regent Street. By 1905 (per Wrights Directory), he was operating from Queens Road and from Commercial Buildings (in the Square). In Alfred's obituary (1947), it is stated that he took over \"Mr George's two shops at 114 High Road and Queens Road\" and that \"the shop in the High Road continued to operate and has done so ever since\". If this implies that George sold all his shops to Elliott, this is not so as he was still trading in the Square in 1920. The Queens Road shop clearly matches but the 114 High Road does not appear to match the on-going location at 47 High Road - unless the premises were renumbered over the years.\n\n9This picture is from a paper bag which was carefully preserved by the writer's mother for many years. It is assumed that she must have traded at Elliotts in the 1930s. The 1913 and 1920 shop locations are derived from contemporary entries in the local Wrights Directories.\n\n10In both 1902 and 1905, his business is shown as \"Burnham & Son (James), Joiner. Villa Street\". This appears to refer to James (b.1850) and his son James Arthur (b.1883).\n\n11Wrights Directory of Nottingham & Neighbourhood, 1920 - J Belfield & Son, Bakers & Confectioners, 22 Chapel St, Beeston.\n\n\n\nAll information relates to the specific individual and/or family shown and and does not necessarily relate to other individuals or families with the same surname.\n\nWhilst every effort is made to ensure that information is as accurate as possible, as in all genealogical research, users should satisfy themselves as to its accuracy.\n\nWe do not knowingly include information relating to living individuals.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/october-2017/john-c-burnham-(1929%E2%80%932017)", "page_content": "Historian of American Psychology and Psychiatry\n\nJohn Chynoweth Burnham, professor of history at Ohio State University (OSU) from 1963 to 2002, died on May 12, 2017. Best known for his work in the history of science and medicine and described as \u201cthe dean\u201d of his fields by historian Dorothy Ross, John had a reach that far exceeded his fields of scholarly expertise.\n\nJohn was born on July 14, 1929, in Boulder, Colorado. After graduating from West Seattle High School in Washington state (he was proud of his excellent urban public-school education), he accepted a scholarship to Stanford University, where he took his bachelor\u2019s degree. He went \u201ceast,\u201d as he put it, to the University of Wisconsin for his master\u2019s degree, after which he returned to Stanford for his PhD (1958). John always talked more about his teachers than his schools. After he informed his seminar students that the course descended directly from Frederick Jackson Turner, he went through the lineage of his teachers and theirs. He taught students never to stop asking questions and searching for answers, and he expected deep research, concise writing, and historiographical significance.\n\nJohn\u2019s own work regularly disrupted traditional historiography, and altogether, he created and enjoyed an enviable career that extended far beyond his retirement. He spent most of his academic career at OSU, but he also taught and held prestigious research fellowships at the universities of Sydney, Cambridge, Chicago, and Melbourne; Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities; Bowdoin College; and numerous other institutions. He was president of the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM) from 1990 to 1992 and edited the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences from 1997 to 2000. He lectured internationally, and scholars have published anthologies and held special conferences to celebrate the significance of his pioneering work to their fields. John published 10 monographs and nearly a hundred articles over the course of his career. His last book, Health Care in America (2015), is a masterful history of medical practice in the United States that stands as a fitting culmination of his scholarship.\n\nJohn was deadly serious about his work and historical scholarship generally. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he had a tough, often unreadable shell. He was also kind, generous, and concerned about other people\u2019s happiness. Susan Reverby described him as \u201can early supporter of young scholars within the AAHM and wherever we turned up to give papers if he was at the same meetings.\u201d James Gilliam, who studied Chinese history at OSU, was John\u2019s teaching assistant during the early 1980s and said that John was \u201cas much or more responsible for my earning my PhD as anyone on my committee.\u201d John and his wife of 59 years, Marjorie Spencer Burnham, always hosted newcomers to the history department soon after their arrival. In 2001, Marjorie founded a history of medicine lecture series for the OSU Medical Heritage Center and the history department. They were also instrumental in the funding of an endowed lectureship in the medical school. When two colleagues died, John located their manuscripts and found people to finish them; both books won prizes.\n\nAs serious as John was about scholarship, he had a wicked and deadpan sense of humor. He could appreciate being the subject of the joke himself. After he told me about the fabulous prize his book After Freud Left (2012) had just won, I asked, \u201cWhich prize?\u201d He answered that it was for the cover. (The designer really was brilliant.) Although it might not have been a joke (one could not always tell with John), when it came time to talk with one of his children about sex, John presented him with a two-volume work on sex education and insisted that he would answer any questions his son had once he finished reading it.\n\nJohn will long be remembered not only for his contributions to the history of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, science, technology, and culture, but also for all the ways he supported his university, his profession, and countless individuals in and outside the profession.\n\nStephanie J.

Burnham was born on September 8, 1817 in Thetford, Orange County, Vermont. He attended common schools in New York and served an apprenticeship in the Watervliet Government Arsenal thus learning the trade of gunsmith. At the age of 18, he married Mary McCuen, who was 16 at the time. Mary had been born in northern Ireland and had immigrated with her parents at a young age. His health was not good and he was advised to go to the south to recover in 1837. After spending a winter in Florida, he moved his wife and two children, Mills and Frances to the state in August of 1839. They lived in Jacksonville and Burnham became the first Sheriff there.\n\nBurnham's land claim from the Armed Occupation Act was just north of Doctor Holbrook's place in Ankona bluff. Next to the south was the Philip Herman place. It was reported that Mills was the first man to raise pineapples on his claim. Captain Burnham was considered a man of great strength and he was admired and respected by the other settlers and by the Indian population. Mrs. Burnham was said to be afraid of the Indians, and when the captain was going away on business, he would warn the local Indians to stay away, which they did.\n\nFinding it difficult here to provide for his family, he purchased a schooner, which he called \"The Josephine\". He loaded her with green turtles, taking care to tie their flippers and sailed them up to Charleston. Others did not take such good care of the green turtles when shipping, many died or were damaged. He made wooden pillows to support their heads and cleaned their eyes with salt water each morning. His turtles were sent on to England and fetched a good price.\n\nBurnham also raised long haired West Indian sheep. This gave the family a little change in diet. The family grew many vegetables including corn. Wildlife including the bounty from the ocean, deer and bear. Live was good, but there was very little to do here.

How much longer is a question of debate, although most will agree on the basic shape of that influence: the foundation in 1909, the summit around mid-century, and a downward slope of disputable gradient in the second half of the twentieth century. After Freud Left, an engaging collection of essays based on an earlier conference at the New York Academy of Medicine, largely affirms these contours, despite its distinguished editor's claim that \u201cthe standard narrative will no longer look the same as it did\u201d before this volume was published (13). If the landscape it presents of Freud's influence is familiar, the map it offers unfolds further and more neatly than most others. It challenges the common idea that American psychoanalysis was a straightforward derivative of European practice, a stance shared by recent work in intellectual history, and instead emphasizes that America's appropriation of Freud was \u201cless a singular turning point\u201d anchored around 1909, and more \u201ca constant \u2013 and contested \u2013 process\u201d (210) throughout the twentieth century.\n\nIt is no longer a revelation to observe that Freud was just one distinguished figure among many when he arrived at Clark University in 1909. The historian Nathan Hale Jr. took care of that twenty years ago, noting how Freud only \u201cassumed [an] exalted status\u201d around mid-century. John Burnham's introduction offers some helpful gestures as to how Freud won that status, showing that in the 1970s the 1909 visit became a shorthand for explaining the general traffic in ideas about the mind in these years. Throughout this volume the tone is whimsical, taking an interest in the \u201cunintended beginnings\u201d (20) of Freud's influence on the US, drawn to the sheer \u201cimprobability\u201d (209) of that influence. Two chapters examine the 1909 conference that G. Stanley Hall organized at Clark University, though they do so from different perspectives. Richard Skues forensically studies the iconic photograph taken of the conference's forty-two delegates to show that most who attended the event did so not just to meet Freud. Sonu Shamdasani works on a broader patch, aiming to place the Clark conference and Freud amid what proves to be a sprawling landscape of that year's mental sciences. The scene he presents us with is one where Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg's Psychopathology (1909) towers over Freud's five lectures, in which the importance of the Clark conference is overshadowed by meetings in Geneva and New Haven. His verdict that \u201cthe Clark conference had been a non-event\u201d (46) is a sign, though, that not everyone has stopped digging in the land of the \u201cFreud Wars.\u201d\n\nIf there is a prevailing theme here it comes in the attention that most pay to the \u201cAmericanizing [of] Freudian thought\u201d (13), a theme that will appeal to readers of this journal. The theme of course arose at mid-century, amid centenary celebrations of Freud's birth, when some intellectuals asserted a special connection between Freud and America. Their work helped to \u201cdomesticate\u201d (235) Freud, but did so by interpreting his vision of human nature as austere. This process of Americanization happened in a number of ways throughout the twentieth century though, and the volume captures most. Historian Elizabeth Lunbeck's sterling chapter on the \u00e9migr\u00e9 analyst Heinz Kohut begins by showing how Freud's ideas were bashed into a \u201cdistinctly meliorist American idiom\u201d (210) in the early twentieth century. An original chapter by Hale Usak-Sahin recounts the circuitous wartime emigration of three European analysts, and helps to illuminate the comparatively auspicious environment provided by the US for psychoanalysts. What Usak-Sahin finds, and others confirm, is that the US reception of Freudian psychoanalysis owed much to \u201cthe cultural infrastructure that was in place in the United States\u201d (157). That infrastructure encompassed the \u201canalytic \u2018scene,\u2019 the university chair, the highbrow journal\u201d (243). As the authority of that infrastructure vaulted in the 1940s and 1950s, so too did Freud's reputation, while it dipped when those institutions were recomposed in later decades. Only that distinctly American formation, the \u201cculture and personality\u201d school of the social sciences, given passing mention in Jean-Christophe Agnew's essay, seems crucially absent from this volume.\n\nThe entrenchment of psychoanalysis in the mid-twentieth-century US, this volume suggests, owed as much to \u201clocal settings\u201d (25), its entanglement with pre-existing debates, and \u201cinteract[ion] with other intellectual traditions\u201d (161) as it did to the emigration of European analysts or the straightforward importation of Freud's work. Dorothy Ross shows that literary modernists, like Lionel Trilling, appropriated Freud in a way that fit with \u201cthe anti-Stalinist voice of American left liberals\u201d (169), while Louis Menand suggests that America's postwar interest in Freud owed much to a prevailing \u201cCold War discourse of anxiety\u201d (189), and postwar debates about totalitarianism. Still, Menand's case is not entirely persuasive. A discourse about anxiety was, at times, no less evident in Western Europe than in the United States \u2013 a fact the theologian Paul Tillich, whom Menand cites, recognized \u2013 yet Freud enjoyed no comparable stature there. In part this difference can be explained by Freud's relative standing within European and American medical practice, a subject given only slight treatment here. While this coverage is limiting, it is not surprising, following the trend set by the 1956 centenary, where literary critics and historians dominated discussions. It is an example of one more way in which the place of Freud in the US has changed much less than we at first imagine."}, {"url": "https://archives.lib.ua.edu/repositories/3/resources/609", "page_content": "Biographical/Historical note\n\nJohn Burnham was probably born in Wethersfield, Connecticut on October 15, 1758. At age fifteen he volunteered for service in the Revolutionary Army and served for two years in this capacity. In 1777, Congress called him to service and he enlisted for a three year period. Also, in 1777, he was taken prisoner by the British and held on the British ship Good Intent which was lying off of the coast of New York. After his release from the ship, he served out the duration of his term of enlistment. His time of service consisted of 5 years in all.\n\n\n\nAfter peace with Great Britain, Burnham became a sailor. He served as master of the ship Camilla for a period of time and accumulated a small fortune. In April of 1792, he took command of the ship Hope. On October 6, 1793, while transporting cargo to Malaga, he was taken prisoner near the straits of Gibraltar by an Algerian corsair, stripped of all his possessions, and made a slave.\n\n\n\nWhile in captivity, Burnham wrote the British consul in Cadiz, Spain, James Duff (a personal friend), to ask that Duff attempt to secure his release. Eventually, Duff went to Algiers with the sum of $4,400 which he gave to the Swedish consul. The Swedish consul then secured Burnham's release in April 1794, after six months of imprisonment. After his release, Burnham may have suffered from a form of paralysis caused by his ill-treatment during his captivity. From 1794 until at least 1832 Burnham sought reimbursement from Congress for the ransom paid to secure his release.\n\n\n\nOn his return from Algiers, Burnham went to Philadelphia and interceded with the government to arrange the release of other Americans remaining in Algiers. He was given an audience with President Washington for this purpose. Burnam married Barbara McCarthy, daughter of Judge McCarthy and Mrs. McCarthy (Caroline Lanford), all of Wethersfield, Connecticut, on October 15, 1798. Burnham and his wife had at least one daughter- Caroline Duff Burnham. In later life Burnham lived in Auburn, New York. He died on October 7, 1837."}, {"url": "https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/october-2017/john-c-burnham-(1929%E2%80%932017)", "page_content": "Historian of American Psychology and Psychiatry\n\nJohn Chynoweth Burnham, professor of history at Ohio State University (OSU) from 1963 to 2002, died on May 12, 2017. Best known for his work in the history of science and medicine and described as \u201cthe dean\u201d of his fields by historian Dorothy Ross, John had a reach that far exceeded his fields of scholarly expertise.\n\nJohn was born on July 14, 1929, in Boulder, Colorado. After graduating from West Seattle High School in Washington state (he was proud of his excellent urban public-school education), he accepted a scholarship to Stanford University, where he took his bachelor\u2019s degree. He went \u201ceast,\u201d as he put it, to the University of Wisconsin for his master\u2019s degree, after which he returned to Stanford for his PhD (1958). John always talked more about his teachers than his schools. After he informed his seminar students that the course descended directly from Frederick Jackson Turner, he went through the lineage of his teachers and theirs. He taught students never to stop asking questions and searching for answers, and he expected deep research, concise writing, and historiographical significance.\n\nJohn\u2019s own work regularly disrupted traditional historiography, and altogether, he created and enjoyed an enviable career that extended far beyond his retirement. He spent most of his academic career at OSU, but he also taught and held prestigious research fellowships at the universities of Sydney, Cambridge, Chicago, and Melbourne; Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities; Bowdoin College; and numerous other institutions. He was president of the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM) from 1990 to 1992 and edited the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences from 1997 to 2000. He lectured internationally, and scholars have published anthologies and held special conferences to celebrate the significance of his pioneering work to their fields. John published 10 monographs and nearly a hundred articles over the course of his career. His last book, Health Care in America (2015), is a masterful history of medical practice in the United States that stands as a fitting culmination of his scholarship.\n\nJohn was deadly serious about his work and historical scholarship generally. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he had a tough, often unreadable shell. He was also kind, generous, and concerned about other people\u2019s happiness. Susan Reverby described him as \u201can early supporter of young scholars within the AAHM and wherever we turned up to give papers if he was at the same meetings.\u201d James Gilliam, who studied Chinese history at OSU, was John\u2019s teaching assistant during the early 1980s and said that John was \u201cas much or more responsible for my earning my PhD as anyone on my committee.\u201d John and his wife of 59 years, Marjorie Spencer Burnham, always hosted newcomers to the history department soon after their arrival. In 2001, Marjorie founded a history of medicine lecture series for the OSU Medical Heritage Center and the history department. They were also instrumental in the funding of an endowed lectureship in the medical school. When two colleagues died, John located their manuscripts and found people to finish them; both books won prizes.\n\nAs serious as John was about scholarship, he had a wicked and deadpan sense of humor. He could appreciate being the subject of the joke himself. After he told me about the fabulous prize his book After Freud Left (2012) had just won, I asked, \u201cWhich prize?\u201d He answered that it was for the cover. (The designer really was brilliant.) Although it might not have been a joke (one could not always tell with John), when it came time to talk with one of his children about sex, John presented him with a two-volume work on sex education and insisted that he would answer any questions his son had once he finished reading it.\n\nJohn will long be remembered not only for his contributions to the history of medicine, psychology, psychiatry, science, technology, and culture, but also for all the ways he supported his university, his profession, and countless individuals in and outside the profession.\n\nStephanie J.

Burnham highlighted that we should be able to add extra identity factors to the G.R.A.C.E.S mnemonic and adjust them as the needs arise. Hence, it has since been built upon to create the clumsy term: GGGGRRAAACCCEEESSS.\n\nSocial graces is an acronym / mnemonic explaining the visible and invisible aspects of our identity. It allows us to examine the elements of identity that might impact our lives and behaviors.\n\nDefinition of the Social Graces\n\nThe social graces is a framework for understanding aspects of identity and how they shape our practices. It makes aspects of identity and asks practitioners (normally therapists, but also teachers, social workers, etc.) to be aware of how their identity influences their thinking.\n\nSome scholars define it similarly as:\n\n\u201cA mnemonic that separates out different aspects of identity into separate categories.\u201d (Butler, 2017, p. 17)\n\n\u201cMnemonic for aspects of difference\u201d (Jones & Reeve, 2014, p. 2)\n\n\u201cA suitable framework [\u2026] through which therapists can reflect on their own beliefs and prejudices in order to understand how they might bring these into the therapy\u201d (Totsuka, 2014, p. 106)\n\nUse these quotes (or cite these sources) in your essay on this topic.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe concept helps therapists, educators, councilors and psychologists talk through the elements of identity and how they might impact how we relate to others. It is designed to make identity factors a part of a discussion about privileges and disadvantages that are evident in society.\n\nBurnham and colleagues often use the concept to help practitioners identify their own implicit biases. When their implicit biases are identified, they can help neutralize them to become more effective, thoughtful and fair practitioners.\n\nAs Nolte (2017, p. 4) argues, the framework:\n\n\u2026 provides a helpful way for us to become intentional in our developing awareness of, reflexivity about and skillfulness in responding to sameness and difference.\n\nSimilarly, Partridge and McCarry (2017) argue that this model can help us to:\n\nReflect on action: Think about how identity influenced a situation.\n\nThink about how identity influenced a situation. Use or reflections to inform future actions: Think about how we can ensure we are fairer in future actions.\n\nThink about how we can ensure we are fairer in future actions. Subvert the dominant discourse: Consider ways to re-think ongoing behaviors that privilege dominant social identities (white, middle-class, male, able, etc.)\n\nConsider ways to re-think ongoing behaviors that privilege dominant social identities (white, middle-class, male, able, etc.) Consider new alternatives for future actions: Come up with new ways to behave that are fairer.\n\nKey Features\n\n1. Makes Aspects of Identity Visible and Explicit\n\nThe main feature and benefit of this concept is that it helps us talk about aspects of identity out loud. It gives us an opportunity to air our thoughts on aspects of identity that are \u2018unsaid\u2019 (that we don\u2019t usually talk about) as well as aspects that we wear on our sleeve.\n\nIn sessions where the SGs are used to discuss identity, people will usually talk through each aspect of identity and consider which features they identify with. For example, when talking about \u2018gender\u2019, people can bring up their perspective as a male / female / non-binary person. When talking about \u2018Education\u2019, people can bring up how their educational background influences their views, etc.\n\n2. All Aspects of Identity are Equally Important\n\nBurnham (2003) states that all aspects of identity should be considered equally important within this framework. While the Gs come before the Rs, this should not be taken to assume that Gs are more important than Rs in the framework. Instead, the separation of each \u2018grace\u2019 is designed to ensure each one is examined sufficiently and not drowned out by any others.\n\n3. Always Evolving\n\nThe acronym is constantly evolving as people add to and subtract from it. Burnham highlights that sessions should begin by asking people what other aspects of identity they could add to the framework. For example, in North America, many people may add their migrant experiences or Indigenous identities to the framework, thereby introducing new but equally important aspects of identity to the discussion.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nStrengths\n\n1. Helps people understand Identity\n\nThe framework provides a useful way to get people talking about identity. It is a clear and explicit (rather than abstract) way of examining various identity factors that may contribute to our perspectives and beliefs.\n\n2. Makes unsaid and invisible aspects of Identity a Topic of Discussion\n\nWithout a clear framework for discussing aspects of identity, many aspects may be ignored or not spoken about. The aspects of identity that are most likely to be overlooked are ones that are invisible and unspoken. The benefit of this framework is that the teacher and students can talk through each aspect one by one, ensuring nothing is overlooked.\n\n3. Helps us see our Implicit Biases\n\nBy examining aspects of our identities we can think about how they shape our perspectives and actions. If we can talk about this, then we can work on eliminating or minimizing implicit biases in our professional practice.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. Fails to understand complexity of identity\n\nButler (2017) argues that breaking down identity into separate categories fails to understand the complexity of identity. The graces acronym sees identity as \u2018the sum of its parts\u2019 rather than a holistic and indivisible concept. Therefore, Butler argues that it is \u201cfundamentally opposed by intersectional theory\u201d (Butler, 2017, p. 17). This is because intersectional theory sees intersectional identities (such as black-queer) as inseperable and unique and impossible to discuss in separation.\n\nSimilarly, Totsuka (2014, p. 106) highlights that aspects of the graces are \u201ccomplex and interwoven\u201d. She notes that in one of her sessions a student noted that her \u201cethnicity, culture and religion were inseparable\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be separated out in the way they are in the graces framework. Nonetheless, the session made this point explicit, providing yet another entry way into a complex discussion of identity that was valuable to all participants in the session \u2013 so perhaps this is a good thing!\n\n2. A Framework, not a Theory\n\nThe graces concept is a tool for thinking about identity, it is not a theory. It should not be mistaken for a theory of race (like, for example, Critical Whiteness Theory, Critical Race Theory, Intersectional Theory, etc.) This may be considered a weakness at times, or may simply be seen as a simple fact: it\u2019s not to be used as an underpinning explanation of the world. It simply opens up discussion about social identities and biases.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe social graces concept by Burnham and colleagues is a useful way for looking at how our identities are formed and how they impact our implicit biases. It is most commonly used as a training tool to help therapists, teachers, and other practitioners think about how to counter implicit biases in their own practices in order to achieve social justice.\n\nRead Also: Muted Group Theory\n\nReferences\n\nBurnham, J.

There he continued his established trade as a joiner. We also explored how his sons and daughters continued the family joinery tradition - but also began to diversify, in particular by ventures into the licensing trade and the Royal Oak pub on Villa Street specifically. Click to read about this earlier generation.\n\n\n\nOn this page, we continue with our study of the family with something of the lives of John & Emma's children - and a little about their children, in turn. Amongst these we will find publicans, a schoolmaster and railway employees and the daughters will be seen to marry lacemakers, bakers, butchers and miners. But, throughout these generations, one constant will remain - the joinery business continued, still based on Villa Street as it was from the day the family arrived for almost 150 years, The advertisement on the right, dated from about 1935, shows the business1 then in the hands of John Burnham, born about 1884, the son of George Burnham and then the fourth generation to take the reigns. As we can see, there had been some diversification - both he and his father also practised as undertakers, the traditional other role of the joiner - but the story is generally one of continuous service to a craft by a family which must have paid a significant role in helping to build and maintain large parts of Beeston in that era.\n\n\n\nEdward Burnham's Family - as we have seen, Edward married twice. By his first wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Facer), he had two daughters. Each of them continued to live with their father and stepmother after their mother died in 1845 and he remarried almost immediately. As each became old enough, it is very likely that they helped their father in the Royal Oak - but both left Beeston after their marriage: Eliza Burnham - born in 1840,by the time she was twenty, she was living with her maternal grandfather - Thomas Facer, by then a widower - presumably keeping house for him. In 1864, she married John Wright from Carrington, Nottingham, who had first followed his father to work as a lacemaker but. after their marriage, became an engineer - probably working on lace machines. The couple settled in Bywaters Yard in Nottingham, at first with John's widowed mother, and continued living there for many years - certainly beyond 1891. It appears that there were no children of the marriage - certainly none that survived infancy.\n\n\n\nEmma Burnham - was born in 1842 and married John Hartley, a lace maker who lived on nearby Cross Street. After their marriage the couple took a pub on Pepper Street, Hyson Green but Emma died in 1879, aged only 37 - again, a childless marriage. After just over a year, John remarried,and became the landlord of the Fox & Crown Inn on Church Street, Basford, Nottingham. Edward's second wife, Ann (n\u00e9e Codling), had been briefly married to John Brewer and in 1834, they had had one daughter before what appears to be John's early death. By 1841, Ann was living in Villa Street with her younger sister and another widow, getting by working as a domestic servant - a role that probably brought Edward and her together in Edward in 1845, when they married within about three months of the death of Edward's first wife. Ann's daughter, Sarah Ann Brewer, joined the Burnham household, working in the nearby lace factories as a bobbin winder but died, aged 23 in 1857 without marrying. A surviving memorial in Beeston Churchyard tells us of her devout Christian faith.\n\n\n\nTogether, Edward and Ann had at least seven children, all born in Beeston and baptised in the Wesleyan Chapel, then on Chapel Street: Edward Burnham - the oldest son, was born in 1846 and, like most of the men in the family, trained as a carpenter and joiner. In 1867, he married Mary Bond, then aged 18, but not before their youngest daughter was born a month or two earlier. The couple seem to have been helped by Mary's parents and appear to have moved to Long Eaton - where her father was a platelayer, later an inspector, on the railways - and it was there that their first two of their children were born. By 1870, however, they had moved back to Beeston and were living on Denison Street - then a new development - with Edward working as a carpenter and joiner. Whether or not he was working for his father, this arrangement did not last long as, by 1873, Edward had moved his family to Basford, just north of the centre of Nottingham, and - following a formula that had worked for his father - took over as landlord of the Shoulder of Mutton pub on Radford Road.2 This change of career seems to have been succesful as he continued at the Basford location for over 20 years before moving to the Horse & Jockey pub in Bulwell Market Place. As the eldest son with experience in the licensed trade, it would have perhaps been expected that he would have taken over from his father when he retired from operating the Royal Oak in Beeston in the mid-1880s; in the event, it was taken over by his brother-in-law, Alfred Elliott - it seems that Edward's horizons stretched beyond Beeston.\n\n\n\nClick here to see photographs of Edward Burnham - and here for Mary Burnham\n\nClick here to see photographs of Abel & Sarah Bond\n\nEdward and Mary raised eight children : Sarah Ann Burnham - born in Long Eaton, Derbyshire in 1867 - married George Day, a Basford baker who worked with his father. For a brief period, he followed his uncle, Arthur Burnham, in running the Commercial Inn, on Wollaton Road, Beeston - serving a similar area to the Royal Oak - but soon returned to the family bakery business, and had took over its running after his father retired. The couple raised seven children.\n\n\n\nClick here to see photographs of Sarah Ann Burnham\n\n- and here for Sarah Ann with her husband, George Day and son Edward Burnham Day\n\nEdward Burnham - was born in 1868, also in Long Eaton, Derbyshire - was a plumber by trade. In 1892, he married Frances Mary Taylor who had been born into a Roman Catholic household in 1869.3 A short time after her birth, her mother had died and she had been taken in by William Daycock (a Basford milk seller) and his wife Ann, who became her adoptive parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to Mansfield, Notts where they raised five children.\n\nMaud Mary Burnham - was born in 1870 after her parents had returned to live in Beeston. In 1899, she became the second wife of John Norton Hickman who had been left with five children when his first wife died in 1897. John was a self-employed butcher who traded in premises in the Market Place, Bulwell - near to the Horse & Jockey pub where Maud was living - and probably working - with her parents. Maud was twelve years younger than John - and only twelve years older than his eldest child - but nevertheless took on the role of wife and instant mother to five and - by 1901 - had added at least one son of her own to the family.\n\nElizabeth Emma Burnham - was born in 1873, around the time that the family left Beeston for Basford.4 She married William James Clarke in 1893, a short time before the birth of their first child - who tragically died within days. The couple went on to raise at least three further children. William was a self-employed lime burner who worked with his father at Quarry Road, Bulwell where the couple made their home.\n\nAbel Burnham - named after his maternal grandfather, was born in Basford in 1878. By 1901 he was working as a plasterer's labourer.\n\nArthur Burnham - was born in Basford in 1880. By 1901 he was working as a butcher's slaughterman - more than likely for his brother-in-law, John Norton Hickman.\n\nPercy Burnham - was born in Basford in 1883. In 1901 he was boarding in Defford, Worcestershire where he was working as a railway clerk.\n\nEthel Annie Burnham - born in 1885 in Basford, was still living at home with her parents in 1901. George Burnham - the second son, was born in 1848 and worked all his life as a joiner, the main member of his generation to operate in the family business5 - although his uncle William and his sons would also have been involved during that era. In 1869 he married Mary Hannah Hudston, the youngest daughter of Francis, a Beeston coal dealer - and later a smallholder - and his wife Sarah. The couple had six children: George Arthur Burnham - born in 1870, continued the family tradition as a joiner. By 1905. he - probably in conjunction with his father - had however, diversified as an undertaker. This route for diversification was traditional in the joinery trade, probably because of the ability to provide a coffin and cart for simple funerals for those unable to afford the more formal. He and his wife Sarah Ann are themselves remembered on their memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nFrancis Edward Burnham - born in 1872, became a plumber, adding another dimension to the family trade skills.\n\nAnnie Elizabeth Burnham - was born in 1875 and, by 1901, was still with her parents working on her own account as a dressmaker. In 1919, however, she became the second wife of William Torrance, a local greengrocer. He died four years later but Annie lived on as his widow for over 47 years, and died in 1971, aged 95.\n\nAaron Burnham - born in 1878, became a painter - yet another building trade diversification within the family.\n\nAlbert Burnham - was born in 1882. Unusually, for the family, he went into the lace trade, joining Pollards as a draughtsman.\n\nJohn Burnham - born in 1884, following family tradition, he was apprenticed as a joiner by 1901. George died in 1910, survived by his wife who died in 1927. They are remembered on a modest memorial which survives in Beeston Cemetery\n\n\n\nMary Burnham - was born in 1850 and, in 1871, married Richard Wheatley, a butcher from Nottingham. By 1891 they were living at the newly fashionable Queens Road, Beeston and, for a time, took in Mary's father, by then a widower in deteriorating health. Richard later acted as a co-executor (with George Burnham) of his father-in-law's estate. Richard, who died in 1933. aged 83 and Mary, who died in 1939, aged 88, are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had five children : Arthur Wheatley (b. c1873) who became a plumber, Horace Wheatley (b. c1878), Frank Wheatley (b. c1882), Ethel Minnie Wheatley (b. c1890) and Athol Lewis Wheatley (b. c1892). Arthur Burnham - was born in 1853. In 1879, he married Emily Martin, the second daughter of David - a lacemaker - and Elizabeth Martin who lived then on Chapel Street, Beeston. Around 1888, Arthur took over the Commercial Inn on Wollaton Road but this did not last long as, by 1891, he had moved his family to Radford, Nottingham and was looking for work as a joiner. The couple had two children: Emily Burnham (b. c1882) and Arthur J. Burnham (b. c1888).\n\nElizabeth Burnham - was born in 1855 and, in 1878, married Alfred Elliott, the youngest son of Edwin Elliott, a lace maker, and Hannah who were then living in Chilwell but had started their married life in Tewkesbury and had been amongst several families who moved to Beeston from Tewkesbury in the mid-1840s to take advantage of the employment opportunities then emerging in the lace trade. Hannah (n\u00e9e Hart) was born in Tewkesbury in about 1809 and, interestingly, claimed descendency from William Shakespeare6. Before his marriage, Alfred had found work in a printing works in Preston, Lancashire where he first lived with his brother's family. By the time of their marriage, Alfred was working as a printer's assistant in the Bradford area of Yorkshire and it was here that Elizabeth and Alfred set up home. However, by 1884, they returned to Beeston to take over the running of the Royal Oak from Elizabeth's father. This change of direction was, it seems, particularly successful as Alfred, a popular and respected local figure, was to continue there as licensee, assisted by his wife and family, until his death in 1912. The couple are shown in the photograph on the left, probably taken shortly before Alfred's death in 1912. Such was his local standing that at his funeral at Beeston Cemetery, the family mourners - in six carriages - were joined in tribute by many prominent citizens from the civic and business communities, the route was lined along its length and over 600 citizens attended the cemetery itself. An full account of the funeral was printed in the local paper and was repeated the following week, such was the popular demand locally.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, with the loyal help of her daughters, continued to run the Oak, possibly until her death in 1933. By then, much of the energies and resources7 of the next generation, as we shall see, were directed towards a butchery business on the High Road family but the license at the Royal Oak was continued by their youngest son Harold Burnham Elliott until his death in 1944.\n\n\n\nAlfred and Elizabeth are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. They had six children: Alfred Elliott - was born in Bradford about 1879. In 1909 he married Sarah Eaton, the second daughter of Richard Eaton, of West Bridgford, a farmer, originally from Derbyshire, who had previously farmed at Risley and in Toton and his wife Sydney who originated from Stapleford. Alfred started his career as a butcher with William Herbert George who then operated two shops in Beeston - at 62 City Road and at 127 Queens Road. By 1913 Alfred had taken over these two shops8 and was trading on his own account and was on his way to building a business which was to become a firm favourite with Beeston families through two generations and for over 75 years. During World War 1, staff shortages forced the closure of the Queens Road shop and, by 1920, he was trading exclusively from the shop at 47 High Road, Beeston, a prime trading position on the corner of Villa Street - see picture on the right9 - where he and his sons continued to trade until 1964. His wife, Sarah died in 1933 and Alfred died suddenly in February 1947 - apparently after clearing snow during the very hard winter of that year; They are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had four children: Marjorie Elliott - was born in Beeston in 1909. After school she worked in the millinery trade, first at Meakins in Beeston Square and later at Cullens in Carrington Street in Nottingham. She then began helping her father in the butcher's shop, become even more involved after her mother died in 1933 and joined her brothers when they took over following their father's death in 1947. She never married and, after their retirement in 1964, moved with her brother to live in Whatton-in-the-Vale where she died in 1975.\n\nRosalind Elliott - was born in 1914 and died, aged four in 1918. She is remembered on her parents' memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nAlfred Richard Elliott - was born in Beeston in 1915 and joined his father in the family butchery business at 47 High Road. In 1940 he married Gladys Evelyn Hankinson. After War service, he rejoined the family business which, after their father's sudden death in 1947, he continued to run in partnership with his brother William with the help of their sister Marjorie. In 1964, the partnership was dissolved and Alfred closed the High Road shop and continued the business from premises on Chilwell Road, at the corner of Hall Croft. He died in 1989, followed by his wife in 1992.\n\n\n\nClick to see more about the Chillwell Road shop.\n\nWilliam Eaton Elliott - born in 1918, was also part of the family butchery business, joining his brother in partnership after their father's death in 1947. He never married and he and his sister retired in 1964, moving to Whatton-in-the-Vale where he died in 1995. Bertie Elliott - born in 1882 in Bradford was, like Alfred, nevertheless brought to Beeston to be baptised in the Parish Church. He joined the LMS Railway as a sheet checker, was working as a railway clerk by 1901 and finished his career with the company - in all some 45 years - as an accounts collector at Nottingham. He was highly regarded as a cricketer with a career with Beeston Town Cricket Club notable mainly for his bowling prowess - but also as a useful bat. During the 1914-18 war he served for 2\u00bd years with the Royal Engineers, assisting with the operation of a light railway on the Somme. During this time he survived a torpedo attack when the HMS Lydia - packed with troops and railway equipment was hit. He was a stalward for over 50 years at Queens Road Methodist Church where, except during his war service, he served as secretary from 1901 until his death. He was a Trustee of the church for many years and had attended a meeting of that body on the evening before his sudden death in 1953. In 1908 he married Lillie Gertrude Timmins from Staffordshire and had two children - Dorothy, who was on the staff of the Clerk to Beeston & Stapleford District Council and who married Robert Marvin, and Alfred Joseph who moved to Essex. His memorial, and that of his wife who died in 1963, can be found in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nLily Ann Elliott - was the first to be born - in January 1894 - after the family's return to Beeston. She and her sister Emma assisted their parents in the Royal Oak. In 1924, she married George Herbert James, a widower who worked as a railway clerk. She died in 1969, aged 85 and is buried in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Edward Elliott - was born in about 1886, first worked as a joiner but later became a plumber, moved to Sheffield, married and had two children. He died there in 1953.\n\nEmma Elliott - was born in about 1888 and died in 1976, having never married. Along with her sister Lily, she assisted her parents with the running of the Royal Oak.\n\nHarold Burnham Elliott - born in 1891, married Mabel Bignall, daughter of a lace maker, in 1920. He started his career in the lace industry, becoming a lace designer but, after the death of his mother in 1933, took over the licence at the Royal Oak and ran it until his relatively early death in 1944 - although his widow lived on for a further 46 years. Their only daughter, Kathleen, born in 1922, died unmarried in 1961. Harold was also a cricketer of note, once taking 10 wickets for 23 runs for Chilwell Cricket Club - and was presented with the ball.

By 1881 he had moved to Weelsby, a village in north Lincolnshire where he had found a teaching post. In 1886, he married Miriam Dobson - a marriage which was to end in sadness a year later when Miriam died as a result of giving birth to their only child, Charles. Aaron continued to teach in the Grimsby area of North Lincolnshire assisted at home with the young Charles by a servant, Kate Moore - whom he was to marry in 1895.\n\nJohn Burnham - who was born in 1860 has not been identified after 1861. Martha Burnham's Family - as we have seen, Martha did not marry but had one daughter: Mary Burnham - was born in 1841 and died unmarried in 1859. Her memorial survives in Beeston Churchyard. Elizabeth Burnham's Family - Elizabeth married James Bates in 1841 but was widowed in 1844. Elizabeth herself died in 1857. However, in the short interval of the marriage, the couple had two children: William Bates - was born in 1842 and, initially at least, became a joiner within the Burnham family,\n\nJohn Bates - born about 1843, was brought up by his grandparents but eventually moved to Bradford, Yorkshire where he married and operated as a carter. William Burnham's Family - with his wife Eliza, William had six children: William Burnham - was born in about 1849 but is not identifiable after 1861.\n\nJames Burnham - was born in 1850 and followed the traditional family occupation by becoming a joiner and remaining in the trade throughout his life10. In 1871 he married Ada Mills, the grand-daughter of Edward Mills, a basket-maker from West Leake, Notts. Together they had five children, all born in Beeston: Ernest William Burnham - was born in 1873 and worked as a lace maker. In 1895 at Beeston Parish Church, he married Mary Hooton Goodhead who was the daughter of a Manchester grocer but who had been working in Beeston as a servant. The couple had at least one child: Ernest Goodhead Burnham - was born in 1910 who first married Edna Taylor in 1932 and then, after her death, Ivy Lilian Whiting in 1940. Ernest was a builder who, during the late 1930s built the row of houses which now makes up 174-214 Wollation Road Beeston. Edith Kate Burnham - born in 1874, died in 1878.\n\nEliza Anice Burnham - was born in 1877 and worked in the lace trade until her marriage to Walter Berryman Holmes in 1902. Walter was a foreman at Beeston Boiler Company for virtually all his working life and the couple lived on City Road during that time. An undated modest memorial from their children survives in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nJames Arthur Burnham - was born in 1883 and took up the family trade as a joiner - and apparently by 1902, was in partnership with his father. In 1902 he married Ellen Spray, the third daughter of Frederick and Mary Spray.\n\nJohn Edward Mills Burnham - was born in 1885 and was employed as a printer's clerk. He married Harriet Baker in 1907 Eliza Burnham - who was born in 1856 has not been identified after 1871.\n\nEmma Burnham - born in 1858, was a winder in the local silk and lace factories until her marriage, in 1885, to Samuel Fox, a mill engine driver. The couple lived at 55 Middleton Street, Beeston after their marriage and took in he father after he became a widower. Husband and wife died in in 1932 and 1945 respectively and are remembered on a memorial in Beeston Cemetery.\n\nMartha Burnham - born in 1862 and married William Stevenson in 1882.\n\nSarah Ann Burnham - born in 1866, married John Hallam, a firemen at a coal mine, and moved to Radford, Nottingham.\n\nEmma Burnham's Family - Emma was the youngest daughter of John Wilkinson Burnham and his wife Emma. As we have seen, she married Henry Belfield, a baker, in 1845. The couple had seven children: Emma Belfield - was born in about 1847 in Radford, Nottingham where, for some reason, the couple had married and lived in the early months of their marriage. She was, however, baptised at Beeston Parish Church in 1849, along with the couple's second child. By 1871 she was working as a governess in the household of Charles - a land owner, farmer and Mayor - and Constance Brobant (or Broadbent) in Latchford, Cheshire. She served this family faithfully for upwards of twenty years before moving on to serve in the household of Edward (a cotton manufacturer) & Margaret Greg (who was probably related to the Mrs Broadbent) in Styal, Cheshire, apparently as a domestic nurse. We have not been able to find any further trace of Emma but it is likely she did not marry.\n\nAnn Belfield - was born in about 1849 in Beeston - where she was baptised with he younger sister in the same year. This date seems to mark the return of the family to Beeston. In 1872, she married Robert Baguley but died in 1876, apparently as a result of childbirth with their only child, Ann Belfield Baguley. After his wife tragic death, Robert moved away - he can be found working as a domestic butler in Matlock in 1881 - and their daughter Ann was brought up by her maternal grandparents, staying with her grandmother after she was widowed in 1887\n\nHenry Belfield - was born and died in 1854.\n\nMartha Elizabeth Belfield - born in 1855, married John Lee, a lace maker, in 1877. The couple settled first in Cottage Grove, Chilwell before moving to Middleton Street, Beeston during the 1880s. The couple had five children: Thomas H Lee (b. c1879), John Harold Lee (b. c1885), Emma Ellen Lee (b. c1887), Albert Own Lee (b. c1889) and Catherine Lee (b. c1890). John Henry Belfield - as Henry and Emma's eldest surviving son, born in 1859, it fell to him to continue the family bakery business on Chapel Street, Beeston - working first as his father's assistant and taking over after his father's death in 1877. In 1879, he married Pamela Murden, originally from Keyworth, Notts who had been working as a domestic servant at the time of their marriage. John Henry died in 1929 and his wife in the following year and are remembered on a surviving memorial in Beeston Cemetery. The couple had one child: Henry Belfield - born in about 1889, joined his father in the bakery business, was in partnership with him by 192011, at the latest and took over after his father's death in 1929. Thomas William Belfield - born in about 1861, went into the joinery trade - presumably apprenticed to the Burnham family. In 1889 he married Selina Pare and set up home in Cottage Grove, Chilwell, Notts. The couple had one child: Thomas Henry Belfield - born in 1893 and killed in action while serving with the Grenadier Guards on the Western Front, on 23 April 1916. Catherine Mary Belfield - born in about 1864, married Henry Moss, a coal miner, in Attenborough in 1890. The couple moved to Heanor, Derbyshire and later to Henry's native Smalley, Derbyshire and raised at least three children: Henry Belfield Moss (b. 1891 in Heanor), Frederick Moss (b. c1893 in Heanor) and Emma C Moss (b. c1895 in Heanor) John Burnham's Family - John and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Cook) - who he married in 1855 - apparently had only one child: John Edward Belfield - born in 1858 and died, aged 30 months, in 1860 and remembered on a surviving memorial in Beeston Churchard.

The advertisment is also interesting as it states that the business - that is, the family's involvement in joinery - was established in 1817. This presumably refers to John Wilkinson Burnham's original business started in Clifton and transferred by him to Beeston about 1827.\n\n2The Shoulder of Mutton was situated on the corner of Radford Road and Valley Road (now part of the Nottingham Ring Road) and across the road from Basford Gas Works. It appears that the previous landlord was George Offiler who founded the well known brewery. The site is now occupied by a MacDonalds.\n\n3Her father was Joseph Edmund Taylor. At the time of his wife's death and Frances Mary's birth he was running the Warren Arms, a beerhouse on Derby Road, Nottingham. About two years later, he married his barmaid and had three further children. By 1901 he was working as an accountant's clerk.\n\n4It is presently unclear whether she was born in Beeston or in Basford; the evidence from census returns varies and the Registration District for both locations was the same at that time. She was, however, baptised at Beeston Parish Church in August 1873. It is interesting that the next child is not born for another five years - during which time, presumably, Edward and Mary were focused on establiishing their business in Basford.\n\n5His involvement with the business can be tracked in a series of Wrights Directories, throughout the 1880s. Curiously, he is shown then in partnership with Aaron Burnham (e.g. in 1885 as \"George & Aaron\" in 1885) - which seems unlikely, given that his brother of that name was working as a school teacher in Lincolnshire at that time and his son of the same name was only about 5 years old at the time of the first entry in 1883.\n\n6Details of this are on the Claims to Fame page (Opens in a new window)\n\n7By the time of Elizabeth Elliott's death, these resources included property she owned at 16,18 & 20 Bramcote Road, Beeston and 90 (occupied by her son Bertie's family), 104 (occupied by her daughter Lily's (Mrs George H James) family & 106 (occupied by Elizabeth herself and by her daughter Emma) on Denison Street, Beeston and property at 6 & 8 Park Street, Beeston built by her son Alfred in 1932 on land previously owned by her.\n\n8There is some confusion about the location of William Herbert George's shops compared with those acquired by Alfred Elliott. At the time of both the 1891 and 1901 census, George was operating from 80 High Road (which is on the south side and near to Regent Street. By 1905 (per Wrights Directory), he was operating from Queens Road and from Commercial Buildings (in the Square). In Alfred's obituary (1947), it is stated that he took over \"Mr George's two shops at 114 High Road and Queens Road\" and that \"the shop in the High Road continued to operate and has done so ever since\". If this implies that George sold all his shops to Elliott, this is not so as he was still trading in the Square in 1920. The Queens Road shop clearly matches but the 114 High Road does not appear to match the on-going location at 47 High Road - unless the premises were renumbered over the years.\n\n9This picture is from a paper bag which was carefully preserved by the writer's mother for many years. It is assumed that she must have traded at Elliotts in the 1930s. The 1913 and 1920 shop locations are derived from contemporary entries in the local Wrights Directories.\n\n10In both 1902 and 1905, his business is shown as \"Burnham & Son (James), Joiner. Villa Street\". This appears to refer to James (b.1850) and his son James Arthur (b.1883).\n\n11Wrights Directory of Nottingham & Neighbourhood, 1920 - J Belfield & Son, Bakers & Confectioners, 22 Chapel St, Beeston.\n\n\n\nAll information relates to the specific individual and/or family shown and and does not necessarily relate to other individuals or families with the same surname.\n\nWhilst every effort is made to ensure that information is as accurate as possible, as in all genealogical research, users should satisfy themselves as to its accuracy.\n\nWe do not knowingly include information relating to living individuals.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/countycricket/jack_burnham_to_leave_durham.html", "page_content": "Jack Burnham to leave Durham after long association\n\nBurnham, the former England Under-19 international batsman, made just under 100 appearances for the county across formats after making his debut in 2015\n\nJack Burnham has left Durham at the end of his contract.\n\nBurnham, the former England Under-19 international batsman, made just under 100 appearances for the county across formats after making his debut in 2015.\n\nDespite showing tremendous promise in his teenage years, Burnham's career stuttered after he was handed a year-long ban in 2017 for failing three recreational drugs tests.\n\nDurham stuck by him and he returned to the club for the 2019 season.\n\nHowever, the 24-year-old and the county will now go their separate ways.\n\nDurham director of cricket Marcus North said: \u201cEveryone at Durham wishes Jack the best of luck with his future endeavours.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/news/jack_burnham_to_leave_durham.html", "page_content": "Jack Burnham to leave Durham after long association\n\nBurnham, the former England Under-19 international batsman, made just under 100 appearances for the county across formats after making his debut in 2015\n\nJack Burnham has left Durham at the end of his contract.\n\nBurnham, the former England Under-19 international batsman, made just under 100 appearances for the county across formats after making his debut in 2015.\n\nDespite showing tremendous promise in his teenage years, Burnham's career stuttered after he was handed a year-long ban in 2017 for failing three recreational drugs tests.\n\nDurham stuck by him and he returned to the club for the 2019 season.\n\nHowever, the 24-year-old and the county will now go their separate ways.\n\nDurham director of cricket Marcus North said: \u201cEveryone at Durham wishes Jack the best of luck with his future endeavours.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Burman_(cricketer)", "page_content": "John Burman (5 October 1838 \u2013 14 May 1900)[1] was an English first-class cricketer, who played one match for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, scoring a duck and a vital 1 not out against Cambridgeshire at Queens Park, Wisbech in 1867.[1] That was his only first-class run, and his only contribution to the game, but it was a heroic innings as he was last man in, and helped Joseph Rowbotham take the score from 76 for 9, to the 91 they needed to complete a one wicket win.\n\nEnglish cricketer\n\nBurman, who was born in Bramham cum Oglethorpe, near Wetherby, Yorkshire, England, also umpired the Roses match at Old Trafford in 1875.\n\nHe died aged 61, in May 1900 in Halton, Leeds."}], "John Burnham played for Derbyshire between 1871 and 1876.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Burnham_(cricketer)", "page_content": "John William Burnham (6 June 1839 \u2013 20 April 1914) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1871 and 1876.

For more than 24 hours, the fire burned through the heart of Chicago, killing 300 people and leaving one-third of the city's population homeless.\n\n\n\nThe \"Great Rebuilding\" was the effort to construct a new, urban center. Big businesses, innovative buildings, and a new style of architecture were the results.\n\nThe Great Chicago Fire started on the evening of Oct. 8, 1871. While there is little doubt that the fire started in a barn owned by Patrick and Catherine O'Leary, the exact cause of the fire remains a mystery. From the barn at 137 DeKoven Street, on the city's southwest side, the fire spread north and east, into the heart of Chicago's business district.\n\n\n\nRain put out the fire more than a day later, but by then it had burned an area 4 miles long and 1 mile wide. The fire destroyed 17,500 buildings and 73 miles of street. Ninety thousand people\u2014one in three Chicago residents\u2014were left homeless by the fire. While only 120 bodies were recovered, it is believed that 300 people died in the blaze.\n\n\n\nChicago's summer and fall in 1871 were unusually dry, with only one-fourth the normal amount of rain falling between July and October. Many of the city's wooden buildings and sidewalks had dried out in the summer's intense heat.\n\n\n\nOn the first night of the fire, strong southwesterly winds fanned the flames high into the sky and created convection spirals, or \"fire devils.\" Fire devils spit burning debris in all directions, causing more buildings to burn.\n\n\n\nBuildings often had a single layer of fireproof material on the outside, hiding the wooden structure beneath. The Waterworks, on Pine Street, was just such a building. Its wooden roofing shingles had been replaced with slate, but the structure itself was pine . When a burning ember struck the roof in the first hours of the fire, the Waterworks was quickly destroyed. It was the main source of water for the city's understaffed fire department.\n\n\n\nOn the first Sunday after the fire, the Rev. Robert Collyer spoke to his Unitarian congregation outside the ruins of Unity Church on Dearborn Street. \"We have not lost, first, our geography. Nature called the lakes, the forests, the prairies together in convention long before we were born, and they decided that on this spot a great city would be built.\" Unity Church was rebuilt the following year.\n\n\n\nThe fire destroyed the city\u2019s business district , but it left the stockyards and the new packing plants on the South Side untouched. Known as the \u201cHog Butcher of the World,\u201d Chicago\u2019s stockyards processed more meat than anywhere else on Earth.\n\n\n\nMost of the wharfs, lumberyards, and mills along the Chicago River survived, as did two-thirds of the grain elevators to the west. The industries surrounding agriculture and trade kept the city\u2019s finances as stable as possible, and employed thousands of people.\n\n\n\nMost railroad tracks were not damaged. This allowed shipments of aid to come pouring in from across the country and around the world. Book donations collected in England became part of Chicago's first free, public library. The Chicago Public Library opened its doors on Jan. 1, 1873. Its original building was a water tank on LaSalle Street that had survived the fire.\n\n\n\nIn 1956, the Chicago Fire Academy was built on the site where Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary's barn once stood. The school trains new firefighters to this day.\n\n\n\nFirst Phase of the Great Rebuilding\n\n\n\nThe rebuilding of Chicago started immediately. Sometimes, construction began even before the architect and engineers had completed the design.\n\n\n\nAfter the fire, laws were passed requiring new buildings be constructed with fireproof materials such as brick, stone, marble, and limestone. These building materials, much more expensive than wood, are held together by a sticky, strong substance called mortar. The construction technique using mortar is called masonry. Masons are a skilled group of construction workers.\n\n\n\nMany poorer Chicagoans couldn't afford the fireproof materials or skilled masons to rebuild. In addition, many could not afford fire insurance. (Before the fire, many people had insurance , but their policies were burned in the fire.) Without the means to rebuild or insure their property, thousands of people and small businesses were crowded out of Chicago.\n\n\n\nMany other businesses simply ignored the new building laws. Wood often replaced stone , and builders decorated their buildings with wooden awnings, cupolas, and cornices.\n\n\n\nTerra Cotta\n\n\n\nTwo events stopped this phase of reconstruction. The first was the failure of a bank, Jay Cooke and Company, in Sept ember 1873. The bank \u2019s failure triggered a nationwide depression that halted much of the Chicago construction. The second event was another, somewhat smaller fire, in July 1874. This fire destroyed more than 800 buildings over 60 acres.\n\n\n\nAfter the 1874 fire, the slow and expensive process of rebuilding with fireproof materials began. Big banks and businesses, which handled millions of dollars in revenue every year, dominated Chicago\u2019s new business district .\n\n\n\nTerra-cotta clay emerged as a popular and effective building material. By the mid-1880s, terra cotta tiling made Chicago one of the most fireproof cities in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe renovation of Palmer House, a luxury hotel on Monroe Street, is an example of how reconstruction efforts used terra cotta. Palmer House had opened only 13 days before the Great Fire. When it looked likely that the Palmer House would be destroyed, its architect , John M. Van Osdel, buried the blueprints in a hole in the basement, and covered them with a thick layer of sand and clay. Sand and clay are the chief materials used in the building material known as terra cotta. The blueprints survived the fire, and Van Osdel became convinced that clay terra cotta tile would make an excellent fireproof material.\n\n\n\nTerra cotta tiles became roofing materials for the new Palmer House. The building itself was made of iron and brick . Palmer House, which is now part of the Hilton hotel chain, advertised itself as \u201cThe World\u2019s Only Fire Proof Hotel.\u201d\n\n\n\nTerra cotta would also be used in the Montauk Block, on Monroe Street, often regarded as one of the world\u2019s first high-rise buildings. The Montauk was 10 stories tall, with 150 offices. After the fire, clay tiles formed fireproof insulation around the building's iron frame. The Montauk was also the first building in Chicago where the construction didn't stop during the winter, and it was the first building in the world to be built at night, using the new technique of electric lighting.\n\n\n\nChicago School\n\n\n\nChicago's architects worked to meet the demands of commercial businessmen. Businessmen preferred plain-looking buildings, because putting on fancy ornaments cost more money. This streamlined style became known as the Chicago School of architecture . William Le Baron Jenney, Daniel Burnham, John W. Root, Louis Sullivan, and Dankmar Adler are some of the most well-known Chicago School architects .\n\n\n\nThe construction of the Home Insurance Building is a good example of how the Chicago School architects worked with businesses to form a new style. When the New York Home Insurance Company relocated its business to Chicago, they challenged the architectural community to come up with a design to bring natural light to all parts of the building. William Le Baron Jenney came up with a solution: Steel, lighter and stronger than iron , could be used on the upper floors.\n\n\n\nJenney's Home Insurance Building, on LaSalle Street, was the first to make use of a steel cage to provide a building's support. The steel frame allowed more large windows to be constructed on every side of the building. Natural light flooded the tall structure. The partitions between offices were made of brick and terra cotta. Built in 1884, the Home Insurance Building is considered to be the world's first skyscraper."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128420362/john-c-burnham", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

Peterson [1] THE 1901 to 1902 Senate Park Commission plan for Washington, D.C., ranks among the most significant urban plans in American history. Its novel blending and adroit elaboration of city-making ideas then current in the United States made it a benchmark for modern urbanism and triggered a national city-planning movement. The consummate artistry and professionalism of its designers, together with their boldness of vision and willingness to address local needs, established its potential benefit to the national capital. Ultimately, the plan-makers' deep and enduring commitment to implementation, fortified by the tactical shrewdness of their backers\u0097and their plain good luck\u0097in negotiating Washington politics, against a backdrop of mounting public support, brought success: a capital city recast as a symbol of national authority and of the nation's emergence as a world power. All of these considerations, taken together, establish the importance of the Senate Park Commission plan, often called the McMillan Plan after its sponsor, James McMillan of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia from 1890 until his death in 1902 (frontispiece). [2] Senator James McMillan of Michigan (1838-1902). Commission of Fine Arts A design of such note might be presumed to reflect a strong, well-established urban planning tradition in the United States. But this was not the case. Since the mid-eighteenth century, most American towns and cities had been laid out on grids by a society more eager to promote land sales than civic order. And big-city growth, once it had begun on a sustained basis from the mid-nineteenth century onward, had occurred in boom-and-bust surges subject to little or no public regulation. Everywhere in the United States, market forces had set the terms of growth, in land subdivision at the city's fringe and in building up the city proper: its stores, shops, offices, factories, and private residences. In transportation, the powerful railroad corporations that had tied the nation's towns and cities into vast networks by the 1880s, and the city transit firms that had laced urban America with trolley lines in the 1890s had dictated the routes and hence the directions of city growth. During the Gilded Age, large-scale, systematic public planning for existing cities had focused on water supply, sewerage systems, and public parks. Because these services, though urgent, had offered scant opportunity for profit, they usually had been addressed by public authorities as specialized interventions. As to generalized planning for all aspects of the built city, or what is now called comprehensive city planning, it was all but unknown in the United States of 1900.\n\nTHE PUZZLE OF WASHINGTON To all of this, one city stood out as a partial exception. Alone among major urban centers in the United States, Washington rested on a grandly conceived foundation. In 1791 Pierre Charles L'Enfant, in the employ of President George Washington, had conceived the capital as the seat of a \"vast empire,\" designing it as an enormous grid of streets crisscrossed by wide diagonal avenues. The many points of crossing and convergence had, with artful forethought as to placement, yielded over two dozen public squares and spaces and, together with the avenues, had made the city a symbol of nationhood. By 1900 the capital had filled out its frame, but the Victorian city that had emerged differed fundamentally from L'Enfant's and Washington's vision. When the Mall as the physical and symbolic heart of L'Enfant's plan began to be developed in the 1840s, the neoclassical design principles of harmony and regularity that had guided him had given way to ones predicated on irregularity and intricacy derived from medieval art. L'Enfant had envisioned the Mall as a partially sunken, axial corridor lined by museums and theaters and extending about a mile due west from Capitol Hill. This major axis would have formed the stem of a vast, L-shaped public space, its crossing arm running due south from the President's House. L'Enfant had marked this juncture point with an equestrian statue of George Washington (pl. I). Yet in 1848, Robert Mills' obelisk monument was placed well away from that point, in the middle of the central vista between James Renwick's Smithsonian Institution, begun on the south side of the Mall in 1847, and a canal, which occupied a wide swath along the Mall's north side. Although the Mall still looked like \"a marshy and desolate waste,\" these structures, in concert with the Botanic Garden at the foot of Capitol Hill, would soon define the western \"vista\" when viewed from the Capitol terrace. Picturesque landscaping for the Mall was considered as early as 1841 and began to be carried out in 1851, to the plans of America's most prominent landscape gardener, Andrew Jackson Downing, filling L'Enfant's corridor with dense tree plantings of many species. The monument itself, built to a height of 170 feet by 1855, remained an unfinished shaft for the next quarter of a century, as if representing the city itself. [3] By 1900 the Mall had become a chain of individual public parks, each associated with a different Victorian building, most of them built of red brick. The passenger shed of the Victorian gothic terminal of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, built in 1873 to 1878, extended nearly halfway across the Mall at Sixth Street; the canal had been filled during the 1870s. [4] (See Helfrich fig. 3 and Wrenn fig. 6) Beyond the tracks, from Seventh to Twelfth streets, lay the picturesque grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, where a multitude of footpaths meandered through a forest of trees (fig. 1). From Twelfth to Fourteenth streets, the Agriculture Department maintained an open and formal parterre in the center of the Mall, but extensive greenhouses and sheds to the west of its building struck resi dents and visitors alike as an eyesore. (See Dalrymple fig. 4) Terminating the chain, scattered clumps of trees dotted the meadow around the Washington Monument, completed in 1884. Fig. 1 Victorian Washington, ca. 1900. Foreground: The Mall, with its curving paths and random planting of trees, in the vicinity of the Smithsonian Institution building. Middle ground, far left: Center Market, which stood between 7th and 9th streets, facing North B Street (Constitution Avenue). Middle ground, near right: The B & P Railroad terminal, marked by a Victorian-style tower, now the site of the National Gallery of Art. Commission of Fine Arts By 1900, to the west and southwest of the Monument lay \"Potomac Park,\" a 739-acre swath of newly made public ground that, as landfill, covered the old tidal flats of the Potomac River. This project, begun in 1882 by the Army Corps of Engineers, included a long spit of land stretching southeastward along the eastern bank of the Potomac, later named East Potomac Park. [5] What was to be done with this new land and its connections, if any, to the Mall park chain had not been decided (pl. XVI). Washington itself by 1900 had become a city of considerable stature. From a population of 75,000 in 1860, it had grown to 278,000. Beginning in 1871 the city center and its built-up neighborhoods acquired their first modern infrastructure, including gas and electric lines, water and sewer service, and street paving. These improvements, initiated during the city's brief territorial government (1871-74), had continued under a board of commissioners directly answerable to Congress. Inevitably, the various House and Senate committees on the District of Columbia that oversaw the city's day-to-day affairs, along with other committees that designated sites for new federal and city buildings or privately sponsored monuments, exerted a fragmented and unpredictable control over Washington's development. For example, beginning in 1892 to 1893, Congress, after years of splitting costs with local taxpayers, suddenly refused to finance the extension of streets and squares into the \"county\" lands lying between the city's original boundary and the District of Columbia line. Nonetheless, Washington by the 1890s was increasingly perceived as a source of national pride, especially for its government buildings, many of which contained small museums or spaces commemorating American achievements, none more lavishly than the new Library of Congress. Against this backdrop, the Senate Park Commission plan when displayed at the Corcoran Gallery for nearly six weeks beginning in mid-January 1902, drew rapt attention. On view, first and foremost, was a spectacular design for the city's core, featuring the Mall as a two-and-one-half-mile-long corridor, beginning at the foot of Capitol Hill and extending westward to reach what is now the Lincoln Memorial. Gone was the miscellany of verdant parks and grounds; gone was the railroad station; and gone also were all the brick and brownstone Victorian buildings along the Mall's southern edge, including the Smithsonian Institution. In their place, a unified green space controlled the scene, accented by parterre gardens, water basins, and monuments and flanked by rows of trees in front of new, white, neoclassical buildings\u0097with everything located in concert rather than by happenstance (pl. VIII). [6] What the Senate Park Commission plan contemplated was a unified ceremonial core, scaled to early twentieth-century urbanism and reflective of a cosmopolitan vision of national culture. Besides the renewed Mall, the core scheme also included formal groups of public buildings around Capitol Square, around Lafayette Square just north of the White House, and between the Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue (an area now known as the Federal Triangle). The newly made Potomac Park contained two monuments, one to terminate the Capitol axis, the other the White House axis. Also integral to the core were a new union railroad station and a memorial bridge across the Potomac River. [7] A second phase of the plan called for a vast, new park system joining together the outer reaches of the city (pl. IV). From the Mall core, a shore drive ran along the Potomac River leading to a parkway through the valley of Rock Creek that connected to both a multilane boulevard and a beltway across the northern reaches of the city. These roads provided access to several federal sites, including Civil War forts and the grounds of the U.S. Soldiers Home. Further on, additional park and road connections led to the Anacostia River, and to an array of Civil War forts in the southeastern portion of the district, yielding a park chain that encircled most of the city. This phase of the plan also called for the inauguration of a playground system; the transformation of the malarial Anacostia flats into an immense water park; the more \"sober treatment\" and better regulation of Arlington cemetery; the preservation of the Potomac River palisades and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; the establishment of the Great Falls of the Potomac as a national park, of a quay for the Georgetown waterfront, and of a memorial drive to Mount Vernon. [8] The great puzzle of the Senate Park Commission plan is why a scheme of such remarkable sweep and boldness ever appeared. It followed no European model, despite specific borrowings from European civic and garden design. No American city had ever contemplated anything like it. It was, in fact, sui generis: a new and comprehensive vision for the capital and the nation. As such, it reflected an extraordinary convergence of events whose interactions could hardly have been forecast even twelve months earlier. And because it was so idealistically framed and swiftly formulated at a time of fiscal stringency, its prospect for survival and influence was anything but certain. Yet it had appeared in the one city whose planning had always been an American exception. The story, in outline, unfolded as follows. After several prominent Washingtonians, most of them members of the Board of Trade, had organized a lavish, patriotic celebration to mark the 100th anniversary of the federal government's move to Washington in 1800, their initiative became entangled with city-development issues sparked by a power struggle between Senator McMillan and the entrenched U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The latter had held executive authority over public buildings and grounds, including the Mall, since 1867. The root question was how to eliminate dangerous railroad grade crossings throughout the city. The controversies that ensued placed the entire urban fabric at issue, most especially the civic core, establishing quite by accident the citywide and multipurpose character of the struggle and hence of the Senate Park Commission plan as its ultimate outcome. The American Institute of Architects (AIA), well into these controversies, seized hold of the 12 December 1900 centennial event to showcase their profession's most advanced ideas about civic art. Interested in much more than theory, they immediately allied themselves with Senator McMillan and the Board of Trade against the engineers to attain their goals in an unprecedented way: by means of a park system plan for the entire city. Once the Senate Park Commission was named, Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham played a catalytic role by disregarding McMillan's initial instructions to produce a \"preliminary\" scheme, pushing instead for an ideal solution. Burnham's leadership, in turn, engendered a deep commitment among all the plan-makers, including McMillan and his political aide, Charles Moore, to the plan itself. Consequently, its creators became its chief advocates in the struggles that followed its release. Finally, the architectural profession through the AIA and a host of civic arts-advocacy groups brought together by the burgeoning City Beautiful Movement established a national constituency for the plan outside of Washington that proved crucial to its survival.\n\nMARKING THE CENTENNIAL By any telling, the story begins with the effort to celebrate the centennial. The initiators were leaders of the Board of Trade, the most powerful civic promotional body in the capital. After organizing in October 1898, they approached President William McKinley in mid-November, suggesting several ideas: a memorial hall, a majestic bridge across the Potomac River, or some other durable work that would \"inspire patriotism and a broader love of country.\" [9] These conventional, if costly, ideas typified the rituals and piecemeal methods of city-making then commonplace in the United States. When neither the House nor the Senate authorized a specific project, the Board of Trade called a meeting of local, congressional, and national centennial committees for 21 February 1900. This was to be a glittering occasion, staged as much to honor the state governors who comprised the national committee as to make major decisions. It would culminate in a lavish banquet that would feature the surprise illumination of a huge \"American flag of electric lights,\" emblematic of the unabashed patriotism of the era. Prior to the event, the local sponsors had agreed among themselves to push the Potomac River bridge as their most popular goal. The centennial, they hoped, would climax with the laying of its cornerstone. But to everyone's surprise, the assemblage substituted entirely new objectives. [10] This turnabout was the work of Senator McMillan, a millionaire and, by reputation, \"one of the five senators who 'practically run the United States.'\" [11] McMillan was appointed to the Senate Centennial Committee on 16 February 1900, and five days later became chairman and spokesman of an ad hoc group to evaluate centennial projects. Instead of promoting the bridge, the favorite project of local leaders, McMillan called for the enlargement of the White House, an idea of long standing in Washington, and proposed the building of a three-mile-long Centennial Avenue to begin at the foot of Capitol Hill and to run obliquely through the Mall to the Potomac River (fig. 2). The latter idea, said the next day's Evening Star, was \"a new scheme, unverified by official surveys, virtually unheralded and unknown.\" [12] Fig. 2 The avenue plan, called Centennial Avenue by its promotors, designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb, 15 February 1900. The Inland Architect and News Record, 35 (Mar. 1900). Photo courtesy The Fine Arts Library, Harvard College Library.\n\nTHE AVENUE PLAN AND THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD McMillan's sponsorship of the avenue plan signaled a critical turning point in the centennial discussions. On the surface, he had raised a genuine, if far-fetched, civic art issue being debated chiefly among Washington architects: whether the original design of the Mall should be reinstated. When McMillan publicly announced the avenue plan, he upheld it as a fulfillment of L'Enfant's dream and as an opportunity to group public buildings, a civic art issue also current among architects. [13] But he was not being candid. The avenue plan had much less to do with L'Enfant and civic art than with two major pieces of railroad legislation that he had recently introduced in the Senate in December to January, 1899 to 1900. Both bills represented complex bargains hammered out during the previous three years with the two railroads that entered the capital, the Baltimore and Potomac (B & P), which was owned by the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B & O), which operated a terminal at New Jersey Avenue and C Street, NW. [14] The laws committed the railroads to eliminate grade crossings by removing tracks from the city streets. This hazard, common to most American cities, had killed annually as many as three people and had yielded \"a steady stream of serious accidents, one occurring roughly every three weeks.\" [15] The laws, in turn, authorized each railroad to build new passenger terminals. The old, crowded B & P depot on the Mall would be replaced by an enormous, up-to-date facility in the same location but on a much expanded, fourteen-acre site between Sixth and Seventh streets. The existing tracks across the Mall would be ripped up and rebuilt nearby on a massive, elevated structure to be thrown across the Mall. [16] Never before had anything so fundamentally destructive to the Mall\u0097or to L'Enfant's vision of it\u0097been contemplated. Yet as sponsor of the legislation, McMillan had wedded himself to the scheme for as long as the Pennsylvania Railroad refused to budge from its coveted position. Viewed in this light, the proposed avenue represented a grand approach street to the new terminal. Its curiously oblique alignment would offer travelers a direct route eastward toward Capitol Hill and westward toward the White House, making the new terminal \"so . . . easy of access as if it were the very pivotal point to all else\" in the city. [17] Why McMillan introduced the idea is a significant puzzle. Even the Pennsylvania Railroad opposed it. [18]\n\nLOCAL ORIGINS: THE BATTLE OF PLANS The Army Corps of Engineers within the War Department became McMillan's first and most determined antagonists. Routinely, Army engineers assigned to duty anywhere in the country reviewed federal public works and reported their findings to the president, who submitted them to Congress. As early as 29 January 1900, the Corps in Washington responded to an official request by McMillan for their technical judgment of his railroad bills. [19] They more than replied: they exploded. Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, the outspoken superintendent of the Office of Buildings and Grounds (since 1867 under the War Department), denounced the proposed terminal as a desecration of the Mall, a travesty of L'Enfant's \"noble plan,\" and an \"unpatriotic\" rebuke to the memory of George Washington. [20] McMillan's diagonal avenue plan further outraged the engineers. [21] On 5 March 1900, less than two weeks after McMillan unveiled his scheme, Bingham submitted an alternative Mall plan to President McKinley. In it, he banned the proposed terminal to a position south of the Mall, called for a mid-Mall boulevard between Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument, and suggested that any new public buildings be erected along Pennsylvania Avenue. [22] Meanwhile, the avenue plan had alarmed other Washingtonians, especially businessmen who had long favored upgrading the triangle of land between the Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue. \"Given up almost wholly to slumdom,\" with prostitution along Thirteenth and Fourteenth streets, this area disgraced respectable Washington. [23] By 1900 downtown interests clearly wanted the area upgraded by erecting new government buildings\u0097an incremental slum-removal program. [24] But McMillan's proposed avenue and the building sites he favored along it lay far enough to the south to undercut that hope while stirring fears that Pennsylvania Avenue might become a \"back street.\" [25] Thus, the fate of the Triangle slum and of Pennsylvania Avenue also became entangled in the battle and, ultimately, in the Senate Park Commission plan. Finally, the avenue plan impinged upon a park system initiated by the Washington Board of Trade in 1899. Following the lead of many American cities in the 1890s, the board had contemplated a great chain of parks and parkways as proof of civic stature. Washington, they claimed, already possessed magnificent resources: the newly made 739-acre Potomac Park; the National Zoological Park in the southern end of Rock Creek valley; the immense Rock Creek Park, just north of the zoo; the parklike grounds of the U.S. Soldiers Home; and various Civil War hilltop fortifications. But except for the zoo, none of these parcels had been developed yet for regular public use, let alone linked by parkways. [26] Well before McMillan had proposed his avenue plan, the Senate's District of Columbia Committee had aired these ideas and had even readied legislation authorizing a park commission to devise a scheme. [27] But McMillan's proposed avenue raised awkward questions about how such a \"grand thoroughfare\" could serve public needs and railroad interests simultaneously. Also under scrutiny was the free grant of Mall land to the Pennsylvania Railroad by the proposed grade crossing legislation. [28] These unresolved and conflicting goals resulted in a broad battle over the future development of the nation's capital. Senators, congressmen, army engineers, centennial promoters, downtown businessmen, Civil War veterans, the Washington press, and numerous civic leaders had joined the fray, all disputing basic questions of civic art, park system design, and even slum removal, as if these were interrelated considerations.\n\nTHE VICTORIOUS ENGINEERS To reconcile these divergent viewpoints, McMillan, on 14 May 1900, introduced in the Senate a resolution asking the president to appoint a panel of art professionals. An architect, a landscape architect, and a sculptor would work with Army engineers to devise a plan for the entire Mall-Triangle area and also to devise a \"suitable connection\" between Potomac Park and the zoo. [29] The same experts would design the enlargement of the White House. In effect, McMillan sought to reinstate the architects' and artists' traditional right to oversee construction of their own works. The Army engineers had usurped this role in 1867 when Congress had relegated architects to the task of providing only the first drafts of public buildings while asking engineers to both provide technical expertise and wield executive authority over construction, including any design changes they deemed necessary. In the House version of the bill, the Army engineers, not a panel of art professionals, would carry out the work. On 6 June a House-Senate conference resolved the impasse, with the engineers maintaining the executive role they had played for the past three decades. The chief of engineers then assigned Bingham to the tasks of redesigning the White House\u0097as the president's aide-de-camp, he had worked out of that building since 1897\u0097and of hiring a landscape architect to plan the Mall Triangle area and the parkway link to the zoo. In October the Ladies Home Journal published Bingham's massive, if truncated, version of Frederick Dale Owen's 1890 plan for White House enlargement. [30] On 5 December the War Department issued a Mall design by Samuel Parsons Jr., the New York landscape architect chosen by Bingham (fig. 3). The Parsons plan, though idiosyncratic, fulfilled one purpose of the engineers by relegating the railroad terminal to the south of the Mall. \"A lightning express,\" Parsons remarked, \"is quite incompatible with a green garden and singing birds.\" [31] Fig. 3 Mall plan by Samuel Parsons, Jr., 1900. Collection: Pamela Scott (click on image for a PDF version)\n\nTHE ARCHITECTS INTERVENE The American Institute of Architects assembled in Washington for its annual convention on Centennial Day, 12 December 1900, having rescheduled its meetings to address the issues provoked by the Centennial Avenue scheme. Above all, the AIA wanted Congress to entrust the shaping of the capital core to the nation's premier architects and artists, the same aesthetic elite that had crystallized civic art aspirations in America at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, or World's Columbian Exposition as it was formally called. Glenn Brown, the secretary of the AIA who masterminded this strategy, was well prepared professionally and politically. [32] About ten years earlier, while making an exhaustive study of the U.S. Capitol, Brown had recognized L'Enfant's Mall as the true vista to and from the Capitol. As early as 1894 he had launched a personal crusade to arouse his profession to reclaim the Mall in accord with L'Enfant's intentions. Even then, he had opposed the Army Corps of Engineers for the job, reflecting an enmity toward engineers endemic to his profession and notably virulent among AIA members. That body, Brown remarked acidly in 1894, had \"never been accused of being artistic.\" [33] In 1887 Brown had also organized the Washington AIA chapter and in 1895 to 1897, with other chapter members, had established the Public Art League, the first organization to advocate the creation of a national fine arts commission. [34] As national secretary of the AIA, Brown served an organization already steeped in pressure-group tactics learned from its long struggle to enact and then enforce the Tarsney Act of 1893, a law that stipulated open competitions for federal buildings. [35] Alarmed by the ill-fated Centennial Avenue, he quickly persuaded the AIA to stage its annual meeting as a protest against haphazard city building in the nation's capital. [36] Brown made the \"Grouping of Government Buildings, Landscape, and Statuary\" the meeting's organizing theme, evoking the growing enthusiasm of his profession for ensembles of buildings utilizing classical architecture with baroque spatial effects, especially when achieved by collaborating architects, sculptors, painters, and fine craftsmen. [37] Many American architects, most especially the AIA elite, had absorbed this Renaissance ideal from studies at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. [38] In all, Beaux-Arts classicism in the United States, sometimes called the American Renaissance, conveyed a host of ideas then emergent in national culture: public order, progress; civilization, refined taste; civic pride; and national wealth and power. From March to November 1900 Brown recruited speakers for the AIA convention and orchestrated their assault, alerting them to Bingham's article in the Ladies Home Journal and even cautioning sculptor H. K. Bush-Brown against proposing any commission \"dominated in any way by the army engineers.\" [39] When the architects assembled, they scorned Bingham's White House scheme and on 13 December staged an evening session on the design of the capital city that was reported in local papers. [40] Every AIA speaker sought a formal, monumental, aesthetically unified composition of buildings, statuary, and public grounds, all done in a grand manner and all rendered consistent with the L'Enfant plan as they understood it. \"The city of to-day has grown too large to be picturesque,\" C. Howard Walker proclaimed. [41] No speaker that evening discussed the park system of the city or the suburban districts through which it would reach. [42] Earlier that day, however, five representatives of the AIA had met with McMillan or his aide Moore, and, almost certainly, someone from the Board of Trade. [43] The Board, long accustomed to working with McMillan, had wanted backing for its park ideas. [44] Not only had the architects denounced Bingham, but they would ignore the Bingham-commissioned Parsons plan for the Mall-Triangle at their public session on the design of the city that evening. McMillan, for his part, still had his eyes riveted on his grade-crossing legislation, especially his bill authorizing the Mall terminal. Even as they met, his opponents in the House of Representatives were preparing to cite engineering criticism and the Parsons plan as justifications for voting down McMillan's legislation. [45] McMillan wanted the architects to sanction his claim that he had the beauty of Washington at heart. The architects, in turn, satisfied the senator's needs in one critical respect: they accepted, as a matter of realism, his terminal in the Mall. [46] Once allied with McMillan, the AIA had no choice but to embrace park planning. Powerful as McMillan was in Washington affairs, his District of Columbia committee lacked authority over building location, which belonged to the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, or over statuary, which lay with a Joint (House-Senate) Committee on the Library. [47] But McMillan did have power over park matters and had already worked with the Board of Trade to prepare park legislation. Thus the AIA agreed to address this issue, and the Board of Trade, the chief promoter of the park system, agreed to add the subjects of building and bridge placement to its publicly stated goals for the city. [48] Ostensibly, McMillan had fathered a new coalition for the physical improvement of Washington and a strategy for seizing the planning initiative from the engineers. In fulfillment of this bargain, McMillan introduced Joint Resolution No. 139 in the U.S. Senate. Intended to win the support of both houses of Congress for the planning of Washington, this measure authorized the President of the United States to appoint a commission consisting of two architects and one landscape architect to \"consider the subject of the location and grouping of public buildings and monuments . . . and the development and improvement of the park system\" of the district. An appropriation of $10,000 was sought for expenses. [49]\n\nSENATOR MCMILLAN FULFILLS THE BARGAIN Joint Resolution No. 139 would never clear the Senate let alone the House. In the House, Joseph Cannon, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, already loomed as a predictable adversary, notorious for his \"skinflint\" proclivities and distrust of artists. [50] Nonetheless, McMillan found a way to honor his bargain. [51] After 12 February 1901, when his B & P railroad bill was finally enacted, McMillan's trusted aide and confidant, Charles Moore, suggested a new strategy (fig. 4). [52] Fig. 4 Charles Moore (1855-1942). Commission of Fine Arts Accordingly, on 8 March during an executive session of the Senate held after the adjournment of Congress, McMillan obtained last minute passage of a resolution authorizing his committee to \"report to the Senate plans for the development and improvement of the entire park system of the District of Columbia.\" Appropriate \"experts\" might be consulted and expenses defrayed from \"the contingent fund of the Senate.\" [53] These experts, once appointed, would become known as the Senate Park Commission (later, often known as the McMillan Commission). But their authority, it must be emphasized, rested on a far more tenuous base than had been envisioned in Joint Resolution No. 139 back in December. Furthermore, the new measure said nothing whatsoever about public buildings and monuments. Following through on 19 March, McMillan and Senator Jacob H. Gallinger of New Hampshire, acting as a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, held an informal hearing with representatives of the AIA. Their purpose was to discuss, as McMillan put it, the \"improvement of the park system\" and, \"incidentally,\" the placement of public buildings. [54] Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. also attended, making a derailed record. [55] Everyone present agreed that three experts should be appointed, but no one articulated just what sort of plan they should formulate. As the hearing proceeded, however, a very definite objective emerged: the commission should devise a \"preliminary plan\" as distinct from a \"matured one.\" [56] Because the scheme would be tentative, it could then be negotiated through the three Senate and House committees that had jurisdiction over parks, buildings, and statuary\u0097or through a joint committee representing all three bodies. [57] A final, amended plan would be developed later. In light of the tenuous mandate McMillan had won for his commission, this cautious, consensus-building strategy made excellent sense. As Olmsted Jr. noted, McMillan wanted a \"comprehensive scheme\" but feared that \"it might be turned down by the other Committees if it were made too complete and pushed too far.\" [58]\n\nDANIEL H. BURNHAM: CATALYST Daniel H. Burnham, the Chicago architect nationally known for having orchestrated the planning and construction of the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, played the catalytic role in redefining this mission. As Moore later recalled, he had proposed Burnham, then age 54, as a member, and McMillan, in turn, had suggested Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., then only 30, recognizing him as the mantle bearer for his eminent father. They then communicated their wishes to the AIA, which nominated them on 19 March 1901. [59] These two men, once enlisted, also took their cues from McMillan and Moore, choosing as the third member, Charles F. McKim, the celebrated New York architect who epitomized the conservative wing of the American Renaissance with its preferences for Roman and Renaissance modes of civic art over more recent and flamboyant French variants. \"Only your association with the Washington work,\" McKim later telegramed Burnham, \"made it possible for me to accept.\" Not until early June did Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, become the fourth commissioner, at the suggestion of McKim [60] Due to illness, he would play a limited but not insignificant role. All four men were veterans of the Chicago World's Fair; even \"young Olmsted\" had worked there assisting Burnham (fig. 5). [61] Fig. 5 Members of the Senate Park Commission.

At the 19 March hearing, McMillan and Gallinger made clear that they wanted a \"preliminary plan\" so as to avoid heavy expenses. When Burnham and Olmsted had first conferred on 22 March with McMillan, they had quickly estimated $22,600 as their \"maximum expense.\" But McMillan wanted \"between $15,000 and $20,000,\" [62] and he publicized a still lower sum, reported by the Washington Post as \"about $10,000.\" [63] These dollar figures provide benchmarks for gauging how far the commission would soon exceed its instructions. From the outset, Burnham's powerful personality and expansive outlook dominated, with McMillan treating Burnham as if he were the chairman of the commission, though Burnham would later ask Moore to confirm this unstated fact. [64] Burnham declared that he would serve without compensation. The others followed suit. Burnham wanted every aspect of Washington's urban setting to be considered, just as at the Chicago Fair, when he had overseen everything from sewerage to color effects. In early May, for example, he wrote out eleven pages of topics to explore, including public grounds and buildings, a \"general plan of roads\" issued by the army engineers in 1898, building-height limits, and even the appearance of private lawns and gardens, public markets, and street vendors. [65] As he had explained to Olmsted in mid-April, on another matter, \"My own belief is that instead of arranging for less we should plan for rather more extensive treatment than we are likely to find in any other city.\" [66] Action more than words defined Burnham's role. Early on McMillan informed Burnham that the new B & P terminal to be built by the Pennsylvania Railroad must be regarded as \"a fixture upon the Mall.\" [67] But Burnham refused to accept this reality. Since September he had known that Alexander Cassatt, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, might employ his firm to design that very structure. [68] To Burnham this spelled opportunity, not conflict of interest. When Burnham reached Washington, 5 April, before seeing anyone and not having spoken to McKim in the interval, he \"drove to the location of the Obelisk.\" And the next day, before making a trolley tour of the city outskirts prearranged by Moore and McMillan, the commission, led by Burnham, \"drove to the Obelisk-Capitol axis.\" [69] Back in Chicago, on 10 April, Burnham wrote Olmsted asking if they were ready to design the Mall's main axis \"on a large scale.\" [70] The second of two of the Commission's earliest sketch plans both dated 27 April, diagramed precisely this area, reasserting L'Enfant's Mall and relegating the railroad station to the south side of the Mall (pl. V). [71] On 20 May Burnham shifted from thought to deed. That day, he arrived at the Philadelphia headquarters of the Pennsylvania Railroad empire, hoping for the assignment to design the terminal. [72] But he did not come as a passive supplicant. He brought rough plans for the alternative site south of the Mall. Afterwards that same day in two excited letters to McKim, whom he addressed as a coconspirator, Burnham reported that Cassatt and his chief engineers had \"no idea of the development we had worked out\" and had still been thinking of \"the old location.\" \"The new idea,\" he stated with relief and some amazement, \"has been received with much more open-mindedness than I had hope of.\" In fact, the railroad had agreed to halt land purchases \"for the old scheme,\" at least until a more detailed proposal for \"the new location\" could be presented. [73] Suddenly, the \"fixture upon the Mall\" seemed less secure. The railroad certainly had its own reasons and interests and, in fact, had long opposed that particular site. [74] The actual direction of Cassatt's thinking soon became apparent to Burnham. On 8 June he reached Philadelphia, carrying \"a hundred or more sketches for the Washington station as part of the new plan,\" only to discover the following day Cassatt's interest in the new terminal site granted to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, just north of the Capitol. [75] As Burnham explained to Cassatt, writing from the commission drafting room in Washington two days later, \"The frontage of the B & O plaza toward the Capitol, on which you suggested that a great union depot could be built, is 780 feet; this would be ample for a monumental treatment.\" [76] The commission did not know that during their trip to Europe from mid-June to mid-August 1901, McMillan would follow up Burnham's initiative by inviting Cassatt to \"Eagle Head,\" his vacation home at Manchester-by-the Sea on the Massachusetts coast north of Boston. As Moore recalled the story off the record years later, the two men had settled the much-vexed terminal question while playing a game of golf, before Burnham's later, better-known July conference with Cassatt on the same matter in London. [77] Whatever precisely was agreed to, much remained to be done, with key negotiations still to take place between Burnham and Cassatt in late September and between Cassatt and McMillan in early December. \"Mr. Burnham has accomplished a great deal in procuring this agreement from Mr. Cassatt, McMillan remarked to Moore after the late September meeting. [78] During the fall of 1901, Burnham and his chief designer Peirce Anderson concentrated on the layout and location of the terminal. Cassatt's decision to remove the proposed terminal from the Mall, even after obtaining the 12 February legislation guaranteeing the site, stemmed from many factors: McMillan's offer to persuade Congress to meet the increased expenses involved in building a tunnel under the Mall or Capitol grounds; the existence of an alternative site north of the Capitol, made available to the B & O by the newly enacted grade-crossing legislation; and a recent decision by the Pennsylvania to purchase \"a controlling interest\" in the B & O, which thus gave it access to the alternative site, and Cassatt's own largeness of vision. [79] But without Burnham's initiative in May, boldly suggesting the relocation of the terminal in the first place, neither Cassatt nor McMillan would have altered their course, nor would the Commission have been as zealous in pursuing \"the very finest plans their minds could conceive\" (fig. 6). [80] Fig. 6 Union Station, after erection of the Columbus Monument and the City Post Office (far left), c. 1915. The Architectural Work of Graham Anderson Probst & White (London, 1933).\n\nTHE COMMISSION AS A FORCE McMillan and Moore became advisors, facilitators, and ultimately advocates. At McMillan's command a committee room in the Capitol became the commission's headquarters, and Moore commandeered the north-facing Senate Press Gallery as its drafting room manned by James G. Langdon from Olmsted Jr.'s office. [81] When Burnham, McKim, and Olmsted gathered as a team for the first time on 6 April, they traversed Washington in a luxury trolley car obtained by Moore from the president of the street railway system. [82] The following day they visited Secretary of War Elihu Root and other newly appointed members of the Grant Memorial Commission. [83] Congress had authorized $250,000\u0097an immense sum\u0097for a statue or memorial to Ulysses S. Grant as Commanding General of the Union Army, its location yet to be determined. [84] Root then escorted the architects to the White House to be greeted by President McKinley. [85] A reception followed at the home of Senator McMillan. All this heartened the commission. \"The Washington business opens with great promise,\" McKim reported soon thereafter, noting the probable support of the president, Root, and Treasury secretary Lyman Gage, the latter a personal friend of Burnham. \"If half of what is talked of can be carried through, it will make the Capital City one of the most beautiful centers in the world.\" \"I do not think you will hear any more of the proposed alterations of the White House,\" he added. [86] Burnham returned to Chicago full of enthusiasm. \"The Washington work is a stupendous job, full of the deepest interest, and it appeals to me as nothing else ever has. I have the best fellows with me, and we have the sympathy of all officials in Washington.\" [87] Burnham, McKim, and Olmsted all focused on the Mall, even as they began to differentiate their roles in shaping the overall plan. Olmsted, who in the 1890s had advised on street extensions and the layout of the National Zoo and St. Elizabeth's Hospital, had already favored the Mall as an open, axial corridor flanked by \"masses of foliage and architecture\" when he had addressed the 1900 AIA convention. [88] In contrast, neither Burnham nor McKim had had prior Washington commissions. But the thrust of the AIA convention, their shared experience at the Chicago World's Fair, as well as their own architectural and planning principles inevitably drew them to L'Enfant's plan and the antecedents of his ideas. When the commission gathered for the second time on 19 April, \"Senator McMillan himself launched the enterprise by giving a large dinner at which Senators, Cabinet members, and influential citizens\" met the designers informally. [89] The three men then took a three-day excursion aboard a U.S. Navy steamer down the Potomac River and up the James River to observe the remnants of southern civic design at Williamsburg and several Virginia plantations and to catch the afterglow of the late eighteenth century in America. [90] The respective roles of Burnham and McKim began to emerge, with Burnham focusing on railroad matters and McKim on the design of the Mall. The architects met again on 14 to 19 May and 10 to 11 June and took a second boat trip to the eastern shore of Maryland on 15 to 16 May to visit the Wye and Whitehall estates. [91] There is no better measure of their growing cohesion and commitment than their personal advances of about $1,000 each to George C. Curtis, the Boston model maker, to get him started on two sizable representations of the capital, one to show existing conditions, the other the proposed changes. [92] By the first week of June Burnham, McKim, and Olmsted Jr. had conceptualized the Mall as a great corridor extending from Capitol Hill west to the Potomac River\u0097its axis realigned to bisect the Washington Monument\u0097and crossed by a second corridor running due south from the White House (pl. VI). [93] With placement of the Grant and Lincoln memorials under consideration, McKim proposed Saint-Gaudens as a fourth member of the commission. [94] About this time, the commission also resolved the precise width of the Mall's central greensward by requesting \"the Supervising Architect of the Treasury to erect some flag poles where we could see them from the steps of the Capitol and from the Washington Monument itself. . . . We tried 250 feet, and we tried 400 feet, and we tried 300 feet, and the 300-foot space was most plainly the best.\" [95]\n\nTHE EUROPEAN TOUR: PERFECTING THE MALL When the commission, including Moore, departed for Europe on 13 June 1901 aboard the Deutschland, their goal was to refine the Mall's design and to find inspiration for its special features. Abroad, they immersed themselves in the baroque antecedents to their own thinking, mostly from the seventeenth century, with bows to ancient Rome and Haussmann's Paris. The trip had been Burnham's idea, but Olmsted had laid out the itinerary, emphasizing gardens associated with Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre. [96] From their landing at Cherbourg, France, 19 June, until their departure from Southampton, England, 26 July, the commission visited Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, Paris and environs, and London and nearby stately homes. [97] Olmsted took photographs, recording in and near Rome the Vatican gardens, Hadrian's Villa and the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, the Villa Albani, the Villa Medici, and the Villa Lante. In Paris and vicinity, they studied the Tuileries gardens, the shores of the Seine, the Luxembourg gardens, Fountainebleau, and Vaux-le-Vicomte. The last, a masterpiece of Le N\u00f4rte, received special attention. These specific places accounted for half of the 396 photographs that survive as a legacy of the trip. [98] These pictures also reveal a preoccupation with architectonic garden details at every park, estate, and villa the travelers visited: terraces, stair systems, balustrades, statuary placement, garden vistas (fig. 7). Certain aspects of the Washington problem, it is worth noting, did not preoccupy them. At no point did they study railroad stations or their siting, although Burnham did visit the Gate d'Orsay in Paris and made a personal side trip for this purpose to Frankfurt, Germany, at the behest of Cassatt [99] Nor did they explore the issues that concerned Olmsted, vis-\u00e0-vis a city-wide park system for Washington, except to study river quays in Budapest and Paris. [100] The United States, after all, already excelled in \"park-making as a national art.\" [101]\n\nParis: the Louvre and the Pont Royal\n\n\n\n\n\nParis: the octagonal basin in the Tuileries.

Perhaps McKim was again posing for Olmsted's camera Fig. 7 A selection of photographs taken by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. during the Senate Park Commission's trip to Europe in 1901. Collection: Commission of Fine Arts Recollections made years later bear out these observations. Burnham, testifying before Congress in 1904, recalled the commission studying \"every notable plantation where trees were used and an open space left between them\" and finding at Bushy Park and Hatfield House in England the most satisfying approximations for the Mall's width, 300 feet between the inner rows of trees. They had also examined \"every notable avenue in Europe\"\" before settling on four rows of trees for each side of the Mall's central greensward. [102] Similarly, Olmsted recorded in 1935 that he and McKim, en route from Budapest to Paris, had decided how to lay out plantations of elms to frame the Washington Monument terrace. [103] And Moore, whose biographies of Burnham and McKim best record the trip, recollected that at the Villa Borghese, it was agreed that the proposed Memorial Bridge would be a low structure crossing the Potomac from the west end of the Mall on axis with the Robert E. Lee mansion in Arlington Cemetery. [104] On 18 July 1901, Burnham conferred with Cassatt in London, learning that he was willing to move the train depot off the Mall, provided that the government helped to meet the costs. [105] The commission returned to the United States in high spirits, each member ready to fulfill his part of the undertaking.\n\nEACH MAN TO HIS TASK When the team disembarked at New York on 1 August Moore, by now a virtual member, immediately wrote McMillan, then at his seaside vacation home, describing the plan and, on 12 August personally briefed him for two hours. [106] \"Everything is wonderfully propitious,\" he also reported to McKim. The Senator was \"much pleased.\" In fact, he was already \"working out in his own mind a scheme for the adjustment of the Pennsylvania railroad matter.\" [107] Before the commission visited McMillan at Eagle Head on 20 August, McKim recruited William T. Partridge as head draftsman. [108] Burnham, for his part, headed back to Chicago to oversee his affairs before returning to Washington on 16 August for a tour of Rock Creek Park. [109] Olmsted returned to Brookline, Massachusetts, checked up on Curtis, who was building the models in an old pool hall in nearby Roxbury, and then made his way to Washington on 11 August to confer with Langdon. [110] Since April Langdon had been assembling baseline maps and data, exploring \"every foot of the District on foot or bicycle,\" and devising plans. And since June, he had been relaying photographs to Curtis for use in building the models. [111] On 19 August Burnham, McKim, and Olmsted reassembled for the first time since their return from Europe, inspecting Curtis' models in Boston and travelling the next day to Manchester. [112] \"On the wide veranda overlooking the sea,\" they recounted their trip to McMillan, his wife and his daughter, several neighbors, and Senator William B. Allison of Iowa. At dinner, to impress Allison, McMillan repeatedly hailed Burnham as \"General Burnham,\" Moore recalled years later, because a \"man who could persuade President Cassatt to take the Pennsylvania Railroad out of the Mall, deserves to be a general.\" [113] Moore, in his memoirs, confessed that even he did not learn until long after McMillan's death that the Senator himself had played a significant role. [114] Late that evening, after the designers had departed, McMillan lavished praise on them to Allison, and McKim, hearing of this from Moore, was delighted \"that the heavy weights of the Senate got so fired up.\" \"Things are, indeed, taking a shape which no-one would have dreamed of,\" McKim confessed. If the commission were \"allowed to perfect the scheme\" and \"present it in the best possible guise,\" he predicted, it would \"arouse the interest of Congress and the public, to a degree which we can not at present realize.\" [115] McMillan, now wholly committed, advanced $3,000 of his personal funds in mid-September to support the cash-needy Curtis; ultimately he would loan over $12,000 to insure that the models were completed. [116] Olmsted and Langdon faced the challenge of framing a system of parks and parkways for the entire Washington area. A host of issues confronted them, including boundary realignments for Rock Creek Park, the treatment of the Georgetown waterfront, and the sanitary reclamation of the Anacostia wetlands. The most controversial was the treatment of the lower Rock Creek valley between Georgetown and Washington. The Board of Trade had been promoting an open valley park to replace the refuse-choked banks of Rock Creek as it ran about a mile through a shabby, low-income, industrial area, mostly populated by African Americans. The Army Corps of Engineers had urged filling the entire valley and running its stream through a buried sewer, a proposal favored by land developers who saw the valley as an eyesore, a health menace, and a dangerous haven for drifters and blacks. [117] As Olmsted and Langdon developed the park system for the outer areas, they drew heavily on their firm's long experience with such design, especially in park-rich Boston. Between 1855 and 1881, Back Bay had been filled in, ending noisome conditions quite similar to Washington's Anacostia flats. [118] And by 1898, Boston had begun the nation's first playground system, utilizing school-based sites, an idea Olmsted would apply to Washington. [119] Finally, the State of Massachusetts, since 1893, had undertaken a vast metropolitan system of reservations for Boston, the first of its kind in the nation, emphasizing scenic and shoreline preservation and bathing beaches, all of which Olmsted Jr. ultimately adapted to Washington. [120] On 3 December 1901 McMillan and Cassatt agreed to place the B & P railroad station on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue, a block east of North Capitol Street and facing the Capitol. [121] Although Burnham lavished attention on the station and its forecourt plaza, this complex would not be featured in the many drawings made that fall to illustrate the plan, probably because it was a private commission beyond the Senate Park Commission's mandate. But to Burnham, the \"Grand Court\" to be built in front of the depot as a \"vestibule\"\" to the city was \"as important as the work around the Monument in the Mall\" and just as \"essential to the broad scheme of improvement.\" [122] Burnham also initiated a very significant component of the plan quite late in the process. On 27 November he suggested grouping legislative buildings around Capitol Square and executive buildings around Lafayette Square north of the White House. [123] In addition, McKim sent Burnham a telegram on 29 November which suggests that the Chicago firm contributed to the design of the proposed Memorial Bridge. [124] Burnham also labored over the text of the Senate Park Commission's report, even hiring a Chicago writer, but Moore eventually took charge, pleasing McKim but deeply distressing Burnham who wanted a more popular style. [125] \"I do not see how any of the matter that has been prepared can go into the report without being entirely rewritten,\" Moore confided to McKim in mid-December. \"The tone of much that I have is that of flippant criticism.\" If published, it would \"rob the Commission of the result of their very arduous and intelligent labors.\" [126] Olmsted matched Moore's clear, simple, and direct prose and the two produced the final draft, Olmsted writing the longer section relating to \"park matters\" with Moore presenting the rationale for reforming Washington's monumental core. [127] (see Appendices for Burnham's version) Well before the report appeared, in June 1902, Moore had established himself as the public voice of the Senate Park Commission, publishing \"The Improvement of Washington City\" in the February and March 1902 issues of the Century Magazine, the plan's first public description.

MCKIM: IMAGE MAKER AND DISPLAY ARTIST As the planning unfolded, McKim steadily emerged as a key figure. From August onward, he took charge of the visual representation of the redesign of central Washington. The images soon created under his direction would win widespread support for the plan and powerfully influence the City Beautiful Movement just then emerging in the United States. Another turning point occurred in August, on the 26th, when McKim conferred with Root about the Grant Memorial, standing in for Burnham, who could not be present. Seeking support for placing the Grant Memorial at the Potomac end of the Mall, McKim discovered the depth of Root's backing and the lucidity of his advice. [129] A meeting between the representatives of the two commissions that might have been adversarial resulted in a long-term liaison. Root, a man of brilliant legal talent and cosmopolitan sensibilities, made clear to McKim that he understood the multiple issues facing the Senate Park Commission, including conflicts with Army engineers. [130] Root personally accepted placement of the Grant Memorial (previously located near the White House) at the Potomac end of the Mall. In turn, he urged the Park Commission to address the Triangle slum for the sake of local business interests who wanted to see the area upgraded and to safeguard the historic stature of Pennsylvania Avenue. McKim listened. And the plan ultimately reflected Root's advice, specifying municipal structures for this locale. Root also forcefully suggested a major publicity campaign, with a simultaneous news release about the plan in key urban centers across the nation, even naming specific cities and newspapermen. [131] And something like it was soon attempted. That fall McKim lavished attention on the Mall's details, especially the Washington Monument gardens, which one acquaintance lampooned as the \"holy of holies.\" [132] About 13 October, the portion of the Curtis model devoted to the new Mall arrived from Boston and was installed on the sixth floor of McKim's offices. [133] Eventually, seventeen men, in addition to McKim and his chief draftsman Partridge, labored on the model and drawings, developing a notable esprit de corps. [134] \"The firm complained that they never saw McKim unless they went upstairs,\" Partridge recalled. [135] In late November McKim relocated the Grant Memorial from the Potomac end of the Mall to the foot of Capitol Hill, probably at the suggestion of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Although a sculptor had yet to be chosen, McKim imagined this new setting, which he called \"Union Square,\" as Washington's analogue to Place de la Concorde in Paris (pl. X). [136] This decision, endorsed by Root but not yet by the Grant Memorial Commission, led to the shifting of the Lincoln Memorial from the south end of the White House axis (now, the Jefferson memorial site) to the Potomac site, all because Grenville Dodge, chairman of the Grant Memorial Commission, had stubbornly opposed McKim's insistence that a triumphal arch be used to honor Grant at this latter site, instead of a sculptural group as mandated by Congress and favored by Dodge. [137] That the Lincoln Memorial was decided so late underscores a fundamental aspect of the story that is easily overlooked: that the Senate Park commissioners proceeded as artists, giving precedence to design over symbolic content. From the outset, they had chosen to reinstate the original Mall from the Capitol to the Monument and to make its axis their organizing principle. By June they had elaborated a general framework, projecting the original Mall westward to the Potomac, identifying the accent points along its course, and reestablishing the White House cross axis as a central focus. By the time the team returned from Europe, if not before, McKim had settled on the principle that the Capitol axis must be terminated by a unique architectural feature. In contrast to the \"arch\" of the Capitol dome and the \"pier\" or vertical line of the Monument, the western end should be closed by a flat-topped structure, or \"lintel,\" after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris or the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. [138] That the architects wanted at first to honor Grant, not Lincoln, on the Potomac site startles the modern reader. In 1901, however, the placement of the Grant Memorial was a more urgent question. As these decisions unfolded, McKim also became preoccupied with the upcoming exhibit of the models, drawings, and photographs. By late August he began urging \"the right kind of drawings and enough of them\"\u0097watercolor renderings\u0097to supplement the Curtis models. [139] McMillan, asked to countenance yet another expense, replied, says Moore, \"Go ahead, if the Government will not pay for it, I will.\" [140] Moore arranged a dinner party on 22 October for the architects to meet the trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and discuss a major exhibit. [141] Eventually a dozen illustrators and architectural renderers, including Henry Bacon and Jules Guerin, produced bird's-eye perspectives and ground-level views from multiple vantage points. [142] Olmsted compiled photographs for the exhibit as well as drawings that compared parks in six major American and European cities. [143] On 15 January 1902 the Corcoran exhibit opened, with the still unfinished Curtis models in the \"Hemicycle\" room so that visitors might walk beside them or look down on them from a raised platform. [144] On the walls and in adjoining galleries 179 illustrations offered a compelling pictorial tour of what Washington might become, supplemented by photographs of the European settings that had inspired the commission. [145] For the heart of the city, the plan proposed a vast new ceremonial core, arranged as a kite-shaped expanse bounded by the Capitol and its building group to the east, the Lincoln memorial to the west, the White House and the executive buildings clustered about Lafayette Square to the north, and a complex of recreational buildings to the south. Immediately west of the Washington Monument where the two great axes of the plan crossed lay McKim\"s elaborate sunken garden. [146] Ironically, the proposed Union Station, the key to the entire scheme, had only a shadowy presence in three overview illustrations (pls. VII, VIII, XIII). [147] For the periphery, Olmsted provided a state-of-the art park system, including a Potomac parkway link from the Mall. Less prescriptive than McKim\"s monumental core, it suggested broad treatments more than detailed and completed designs. Nothing like this exhibit had ever before been mounted in the United States: a spectacular display of a new vision for an already built city, specifying the future direction its development should take on a comprehensive basis. With the whole of Washington as its object, it captured the entire trajectory of the Senate Park Commission since March 1901: what its final report would describe as \"the treatment of the city as a work of civic art.\" [148] Visitors could attend the exhibit free of charge on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays or pay a twenty-five cent fee all other days. [149]\n\nTHE POLITICS OF THE PLAN By framing an ideal scheme, the Senate Park Commission had embraced one horn of a then insolvable political dilemma. If it had followed its original instructions to produce a \"preliminary plan,\" subject to negotiation with other Senate committees, the result, at best, would have been a politically brokered, lackluster outcome. Almost certainly, the railroad would have remained in the Mall. But opting for a perfected plan had entailed great risks, financially and politically. By mid-December 1901 the commission had already \"entirely used up the contingent fund of the Senate.\" [150] And by September 1902, when all its expenses had been accounted for, the price of its idealism had become apparent. The Curtis models alone, originally estimated at $13,000, had cost nearly $24,500. McKim had spent over $17,000, mostly for draftsmen and illustrators; Olmsted, about $4,300 on expenses and assistants; and Burnham, $1,550. Altogether, an undertaking originally estimated by McMillan publicly at $10,000 and privately at $15,000 to 20,000, had consumed almost $55,500. [151] These excesses made the commission an easy political target, giving rise to myths of its wanton, almost dissolute ways. Repeated and embellished from year to year, they would find expression in 1904 in the Chicago Chronicle. Senator McMillan, so the story ran, had believed the cost would not exceed $5,000. But the commission had \"immediately entered upon a career of extravagant expenditure that has few parallels,\" hiring a huge staff that occupied \"nearly an entire floor of the new Willard Hotel, the most expensive in Washington,\" and then sailing \"for Europe with a large and expensive retinue.\" McMillan, though a man of \"sincerity and patriotism,\" had become \"a victim of bad faith.\" Significantly, one fact in the tale was correct, or nearly so: that \"Burnham, McKim, and Olmstead [sic] contracted obligations aggregating $60,000.\" [152] This reality kept the myths alive. The only escape, politically, was to avoid head-on debate over the plan as a whole. Although the commission had assuaged local advocates of a memorial bridge, of Triangle slum redevelopment, and of Civil War fort sites, it also had made enemies, beginning with Colonel Bingham and the Army Corps of Engineers and now, potentially, those who spoke for institutions already present on the Mall, especially the Botanic Garden and the Department of Agriculture. Furthermore, any adversary could count on support from the plan's most powerful opponent, Joseph G. Cannon, of Illinois, a Congressman since 1873, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a leader of Old Guard Republicans, and, beginning in 1903, Speaker of the House. [153] In December 1901, well before this line-up of forces had become fully visible, Glenn Brown, working with Robert S. Peabody, president of the AIA, began to advocate a permanent art commission to enforce the plan, enlisting McKim and activating the Public Art League (PAL). With the Senate Park Commission about to complete its work, Brown feared that Congress might assign its implementation to \"the Commissioner of Public Buildings, an army engineer, or may place it under . . . the Chief Engineer of the Army.\" [154] Significantly, the first full-dress discussion of this proposal took place in New York, then the center of public art advocacy in the United States. On 16 December, at the office of architect George B. Post, McKim, together with Richard Watson Gilder, editor of Century Magazine, and Saint-Gaudens\u0097both of them PAL officers\u0097and Frederick Crowninshield, president of the Fine Arts Federation of New York, decided to defer to the judgment of Senator McMillan, as conveyed by Moore in a letter sent to McKim for use at the meeting. [155] Although McMillan nine months earlier had foreseen the need for a permanent commission, the politics of the plan now looked very different. [156] Noting the poor shape of District finances and \"a disposition in some quarters . . . to criticize the cost of your present plans,\" Moore, speaking for McMillan, thought it \"unwise to give jealous and disgruntled people an opportunity at this time to say that the architects propose to run the country and shut out all others.\" McMillan was dealing with \"500 individuals from all parts of the country\"\" with diverse opinions. \"The only thing to do is to overcome them in an easy fashion that will leave no bad blood....\" [157] In short, the backers of the plan should offer no easy targets, especially measures that might jeopardize the entire effort. When Peabody revisited the issue in mid-March 1902, Moore again delivered McMillan's verdict through McKim. \"Any movement at this time to secure a permanent Commission will be bad policy.... The present situation can not be improved, and may be seriously impaired by the proposed legislation.\" [158] Only a gradualist approach offered an escape from the dilemma, keeping the plan alive by advancing it piecemeal. For McMillan, this meant pushing his Union Station bill, which he regarded \"as the foundation of all the work.\" [159] Once that was settled, then he would consider a permanent commission, he told Moore in April. [160] Because the railroad in the Mall had long been recognized as a mistake, the Senator got his bill through the Senate by 15 May 1902, shortly before Congress adjourned. [161] Then, unexpectedly, Senator McMillan died, 10 August, while at his vacation home in Massachusetts. Suddenly, the political mainspring of the plan was gone. In shock and grief, Olmsted wrote to Moore from Paris, where he had been studying European zoos. \"I fell at once to wondering, fearfully, how seriously his irreplaceable loss would set back the movement upon which we have all come to set our hearts,\" he confessed. [162] McKim and Burnham, with Moore, joined the McMillan family in Detroit. Moore, his patron now dead and his career disrupted, would return to Washington, at the family's request, to settle the Senator's affairs and to shepherd the Union Station bill through Congress, almost as a memorial. [163] On 4 December the House District Committee approved the bill; on 28 February 1903, Congress enacted it. [164] By 16 March Moore had left the capital for new employment in the far northern reaches of Michigan, at Sault Sainte Marie. [165] With his departure, the plan stood exposed to its enemies as never before. New political tactics would be needed if anything more than a new railroad station was to be its outcome.\n\nTHE CITY BEAUTIFUL AND THE SENATE PARK COMMISSION PLAN To its good fortune, the Senate Park Commission plan coincided with the emergence of the City Beautiful Movement in the United States, quickly becoming one of its icons. Absent this development, the new vision of the Mall set forth in 1902 might never have been carried out. As a cause, the City Beautiful championed town and city beauty, drawing its support from the same native-born, business and professional groups that had been energizing municipal reform in efforts in the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Coast since the mid-1890s. What had begun with local calls for efficient and honest governance in opposition toward bosses and venal business interests, had blossomed by 1900 into a multifaceted campaign to address the city itself as the critical arena of national life. To many reformers, the forces then wrenching the nation and its cities\u0097immigration, industrialization, ever-larger transit and railroad empires, big business mergers, and transformative technologies, such as electricity\u0097necessitated the fashioning of a new civic order, to be achieved through a revitalized sense of citizenship or what many called a new civic consciousness. The City Beautiful, as one expression of this ethos, became something of a crusade as the twentieth century opened. [166] As a movement, the City Beautiful wove together many threads of American aesthetic culture. The oldest of these, \"village improvement,\" dated back to the mid-nineteenth century ideas of Andrew Jackson Downing about the upgrading of often bleak country towns and villages. By 1900, as \"civic improvement,\" it had spread across the nation. Its activists, often women, demanded clean streets, tidy waterfronts, garbage incineration, municipal flower beds, public libraries, street trees, indeed almost anything that would make an ordinary place more visibly appealing. [167] A second thread involved \"outdoor art,\" namely the naturalistic values that had been pushed forward by the movement for scenic urban parks, beginning with Central Park in New York before the Civil War and, after the war, exemplified by the city park system idea in Buffalo and Chicago by the late 1860s, in Boston and Minneapolis by the 1880s, and in Kansas City and Louisville by the 1890s, and culminating with the vast metropolitan system of Boston begun in the 1890s [168] A more recent and more cosmopolitan thread, then called municipal art, had emerged among the New York artists and architects who had helped design and execute the Chicago World's Fair. The Chicago spectacle, they hoped, just might persuade city officials to make greater use of murals, statuary, artistic street fixtures, and other embellishments in public places. More profoundly, they sought to turn the post-Civil War pursuit of art and culture, which had long been the preserve of the rich and wealthy, toward the adornment of the public realm. From their vantage, the Chicago World's Fair had represented a breakthrough for public art, with its great Court-of-Honor basin, framed by white, classic buildings and adorned throughout with lavish outdoor sculptural and mural displays (fig. 8). [169] After the fair, a devastating economic depression had thwarted the impulse to translate this model into the fabric of real cities until the return of prosperity, about 1897. Fig. 8 Court of Honor, Chicago Fair of 1893. Commission of Fine Arts As the new century dawned, the City Beautiful, just then coalescing as a national movement, favored piecemeal undertakings, not citywide planning. For example, the National League of Improvement Associations, founded in October 1900 in Springfield, Ohio, promoted virtually any action that would physically upgrade a town or small city. A year later, it renamed itself the American League for Civic Improvement, reflecting the new civic reform ethos. Yet another body, the American Park and Outdoor Art Association, begun in 1897, voiced the landscape-art tradition. [170] It groped at first for ways to uphold its values. One became the promotion of children's gardens; another was opposition to outdoor advertising. Meanwhile, municipal art societies in Cincinnati, Chicago, and Baltimore\u0097all following New York's lead and emboldened by the new prosperity\u0097together with various art and architectural organizations, envisioned bigger and ever more daring projects: a lakefront park in Chicago, a radial boulevard in Philadelphia, a public building group in Cleveland. That all these efforts comprised a national movement first became apparent in the writings of Charles Mulford Robinson, a Rochester, New York newspaperman and magazine columnist. In 1901 he published The Improvement of Towns and Cities, soon dubbed \"the bible of the believers in the city beautiful.\" [171] In it, he brought all threads of beautification effort together. Issued by a skeptical publisher who forced Robinson to bear the cost, it sold immediately and well, going through eleven reprints by 1916. [172] In fact, the diverse organizations which Robinson upheld as parts of a common cause were just then exploding in number, rising from about 300 \"improvement\" groups in 1901, to over 700 by 1902, to 1,740 in 1904, and reaching 2,426 in 1905. In these same years, the popular Chautauqua movement added its support as did great numbers of women's clubs, whose 300,000 members were organized through the General Federation of Women's Clubs. [173] Robinson had written his book as a manual for all these groups. Its success elevated him to the top ranks of the national organizations then promoting civic beautification. Precisely as this \"great civic awakening,\" as its advocates called it, gathered momentum, the Senate Park Commission displayed its spectacular plan for the national capital at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, knowing that its fate hinged directly on its public reception. [174] On 15 January, with the finest photographs, the most artful renderings, the best possible display of the three-dimensional Curtis models, and maximum press coverage\u0097locally and nationally\u0097all arranged, President Roosevelt and his party and, soon thereafter, key members of Congress and the commissioners of the District of Columbia toured the displays. Knowingly or not, they commenced a publicity blitz intended to place the future of Washington squarely on the nation's public agenda. [175] Although the Senate Park Commission had risked everything on a perfected scheme and Senator McMillan had been won over to this course, neither he nor his experts could have known that their idealism almost perfectly suited the mood underlying the City Beautiful. Fortunately for the plan, it cleared its first hurdle. The president, his cabinet, the congressmen, and the District commissioners liked what they saw. [176] Then in February, March, and April and with reduced frequency for the rest of the year, the national magazine press lavished attention on the scheme. Key journals of polite opinion and genteel culture\u0097Harper's Weekly, Outlook, and Century Magazine, all of them esteemed by the nation's reform-minded groups\u0097paid immediate heed. [177] Others, less prestigious and more specialized also offered major coverage, virtually guaranteeing the attention of the college-educated middle class throughout the nation. [178] Without exception, all of these accounts highlighted the spectacular aspects, especially the new Mall with its promised grandeur and patriotic appeal. Meanwhile, the architectural profession, proud of its role in generating the plan, inundated its members with reports. Every one of its major publications and nearly every minor one provided detailed, authoritative coverage, sufficient to prime the rank and file for proselytizing interested laymen. [179] In addition, a lantern-slide lecture circulated, reaching about twenty cities by year's end. Daniel Burnham, Charles Moore, Frederick Law Olmsted, as well as William Partridge and Glenn Brown, all spoke to select groups in different cities. [180] As one Boston architect remarked of the plans after the first year of publicity, \"almost everybody who reads only as he runs knows something about them.\" [181] Many writers and editors instantly grasped the national significance of the Senate Park Commission plan. \"We have the same opportunities here,\" said the Inland Architect of Chicago, upholding Washington \"as an example for municipal improvement.\" [182] \"What a tantalizing prospect this must be for an artistically sensitive New Yorker!\" enthused the New York Times, urging that a \"board of experts\" be appointed to study \"the general treatment of New York.\" [183] \"The good work planned for the capital city,\" said the editors of Century Magazine, prophetically, \"will give impetus to the advancing tide of civic improvement now passing over the United States.\" \"The more these plans and pictures are studied,\" they added, \"the more thorough, the more significant, the nobler, do they seem.\" [184] Big-city art organizations swung into action, nowhere more swiftly than in New York where much of the actual preparatory work for the Senate Park Commission plan had taken place, especially for the design of the Mall. [185] Thus, only a few weeks into the publicity blitz, the Fine Arts Federation, speaking for the city's\u0097and the nation's\u0097artistic establishment, petitioned reform Mayor Seth Low, requesting that the Municipal Art Commission determine \"the advisability of employing a commission of distinguished experts, as was done recently by Congress for the city of Washington.\" [186] Soon, the Municipal Art Society endorsed the effort, set up its own City Plan committee, and took charge of the campaign. [187] Efforts were even made to enlist McKim as the planner, to no avail. [188] Other art centers began to stir. In Cincinnati, the Municipal Art Society arranged for a lecture on the Washington plan. [189] Similarly, the Boston Society of Architects discussed comprehensive planning for their city. \"Somebody that knows has got to show the way to the City Beautiful,\" the principal speaker asserted. \"The architects are of the cognoscenti; if they can not, no one can.\" [190] And in Chicago, the Municipal Art League by early 1903 foresaw \"the necessity of the appointment of a similar commission . . . to offer a comprehensive plan for developing the natural advantages of Chicago.\" [191] Charles Mulford Robinson, the master scrivener of the City Beautiful, caught the shift perfectly. In 1902 he was drafting his second major work, Modern Civic Art or the City Made Beautiful, to be issued in 1903. Recognizing the limitations of piecemeal action, he now recast his approach, concluding that \"in an effort for civic improvement...the first step is to secure a comprehensive plan\" and pointing to Washington. \"Unless there be a well thought out, artistically conceived, general plan to work on,\" he emphasized, \"our civic art will go astray, with lack of completeness or continuity.\" [192] This embrace of the larger planning idea embedded in the Senate Park Commission plan soon yielded results. The prosperity and optimism of the nation at the opening of the new century and the proliferation of ambitious public works proposals and projects in many cities, together with the pursuit of beauty as a public value, had created a receptive climate for big ideas. By 1904 to 1905 New York, San Francisco, and Detroit were seeking expert advice on physical development. By 1909 over thirty-five cities in the United States had obtained comprehensive plans, some quite bold and elaborate such as Daniel H. Burnham's Plan of Chicago, issued in 1909, and others more modest, such as the many schemes devised by Charles Mulford Robinson. All of these reports, including those of such landscape architects as John Nolen and Frederick Law Olmsted, characteristically had one trait in common: they adhered to the Senate Park Commission plan idea of combining both suggestions for public building groups, usually in the form of civic centers, with proposals for parks and park systems. In bigger cities, a union railroad station often figured in the scheme. [193] A national pattern had been set. The many organizations and enthusiasts who embraced city planning as the best vehicle for fulfilling the goals of the City Beautiful also became a resource for defending the Senate Park Commission plan itself, especially during the critical battle fought in early 1904 over the placement of the Department of Agriculture's proposed new building in the Mall, a struggle detailed elsewhere in this volume. Had this structure been built as originally intended, the commission's vision of the Mall and ultimately its overall plan would have suffered irreparable defeat. Worth noting here is the fact that in late February and early March 1904, even as Olmsted despaired that \"the matter has been settled against us,\" he and others summoned every scrap of support from around the country. Glenn Brown, as AIA secretary, prepared and sent out thousands of circulars alerting AIA chapters and art organizations. [194] Olmsted himself enlisted Charles Eliot, president of Harvard, to write to Joseph Cannon. [195] He also worked with Boston-area architects to contact Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and wrote to his House representative, Samuel Powers, who defended the architects and the plan in a House speech in early March. [196] In addition, Olmsted fed information to the Boston Herald and Boston Transcript, to Senator Francis G. Newlands, and to Charles Mulford Robinson, who had caught wind of what was afoot. [197] The defenders at first did not know their own strength, having never fought such a national battle before. Moore, by then based in Detroit and eager to reenter the fray, had by 7 March enlisted William McMillan, the deceased Senator's brother, to appeal to all Michigan congressmen in behalf of the plan. \"I believe that the plans have got enough popular support by this time to bring about the right result if we can only bring the sentiment to bear,\" he told McKim [198] The American Park and Outdoor Art Association, though crippled by an office fire in Rochester at this time, became a resource, thanks to Robinson, its secretary, and to Warren Manning, a Boston-area landscape architect with strong ties to Olmsted. [199] Had there been no prior publicity blitz for the plan in 1902 and no City Beautiful Movement already alert to its significance, these appeals for support might have been far less successful. But on short notice, a lot could be done. For example, in Philadelphia, Charles Mulford Robinson, on 18 March, alerted Andrew Crawford Wright, an ardent civic reformer and experienced park promoter, who in turn summoned twenty representatives of local art and architectural groups. Meeting at the office of AIA architect Edgar Seeler, architect Frank Miles Day explained the situation and, together, they all agreed to contact local congressmen as well as place articles in the press. [200] The effect of such efforts is suggested by the experience of Massachusetts Congressman Powers who later told Olmsted that his speech defending the plan had brought forth \"more letters and inquiries and seemed, to his surprise, to rouse a more widespread interest in the country than any speech he had ever made.\" [201] In essence, the Senate Park Commission plan through the City Beautiful Movement was reflected back upon itself, helping to authenticate the case being made for its survival in Washington. Through such processes, the Senate Park Commission plan became more than a paper scheme: it became a new vision deeply expressive of what was possible for the capital and the nation.

Pelz, and George O. Totten, which were published later with the evening-session papers. Landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., who spoke that evening, scorned the then existing Mall with its \"wiggling road and confused informal planting,\" favoring its treatment as a broad corridor of turf as suggested by the Tapis Vert at Versailles, to be flanked in Washington by \"masses of foliage and architecture and shaded drives.\" Olmsted Jr., who became a member of the Senate Park (McMillan) Commission, later strongly influenced its thinking on this crucial feature. Only Paul J. Pelz, a local architect, wanted to preserve the Mall as series of picturesque gardens. Ibid., 3, 30.

The presence of the Board of Trade is inferred from the fact that it voted the very next day to adopt the policies set 13 December. See Cox, \"Action of the Board of Trade,\" 17.
