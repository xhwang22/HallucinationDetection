The A-League club which made such an impression on new consultant Harry Redknapp he could not quite recall their name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the South Coast Mariners \u2026 they asked me if I would do a bit as an advisor,\u201d the English manager told talkSPORT radio in May 2016. The Mariners had just claimed the wooden spoon, finishing 12 points adrift and with a total three wins and 13 points from 27 games.\n\nExecutive vice chairman Peter Storrie, one of Redknapp\u2019s former West Ham colleagues, had done the wooing and chief executive Mike Charlesworth expected him to visit the Central Coast at least twice during the season and possibly also in the off-season. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Redknapp said. \u201cI won\u2019t be going. It\u2019s a long way \u2013 30-odd hours on a plane.\u201d\n\nHow about those Mariners? The team which used to do so much with so little but had slipped into comedic areas and reached the peak of peak A-League. How about the 70 goals conceded in 2015-16 under Tony Walmsley, an unenviable record that got him the sack?\n\nHow about the 4-1 loss to Perth Glory on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2018 remembered not for the unfortunate scoreline but the image of two portable training goals being wheeled onto the field after a goal post on one of the originals snapped mid-match?\n\nHow about Usain Bolt, the champion sprinter with the first touch of a trampoline who came but did not conquer? How about the home defeat to Wellington Phoenix that ended with an 8-2 scoreline and another sacked coach in Mike Mulvey?\n\nNow there is none of that. Gone is the drama and the farce and the toy rifles smuggled into stadiums by small children. In its place, finally, is some football. This season, under Alen Stajcic, is the first time the Mariners have back-to-back league wins since December 2017. It is their best start since their title-winning campaign of 2013-14 of the Graham Arnold era. Five wins and two losses from the opening seven games seems scarcely fathomable, their 15 points to date utterly incongruous with those 13 gleaned from entire season some five years ago.\n\nEach week, A-League observers with a keen sense of history wait for it all to come crashing down, for natural order to resume. Except that it does not, and the football keeps coming. There is still the small matter of the club\u2019s perennially imminent sale the still-empty promise of a budget big enough to climb up off the salary cap\u2019s floor.\n\nStill, how about 19-year-old Alou Kuol, whose mere presence on the field makes magic happen, and whose brace off the bench against Western United on Sunday \u2013 his fourth and fifth goals from seven outings this season \u2013 won the game 3-2 and restored the Mariners\u2019 spot at the top of the table, and whose name is now talked about as an Olyroos candidate for the Olympics?\n\nHow about Danny De Silva\u2019s return to form, and the energy of Josh Nisbet, Jordan Smylie and Daniel Bouman? That tired \u201cgive youth a chance\u201d refrain so often trotted out when money is tight, recruitment poor and injuries plentiful has suddenly taken on a prettier hue.\n\nAnd what about Matt Simon doing things the way he used to back when the club\u2019s winning culture made for premierships, championships and regular finals appearances. He has always been the serial pest opponents love to hate and hate to love, only the Wizard of Woy Woy of 2021 is producing his special kind of sorcery surrounded by some other magic. Last week the club talisman marked his 200th appearance with an assist and penalty goal to help Central Coast to a 3-2 comeback win over Melbourne City. He was chaired off the field by teammates, then cried as he embraced his young daughter, who was born prematurely and to whom he dedicated his display. Days later the 35-year-old opened the scoring against Western United to lay the foundations on which Kuol would build.\n\nAccording to United coach Mark Rudan, Stajcic is actually the resident practitioner of the paranormal. \u201cHe\u2019s a magician as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 he\u2019s turned the place around again,\u201d Rudan said before his side\u2019s loss. \u201cIt\u2019s funny [the media] mentioned [the Mariners are] walking on water because right now you\u2019d think Alen Stajcic is Jesus, because he\u2019s done a fantastic job with them. We all know the fantastic job that he did with the Matildas as well.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Stajcic himself was more pragmatic. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic, the magic is hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you put the hard work in sometimes you get rewarded, and we\u2019re in a moment now where the hard work we put in over the pre-season is paying off. The best part is it\u2019s instilled some belief and confidence.\u201d\n\nNothing to write home about, in other words. No slapstick or circuses, just football."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2960892/2021/11/17/thats-just-him-why-blackhawks-interim-head-coach-derek-king-is-wearing-the-right-hat-at-the-right-time/", "page_content": "The Derek King you\u2019ve seen as Chicago Blackhawks interim head coach is the one nearly everyone who\u2019s known him talks about.\n\nThey mention his quick wit \u2014 like when King, standing at a lectern instead of sitting at a table after his first practice with the Blackhawks, remarked, \u201cOne win and I\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis son D.J. King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://mens.nplnsw.com.au/2022/05/07/luke-wilkshire-appointed-central-coast-mariners-head-of-youth-development/", "page_content": "National Premier Leagues NSW Men\u2019s side Wollongong Wolves have announced the departure of their head coach former Socceroo Luke Wilkshire who has accepted a role with the Central Coast Mariners for the next two A-League seasons kicking off next year.\n\nWilkshire will remain head coach of the Wolves for the duration of the 2022 NPL NSW Men\u2019s season before commencing his new role with the Mariners.\n\n\u201cBecoming a coach and a manager wasn\u2019t something I aspired to do,\u201d Wilkshire said.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Wolves gave me an opportunity and it\u2019s something I will always be grateful for.\n\n\u201cTory Lavalle, and everyone of influence at the club have been fantastic.

It was an optional skate at the Honda Center in Anaheim, and Arvid S\u00f6derblom \u2014 the only goaltender who took the ice \u2014 already was back in the locker room, so the Blackhawks were using a very basic \u201cshooter tutor,\u201d a simple mesh net that filled up most of the goal, with small openings along the top shelf, two more below where the goalie\u2019s glove and blocker would be, and a five-hole slot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blackhawks \u2014 well, the third- and fourth-liners who didn\u2019t choose to take the option that afternoon \u2014 kept drawing iron or hitting the net. They were making this thing look like Tony Esposito. So King \u2014 a 40-goal scorer 30 years ago \u2014 called for the puck himself, and promptly tucked it into the top-left corner on the first try. The players cheered, and King smiled broadly as he swung around the net, very much in his element.\n\nThis is what King likes doing best \u2014 working with players, teaching and actually coaching. And this is what he didn\u2019t do enough of last season. There was always somewhere else to be, something else to do, someone else to talk to.\n\n\u201cYou look at Luke (Richardson) and he\u2019s doing a good job of it \u2014 he\u2019s coaching, right?\u201d King said following that practice last Friday. \u201cI kind of got away from that last year. I had to do media, or I had to be here, or I\u2019m about to be there, I have to put out fires, I have to get ready and everything. I managed my time maybe not as good as I should have.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that King didn\u2019t enjoy his stint as the Blackhawks\u2019 interim head coach following Jeremy Colliton\u2019s firing in early November last season. Nor is it to say King isn\u2019t proud of the work he did in taking over a moribund team at arguably the nadir of franchise history and almost singlehandedly flipping the vibe around while turning it into a competitive squad. Nor does it mean King didn\u2019t want to keep the job. He very much wanted to keep the job.\n\nBut this is where he\u2019s happiest. This is where he\u2019s doing the most good. This is where he belongs. The title is almost irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps no one else in the league would have accepted an assistant coaching job with the same team for which he was just the head coach.\n\nDerek King. (Bill Smith / NHL I via Getty Images)\n\nBut perhaps no one in the league is quite like Derek King. He\u2019s an anomaly in the NHL. There\u2019s no ego there, no chip on his shoulder, no sneering defiance burning within. Even as head coach, as the voice of the team, there was no spin, no polish, no false veneer to hide behind. He is exactly what he looks like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what he looks like is a guy who\u2019s really enjoying himself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people have said to me \u2014 \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d King said. \u201cThey think I should be like, \u2018Screw you! You don\u2019t think I can coach?\u2019 But that has nothing to do with it. They feel I can help and they wanted to keep me on. And why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nReally, there are plenty of reasons why he wouldn\u2019t. For one, yeah, it\u2019s hard not to be at least a little insulted when a team picks someone else to take your job \u2014 general manager Kyle Davidson gave King \u201cthe old we\u2019re going in a different direction speech,\u201d King said. For another, just about every assistant coach in the league harbors dreams of becoming a head coach in the NHL, King included. And the chances of a demoted former interim coach becoming the head coach of that same team seem awfully slim. Especially when the new coach is just starting a four-year contract and has the kind of long leash that only comes with an openly declared rebuild. Surely, the path back to bench boss would be more navigable as an assistant on another NHL team. Then there\u2019s the ego hit that comes with walking into the same room with the same players as an assistant coach after being the top guy for nearly a full season.\n\nKing shrugged all of that off.\n\n\u201cHaving the opportunity to stay with the organization and be a part of this rebuild, I didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d King said. \u201cThis is where I started right? This is what I was. I was the assistant coach. I did skills after practice, I worked with guys individually, I got into the video and stuff. So now I\u2019m back doing all that, and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I missed it.\u201d\n\nDavidson knew King was wired differently than most coaches, and he knew he wanted him back on staff. But ultimately, he wasn\u2019t sure King \u2014 or Richardson \u2014 would be comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even really our call,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe said to Luke, \u2018You know what, your staff is your business. But this guy is a great guy, and he\u2019s got a great way with players, and I think he could be a really good counterpoint. But you\u2019ve got to talk to him and you\u2019ve got to feel the same way.\u2019\u201d\n\nRichardson didn\u2019t need much prodding. The two played against each other in the Ontario Hockey League, both broke into the NHL at the same time in 1987-88, had long and successful NHL careers (21 years for Richardson, 13 for King), and then coached against each other in the American Hockey League. They respected each other well enough that Richardson didn\u2019t even need to get mutual buddy Dallas Eakins\u2019 blessing before offering him the job.\n\nFacing both reality and a long-term rebuild, Richardson wanted to build a more modern coaching staff to suit today\u2019s young players \u2014 one built on hands-on teaching and open communication, not fire and brimstone. King fit the mold perfectly, and his knowledge of most of the roster from his time in Chicago and as Rockford\u2019s head coach made it an easy call.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have a personality as a coaching staff that we can teach and not be yelling and screaming and demanding things that are unachievable at this moment,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWe wanted to build and teach and learn and work well together and have a calmer demeanor doing that, so we can get that point across. After a while, players just tune that out if you\u2019re always yelling and screaming. And so I thought it was a good fit. I think it\u2019s working out really well.\u201d\n\nWhen Davidson had settled on Richardson and had given King the \u201cdifferent direction\u201d spiel, King asked about his contract. Davidson, hoping that Richardson would indeed want King on his staff, told King not to worry about that just yet, because Richardson was likely to call.\n\nKing spent a couple of days mulling the offer with his wife and three sons. But deep down, he knew what his answer was going to be the moment Richardson made the offer.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d King said. \u201cAnd plus, I didn\u2019t have to update my resume and chum it out and make phone calls. I\u2019ve been through that. The fact that he wanted me and management still wanted me, I thought, well, that\u2019s a good thing, right? That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Davidson got to essentially hire a coach he really liked, fire a coach he really liked, yet somehow keep both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely surprised (King accepted the job) because he has no ego,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd I think he genuinely loves being part of the organization, he liked how we do things and how we operate. It\u2019s a testament to the person that he is and the lack of ego that he has that he was willing to do it. He saw that it was a good situation with a good head coach and he could still be involved at the NHL level and really help us push this thing forward. So yes and no. I was a little surprised, but I was relieved that he wanted to stay.\u201d\n\nAnd hey, King might have been demoted, but he got a new three-year contract out of it \u2014 and a raise.\n\n\u201cPretty good deal,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nAssistants are critical to running a successful team \u2014 working on individual skills, running special-teams meetings, cleaning up messes and soothing bruised egos left by the head coach. But unlike coordinators in football, they operate out of the limelight. So assuming his five months as interim coach were his last as head coach of the Blackhawks, King is likely to go down as a mere footnote in franchise history.\n\nBut what he accomplished in those five months shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\n\nKing arrived from Rockford on a Saturday morning in November to take over a team that entered the season with playoff hopes but started 1-9-2, that had just played one of the worst games imaginable in a pathetic 5-1 loss in Winnipeg, just 11 days after the Jenner & Block report laid bare all the franchise\u2019s sins in one of the darkest days in franchise history.\n\nInto a sullen and embittered locker room walked this soft-spoken, self-deprecating, folksy guy with wacky uncle energy, an arsenal of dad jokes and zero NHL coaching experience. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mood changed dramatically. Instantly. The Blackhawks won their first four games under King. Players started having fun again. They never had a chance of sniffing contention after that horrid start, but King managed to salvage the season to an unlikely degree. He convinced his players to loosen up a bit out there. He reinforced his mantra of \u201chabits protect you,\u201d constantly reminding players that if they have good habits on the ice, their mistakes will be minimal and minimized. He tweaked the way the Blackhawks played in the neutral zone and the defensive zone. He was critical when necessary, but encouraging always. He was unceasingly honest, even when it meant being harsh \u2014 whether he was talking to a player one-on-one or in a press conference.\n\nHe might not have been the biggest Xs and Os guy, but he fundamentally changed the team all the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just his personality,\u201d said Reese Johnson, who played for King in Rockford and Chicago. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes him a good coach and gives him a good relationship with the players. He knows when to be critical and he knows when to keep you going. He has good balance. I think Kinger did an unbelievable job going from head coach in Rockford to head coach in Chicago, and now to assistant coach. The one that thing stands out to me the most is throughout those years, he\u2019s just always been himself. He really hasn\u2019t changed throughout his roles.\u201d\n\nKing behind the bench during the 2021-22 season. (Steph Chambers / Getty Images)\n\nBut King had been thrown straight into the deep end, and really, he was just trying to keep his head above water. As head coach in Rockford, he basically managed a staff of one and only had to answer to the local PR guy and Rockford GM Mark Bernard. His job was to develop players; everything else was secondary, even winning. In Chicago, in his own words, \u201cEverybody\u2019s watching, and everybody\u2019s judging.\u201d\n\nSo he leaned on assistant coach and former head coach Marc Crawford \u2014 the only holdover from Colliton\u2019s staff \u2014 to handle much of the job. Crawford often ran practices. Crawford handled a lot of the Xs and Os. Crawford even chose King\u2019s second assistant coach, Rob Cookson, because King didn\u2019t really know anybody around the league. The hours got away from him, he wasn\u2019t getting his own workouts in the way he\u2019d like, and the commute to see his family back in Rockford took a toll on him (and on his wife, who was often dealing with the three boys while King stayed in a place he had in Chicago).\n\nKing loved every second of it. But he felt every second of it, too.\n\n\u201cIt was tiring,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking back on it, King can see what he did right and what he could have done better, how he could have made things easier on himself and had a better work-life balance. But he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call them regrets. He knows the challenge he faced, and how improbable (if modest) his success was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of it, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I change things? Sure, I would, knowing what I know now. That\u2019s natural. But going into it, I felt I did what I needed to do, and what I felt was the right thing. So I sleep at night.\u201d\n\nAs that practice in Anaheim wound down, King was one of the last guys off the ice, lingering to work on some skills work with the stragglers. Richardson had long left; the press was waiting, and there were probably a dozen other things he had to handle before heading back to the hotel. It\u2019s Richardson who has to tell guys that they\u2019ll be scratched or sent to Rockford. It\u2019s Richardson who has to delegate assignments to his staff. It\u2019s Richardson who has to meet with Davidson to discuss the depth chart. It\u2019s Richardson who has to sit down with team leaders and get the pulse of the room. It\u2019s Richardson who has to handle the surprisingly sprawling bureaucracy of running an NHL locker room.\n\nIt used to be King who did all that. But now King gets to be the good cop, bucking a player up after the head coach has to break him down a bit. Now King gets to have the time to sit down with a player one-on-one to go over the little details of a botched power play, or to reinforce the habits of a good penalty kill. Now King gets to linger on the ice and fire off one-timers.\n\nIt\u2019s all a little less difficult this season for King. He moved his family to the western suburb of Glen Ellyn; his kids love the high school and his twins play hockey at Johnny\u2019s IceHouse West, just a few blocks from the United Center. He\u2019s found that work-life balance that he never managed last season, not after suddenly being thrust into someone else\u2019s burning house and handed a watering can.\n\n\u201cThe hours are still there, but it\u2019s maybe not quite as stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I need to do, how I can help. I ask (Richardson) what he needs. I come in the morning, do my stuff, leave and go home. It\u2019s been great. I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d\n\nWould King love to be the Blackhawks\u2019 head coach? Of course, he would. Does he think he deserved the job? Of course, he does. Will he try to become a head coach in the NHL again? Of course, he will. But while most coaches wouldn\u2019t be caught dead accepting a demotion and would instead defiantly storm off into the unknown in search of another job, King isn\u2019t like most coaches.\n\nHe was offered a job in the NHL. In an organization he knew well. With a roster full of players he cared about. To work for a coach he respected and liked. To do what he loves best \u2014 to teach, to grind, to coach.\n\nAnd what\u2019s so bad about that?\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Rockford, I never even thought about (an NHL job),\u201d King said. \u201cBut once I got it and I got comfortable and it was the end of the year, I\u2019m like, \u2018This ain\u2019t a bad gig.\u2019 So whether it\u2019s as a head guy or as an assistant, it\u2019s the NHL. It\u2019s pretty nice. It\u2019s been great this year, it honestly has. I can\u2019t think of one negative thing about it.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Derek King: John J.

With new management after the firing of many executives in connection with the Kyle Beach cover up, new general manager Kyle Davidson made the call: on November 6, 2021 Derek King became the 39th head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nSince his hiring, the Blackhawks have shown responsiveness to the change. After starting with one win, nine losses, and two overtime losses (1-9-2) under Colliton, the Blackhawks have earned nine wins in their first 14 games with King. What changed?\n\nSome fans say the team began to develop an identity. Others say that the change lit a fire under them. But the results show.\n\nAgainst the St. Louis Blues, the Hawks went down 2-0 after the first period. Earlier in the season, games similar to this one had gotten away quickly from the team. The team went down two goals to the Carolina Hurricanes after the first period on Oct. 29, and the team had no response. In the next two periods, the Blackhawks scored three consecutive goals, including the game winner in overtime.\n\nFans noted this as evidence of change in identity. Broadcasters have noticed the shift after King\u2019s promotion as well. An announcer for the team since 1981, Pat Foley noted that no team in his time has been as physical as this year. It\u2019s showing in the stats; the team is tied for the lead in hits as of Dec. 10. Most Blackhawks teams have been near the bottom of this list."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3215678/2022/03/29/is-derek-king-right-coach-for-blackhawks-after-this-season-his-response-to-disappointing-loss-to-sabres-might-be-sign/", "page_content": "There were no jokes.\n\nThere were no one-liners.\n\nThere was no playfulness.\n\nThere was just plain-faced honesty from Blackhawks interim coach Derek King. It\u2019s what the situation called for. Anything else would have seemed wrong.\n\nThe Blackhawks had just surrendered their second consecutive sizable lead \u2014 this time losing to the Buffalo Sabres 6-5 on Monday after once leading 4-0 \u2014 and King wasn\u2019t about to sugarcoat what happened. What he saw was unacceptable and he said as much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe stopped playing the game the right way,\u201d King said. \u201cWe just decided to just go and do what they felt like they wanted to do. Didn\u2019t do anything we asked them to do. First period they did. They played the game the right way. Second period, nothing. Third period, eh, they kind of threw some flashes. It\u2019s like putting lipstick on, right? Clean it up a little bit. Make it look good. Not good enough.\u201d\n\nIt was just the tip of his honesty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking when they decide they\u2019re going to turn pucks over or they\u2019re sniffing blood or sniffing points and they think they\u2019re good enough to play that way,\u201d King said. \u201cThey\u2019re not. There\u2019s a few guys that can turn it on and take some chances and make some things happen, but the rest of them, they need to play a certain way to survive, to play in this league on a consistent basis. And when those guys start turning pucks over and not checking and missing assignments and stuff, then we\u2019re in trouble and that\u2019s what happened tonight. We got in trouble that way.\u201d\n\nWe all have seen the happy-go-lucky side of King. His humor, positive attitude and continual encouragement were what the Blackhawks needed when he was made interim coach in place of Jeremy Colliton. The Blackhawks were lost in a dark, dark cloud and King was the perfect coach to help them find a way out of it. He altered the mood and then the play of the Blackhawks.\n\nNow, as the Blackhawks enter a new phase, one of rebuilding for the future, the question is whether King is the right head coach to guide them through that as well. It\u2019s likely the near future will require someone who can keep things light and keep the focus on development and getting better. But it also probably could use someone who can hold players accountable while helping them through their mistakes. There has to be a balance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing has shown signs this season he has that in him, but he especially demonstrated that mentality after Monday\u2019s loss. His words exactly matched the result.\n\n\u201cVery surprised, disappointed, and they should be disappointed,\u201d King said of the collapse. \u201cSo we\u2019ll find out come next game how disappointed they really are about losing a game like that.\u201d\n\nSince the trade deadline, King and his players have talked a lot about creating an identity for the Blackhawks. They all understand where the team and organization are, but they also realize for them to ever get somewhere better, things have to change on and off the ice. Squandering a 3-0 lead Saturday and then an even bigger one Monday is the complete opposite of what King is trying to create. It\u2019s why he won\u2019t let what he saw Monday slide.\n\n\u201cOur identity as a team, the culture, what we value as a team or as individuals, this is stuff we have to build on for next year and we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d King said. \u201cWe\u2019re close. But we\u2019re not there. Hopefully, we learn from this, kind of just straying and going and doing what we think is the right way to play. And that\u2019s my job to make sure what the right way to play is. That\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nThat personable accountability is important, too. A lot of fans criticized Colliton because they felt he didn\u2019t hold himself to the same standards and often put the team\u2019s errors on the players. King seems to get that responsibility falls on him as well. He has said many times in recent months he has to be better, too.\n\nBlackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson is undoubtedly thinking about who will coach the team next season. King has said he hopes to be considered. Though how the Blackhawks performed Monday isn\u2019t what Davidson is obviously seeking from the team, you would think how King responded is what he\u2019s looking for from his coach.\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2021/12/20/22845143/blackhawks-derek-king-head-coach-search-candidates-kyle-davidson", "page_content": "Interim coach Derek King\u2019s honeymoon might be ending.\n\nThe good feelings probably aren\u2019t going away. King\u2019s positivity and nonchalance are part of his personality, and his image as a regular guy thrown in charge of the Blackhawks is captivating.\n\nBut the oft-discussed \u201cnew coach bump\u201d is starting to wear off. Hawks players and fans are getting used to who he is, who he isn\u2019t and what he does and doesn\u2019t emphasize in this hard-to-wrangle sport.\n\nNow comes the second chapter of King\u2019s tenure, in which the focus turns to the long-term future and figuring out if he\u2019s capable of leading the Hawks through that. After all, the concept of a regular guy being an NHL coach remains fun only if he\u2019s winning.\n\nKing still is making a decent case. The Hawks are 10-6-2 since he took over Nov. 6 after consecutive overtime losses to the Predators and Stars. Before Saturday, he had alternated wins and losses for 14 consecutive games, which is better than what the Hawks were doing under predecessor Jeremy Colliton.\n\nThe comparisons to Colliton must end eventually, though, and now might be a good time.\n\nThe Hawks set the bar so low during his remarkably awful final stretch that merely clearing it doesn\u2019t mean things are golden. Yes, the Hawks\u2019 even-strength scoring-chance ratio, for example, has risen significantly, from 43.9% under Colliton to 47.5% under King. But 47.5% is still under 50% and ranks 24th in the league.\n\nInterim general manager Kyle Davidson rightly has given King the keys to coach the Hawks for the rest of the season while the team reconstructs its upper-level leadership. That process already is well underway, and once it\u2019s complete, the new boss\u2019 top summer priority will be naming a permanent coach.\n\nKing, initially a long shot, has made himself a legitimate candidate. His interpersonal skills, in particular, have stood out.\n\nHe has relaxed and united a once-fragile locker room, teaching his players never to panic. He has earned the faith of the team\u2019s few veterans and built upon his pre-existing relationships with many young players.\n\nKing has given each player a sense of freedom on the ice, letting them follow their instincts without overthinking each situation, while establishing a consistent, effective structure.\n\nHis lack of ego and willingness to delegate duties has created harmony among the coaches, too, with defensive coach Marc Crawford and goalie coach Jimmy Waite taking on large roles.\n\nIt all has proved to be exactly what the Hawks needed to stabilize themselves during this crisis-laden season.\n\nBut does King have what it takes to not only rescue a shipwrecked team, but also steer a contending team to the playoffs year after year? That\u2019ll be the Hawks\u2019 long-term goal, and they don\u2019t know if King has those kinds of chops.\n\nHis knowledge of players on other teams and how to match up lines against them is lacking. His delegations to Crawford and Waite border on deferential, and the Hawks naming co-head coaches would be unprecedented. His system grinds out plenty of points in one-goal games but wouldn\u2019t push a talented team to the top of the standings.\n\nIf King\u2019s results over the rest of the season are good enough, the Hawks might be willing to overlook those concerns and see how long he can ride the wave. Stranger things have worked in this fickle sport.\n\nBut as King\u2019s weeks stretch into months, leaving behind the flattering comparisons to Colliton, he\u2019ll have to prove his approach is sustainable.\n\nNote: The NHL on Sunday suspended Brett Connolly for four games for his hit Saturday on Stars forward Tanner Kero. Barring additional postponements, Connolly will be eligible to return Jan. 2 against the Flames.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://ebiographypost.com/sports/coaches/derek-king-bio-net-worth-wife-children", "page_content": "Derek King is a one-time Canadian professional ice hockey player who competed from 1986 to 2000 as a left winger in the National Hockey League.

Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season.

Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018.

So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself.

It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life.
