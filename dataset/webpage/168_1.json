Additionally, IOSG joins existing investors, including Galaxy Interactive, Hustle Fund, Gary Vaynerchuk, Trevor McFederies, Ryan Selkis and Balaji Srinivasan. The company said it has raised a total of $12.7 million in funding since it launched in 2019.\n\nRoll is a financial operating system and network for social tokens, which are branded digital currencies that creators can use to \u201cmake a market that belongs to them and their audience without third-party intermediaries, like platforms,\u201d the company said.\n\nAdditionally, Roll\u2019s network mints branded social tokens unique to individuals so they can control and coordinate its value across platforms. Roll\u2019s social tokens can use Ethereum smart contracts to develop a social token infrastructure that can interact with web platforms and smart contract applications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point now where Roll uniquely allows them to mint these social tokens through the Ethereum blockchain; it can be plugged into anything anyone else is building on Web3,\u201d Bradley Miles, co-founder and CEO of Roll said to Blockworks in an interview.\n\nRoll has over 350 creators, up 250% from 100 creators a year ago, Miles said. The creators range from websites like OnlyFans and Youtube to NFT artists and celebrities like Terry Crews.

Although the sale was closed in June, it was not publicly announced until mid-September.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation says that it will use the proceeds to accelerate the rapid growth of DeFi, NFTs, and other new asset classes on the Avalanche blockchain, Blockworks reported.\n\nSeparately, the Ethereum-based Immutable X sold out its token sale and raised over $12.5 million in less than an hour, Immutable, the company behind the token, said in a tweet on Monday.\n\nAccording to the tweet, Immutable X\u2019s token sale brought in over 720,000 registrants but only about 3.6%, or 25,000, of those registrants were able to become new token holders through CoinList, which is a platform that showcases digital assets before they\u2019re readily available on exchanges.\n\nImmutable is an Australian company that focuses on the first layer 2 for NFTs on Ethereum and allows users to set their own trading fees, among other elements.\n\nIn mid-September, the company closed a $60 million Series B round co-led by BITKRAFT Ventures and King River Capital, with participation from Prosus Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Fabric Ventures, Alameda Research, AirTree Ventures, Reinventure, Apex Capital, and VaynerFund.\n\nImmutable did not disclose what the token sale on Monday will be used toward. However, after the $60 million in funding the company said it would use the investment to primarily expand its global engineering and sales team, while strengthening partnerships with gaming companies, Blockworks previously reported.\n\nAre you a UK or EU reader that can\u2019t get enough investor-focused content on digital assets?

Roll Team \u00b7 Follow Published in Roll Protocol \u00b7 \u00b7 Oct 28, 2020 5 min read -- Listen Share\n\nWe\u2019re so excited to bring some new friends to Roll and announce our $1MM round extension. The additional capital brings our total funding to $2.7MM.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked up to so many people in the blockchain space and personal friends that have helped us along the way, it\u2019s incredible to have them along for the ride. Some of our new investors include Galaxy Interactive, Balaji Srinivasan, Fabric Ventures, IOSG Ventures, Lionschain Capital, The LAO, Sam Cassatt, Julien Bouteloup, Bobby Ong, William Mougayar, George Lambeth, Sebastien Borget, Drew Stone and Dillon Chen, Trevor Delves, Jon Ma, Marc Weinstein and Hideo Suguri.\n\nJocy Lin, Managing Director of IOSG Ventures gives some insight on the investment below:\n\nGranting creators the access to easily mint branded ERC20 tokens that could represent their platforms and be used to reward community unlocks the potential of social money for many use cases, Roll lets each creator have the freedom to determine the rules within its social economy, empowering them to create the business models most suitable to the interest of their community.\n\nA new type of capital for creators\n\nWe see ourselves as leading a shift from user-generated content to what we identify as the next phase, \u201cuser-generated capital\u201d. We\u2019re positioning social money as the foundation of this shift. Bradley Miles, co-founder and CEO of Roll says:\n\nPosts, videos, streams and other social media are forms of user-generated content. Social money like WHALE and CHERRY are forms of user-generated capital. Social money introduces these radically different relationships between creators and their audience where they both get to own the value they create across all platforms.\n\nCreators don\u2019t just go to Roll to make social money, the platform gives them the ability to send, spend and now even trade social money through a Uniswap integration. Creators like Cherry (CHERRY), Whaleshark (WHALE), Andrew (KARMA) and many others are beginning to see social money market values expanding from the hundreds of thousands into the millions and in some cases tens of millions. Sid Kalla, co-founder and CTO of Roll states:\n\nThe rise of social money markets, cumulatively in hundreds of millions today, will enable the building of the entire DeFi stack and more for traditional Web2 communities. This marks a fundamental shift towards user-generated capital as the basis of evolution of the social web.\n\nMonthly trading volume for social money on Roll is around $3.25 million, the highest of any social application on Ethereum according to Dapp.com. Max Mersch, Partner at Fabric Ventures elaborates on new implications of new business models below:\n\nSocial money allows for more inclusive and equitable collaborations, with a reduced role for ad-driven business models, which is one of the many reasons we are excited by the positive impact Bradley, Sid and the team at Roll can have.\n\nHow creators are using social money today\n\nCreators as diverse as Whaleshark, a noted NFT collector, and Cherry, an OnlyFans creator are using social money to build up the dollar value of their communities and give it back to their users.\n\nWhaleshark in particular has taken a few lessons from DeFi and started a liquidity mining program for WHALE holders. Users can provide liquidity for the WHALE/ETH pair on Uniswap and receive WHALE rewards as a result. The community is now moving on to mining NFTs in exchange for WHALE.\n\nCreators like Whaleshark and Cherry use tools like Roll earn codes to spread social money broadly across their audience, as well as a set of third party tools to create permissioned access on messaging services like Discord and Telegram.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to hold 200 CHERRY to get into the Club Cherry discord server and about 550 WHALE to access some of the private channels on Whaleshark\u2019s discord.\n\nAs the utility of each group grows, it\u2019s not uncommon for users to buy more than enough social money needed to access the group in order to speculate on its value and or own a larger stake in the success of the group itself.\n\nCherry shares her experience so far with social money and creating Club Cherry below:\n\nMy social money CHERRY links all members of my community from Twitter, OnlyFans and Discord. For me, it\u2019s a way to give more value to my content as well as memberships.\n\nTaking social money mainstream with Akon and other creators\n\nThe types of creators on Roll range from digital artists to streamers to youtubers to journalists and community builders, and now multi-platinum superstars like Akon are getting involved.\n\nHis Akoin organization has partnered with Roll to introduce social money to a more global audience. Sid provides more detail on the partnership below:\n\nTo grow the Web3 pie, it is important to reach beyond the immediate crypto-native and DeFi audience and start thinking deeply about how everyday people will really use and embrace Ethereum. We are excited to build tools at Roll that bring Web3 infrastructure to massive Web2 communities.\n\nRoll and Akon parter to take social money global\n\nA new base layer for culture\n\nRoll sees social money as a \u201clayer one\u201d or \u201cbase layer\u201d for digital communities, it\u2019s where the value proposition starts between a creator and their audience.\n\n\u201cThe market value of several digital communities on Roll is larger than some protocols in the space, we\u2019re building for a world where digital communities can and will be the biggest thing in Web3. The goal is to use social money as a bridge between traditional social and decentralized finance, opening up a new paradigm of features for digital communities\u201d says Bradley.\n\nToken Summit producer, author of The Business Blockchain and Roll investor William Mougayar explains further:\n\nRoll is lowering the adoption barriers for consumers and entrepreneurs, allowing them to innovate and create new economic activity by tokenizing value creation within their own communities, one of the most exciting opportunities in Web3 applications.\n\nTo learn more about Roll, sign up to our mailing list on tryroll.com or follow us on twitter @tryrollhq."}, {"url": "https://qsrmedia.com.au/franchising/in-focus/rolld-founder-and-ceo-bao-hoang-its-important-set-correct-expectations-running-", "page_content": "He tells QSR Media that they are working on international \u201cpop-up\u201d opportunities to test various markets.\n\nOnce expressing his ambition for rapid growth, Roll'd founder and CEO Bao Hoang says they have shifted their focus on being sustainable. In seven years, the Vietnamese chain - who will conduct a NSW franchise information evening this week - has expanded its store presence across five states, and has more than 70 stores in the network.\n\nFresh on the chain's menu is their B\u00fan B\u00f2 Hu\u1ebf, a spicy beef noodle soup with robust broth that draws inspiration from the Vietnamese city of Hue, which is commonly known for its use of chili and spice in its traditional cuisine.\n\nFrom 16 July to 12 August, Roll'd is encouraging heat enthusiasts to visit a local store to try their 'Chilli Challenge', where customers can personalise the spice level of each individual dish. The B\u00fan B\u00f2 Hu\u1ebf is available for purchase exclusively via their recently-launched Roll\u2019d App, with each customer\u2019s first BBH purchase being completely free.\n\nQSR Media spoke to Hoang, who discussed the fundamental shifts in their franchising approach, what continents they're aiming to conduct 'pop-ups' and why they prefer more Vietnamese concepts in the market.\n\nQSR Media: Roll'd once had plans to expand to 100 stores in 2016. Looking back, How has the Roll'd expansion and franchising strategy changed over the last 12 months?\n\nHoang: Like any new business, we adopted a policy of rapid growth to ensure we were first to market. Today, we are seeking sustainable growth to ensure we can support every new partner whilst always being able to deliver on our promise to enrich people\u2019s lives, one memorable meal at a time.\n\nOur focus is on quality over quantity within the system: from our franchise partners, to our support team, to our people on the front line in store.\n\nQSR Media: What are some of the adjustments Roll'd has made to ensure better franchisee support? What were some interesting feedback from existing franchisees?\n\nOver the years, we have learnt that the more we invest in developing our people, the more we all mutually gain. We\u2019ve also invested in the tools and technology to enable our people to achieve; such as online communications and training platforms to compliment on-the-ground support. We have invested substantially in ensuring we have the right amount of resources in operation, training and marketing to ensure our partners are set up for success.\n\nQSR Media: In your view, how can the industry improve in its relationships with franchisees?\n\nKeep the lines of communication open, have an honest and transparent relationship and we\u2019re not afraid to discuss the issues that really matter. You won\u2019t always agree but if you have a shared future vision, then you will always work together for the good of the brand. As a support office, we strive to achieve a win-win for both parties, as their success is our success.\n\nFrom the get-go, it\u2019s important to set the correct expectations for running a franchise business, which is not to dissimilar to running a stand-alone business. Running any business requires not only a particular skill set, but also a great mental capacity and perseverance to handle pressure.\n\nQSR Media: Roll'd recently launched its app. How has been the reception so far and how does it differentiate itself compared to other programmes?\n\nOur aim to use technology to change the landscape of the food industry was in response to customer demands for faster service, whilst remaining fresh. We\u2019ve developed an app that caters to both the novice Roll\u2019d customer and to those who quite literally live and breathe all things Roll\u2019d.\n\nThe launch of the Roll\u2019d App is a positive step forward in the digital direction we are moving in. There are exciting ventures to come, including being completely cashless within the next three years, drone/driverless vehicle delivery within five years and a fully customisable suggestive menu, based on customer diets, health needs and requests. We\u2019re excited to take our customer experience to a whole new level.\n\nQSR Media: Talk to us more about your international strategy. Should we expect a 'homecoming' of sorts for Roll'd in Vietnam? Will Malaysia, China, Philippines, Singapore, London, Dubai, and New York still be considered?\n\nWe are thrilled to be able to share our great food and create memorable experiences with people around the world. Furthermore, we are currently working on some international \u201cpop-up\u201d opportunities to test various markets - inclusive of destinations from Europe through to Asia, and even North America.\n\nIn terms of a \u2018homecoming', we were surprised to have received interest from the Motherland, however at this point, Vietnam will remain our source of inspiration.\n\nQSR Media: What's your outlook for the potential of other Vietnamese concepts in Australia?\n\nVietnamese cuisine is definitely a cuisine that is on trend right now, not surprisingly because it\u2019s naturally healthy and fresh. We love to see good Vietnamese concepts enter the market, because it just means more exposure of the cuisine. The more good experiences people have with Vietnamese food, the better for Roll\u2019d.\n\nIt\u2019s only disappointing when lesser quality Vietnamese operators create poor quality and/or experience, as we then have to work harder to get those people to give Vietnamese another chance. Roll\u2019d aims to be a regular on the weekly food roster, as cuisines such as Japanese and Chinese have been over the years, and we\u2019re confident we can maintain the quality and service to stick around for years to come."}, {"url": "https://martinroll.com/about/business-and-brand-strategist/", "page_content": "Martin Roll is an experienced global business strategist, senior advisor and facilitator to Fortune 500 companies, Asian firms and family-owned businesses and family offices.

No, not those fruity snacks you used to find in your lunchbox; roll-ups are the aggregation of smaller companies into larger firms, creating a potentially compelling path for equity value.\n\nRight now, all eyes are on Thrasio, the fastest company to reach unicorn status, and its cadre of competitors, such as Heyday, Branded and Perch, all vying to become the modern model of consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.\n\nMaking things even more interesting, famed investor and operator Keith Rabois recently announced that he too is working on a roll-up concept called OpenStore with Atomic co-founder Jack Abraham.\n\nLike any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio.\n\nThrasio has been reaping the benefits of the e-commerce market\u2019s Cambrian explosion in 2020, in which over $1 billion of capital was invested in firms on a mission to acquire independent Amazon sellers and brands.\n\nThis catalyst can be attributed to a few key factors, the first and most notable being the pandemic accelerating spending on Amazon and e-commerce more broadly. Next is the low cost of capital, a reflection of interest rates making markets flush with cash; this has made it easier to raise both equity and debt capital.\n\nThe third is the emerging and quantifiable proofs of concept: Thrasio is one of several raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and Anker, a primarily Amazon-native brand, went public. Both stories have provided further validation that a meaningful brand can be built on top of Amazon\u2019s marketplace.\n\nStill, the interest in creating value through e-commerce brands is particularly striking. Just a year ago, digitally native brands had fallen out of favor with venture capitalists after so many failed to create venture-scale returns. So what\u2019s the roll-up hype about?\n\nRoll-ups are another flavor of investing\n\nRoll-ups aren\u2019t a new concept; they\u2019ve existed for a while. In the offline world, roll-ups often achieve much greater exit multiples, known as \u201cmultiple arbitrage,\u201d so it\u2019s no surprise that the trend is making its way online.\n\nHistorically, though, roll-ups haven\u2019t been all that successful; HBR notes that more than two-thirds of roll-ups fail to create value for investors. While roll-ups are often effective at building larger companies, they don\u2019t always increase profits or operating cash flows.\n\nAcquirers, i.e., those rolling up smaller companies, need to uncover new operating approaches for their acquired companies to increase equity value, and the only way to increase equity value is to increase operating cash flow. There are four ways to do this: reducing overhead costs, reducing operating costs without sacrificing price or volume, increasing pricing without sacrificing volume or increasing volume without increasing unit costs.\n\nE-commerce could present a new and different opportunity, or at least that\u2019s what investors and smart money are betting on. Let\u2019s explore how this new wave of roll-ups is approaching both growth and value creation.\n\nChannel your enthusiasm: Why every roll-up needs a thesis\n\nLike any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio. There are a few that are trending in this particular wave.\n\nThe first is the primary distribution channel upon which a company grows. Evaluating companies with a common distribution channel can be helpful for creating economies of scale, focusing marketing and growth resources in a specific channel versus diluting resources across several.\n\nOn the downside, these companies become reliant on this distribution strategy and any changes could create vulnerabilities for their portfolio companies. As a study, let\u2019s take a look at how two companies take different approaches:"}], "Roll Global is a privately held company.": [{"url": "https://www.wonderful.com/press/roll-global-announces-acquisition-of-vintage--1814/", "page_content": "Los Angeles, August 16, 2013 \u2013 Roll Global, LLC, today announced the acquisition of Vintage Nurseries, LLC, a Wasco, California-based producer of grafted grapevine rootstocks for the wine grape, table grape and raisin markets.\n\n\u201cRoll Global has been invested in California agriculture for more than 30 years, and entered the wine business almost three years ago,\u201d said David Ricanati, President of Roll Global\u2019s wine business. \u201cAs we developed our own vineyard holdings, we learned firsthand about the cyclical nature of grapevine planting.

This means that, in most cases, the company is owned by its founders, management, or a group of private investors. A publicly traded company, on the other hand, is a company that has sold all or a portion of itself to the public via an initial public offering (IPO), meaning shareholders have a claim to part of the company's assets and profits.\n\nKey Takeaways In most cases, a private company is owned by the company's founders, management, or a group of private investors.\n\nA public company is a company that has sold all or a portion of itself to the public via an initial public offering.\n\nThe main advantage public companies have is their ability to tap the financial markets by selling stock (equity) or bonds (debt) to raise capital (i.e., cash) for expansion and other projects.\n\n1:16 Explaining Publicly and Privately Held Companies\n\nPrivate Companies\n\nThe popular misconception is that privately held companies are small and of little interest. In fact, there are many big-name companies that are also privately held\u2014check out the Forbes list of America's largest private companies, which includes big-name brands like Mars, Cargill, Fidelity Investments, Koch Industries, and Bloomberg.\n\nA private company can't dip into the public capital markets and must rely on private funding.\n\nWhile a privately held company can\u2019t rely on selling stocks or bonds on the public market in order to raise cash to fund its growth, it may still be able to sell a limited number of shares without registering with the SEC, under Regulation D. This way, privately held companies can use shares of equity to attract investors. Of course, privately held companies can also borrow money, either from banks or venture capitalists, or rely on profits to fund growth.\n\nThe main advantage of private companies is that management doesn't have to answer to stockholders and isn't required to file disclosure statements with the SEC. However, a private company can't dip into the public capital markets and must, therefore, turn to private funding. It has been said often that private companies seek to minimize the tax bite, while public companies seek to increase profits for shareholders.\n\nPublic Companies\n\nThe main advantage publicly traded companies have is their ability to tap the financial markets by selling stock (equity) or bonds (debt) to raise capital (i.e., cash) for expansion and other projects. Bonds are a form of a loan that a publicly traded company can take from an investor. It will have to repay this loan with interest, but it won\u2019t have to surrender any shares of ownership in the company to the investor. Bonds are a good option for public companies seeking to raise money in a depressed stock market. Stocks, however, allow company founders and owners to liquidate some of their equity in the company, and relieve growing companies of the burden of repaying bonds.\n\nKey Differences\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the two types of companies is how they deal with public disclosure. If it's a public U.S. company, which means it is trading on a U.S. stock exchange, it is typically required to file quarterly earnings reports (among other things) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This information is made available to shareholders and the public. Private companies, however, are not required to disclose their financial information to anyone, since they do not trade stock on a stock exchange.\ufeff\ufeff"}, {"url": "http://topcompanies.com/agriculture/agriculture-companies/roll-global-llc/", "page_content": "Roll Global LLC\n\n\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90064\n\nhttp://www.roll.com\n\nIs this your company?\n\n11444 W.

A company in the \u201cprivate sector\u201d refers to non-government-owned businesses, and includes both privately held (non-traded) and publicly traded (offering stock shares traded on an exchange) companies.\n\nExamples of a privately held company\n\nThere are many more privately held companies than public companies in existence. While extremely large businesses tend to become publicly traded at some point (to access capital markets and gain liquidity), there are many well-known private companies.\n\nWell-known private companies include:\n\nKoch Industries\n\nDeloitte (one of the Big Four accounting firms)\n\nC.

Starting a privately held company in the U.S., Canada, and other countries is quick and easy, while in other countries such as India and China it is more challenging.\n\nHere are country-specific information resources for starting a private company:\n\nTypes of privately held companies\n\nThere are various types of private company structures, each of which offers its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common types are Corporation, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), Sole Proprietorship, and Non-Profit Organization. These types vary in their specific definitions and structures by country, but in most countries, a corporation is the most commonly used company structure.\n\nRisks of ownership\n\nOwning shares in a private company poses many risks. While all investments are risky, owning shares in a private business entails some unique risks, such as the following:\n\nLack of liquidity (since shares do not trade on a public exchange)\n\nChallenging to value (private company valuation and financial modeling exercises pose challenges due to less readily available information)\n\nGovernance issues (many private businesses lack the corporate governance structures that are in place in public companies)\n\nPersonal liability (owners of private companies typically need to pledge personal assets as collateral to get financing from banks)\n\nAdditional resources\n\nCFI\u2019s mission is to help you advance your career in the financial industry.

Private companies may issue stock and have shareholders, but their shares do not trade on public exchanges and are not issued through an initial public offering (IPO). As a result, private firms do not need to meet the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) strict filing requirements for public companies. In general, the shares of these businesses are less liquid, and their valuations are more difficult to determine.\n\nKey Takeaways A private company is a firm that is privately owned.\n\nPrivate companies may issue stock and have shareholders, but their shares do not trade on public exchanges and are not issued through an IPO.\n\nThe high costs of an IPO is one reason companies choose to stay private.\n\n1:34 Private Company\n\nHow a Private Company Works\n\nPrivate companies are sometimes referred to as privately held companies. There are four main types of private companies: sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs), S corporations (S-corps) and C corporations (C-corps)\u2014all of which have different rules for shareholders, members, and taxation.\n\nAll companies in the U.S. start as privately held companies. Private companies range in size and scope, encompassing the millions of individually owned businesses in the U.S. and the dozens of unicorn startups worldwide. Even U.S. firms such as Cargill and Koch Industries, with upwards of $100 billion in annual revenue, fall under the private company umbrella.\n\nRemaining a private company, however, can make raising money more difficult, which is why many large private firms eventually choose to go public through an IPO. While private companies do have access to bank loans and certain types of equity funding, public companies can often sell shares or raise money through bond offerings with more ease.\n\nTypes of Private Companies\n\nSole proprietorships put company ownership in the hands of one person. A sole proprietorship is not its own legal entity; its assets, liabilities and all financial obligations fall completely onto the individual owner. While this gives the individual total control over decisions, it also raises risk and makes it harder to raise money. Partnerships are another type of ownership structure for private companies; they share the unlimited liability aspect of sole proprietorships but include at least two owners.\n\nLimited liability companies (LLCs) often have multiple owners who share ownership and liability. This ownership structure merges some of the benefits of partnerships and corporations, including pass-through income taxation and limited liability without having to incorporate.\n\nS corporations and C corporations are similar to public companies with shareholders. However, these types of companies can remain private and do not need to submit quarterly or annual financial reports. S corporations can have no more than 100 shareholders and are not taxed on their profits while C corporations can have an unlimited number of shareholders but are subject to double taxation.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Private Companies\n\nThe high costs of undertaking an IPO is one reason why many smaller companies stay private. Public companies also require more disclosure and must publicly release financial statements and other filings on a regular schedule. These filings include annual reports (10-K), quarterly reports (10-Q), major events (8-K), and proxy statements.\n\nAnother reason why companies stay private is to maintain family ownership. Many of the largest private companies today have been owned by the same families for multiple generations, such as the aforementioned Koch Industries, which has remained in the Koch family since its founding in 1940. Staying private means a company does not have to answer to its public shareholders or choose different members for the board of directors. Some family-owned companies have gone public, and many maintain family ownership and control through a dual-class share structure, meaning family-owned shares can have more voting rights.\n\nGoing public is a final step for private companies. An IPO costs money and takes time for the company to set up. Fees associated with going public include an SEC registration fee, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) filing fee, a stock exchange listing fee and money paid to the underwriters of the offering."}, {"url": "https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Roll-Global-RVW4419103.htm", "page_content": "Opportunity to work with *very* intelligent people, most people there are quite nice and friendly, pretty good benefits (such as Krav Maga for $25/month!), privately held organization so no focus (AT ALL!) on quarterly profits.

Although sizable productivity improvements over the past 50 years have enabled an abundant food supply in many parts of the world, feeding the global population has reemerged as a critical issue. If current trends continue, by 2050, caloric demand will increase by 70 percent, and crop demand for human consumption and animal feed will increase by at least 100 percent. At the same time, more resource constraints will emerge: for example, 40 percent of water demand in 2030 is unlikely to be met. Already, more than 20 percent of arable land is degraded. Moreover, food and energy production are competing, as corn and sugar are increasingly important for both. Such resource scarcity could lead to political unrest on a large scale if left unaddressed. Agricultural technologies that raise productivity even in difficult conditions and the addition of land for cultivation in Africa, Eastern Europe, and South America may ease the burden, but meeting the entire demand will require disruption of the current trend.\n\nSensing an opportunity, strategic and financial investors are racing to capture value from technological innovation and discontinuities in food and agriculture. Since 2004, global investments in the food-and-agribusiness sector have grown threefold, to more than $100 billion in 2013, according to McKinsey analysis. Food-and-agribusiness companies on average have demonstrated higher total returns to shareholders (TRS) than many other sectors: the TRS of more than 100 publicly traded food-and-agribusiness companies around the world increased an average of 17 percent annually between 2004 and 2013, compared with 13 percent for energy and 10 percent for information technology.\n\nHowever, finding the right investment opportunity is not easy. Food-and-agribusiness investing requires a deep understanding of specific crops, geographies, and complex value chains that encompass seeds and other inputs, production, processing, and retailing. Many of the relevant investment opportunities are in geographies unfamiliar to some investors, and their profitability rests not only on crop yields but also on how different parts of the value chain perform (Exhibit 1). In this article, we examine the main trends that will likely influence the future of food and agribusiness, identify promising investment opportunities, and offer a view of how players might successfully pursue them.\n\n1\n\nMajor trends in food and agribusiness\n\nThe food-and-agribusiness value chain comprises a wide range of companies, from suppliers of agricultural machinery, seeds, chemicals, animal-health tests and vaccines, and packaged foods to data providers for precision agriculture. Filling the global gap between supply and demand requires more resources\u2014technical, human, and financial\u2014for the majority of these companies. Investors have a critical role to play in meeting this challenge\u2014and opportunities to benefit.\n\nTo identify attractive opportunities across geography, crops, and parts of the value chain, we first analyzed seven trends that will likely influence food and agribusiness economics over the next decade.\n\nPopulation growth, urbanization, and increased income in emerging markets\n\nBy 2020, more than half of global GDP growth is expected to come from countries outside of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; over half the world\u2019s urban population also will be in emerging economies. Not only is demand for food in emerging markets expected to rise dramatically because of population and income growth, but also these regions are likely to adopt a rich-country diet\u2014more calories, protein, and processed foods.\n\nA projected surge in demand for protein in emerging markets, especially pork in China, would create opportunities for companies to grow in core production and supporting industries such as breeding, animal-health testing, feed, and vaccines. For example, beef and other livestock production in Argentina and Brazil is expected to grow strongly to meet global demand. Making feed conversion more efficient so that animals produce more meat while consuming the same amount of feed as they do now could be profitable for companies with unique intellectual property in additives such as probiotics, enzymes, and acidifiers.\n\nWith opportunity come risks. Rising protein prices in emerging markets, government intervention, and environmental concerns could slow demand. Moreover, not every part of the protein value chain is doing well; livestock producers are struggling because of a poor feed-to-meat/dairy price ratio, and primary processors are suffering from high feedstock costs and low capacity utilization. Also, consumer behavior and preferences can change faster than many companies and investors can handle. Successful investment strategies will address the risks by finding opportunities to capture value (for example, technology or processing that improves feed performance or reduces feed-production cost) or by mitigating the risks (for example, vertical integration within the protein value chain).\n\nDemographic and behavioral change in mature markets\n\nIn addition to greater demand for protein, we anticipate a trend toward healthier diets. Consumers are increasingly health conscious and place greater importance on environmental sustainability, most visibly in developed countries but more and more in emerging markets. In response, governments are tightening standards for food production. As a result, demand is rising for healthier functional foods (those that offer benefits beyond basic nutrition, such as lowering cholesterol) and for traceable and certified foods that are guaranteed to meet a certain level of safety and environmental or corporate social responsibility.\n\nProducers and food companies that embrace more stringent environmental and social standards, organic-certification requirements, and traceability standards should be able to better position themselves in the face of evolving regulation and continue to grow to take advantage of this trend. For example, in 2010 Unilever announced plans to source 100 percent of its agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020, and, as of the end of 2014, had reached 55 percent. Food-and-beverage companies can also profit from products with specific fortifications and nutrients to appeal to the health-conscious segment (for example, omega-3\u2013fortified milk).\n\nThe productivity imperative\n\nDepletion of natural resources, the impact of climate volatility on crops, and declining productivity gains in agriculture are expected to hinder growth in the world food supply, forcing countries to produce more with less. By 2030, for example, the gap between expected water withdrawals and existing supply may reach 40 percent. The pressure on water, land, energy, and labor resources will necessitate innovation to enhance agriculture productivity. Indeed, productivity gains have slowed in recent years; productivity of major crop yields is now growing by only 1 percent a year compared with twice that rate in the 1960s and 1970s. This has big implications: a 2 percent increase in wheat yields would generate enough calories (about 150 kilocalories per day) to give an extra piece of bread to the nearly 900 million people living in the least-developed countries.\n\nTo take advantage of the need for higher productivity, input companies, distributors, and logistics enterprises can expand into new geographies as well as provide a wider range of products and services (for example, high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and resource-optimization techniques) to help farmers increase crop yields. Offering innovative technologies (for example, seeds requiring less water for similar yields) is important, but so is their distribution in emerging markets.\n\nThe other way to get more from less is to reduce food waste. An estimated 30 percent of agricultural production in Africa and Asia is lost in postharvest processes. Accurate data on waste are difficult to come by, especially in emerging markets, but we know that logistics, trade, and processing infrastructure are critical bottlenecks. In developed markets, most food waste happens downstream, at the retailer or in consumers\u2019 homes, resulting also in around 30 percent consumption loss. Economics drive waste: margins and transport costs determine how much effort to put into waste reduction while consumer behavior is slow to change.\n\nReducing food waste in emerging markets is a big value-creating investment opportunity, particularly in logistics and distribution. In China alone, the cold-storage-and-transportation market generates $12 billion to $18 billion in revenues and is expected to grow 10 to 15 percent annually to meet the country\u2019s expanding meat, dairy, and vegetable demand. Some local companies are already seeking capital to promote this growth. In developed markets, there are opportunities for innovation in extending food shelf life and in packaging to reduce waste downstream.\n\nA polarized industry structure: Toward bigger and smaller\n\nWe anticipate continued consolidation of firms across the agribusiness value chain as well as the emergence of smaller niche players. Large-scale commercial farming has taken off in places such as Brazil, where commercial farms can top 100,000 acres. In addition, smaller- and medium-size family farms are increasing their purchasing (for example, seeds, crop protection, fertilizer, and machinery) and selling grains, sugar, and ethanol through cooperatives, lowering transaction costs significantly. There is also emerging interest in Africa as a production basin: major agribusiness companies are increasingly integrating vertically as more traders extend into production and processing, while retailers are moving into production and sourcing of key input commodities.\n\nAt the same time, there are rising numbers of specialized players, especially on the input side, where technology and intellectual property play a critical role. Small microbial-fertilizer companies are an example. In addition, the millions of smallholder farmers around the world are gradually integrating into commercial value chains; among them are coffee farmers in Ghana and cotton farmers in India.\n\nConsolidated, integrated farming creates an opportunity for equipment manufacturers, distributors, and technology companies to offer more sophisticated and automated products and services. Smaller, specialized players could grow and perhaps wind up in the hands of strategic investors (as, for example, in BASF\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Becker Underwood, a seed-treatment technology company).\n\nUnprecedented price swings\n\nWe expect continued volatility in agricultural input and output prices. Wider swings in agricultural prices in recent years are similar to what happened with other commodities, such as oil and metal. In addition, there is increasing evidence of tighter linkages among commodity prices. With the spike in food prices and the economic downturn in 2008, the number of undernourished people around the world increased to more than 1 billion, from 850 million in 2005. Food-price peaks in 2011 and 2013 had a similar though less severe effect, while we are seeing a continuous price decline over the past 12 months.\n\nThe politics and technology advancements of biofuels will be an important factor in price levels and volatility. Meanwhile, other contributing factors to volatility\u2014adverse weather, rising oil prices, export restrictions, civil strife\u2014will most likely persist. Risk management and hedging mechanisms such as weather insurance will therefore be an important component of doing business in parts of the food-and-agribusiness value chain.\n\nBig data and information\n\nExpanded access to and more sophisticated use of information will play an increasingly important role in agriculture. There is exciting potential to use more granular data (for example, data for every ten-meter-by-ten-meter square of a field) and analytical capability to integrate various sources of information (such as weather, soil, and market prices) with the goal of increasing crop yield and optimizing resource usage, thus lowering cost.\n\nIn our view, however, there is still significant progress to be made on figuring out a business model that captures value from data at scale. In part, that is because the data are captured by disparate players in different parts of the value chain (for example, seed companies, equipment manufacturers, traders, and software developers). Managing and capitalizing on the critical data points is likely to require strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and potentially a reshaping of the industry structure. Monsanto\u2019s $930 million acquisition of The Climate Corporation in 2013 was one of several moves by an agriculture giant; other companies, like Deere & Company, have announced partnerships on data with input firms. More opportunities could arise in adjacent areas once integrated, comprehensive data become available.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging markets still lack high-quality, reliable data on production and demand. Establishing a systematic mechanism to capture the data could offer additional value-creating opportunities. In particular, rapid expansion of mobile technologies in rural populations could allow farmers in these areas to greatly improve productivity based on access to better information.\n\nWould you like to learn more about our Chemicals Practice\n\nTrade to contribute to food security\n\nAgricultural trade is growing, but protectionism remains a concern for many stakeholders. Indeed, only a modest percentage of global agriculture production is traded across borders, but such exports can influence world market prices and regulation. Agriculture continues to play an important social and political role. Economics often takes a back seat to low food prices, food availability, rural employment, and slowing urban migration.\n\nHowever, there are still investment opportunities for low-cost producers in countries such as Brazil, where agricultural exports continue to grow. In addition, investments in infrastructure that enables the movement of commodities, such as ports, storage, and the cold chain, can help to promote and capture more value from agricultural trade. Major agricultural traders such as Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus have committed capital to relieving some important bottlenecks such as movement of product from Brazil\u2019s interior, and we expect additional investment will follow.\n\nPotential opportunities for investors\n\nBased on these trends, we identified 24 hot spots that may prove attractive to investors over the next decade and assessed these opportunities on market size, risk, and growth potential (Exhibit 2).\n\n2\n\nLet\u2019s look more closely at one of the hot spots:\n\nProtein in China\n\nWith annual spending of $300 billion, China is the world\u2019s largest consumer of meat, two-thirds of which is pork. Protein consumption there is expected to grow 3 to 4 percent a year, mostly as a result of increasing demand from a rising middle class. While levels have risen dramatically, the Chinese continue to trail Western diets in protein consumption. The government has made a strong commitment to modernize the sector, moving from what is largely backyard farming to sophisticated commercial agribusiness. These structural changes and discontinuities make the sector a hot spot worthy of further exploration.\n\nHowever, the space is vast and complicated, with multiple areas to examine and prioritize across products (pork, poultry, dairy, beef, and fishery), value chain (inputs, production, and processing), and cross-cutting themes such as infrastructure. After we assessed major trends, industry structure, and investment opportunities, two areas emerged as attractive possibilities: pork breeding and cold-chain logistics.\n\nChina\u2019s pig-breeding market is substantial, with about $1 billion in annual revenue and favorable economics. Breeding is one of the critical means to modernize the protein industry. Technology and intellectual property inherent in the genetic research allow companies to capture significant margin. Investors must identify international players that are well positioned with reliable Chinese partners. It is critical to offer a compelling value proposition to the Chinese government that combines contributing to local production and productivity improvements as well as offering food security solutions, including direct supply chains into China. Meanwhile, Chinese companies are not standing still: Shuanghui International Holdings, China\u2019s biggest pork producer, completed the $4.7 billion acquisition of Smithfield Foods, the 87-year-old US meat giant, with brands like Armour and Farmland, in September 2013.\n\nOn the back of the increased protein demand and formalization of the Chinese food system, there is a big investment opportunity in developing the cold chain in the Chinese food industry, given increasing consumer and government expectations for food quality and safety. To reach developed-market scale in both cold storage and transportation, the Chinese cold-chain logistics market would have to grow more than 20 percent a year for the next five to ten years. Annual growth rates of more than 15 percent are required to reach government targets for cold-chain penetration of agriculture products. Analysts forecast the global cold-chain market to grow at 16 percent annually to 2018. The current industry is fragmented at the local and regional levels, suggesting that more consolidation and vertical integration can be expected. Given the capital intensity of the sector, the opportunity for investors may lie in acquiring an international player that is well positioned in warehouse-logistics management (where the margins are highest) and has the right customer relationships and local partners.\n\nMaking it happen\n\nSimply identifying potential hot spots will not guarantee success. Winning will require a thoughtful approach and sector-specific capabilities. To create and capture value in food and agribusiness, investors should consider the following moves:\n\nDeepen value-chain understanding . Investors should develop a granular understanding of each step of the value chain and identify where opportunities may lie, since variations across each sector are significant. For example, sugarcane production value grew almost 80 percent in China and 120 percent in Brazil from 2000 to 2012 (although in the last three years, the market has become much tougher for Brazilian sugarcane players), compared with a 23 percent decline in the United States during that same time period. Investors should be selective\u2014food and agribusiness often comprise a small number of large companies (especially inputs and primary commodity processing), businesses that are part of a large conglomerates, and many small farmers and businesses. Increasingly, there are firms specializing in the food-and-agribusiness sector that are attractive to investors because of their strong understanding of the sector.\n\n.

Recognize the importance of emerging markets . Strengthening activities in emerging markets will be essential, as much of the growth in supply and demand will come from there. Investors must build relationships and capabilities and be willing to manage social and political uncertainty. For example, we have seen investors struggle to find opportunities in Brazil, where many family-owned companies have strong, relationship-based businesses. Investors should be aware that social and political constraints have a large impact in this sector and that success will often require active collaboration with social and public entities.\n\n.

Take a through-cycle approach . Investors must maintain a through-cycle mentality in recognition of the underlying volatility of food and agribusiness (and the impact of the volatility in other sectors, such as oil and gas). This could lead to an investment horizon of more than seven years\u2014longer than that of private equity. Some investments may be more suited to investors with longer time horizons, such as pension and sovereign-wealth funds.\n\n.

Investors should be prepared to build the capabilities needed to operate successfully in the agribusiness sector. Many of the capital-intensive segments of the value chain, such as production and processing, will require investors and owners to understand how to achieve best-in-class operations to capture their full value.\n\nThe food-and-agribusiness sector has demonstrated strong performance but is complex and idiosyncratic. Within this space, we have identified 24 hot spots likely to prove interesting for investment consideration over the next five to ten years. Our experience shows that pursuing due diligence in relevant subsectors and following the five approaches we have described increases the chance that investors can capture attractive returns while addressing some of the most significant needs of the global population."}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2021/12/16/5-key-issues-in-agriculture-in-2021", "page_content": "As 2021 ends, we take a retrospective look at five topics that were covered in our analytical work this year. These issues represent just a fragment of the Bank's work, but they are key to reducing poverty and hunger while slowing climate change.\n\nFood Security\n\nLike the previous year, news in agriculture and food in 2021 was dominated by deteriorating food security. Approximately 30 percent of the world\u2019s population lacked access to adequate food in 2020 and into 2021.\n\nThe World Bank took action to fight food insecurity around the world, providing immediate aid to vulnerable households and more long-term support to farmers in the form of seeds, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs.\n\nCOVID-19 also pushed more people into poverty and made the poor poorer around the world. This, along with supply chain interruptions and rising prices had a major impact on hunger. To learn more about these impacts, read this brief compiled by the Bank and updated at least once a month.\n\nOur new podcast series, Table for 10 Billion, launched in March examined the causes of growing hunger and offered some surprising answers.\n\nFarming Insects for Food and Feed\n\nThis December, the Bank released a ground-breaking report looking at the valuable role farming insects can play in both food security and climate-smart agriculture, Insect and Hydroponic Farming in Africa: The New Circular Food Economy.\n\nWhile two billion people regularly eat insects harvested in the wild, farming them for food at scale is new. The report found that African insect farming could generate crude protein worth up to US$2.6 billion and biofertilizers worth up to US$19.4 billion. That is enough protein meal to meet up to 14% of the crude protein needed to rear all the pigs, goats, fish, and chickens in Africa.\n\nKey benefits of insect farming include:\n\nInsects can be farmed without arable land.\n\nInsects can be grown within a couple of weeks.\n\nThe food they need to grow comes from food waste.\n\nInsect waste can be used as fertilizer.\n\nInsects can be used as animal feed, cutting farmer expenses, and reducing greenhouse gases generated from farming and transporting other feed such as soybeans.\n\nPeople can eat insects or sell them for income, increasing food security.\n\nFor more on farming insects and the role they can play in the food system, take a listen to this episode of the Table for 10 Billion podcast.\n\nFixing Food Finance to Build a Greener Future\n\nWhile agriculture currently accounts for about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, it also offers opportunities to both fight climate change and feed more people as the world\u2019s population grows to 10 billion people by 2050. One of the keys will be changing the way agriculture is financed and incentivized.\n\nA report from the Bank, published in September, explains the US$12 trillion in annual hidden social, economic, and environmental costs generated by our current food system and offers recommendations to break the cycle by implementing five food finance imperatives that will help implement climate-smart agriculture.\n\nThe report, Food Finance Architecture: Financing a Healthy, Equitable and Sustainable Food System, was written in conjunction with the Food and Land Use Coalition, and the International Food Policy Research Institute, and released to coincide with the UN Food Systems Summit.\n\nA feature story and episode of the Table for 10 Billion podcast examine transforming the food system to adapt to climate change.\n\nDigital Agriculture and the Path to the Future\n\nAgriculture continued its march to the digital future in 2021, both with new techniques being developed for growing food and technology that better links the world\u2019s 570 million farmers and 8 billion consumers.\n\nIn March, the Bank released the report What\u2019s Cooking: Digital Transformation of the Agrifood System, which explores how digital technologies are improving the food system and provides a roadmap for countries to scale up their own digital agriculture. The report also provides a framework to evaluate policy proposals that can make the food system more efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable.\n\nA live event was held in conjunction with the report\u2019s release and the Table for 10 Billion podcast also looked forward to the digital future of food.\n\nFeeding Growing Cities\n\nIn March, the Bank looked at the fast-growing cities of Asia and how they have integrated food systems into their planning. The resulting report, RICH Food, Smart City, demonstrated that more needs to be done at the planning stages to ensure a plentiful and safe supply of food to residents now and in the future.\n\nOnly 8% of the 170 emerging Asian cities surveyed by the Bank and FAO were deemed to be \u201cfood-smart\u201d\u2013working proactively to ensure strong food systems.\n\nAs was made clear by the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is key for cities to pursue \u201csmarter\u201d food policy in order to foster reliable, inclusive, competitive, and healthy (\u201cRICH\u201d) food systems better aligned with their challenges and aspirations.\n\nThe authors of the book sat down to answer questions on what needs to be done and how to do it."}, {"url": "https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/our-work/environment/food-agriculture", "page_content": "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted in a world where food insecurity and hunger present an enormous global challenge. The world\u2019s population is expected to grow to nine billion by 2050 and demand on global food systems intensifies every day. However, transforming our food and agriculture systems to make them sustainable, resilient and inclusive will deliver access to healthy and nutritious foods, help create livelihoods for small-scale producers and processors, and help protect ecosystems and combat climate change. In this context, business has become a critical partner in designing and delivering effective, scalable and practical solutions for food security and sustainable agriculture. Every actor along the agriculture supply chain, including farmers, producers, traders, retailers, investors and consumers has a critical role to play to establish sustainable food systems that advance food security, protect the environment and ensure economic opportunity. The vision of a world without hunger is ambitious. And it cannot be achieved in isolation. Food security and sustainable agriculture call for all businesses, large or small, to conduct responsible business and for responsible action and leadership from all actors in society.\n\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations laid out a path to eradicate hunger. The UN has scaled up its efforts to work with governments, business, academia and civil society to galvanize the sound policies, actions and leadership that will enable the transformations required to create inclusive, resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems that deliver for people, planet and prosperity.\n\nThe UN Global Compact is committed to drive business engagement in the global effort to advance food security and sustainable agriculture. In support of this goal, the UN Global Compact\u2019s work is focused on the key pillars food and agriculture, which are aligned with the five elements of the Zero Hunger Challenge: (1) Sustainable Food Systems; (2) Rural Poverty; (3) Loss and Waste of Food; (4) Access to Adequate Food and Healthy Diets; and (5) Ending Malnutrition.\n\nIt is also important to mention that the Committee on World Food Security Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment offer a soft law instrument to address a range of environmental, social and economic issues. While the Food and Agriculture Business Principles provide a voluntary framework to advance the positive impact business can have on food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture and to engage in principle-based collaboration with the UN, governments, civil society and other stakeholders."}, {"url": "https://www.wonderful.com/press/roll-global-announces-acquisition-of-vintage--1814/", "page_content": "Los Angeles, August 16, 2013 \u2013 Roll Global, LLC, today announced the acquisition of Vintage Nurseries, LLC, a Wasco, California-based producer of grafted grapevine rootstocks for the wine grape, table grape and raisin markets.\n\n\u201cRoll Global has been invested in California agriculture for more than 30 years, and entered the wine business almost three years ago,\u201d said David Ricanati, President of Roll Global\u2019s wine business. \u201cAs we developed our own vineyard holdings, we learned firsthand about the cyclical nature of grapevine planting.

Because these companies have a lot of resources, manpower and billions of dollars in investor capital, they squeeze out smaller farmers in their race for profits and can sometimes pursue unsustainable practices in the face of fierce competition.\n\nThe global population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, which suggests that food production will have to be increased by at least 50%. In turn, this could result in the need for more land, which could lead to further deforestation and the depletion of other resources like water and soil.\n\nAt the same time, the largest agricultural companies are among the few that can face these challenges and adapt to the changes in the agricultural sector. As people become more concentrated around urban areas, this creates a lack of human capital to be employed in farming and other agricultural activities. Big agricultural companies can develop technologies that would allow farms to continue their operations with less human involvement through automation. Many agricultural equipment companies like Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) and CNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI) have been investing heavily in such technology in the last couple of years, developing tractors, combines, and harvesters that can operate on a semi-autonomous basis, with the goal to develop equipment that would be capable of performing all tasks on its own.\n\nAt the same time, the need for more food could lead to more land being used for production, which could in turn cause deforestation. Deforestation can have devastating effects on the ecosystem, causing soil erosion, increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases, leading to the extinction of many species of plants and animals, etc. Some of the largest agricultural companies by revenue in the world that are engaged in production of seeds and crop protection, such as Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON), should focus on technologies that will allow higher crop yields on the same amount of land, through the use of better seed cultures and better chemicals and pesticides.\n\nGiven the major challenges in global food production, more and more governments are imposing regulations in order to tackle them. Middle-income countries, faced with populations that are becoming more wealthy, are investing heavily in food production, while the investments from more developed countries are slowing down. A big part of the investment in food production represents investment in research and development. According to Nature.com, in 2011, 5% of global investment in R&D was directed towards agriculture and food production, which represented roughly $69 billion, with 55% of that figure being spent in high-income countries and 43% in middle-income countries. At the same time, in high-income countries, over 52% of the research on crop breeding, fertilizers, and food technology was done by the private sector, mainly by the largest agricultural companies.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 12 largest agricultural companies by revenue in the world. To compile this list, we selected some of the largest companies from various industries within the agricultural sector, including farming, processing, agricultural equipment, chemicals, and seeds.

Cargill \u2013 $113.5bn\n\nCargill\u2019s net revenues declined by 1% to $113.5bn in 2019 compared with the previous year, due to a challenging business environment and adverse weather conditions throughout the year.\n\nStrong demand for beef and eggs propelled the growth in the protein business segment in North America, however. The company is investing in the development and expansion of multiple facilities in various Chinese provinces to address the increasing demand for protein, particularly in Asia. It is also diversifying its protein business and expanding the food ingredients and applications business with new acquisitions.\n\nCargill adjusted its manufacturing operations and supply chains to the consumer demand shift during the COVID-19 crisis and reported a 3% rise in the first six months revenues in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nBased in the US, Cargill employs 155,000 personnel and operates in 70 countries across North America, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n\n2. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Company \u2013 $64.65bn\n\nMultiple factors, including adverse weather conditions in the US, African Swine Fever, and the US-China trade dispute, significantly impacted Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s 2019 performance, resulting in just 0.4% revenue growth compared with the preceding year.\n\nADM company operates agricultural services and oilseeds, carbohydrate solutions, nutrition, and other business segments. The passage of biodiesel tax credit (BTC) for 2018 and 2019 resulted in strong revenue growth in refined products in agricultural services & oilseeds segment which earned approximately $270m in net operating profit.\n\nThe carbohydrate solutions segment delivered an adjusted operating profit of $644m in 2019 contributed by manufacturing costs reduction and greater income from co-products in North America. In the nutrition segment, margins were under pressure in emulsifiers and edible beans but the continued growth of margin in proteins came to the rescue.\n\nNet revenues declined by 4% to $46.3bn in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $48.3bn in the same period in 2019. Crushing margins in North America shrunk due to slow farmer selling and COVID-19 pandemic impact on meal and oil demand.\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, US, ADM is a multi-national food processing company with subsidiaries in 70 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia.\n\n3.

The company\u2019s gross profit grew by 21.3% compared with 2018.\n\nJBS business unit Seara posted a 15.2% rise in net revenue driven by the growing preference for the brand among consumers in Brazil. Seara launched more than 180 products across Seara Nature, Seara Rotisserie, and Incredible Seara lines and expanded the Seara Gourmet range in 2019.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not impact the revenue growth of the company significantly.

Its sales grew by 1.6% in 2019, compared with the prior year.\n\nNet sales in the Weston Foods segment reduced by 4.8% in the first half of 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019, attributed to declining volumes in certain retail categories and food services channels due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nGeorge Weston is a Canadian public company with businesses in food and grocery retail, real estate, and consumer goods. The company employs more than 200,000 people.\n\n7. Tyson Foods \u2013 $42.4bn\n\nTyson Foods\u2019 sales grew by 6% year-on-year in 2019, driven by acquisitions and rise in average sales prices in beef and prepared foods segments.\n\nThe beef segment accounted for 36% of the net sales of $42.4bn, followed by chicken (31%), prepared foods (20%), and pork (10%).\n\nThe decline in average sales price in chicken and pork segments offset the beef segment growth, resulting in an approximately 6.7% decline in the operating income in 2019 compared to the prior year.\n\nCOVID-19 negatively impacted the first nine months of the company\u2019s 2020 financial performance due to direct incremental expenses of approximately $340m. Tyson Foods, however, reported strong results in the third quarter driven by beef and pork segments.\n\nBased in the US, the company operates 42 distribution centres and external cold storage facilities, and two research and development centres.

Bunge \u2013 $41.14bn\n\nBunge reported a 10% year-on-year decline in net sales in 2019, due to poor performance of its agribusiness, and sugar & bioenergy segments.\n\nOilseed processing, grain origination, grain trading, and distribution businesses caused a 12% decline in net sales of the agribusiness segment in 2019.\n\nLower global sugar sales volumes and prices, as well as the company\u2019s exit from international trading and merchandising business in 2018, led to a 43% sales decline in the sugar & bioenergy segment in 2019, partially offset by higher ethanol sales volumes and prices in Brazil.\n\nSales in the edible oil products segment increased by 1% primarily due to Loders\u2019 acquisition in 2018, offsetting lower prices in the US, Europe, and Brazil. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the segment continued to perform strongly in 2020, reporting higher earnings in Brazil and Asia due to improved demand from food processor and consumer retail channels.\n\nBunge is a global agribusiness and food company based in the US.

In Latin America, the food & snacks division generated approximately 90% of the region\u2019s combined revenue.\n\nThe additional charges incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted PepsiCo\u2019s operating profit in 2020, although net revenues in the first nine months of 2020 grew by 9% versus the corresponding period in 2019. The growth was attributed to strong food and snacks business and improved beverage business globally.\n\nBased in the US, PepsiCo owns popular brands such as Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, and Quaker. It serves more than 200 countries and territories such as North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Middle East, China, Australia, New Zealand, and South Asia.\n\n10. Mondelez \u2013 $25.9bn\n\nMondelez\u2019s net revenue declined by 0.3% in 2019 due to unfavourable currency and the impact of the divestiture of most of the company\u2019s cheese business in the Middle East and Africa, which was partially offset by a 4.1% increase in its organic net revenue and acquisitions.\n\nThe company generated approximately 74.4% of its net revenues outside the US in 2019. The organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favourable volume or mix. Mondelez acquired majority stakes in Perfect Snacks in 2019 and Tate\u2019s Bake Shop, in 2018.\n\nHigher net pricing, favourable volume or mix, and improved net revenues from the Give & Go and Perfect Snacks acquisitions offset the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact, resulting in a 0.1% increase in net revenues in the first six months of 2020.\n\nBased in the US, Mondelez markets snacks, including biscuits, chocolate, gum and candy, cheese, grocery, and powdered beverage products, in more than 150 countries in Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nThe company operates in approximately 80 countries served by a workforce of roughly 80,000.

They put tremendous pressure to shift the policy focus to the development of a more sustainable and resilient agri-food industry around the world. Estimates suggest that the global food demand will increase by 70% by 2050 and at least $80 billion annual investments throughout the value chains will be required in response. Most of which needs to come from private sector due to the limited public resources, large scale in mechanization, climate smart technologies, processing, and agri-food logistics. Smaller investments are also needed for farmers and agriculture micro, small and medium enterprises to increase their productivity while reducing environment impact and taking into account climate risks.\n\nFinancial systems in most developing countries are ill prepared to finance the shift to sustainable agriculture and agri-food industries. Banks, microfinance institutions, and institutional investors have traditionally been providing very limited resources for the sectors. Agriculture loans and investments portfolios currently are disproportionately low compared to the agriculture sector\u2019s share of GDP. Important challenges for the financial markets include managing unique risks in agriculture, high transaction costs in dealing with large number of small farmers, and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) along the agriculture value chains, limited effective demand for finance, lack of expertise of financial institutions in managing agricultural loan portfolios. On the other side, many countries have put in place inadequate or ineffective policies and instruments, which often limit the opportunities to mobilize private capital for the sector.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWe assist client countries in developing and implementing agriculture finance strategies and instruments to crowd-in private capital, deepening resilient agriculture finance markets. Such markets provide adequate financial services along agriculture value chains from farmers to MSMEs operating in processing, commercialization, transportation of agriculture products.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Interventions: We conduct diagnostic studies including FSAP (Financial Sector Assessment Program) on the state of agriculture finance and produce concrete action plans to reform public policies and regulations in order to create an enabling environment to mobilize agricultural finance. Some examples of policy and legal/regulatory intervention areas include lending quotas, interest rate caps, bank branch expansion regulations, prudential regulations impacting agricultural lending, warehouse receipt financing frameworks, agri-business receivables certificates, and alternative dispute mechanisms for contract farming.\n\nStrengthening agriculture finance markets : We provide solutions for agriculture lenders to access to long term finance, to digitize and green their services, and to manage agriculture risks, and grow agriculture asset classes. We also provide technical assistance to reform and build capacity of public financial institutions and leverage Fintechs and digital platforms to advance agriculture finance.\n\nSupport to financial cooperatives. We operate a special program and a community of practice focused on financial cooperatives, given the importance of these entities as providers of financial services to smallholder farmers, rural MSMEs and households. This program aims to strengthen their performance as well as to enhance applicable regulations and oversight arrangements to better integrate them into their country\u2019s financial system.\n\nInnovative Products: We assist in the design and develop a wide range of instruments, either as a technical assistance or part of lending projects: value chain finance, innovative credit scoring based on agriculture specificities, partial credit guarantees schemes, digital agriculture platforms linking agriculture value chains and financial institutions, digitalization of agriculture value chains and, capital market solutions (e.g. bonds issuance for agriculture finance suppliers, and agribusinesses, agriculture investment funds),. We also work on developing digital finance, e-commerce & payment platforms to enhance access to finance and reduce transaction costs in reaching farmers and SMEs.\n\nClimate change in agriculture finance: Agriculture production and agri-MSMEs are extremely vulnerable to climate change, which increases the risk in agriculture finance significantly and many financial institutions simply stay away from the sector. On the other hand, the sector presents compelling opportunities to reduce emissions and conserve limited natural resources. We work with our client countries and financial institutions to develop and implement solutions including financial instruments and public-private collaboration. Our interventions aim to facilitate and scale-up climate smart investments for productivity increase and resource efficiency and help financial institutions manage climate risks in agriculture lending portfolio.\n\nAddressing obstacles to agriculture finance. In addition to financial markets issues to expand agriculture finance, we work to address various challenges such as access to markets for agriculture products, lack of proximity of financial institutions, and land tenure as they represent strong barriers to agriculture finance. Some of our solutions include agriculture e-commerce platforms, agent banking, and farmer registry.\n\nKnowledge Management and Community of Practice: Informed by our in-house research and knowledge production, we carry out activities both at the internal level (including community of practices and training programs) and at the external level (global and regional dissemination events, South-South exchange and capacity building for policy reforms, among others). We lead two Community of Practice: one on agriculture finance (co-led with Agriculture GP) and another one specific to financial cooperatives.\n\nGlobal Engagements and collaboration within the World Bank Group: We have formed a partnership with Rabobank on financial cooperatives that aims to contribute to the global knowledge on these institutions and their promotion building on concrete experiences. We are one of the core members of CABFIN Partnership \u201cCapacity Building in Rural Finance\u201d, a collaboration effort with FAO, GIZ, IFAD, UNCDF, and EFP aimed at facilitating knowledge exchange and capacity development among relevant public and private stakeholders in order to increase the availability and effective use of financial services in rural areas. We work closely with the Disaster Risk Management team for agriculture risk management and Markets and Technology team in FCI Global Practice for agribusiness development, and also collaborate with CGAP , the Agriculture and Digital Development Global Practices."}]}
