Getty Images\n\nESPN anchor Stuart Scott has died at the age of 49.\n\nHe had battled cancer since 2007.\n\nScott worked for ESPN for 21 years, becoming one of the network's most recognizable anchors on SportsCenter and other studio shows.\n\n\"ESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott,\" ESPN president John Skipper said in a statement.\n\nScott talked about his fight with cancer in a moving speech at the 2014 ESPYs.\n\n\"When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live,\" he said in the speech. \"So live. Live. Fight like hell. And when you get too tired to fight, lay down and rest, and let somebody else fight for you.\"\n\nESPN released the following statement:\n\nStuart Scott, a dedicated family man and one of ESPN\u2019s signature SportsCenter anchors, has died after a courageous and inspiring battle with cancer. He was 49.\n\nScott is survived by his two daughters, Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; his parents, O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott; and his three siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney, Susan Scott and their families. His girlfriend, Kristin Spodobalski, was with Stuart and cared for him every step of the way and along with support from his loving family, close friends and colleagues, he went through several surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation and clinical trials to stay strong and ward off cancer for as long as humanly possible.\n\n\u201cESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott,\u201d said ESPN president John Skipper. \u201cWho engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments? Who leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set? His energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.\u201d\n\nOn July 16, 2014, Scott accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs. During his speech, he expressed the following sentiment about his two daughters: \u201cTaelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here tonight because of you.\u201d\n\nDuring his ESPY speech, Scott shared his approach to fighting cancer. \u201cI also realized something else recently,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m not losing. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m not losing. But I\u2019ve got to amend that. When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live. So live. Live. Fight like hell.\u201d\n\nFor 21 years, years Scott was one of ESPN\u2019s and ABC Sports\u2019 most recognizable and quotable personalities and one of the most popular sportscasters around the world. His catchphrases, including his most famous \u201cBoo-ya\u201d and \u201cAs cool as the other side of the pillow,\u201d have become an integral part of pop culture. While Scott became instantly known for his enthusiasm and colorful descriptions, he was always proud of the facts he would weave into his storytelling, recognizing that every great story is based in fact.\n\nAfter joining the network in 1993 for the launch of ESPN2, Scott became a leading voice on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter, where he anchored the 11pm show. Over the years, his talent and work ethic led to many additional high-profile assignments including major hosting roles on NFL and NBA programming. During his career with ESPN, Scott covered a slew of major events, including the NBA Finals, Super Bowl, Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series, the NCAA Final Four and more.\n\nFrom 2007-2011 Scott was the host of ABC Sports\u2019 weekly NBA Sunday studio show, ESPN\u2019s NBA studio show, and served as a host during the NBA Finals Trophy presentation each year. Scott also hosted numerous ESPN and ABC series and specials, including Dream Job, Stump The Schwab, ESPN\u2019s 25th Anniversary Special, and The ESPY Red Carpet Show.\n\nIn addition to this busy TV schedule, Scott had also worked as a regular contributor to ESPN: The Magazine, ESPN Radio, and ESPN.com.\n\nScott was featured in countless This is SportsCenter commercials, which he so enjoyed.\n\nMost recently, Scott was in the anchor chair alongside his longtime partner, Steve Levy, when ESPN re-launched SportsCenter on a new set.\n\nScott not only interviewed most of the world\u2019s top athletes, he interviewed top celebrities, newsmakers, and politicians. Stuart interviewed and played a televised game of one-on-one basketball with President Barack Obama, one of his two interviews with the President, and conducted numerous one-on-one interviews with the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Denzel Washington and President Clinton.\n\nHollywood and Madison Avenue also took notice of Scott\u2019s wide appeal; he was featured in numerous high-profile commercial campaigns. He appeared on many TV shows, sitcoms, feature films and music videos and was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit.\n\nOver the years, Scott earned numerous awards and honors. He was recently honored with the NABJ Award of Merit, received a Rammy Award which pays tribute to superlative performances in athletics, academics and sports from his beloved alma mater, UNC-Chapel Hill, and was a guest of honor at the 14th annual \u201cAn Evening with Heroes\u201d celebration in Indianapolis, which benefits the Heroes Foundation. In 2011 he was honored by The V Foundation with \u201cThe Spirit of Jimmy V Award.\u201d He was instrumental in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for The V Foundation, Livestrong, and participated in Stand Up To Cancer campaigns as well donating time to raise awareness and funds for numerous other charities.\n\nHe always said a personal and professional highlight for him came in 2004, when he was requested by U.S. soldiers to be a part of \u201cESPN\u2019s SportsCenter: Salute the Troops\u201d effort, in which he and fellow anchors hosted a week of programs originating in Kuwait.\n\nPrior to joining ESPN, Scott worked at local stations in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Florence, South Carolina. He was graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1987. One of his proudest moments came when he served as the commencement speaker at his alma mater in 2001.\n\nAt North Carolina he played wide receiver and defensive back for a club football team.\n\nHe was diagnosed with cancer in November 2007, and dealt with recurring bouts of the disease. He met the challenge as he did everything in his life \u2013 with determination, a courageous fighting spirit and an always positive attitude that impacted and inspired everyone who knew him.\n\nHere's Scott accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs in 2014:\n\nRich Eisen was Scott's coanchor on SportsCenter for many years. Now at the NFL Network, Eisen made a poignant statement regarding Scott on live TV after the news of his death:\n\nScott's style \u2014 energetic and playful with language borrowed from the hip-hop world \u2014 made him one of the most influential broadcasters of his era. To get a sense of what made him so great, here he is announcing the highlights of the 1998 Duke-North Carolina game:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, an avid ESPN viewer, released the following statement:\n\nI will miss Stuart Scott. Twenty years ago, Stu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day's best plays. For much of those twenty years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family \u2014 but wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on SportsCenter were there. Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us \u2014 with courage and love. Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and colleagues."}, {"url": "https://www.sportscasting.com/espns-stuart-scott-performed-a-selfless-act-before-his-tragic-death/", "page_content": "The internet barely mattered when Stuart Scott was making his debut as a SportsCenter anchor in 1997. ESPN was still king when it came to delivering the sports news and highlights that fans craved. The network\u2019s flagship show made stars out of the likes of Chris Berman, Dan Patrick, and Keith Olbermann.\n\nAll were respected, but none came to be as beloved as Scott, whose trademark phrases at times overshadowed his smooth delivery and sharp writing. When Scott died on Jan. 4, 2015, athletes and coaches across multiple sports joined fans in mourning the loss.\n\nThe best of Stuart Scott\u2019s on-air magic\n\nStuart Scott came to ESPN by way of the NBC affiliate in Orlando, Florida. He started out by contributing to ESPN2 shows, eventually taking Keith Olbermann\u2019s place on SportsNight. In 1997, Scott got the call to take on the 2 a.m. ET edition of SportsCenter alongside Rich Eisen.\n\nWith the exception of occasional West Coast games that ran late, that edition of the show was the most complete version and was re-run throughout the morning. It brought Scott and his witty phrases to a broad audience of sports fans. Some of his trademark expressions included:\n\n\u201cBoo-yah!\u201d\n\n\u201cAs cool as the other side of the pillow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe treats him like a dog: Sit, stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust call him butter because he\u2019s on a roll.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I get a witness from the congregation?\u201d\n\nThose might seem out of place for a show wrapping up the day\u2019s news across the sports world, but they were part of a personality that helped keep fans tuning in at 2 a.m. on the East Coast.\n\nScott\u2019s role continued to grow, including hosting NBA shows on ESPN and ABC, and anchoring on-site coverage of Monday Night Football.\n\nA cancer diagnosis in 2007 changed his life\n\nWhile in Pittsburgh for a Monday Night Football assignment, Stuart Scott experienced stomach pain and underwent an appendectomy, after which lab testing determined the presence of cancer. Scott had additional surgery that same week, followed in the fall by the start of chemotherapy.\n\nScott received a second cancer diagnosis in 2011 and then a third in January 2013 that required radiation treatments and additional chemotherapy. By midway through the following year, the disease could no longer be contained by medical science.\n\nDuring the annual ESPYs in July 2014, Stuart Scott received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award. Evoking memories of North Carolina State coach Jim Valvano\u2019s speech when he was in the late stages of cancer, Scott told the audience, \u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d\n\nScott was just 49 years old when he died on Jan. 4, 2015.\n\nESPN\u2019s Stuart Scott performed a selfless act\n\nAt the time of Stuart Scott\u2019s death, CBS News reported that his appendiceal cancer diagnosis was so rare that the American Cancer Society couldn\u2019t estimate how often it occurred or what the mortality rate of the disease was. One estimate indicated fewer than 1,000 U.S. cases per year.\n\nThe network report said Scott never discussed his exact diagnosis, but he did share some of the details of his treatment.\n\n\u201cI just got out of the hospital this past Friday,\u201d he said at the 2014 ESPYs. \u201cSeven days stay. Man, I crashed. I had liver complications. I had kidney failure. I had four surgeries in a span of seven days. I had tubes and wires running in and out of every part of my body. Guys, when I say every part of my body: every part of my body.\u201d\n\nA video introducing Scott before his speech showed him having blood drawn during an examination. Johns Hopkins Hospital doctors were looking for clues to help treat the ESPN anchor and host, but Scott had an additional motivation, according to The Undefeated.\n\nThe blood work that day would determine whether Stuart Scott qualified for a clinical trial research study. Although there was no guarantee that Scott would benefit directly from treatments administered in the clinical trial, there was the potential to help others battling the rare form of cancer.\n\nAccording to the website, Scott joined the clinical trial based upon the test results. What doctors learned in the course of his treatment would contribute to decisions they made in the treatment of future patients, perhaps serving to prolong or even save lives.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a cure for cancer, an extension of the time that you do have is really important,\u201d Taelor Scott said in discussing her father. \u201cAnd I think that that should be an availability and something that everyone gets to kind of participate in and benefit from.\u201d\n\nLike Sportscasting on Facebook.

Scott joined ESPN in 1993 as an anchor for ESPN2 and became one of the best known SportsCenter anchors.\n\nScott began batting cancer in 2007, with the most recent recurrence taking place two years ago. Throughout his cancer battle, he regularly appeared on-air, anchoring ABC\u2019s coverage of the NBA Finals from 2008-11 and hosting Monday Night Countdown on-site during the NFL season. That was in addition to his regular presence on SportsCenter.\n\nAs recently as last summer, he handled the NBA Finals trophy presentation and anchored the first SportsCenter from its new studio.\n\nScott received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at last year\u2019s ESPYs, delivering a speech in which he memorably noted: \u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://time.com/3652980/stuart-scott-impact/", "page_content": "Stuart Scott\u2019s impact can be measured in Sunday\u2019s outpouring of affection for him after news of his death, at 49 from cancer, broke. It cut across all sports, all silos of American culture, from LeBron James to Tiger Woods to Barack Obama to Nicki Minaj. It can be seen in Hannah Storm, the seasoned television professional who couldn\u2019t hold back her tears while eulogizing her colleague on live TV Sunday morning, or Rich Eisen, Scott\u2019s straight-man for many years on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter, who cut into the NFL Network\u2019s pregame playoff coverage to offer a raw, touching tribute.\n\nScott\u2019s legacy can be seen, and will be felt, in his last ESPN appearance, the speech he delivered at the ESPY awards in July, upon accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award. \u201cIt was a miracle that he was even there,\u201d says ESPN senior vice president Mark Gross, one of Scott\u2019s first producers at the network. \u201cHe was in tough shape.\u201d Scott\u2019s colleague and friend, ESPN anchor Sage Steele, was afraid that Scott, weak from his cancer battle, might fall down the stairs as he walked onto the stage. But he didn\u2019t, and Scott nailed it. \u201cWhen you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live,\u201d he said. \u201cSo live. Live. Fight like hell. And when you get too tired to fight, lay down and rest, and let somebody else fight for you.\u201d\n\nSay what you want about ESPN\u2019s stranglehold on sports media. Sure, the debate shows can stink, some SportsCenter schtick gets tiring. But between Scott\u2019s virtuoso performance in July, and Jim Valvano\u2019s \u201cNever Give Up\u201d speech back in 1993, the network\u2019s personalities have offered two of the most most memorable rallying cries against that awful disease. Nothing but goosebumps.\n\nNeed more evidence of Scott\u2019s singular impact? Just think about how hard it is to remember that he once had many haters. Scott got hate mail, because he infused his broadcast with hip-hop references. \u201cSome of the viewing audience wasn\u2019t used to it, wasn\u2019t with it,\u201d says Gross. \u201cBut Stuart never backed off.\u201d Over the past decade, every time Scott showed up to anchor an NBA Finals, or a Monday Night Football game, it was a reminder to those who watched his early days at ESPN, in the mid-1990s, that Scott\u2019s style more than prevailed. It became the standard.\n\nWhen Scott came along, sure, there had been African-American broadcasters at ESPN. And there had been SportsCenter catchphrases. But no one was saying \u201cyo\u201d and \u201cbrotha\u201d on the air. No one was screaming \u201cBooyah!\u201d No one said \u201cSwoopes there it is,\u201d paying clear homage to hip-hop songs and culture, when WNBA player Sheryl Swoopes made nice play.\n\nAt a time when hip-hop was ascendent, in both the inner-cities and amongst the white kids at the suburban shopping malls, no one on SportsCenter was talking directly to them, until Stuart Scott. No one had that swagger. No one, to borrow Scott\u2019s best metaphor, was \u201cas cool as the other side of the pillow.\u201d\n\nAnd sure, many folks wanted those kids to turn their music down. But in the end, Jay Z became royalty. Obama got elected. And Stuart Scott made it to Monday Night Football, the NBA Finals, and Saturday Night Live.\n\n\u201cYes, he brought hip-hop into the conversation,\u201d SportsCenter anchor Jay Harris said in Scott\u2019s ESPN.com obituary. \u201cBut I would go further than that. He brought in the barber shop, the church, R&B, soul music. Soul, period.\u201d\n\nLord knows that sports, too often ruthless and crass, can use it. RIP Stuart. We\u2019ll dearly miss your spirit.

Diagnosed with cancer three times in less than a decade, the SportsCenter anchor died earlier this year at the age of 49, leaving behind his girlfriend, ex-wife, and two teenage daughters, who he memorably thanked while accepting the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the ESPY Awards this past July. Esquire reached out to Scott's co-author, veteran Philadelphia journalist Larry Platt (Only the Strong Survive: The Odyssey of Allen Iverson), about their partnership on the book during the catchphrase-coining sportscaster's final months.\n\nHow did you first meet Stuart?\n\nA little over a year ago, my agent, David Black, called and said, \"What do you think of Stuart Scott?\" and I said I was basically a fan. I'd read headlines about him having cancer, but [Black] said, \"Well he wants to write a book.\" So I had a phone conversation with him and then I drove up to Connecticut and spent the day with him, and was pretty excited after that because he didn't want to write just another sports media memoir. He wanted to\u2014as he said\u2014\"Keep it real and do something raw.\" Also he didn't want it to be so much about a guy facing death as about a guy who learns how to live. Then I just started hanging out with him and mind-melding for the next eight or nine months. I'd accompany him when he was getting chemo, or just hang out with him at his daughter's soccer practice\u2014we'd sit in the car and talk. And then last fall when he got hospitalized for that lengthy 75-day stay, we were on the phone all the time.\n\nLast week you referred to him as \"the Jackie Robinson of sports broadcasting.\" Can you expand on that analogy?\n\nThere are others who might disagree, and Stuart would never say [laughs], \"I'm the Jackie Robinson.\" If you think back to the mid-90s, the sort of hip-hop/athlete came to prominence. It kind of started with the Fab Five in college basketball at Michigan; Allen Iverson coming to the NBA, the first to wear cornrows and tattoos, have a rap album. So you had this cultural influence in sports, but it never made its way into the sports broadcasting booth until this young African American appears on ESPN saying things like, \"Cool as the other side of the pillow\" and talking in this hyperbolic way of youth culture at the time. And it totally resonated with that demographic. And with young black athletes. I mean, there's no question that they heard for the first time an announcer speaking like them. And there was a lot of backlash or \"blacklash,\" and it wasn't so much from ESPN executives as it was from other journalists, pundits, critics. But for Stuart it was just about being who he is and talking about sports\u2014on the air\u2014the way he would talk with his boys or in his living room.\n\nAs a fellow journalist watching his career from afar, did you agree with critics who felt that he was too friendly with certain athletes?\n\nNo, I thought he was celebratory. Here was this character who clearly loved this game, whatever that game might be\u2014football, basketball, or whatever. And I never thought that the role of a SportsCenter anchor or pre-game interviewer was to be Woodward and Bernstein. But, he very consciously sought to elicit information in interviews. It was in a way, as he says, that was meant to explain not judge. That's also what I think attracted an audience: he wasn't this \"gotcha!\" guy.\n\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n\nIt was a fluke, but Stuart attended college with Michael Jordan.\n\nHe wasn't that close to Jordan. The one professional bone Jordan threw him was whenever he did a Sunday Conversation with ESPN, he always wanted it to be Stuart. And that, as Stuart says in the book, wasn't so much because of Stuart as it was loyalty to UNC. Michael would go out of his way to empower UNC grads. They were friendly; frankly, as the writer, I wished they had been better friends. In fact I went into this thinking that they were closer friends.\n\nWas the book intended to be posthumous?\n\nNo, it was initially scheduled to be released Father's Day [2015]. Then around October, when he was in the hospital still, the decision was made to move it up to March. We didn't know how this was going to play out, but the publisher wanted to make sure that Stuart was able to hold it in his hands. We didn't make that but that was the goal. It was early December that we turned the manuscript in. He died January 4.\n\nDid your last conversation feel like it was going to be the last conversation?\n\nYeah, in retrospect. [Choked up] I just thanked him for trusting me with his story.\n\nHow did you find out that he'd died?\n\nI got a text message from a buddy of mine at like seven or eight in the morning and it woke me up. It was condolences. Just the night before, I had spoken to one of Stuart's closest friends and neither of us knew that the end was that imminent.\n\nWhen a book's narrator has an illness, he or she often becomes humble. I was surprised that Stuart knew and articulated that he was damn good at his job.\n\nYeah I think that's the athlete in him. It's the same clutch attitude, some would say \"cocky\" attitude, that enabled him to hit a walk-off with the ESPY speech. He's shaky when he first stands up, and then by the time he's approaching the stage, he's got this strut, he's got this swagger.\n\nAnother thing that struck me as atypical for a \"cancer memoir\" was that he shared anecdotes where he could come across as off-putting. Like refusing to gab with limo drivers and an encounter that took place in an ESPN hallway.\n\nThis was when he was sort of younger in the 90s and had more of a chip on his shoulder when it came to race. He and two African American colleagues were standing in a hallway and a white dude walks by and says like, \"Must be a party.\" And Stuart stops him and says, \"Oh really? A party? Why isn't it a summit? Three brothers in a hallway and its got to be a party?\" Really in-your-face. And that's part of going back to literally the first day we met when he said he wanted to keep this real and be raw. In the retelling he says, \"Now look, I wouldn't handle this this way today. But that's what I did.\"\n\nWhy include that story in the book?\n\nBecause it's who he was, and by the way, he was not distancing himself from his point. His point was that he was a big personality\u2014proud black man coming into a pretty lily-white environment\u2014and he was going to be a change agent. Last week I did the [Keith] Olbermann show in New York and then the publisher sent a car to drive me to ESPN to do a day's worth of interviews. In the car, the limo driver was making small talk with me and I actually said\u2014and this is so out of character for me\u2014\"Hey man, I really don't feel like talking right now\" [laughs]. And that was sort of my silent homage to Stuart. I texted [Stuart's girlfriend] Kristin [Spodobalski] because I knew she'd think it was funny. What struck me is when he said, \"Someone bumps into you. What's the first thing you say? 'Excuse me.' Like, what? Someone bumped into me. I'm not going to say, 'Excuse me.'\" This is something that cancer gave him\u2014he was always aware of his energy level, and always knew that he needed time to recharge. So having a conversation with a limo driver just to be polite is betraying his own body's needs. I love the directness of that.\n\nIn January, Stuart's funeral took place in Raleigh, NC, and \"Rapper's Delight\" played as the casket left the church. You attended ESPN's memorial in February. What are your memories of the Bristol, CT service?\n\nIn the book Stuart talks about how he often had to recalibrate his life's goals, and that his goal was to be there for his daughters' weddings. And of course he didn't make that. But Stuart had picked the song to be played at their weddings, and [his younger daughter] Sydni, who's this amazing singer, came up and sang the song and it was the most moving thing. It was beautiful. And they ended with cellphone video footage of a late-night bar room karaoke rap where he's laying down some flow, with, among others, Charles Barkley. I forget what the rap was, but it was Stu dropping some knowledge.\n\nEvery Day I Fight is .

Guys, when I say every part of my body: every part of my body.\u201d\n\nA video introducing Scott before his speech showed him having blood drawn during an examination. Johns Hopkins Hospital doctors were looking for clues to help treat the ESPN anchor and host, but Scott had an additional motivation, according to The Undefeated.\n\nThe blood work that day would determine whether Stuart Scott qualified for a clinical trial research study. Although there was no guarantee that Scott would benefit directly from treatments administered in the clinical trial, there was the potential to help others battling the rare form of cancer.\n\nAccording to the website, Scott joined the clinical trial based upon the test results. What doctors learned in the course of his treatment would contribute to decisions they made in the treatment of future patients, perhaps serving to prolong or even save lives.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a cure for cancer, an extension of the time that you do have is really important,\u201d Taelor Scott said in discussing her father. \u201cAnd I think that that should be an availability and something that everyone gets to kind of participate in and benefit from.\u201d\n\nLike Sportscasting on Facebook.

Although ESPN had few African American sportscasters, one changed the game of sports reporting and that man was Stuart Scott. Scott was born in Chicago, Illinois but grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He grew up around sports and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he played wide receiver and defensive back. Stuart Scott graduated from UNC at Chapel Hill in 1987 with a Speech Communication, BA.\n\nAfter graduation, Scott worked for many local news stations as a news reporter but finally got his big break in 1993 when he joined the newly launched ESPN 2. ESPN 2 wanted to appeal to a younger audience and Scott brought a style that was fitting for a younger audience: a hip-hop style of reporting with the excitement of a fan watching their sport. Scott was quickly worked up the ranks as he was assigned to \u201cSportsSmash\u201d then ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter.\u201d As a regular on SportsCenter with the likes of Rich Eisen and Steve Levy, Stuart Scott continued to expand his role with ESPN by being the studio host of the NBA on ESPN, coverage of the NBA Finals, Monday Night Countdown, MLB playoffs, and the NCAA Final Four. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Scott interviewed and played one-on-one basketball with soon to be elected President Barack Obama.\n\nStuart Scott\u2019s style of sports reporting was unlike anyone else. His ability to combine hip-hop culture with sport was new to sports reporting and ESPN. People criticized Scott\u2019s style of reporting and according to a a piece in USA Today in 2003, fans expressed their love and hate for his style. However, Scott continued to use hip-hop culture and is famous for his many catchphrases he used throughout his career. Those catchphrases included\u2026\n\nBoo-Yah\n\nAs cool as the other side of the pillow\n\nHe must be the bus driver cuz he was takin\u2019 him to school\n\nIn 2007 after having an appendectomy, Scott learned that he had cancer. That did not stop Scott from working as he continued to host the NBA on ESPN. In 2011 and 2013, Scott\u2019s cancer returned and he under went chemotherapy. At the 2014 ESPY Awards on July 16, 2014, Scott was honored with the Jimmy V Award for his courage with his battle against cancer. During his speech Scott said \u201cYou beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d\n\nOn January 4, 2015, Stuart Scott lost his battle to cancer at the age of 49. His ESPN family honored him as they shared their memories of Scott. Stuart Scott will be remembered for how he changed the way sportscaster reported sports."}, {"url": "https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2015/01/stuart-scott-has-died/", "page_content": "One of the darkest days in ESPN\u2019s history has come to pass.\n\nLongtime SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott has died at the age of 49, following a lengthy and public battle with cancer. Scott joined ESPN in 1993 as an anchor for ESPN2 and became one of the best known SportsCenter anchors.\n\nScott began batting cancer in 2007, with the most recent recurrence taking place two years ago. Throughout his cancer battle, he regularly appeared on-air, anchoring ABC\u2019s coverage of the NBA Finals from 2008-11 and hosting Monday Night Countdown on-site during the NFL season. That was in addition to his regular presence on SportsCenter.\n\nAs recently as last summer, he handled the NBA Finals trophy presentation and anchored the first SportsCenter from its new studio.\n\nScott received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at last year\u2019s ESPYs, delivering a speech in which he memorably noted: \u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer.

While guys like Booger McFarland can find themselves in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, not every ESPN talking head becomes a target of criticism. Everyone, for example, loved to see Stuart Scott behind the SportsCenter desk.\n\nScott, however, is no longer working at ESPN or appearing on television. The beloved anchor tragically died in 2015 after battling cancer.\n\nStuart Scott\u2019s road to ESPN\n\nIn the world of sports, very few athletes simply arrive in the pros as fully-formed stars; most ply their trade in college, the minor leagues, or other stops along the way. Similarly, Stuart Scott didn\u2019t start his career at ESPN.\n\nAfter high school, Scott headed to the University of Carolina. Ever the sports-lover, he played for the club football team and worked at the school radio station before graduating with a degree in speech communication. Armed with his college diploma, he landed a job at WPDE-TV in Florence, South Carolina; according to an ESPN feature after his death, that was where Scott came up with his iconic, \u201cas cool as the other side of the pillow.\u201d\n\nScott then moved further south, taking a job at WESH, Orlando, Florida\u2019s local NBC affiliate. There, he started making connections at ESPN\u2014he met producer Gus Ramsey and crossed paths with Chris Berman\u2014and eventually got the call to join the network.\n\nScott started out on ESPN2, appearing in \u201cSportsSmash\u201d segments in the larger SportsNight program. From there, his star just kept rising.\n\nBecoming an iconic \u2018SportsCenter\u2019 anchor\n\nWhile Stuart Scott took over as the host of SportsNight after Keith Olberman moved to SportsCenter, it looked like that was as far as he would go. On one morning in 1997, everything changed.\n\n\u201cScott figured ESPN executives kept him on the Deuce for one reason: They thought he was a mere catchphrase guy,\u201d Brian Curtis explained on The Ringer. \u201cIn August 1997, Scott got a chance to prove them wrong when he was paired with Rich Eisen on SportsCenter\u2019s 2 AM edition.\u201d\n\nWhile anchoring the early morning SportsCenter could be a slog, it came with a major perk: that episode would keep running through the morning. That meant a generation of sports fans grew up listening to Scott; his \u201cBoo-Yahs\u201d and \u201cHallah\u201d became the soundtrack of getting up and preparing for school.\n\n\u201cMid- to late \u201990s, I\u2019m in high school,\u201d Michael Smith, who went on to work at ESPN and host SportsCenter, told Curtis. \u201cWhen you see somebody that looks and sounds a lot like you, or a lot like the people you know and look up to, the message is not just: You can do this. The message is: You can do this in your authentic way and be yourself.\u201d\n\nThe tragic death of Stuart Scott\n\nAfter making a name for himself on SportsCenter, Stuart Scott did just about everything possible on ESPN. While he covered the NBA Finals, hosted game shows, and became a part of the sports landscape, his career would come to a tragic end.\n\nIn 2007, Scott needed to have his appendix removed; after the procedure, doctors discovered that he had cancer. Despite numerous surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy, though, the iconic anchor didn\u2019t quit. He kept hitting the gym and, more visibly, appearing on television.\n\nIn July 2014, Scott received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs, in honor of his fight against cancer. In a moment reminiscent of the NC State coach\u2019s iconic speech, the SportsCenter anchor told the world, \u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d\n\nOn January 4, 2015, Scott died at age 49.

His most famous catchphrases \u2014 \u201cBooyah!\u201d and \u201cAs cool as the other side of the pillow\u201d \u2014 have become part of pop culture; Scott was even parodied on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott,\u201d ESPN president John Skipper said in a statement. \u201cWho engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments? Who leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set? His energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.\u201d\n\nAt this year\u2019s ESPY Awards in July, Scott was presented with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award, named after college basketball coach and ESPN sportscaster Jim Valvano (who died of cancer in 1993). In Scott\u2019s acceptance speech, he said about his two daughters: \u201cTaelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here tonight because of you.\u201d\n\nDuring his ESPYs speech, Scott explained how he approached his fight against cancer. \u201cI said, I\u2019m not losing. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m not losing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to amend that. When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live. So live. Live. Fight like hell.\u201d\n\nStuart Scott's unforgettable speech when accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award in July. http://t.co/qzrJzF4vyp pic.twitter.com/lLRh9lqEQK \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 4, 2015\n\nOn ESPN, Scott anchored the 11 p.m. telecast of \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d and most recently was paired with his longtime partner Steve Levy on the show\u2019s new set. He also played major hosting roles for the sports programmer\u2019s NFL and NBA coverage, including the NBA Finals and Super Bowl, as well as the Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series, and the NCAA Final Four.\n\nFrom 2007-11, Scott hosted ABC Sports\u2019 weekly \u201cNBA Sunday\u201d studio show as well as ESPN\u2019s NBA show, and served as a host during the NBA Finals Trophy presentation each year.

He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1987, earning a bachelor of arts degree in speech communications and radio, television and motion pictures. While at UNC, he played wide receiver and defensive back for a club football team. He was born in Chicago, but his family moved to North Carolina when he was young.\n\nScott\u2019s cancer was identified after he became ill while covering the Steelers-Dolphins \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game on Nov. 26, 2007, and he underwent an emergency appendectomy that revealed a malignancy. Four years later, Scott was diagnosed with a recurrence of cancer, which entered remission in early 2012 before returning in January 2013.\n\nIn remembrance of Scott, the White House issued the following statement from President Obama: \u201cI will miss Stuart Scott. Twenty years ago, Stu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day\u2019s best plays. For much of those 20 years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family \u2014 but wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on \u2018SportsCenter\u2019 were there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us \u2014 with courage and love,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cMichelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\n\nESPN also posted a touching tribute video remembering Scott and honoring his legacy.\n\nScott is survived by his daughters, Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; his parents; and his three siblings, Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney and Susan Scott. His girlfriend, Kristin Spodobalski, was with Stuart and \u201ccared for him every step of the way,\u201d ESPN said.\n\nScott\u2019s family has requested that donations be made to The V Foundation."}]}
