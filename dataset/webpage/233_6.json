They needed a spectacular winner from the prolific Erling Haaland to complete the turnaround against Dortmund in September before playing over an hour with ten men in a goalless draw at Copenhagen.\n\nAfter a quiet display in the last-16 first leg against Leipzig, Haaland hit a record-breaking five goals in the return before adding two more to his tally in an emphatic last-eight triumph against Bayern. The goals came from elsewhere in the semi-finals, and City were perhaps as impressive as ever as they cruised past holders Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate.\n\nRoad to the final: Every Man City goal\n\nWhy they can go all the way\n\nCity have one of the game's most astute tacticians, phenomenal strength in depth and one of the best strikers of his generation at their disposal. Why shouldn't they lift the trophy in Istanbul in June? There are no guarantees in a competition where fine margins so often prove decisive, but Guardiola's team fear no one. With Lady Luck on their side, a maiden Champions League crown could be just around the corner.\n\nHow do Man City play?\n\nJohn Stones' role as part of a double pivot when City have possession \u2013 which is the majority of the time \u2013 has enabled Guardiola's team to exert even greater levels of control in games. Pinning opponents in their own half with a high defensive line, City circulate the ball with trademark ease until the relentless pressure finally tells. Unlike last season, when Guardiola often operated with a false nine, the Cityzens now have arguably the most prolific focal point in the game to finish off their free-flowing moves.\n\nCoach: Josep Guardiola\n\nOne of the most decorated coaches in world football, the 52-year-old won this competition twice with Barcelona but will be desperate to end his 12-year wait for a third triumph. Scooped three league titles apiece at the helm of the Catalan club and Bayern, and made it four Premier League winners' medals with City in 2021/22.\n\nKey player: Kevin De Bruyne\n\nHaaland would be the obvious choice \u2013 51 goals this season makes him pretty influential, after all \u2013 but De Bruyne remains a talismanic figure, contributing a constant supply of chances for the relentless Norwegian. The 31-year-old midfielder has assisted 28 goals in all competitions this term \u2013 his most in a single campaign for the club. The Belgian also has a habit of rising to the big occasion, with 11 of his 14 Champions League goals for City coming in the knockout stages.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAt 22 years 272 days old and after only 27 games, Haaland was both the youngest and the quickest player to reach 35 Champions League goals.\n\nErling Haaland: Every Champions League goal this season\n\nUEFA coefficient ranking: 11\n\nThis season: W7 D3 L2 F19 A10\n\nGroup C: Runners-up\n\nRound of 16: W 1-0agg vs Porto\n\nQuarter-finals: W 5-3agg vs Benfica\n\nSemi-finals: W 3-0agg vs Milan\n\nPedigree\n\nLast final appearance: 2010 (W 2-0 vs Bayern)\n\nLast season: Round of 16 (L 1-2agg vs Liverpool)\n\nBest European Cup performance: Winners (1963/64, 1964/65, 2009/10)\n\nCampaign so far\n\nWhile Inter have struggled for consistency in Serie A, the Nerazzurri have consistently performed in the Champions League. They qualified from a strong group including Bayern and Barcelona and have now reached the final after eliminating Porto, Benfica and Milan. They have put in six solid knockout stage performances, keeping five clean sheets in the process, and more than merited their 3-0 aggregate victory over their city rivals.\n\nEvery Inter goal on their road to the Champions League final\n\nWhy they can go all the way\n\nBecause this Inter side seemed designed to produce their best in big games. Just watch their results in all competitions in 2023. The Nerazzurri have often lost against lower-ranked teams in Serie A, but have always performed against the top sides. The game in Istanbul will be one of the biggest in the club's history.\n\nHow do Inter play?\n\nThe system is a 3-5-2, where wing-backs, namely Denzel Dumfries and Federico Dimarco, are required to cover the entire flank. One of the three midfielders is a deep-lying playmaker: Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu is now preferred to Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 for this role. The two other midfielders, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, lead the pressing and support the attackers. Edin D\u017eeko and Romelu Lukaku are alternating as attacking partners for Lautaro Mart\u00ednez to great effect. A nice dilemma for Simone Inzaghi in Istanbul.\n\nCoach: Simone Inzaghi\n\nA Serie A and three-time Coppa Italia winner as a player with Lazio, the 46-year-old also brought a domestic cup to Rome during his five seasons in charge. Took over from Antonio Conte in 2021, winning the domestic Super Cup and Coppa Italia in his first campaign at the helm.\n\nKey player: Lautaro Mart\u00ednez\n\nNicknamed 'The Bull', Mart\u00ednez ended the 2021/22 campaign with 25 goals in 49 appearances across all competitions \u2013 his best haul since arriving in Milan from Racing Club in 2018. Formed a prolific partnership with Lukaku, who returned from Chelsea but did not play much in the first half of the season due to injury. The pair combined expertly for Mart\u00ednez's second-leg winner against Milan.\n\nDid you know?\n\nInzaghi could become the first Italian coach to lead Inter to European glory. The Nerazzurri's previous triumphs in the competition were under Helenio Herrera (1964 and 1965) and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (2010).\n\n2010 highlights: Inter's last Champions League glory\n\nDonate to aid communities impacted by the recent earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria."}, {"url": "https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/rb-leipzig-psg-champions-league-live-line-ups-stats-neymar-mbappe-upamecano-12433", "page_content": "RB Leipzig's incredible run to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals came to an end at the final-four stage after defeat to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nAs it happened!\n\nRB Leipzig 0-3 Paris Saint-Germain\n\nGoals: 0-1 Marquinhos (13'), 0-2 Di Maria (42'), 0-3 Bernat (56')\n\nFULL TIME!\n\nLeipzig's incredible journey through the Champions League in 2019/20 comes to an end. A season that will never be forgotten by the club and Die Roten Bullen fans as they reached the semi-finals of a European competition for the very first time. Nagelsmann and his side will be back in the tournament again in 2020/21 and will want to repeat their success of this season.\n\n90' - ADDED TIME\n\nWe'll have two mintues of added time here with Leipzig continuing to press forward.\n\n82' - NO LUCK FOR LEIPZIG\n\nSuperb play going forward as the ball is played across the face of the PSG goal with pace and Forsberg is there to hit it at goal. It bounces back off his own man though in Poulsen and the rebound is cleared. Orban is on in place of Klostermann here, too.\n\n80' - LEIPZIG SHOWING HEART\n\nThe Bundesliga side are not giving up on this at all besides the fact that luck just has not been on their side tonight. Mistakes have been made and they have not seen the ball fall their way at the other end in what has been a frustrating evening, but Nagelsmann's side will never let it go easily.\n\n75' - BIG CHANCE FOR LEIPZIG\n\nAngelino fires a shot at goal from the edge of the box and Rico can only parry it down in front of him. To Leipzig's annoyance, the rebound just doesn't fall to a white shirt and instead PSG can break.\n\n72' - GULACSI MAKES BIG SAVES\n\nMbappe is played in on goal with Upamecano trying to battle back. The French forwards gets a shot past his compatriot put Gulacsi raises a big fist to beat the shot away before Gulacsi saves again after a long-range effort from Paredes.\n\n70' - NOW OR NEVER FOR LEIPZIG\n\nApproaching the final 20 minutes here in Lisbon and Leipzig are reaching last-chance-saloon. It's been a frustrating evening so far but there's still time to change their fortunes. At the moment, though, it's PSG both in control of the scoreline and the ball as they remain one pass ahead of the Bundesliga side.\n\n64' - ANOTHER LEIPZIG CHANGE\n\nAdams is now on in central midfield, replacing Kampl for Leipzig. Fresh legs are on the pitch and fresh motivation. One goal can spark a comeback here if the Bundesliga side can get it...\n\n62' - LEIPZIG CHANGE\n\nHalstenberg now comes on, replacing Laimer just after the hour mark. He goes onto the left side of Leipzig's three-man defence.\n\n60' - GREAT START TO SECOND HALF UNDONE\n\nLeipzig now have to maintain belief that they can get back into this game. There is still 30 minutes to go and that's plenty of time in football, as we have seen in the Bundesliga over the years. It's been a much brighter start for Nagelsmann's side in this second half but once again, their own mistakes are letting them down here.\n\n56' - PSG HAVE A THIRD\n\nMore defensive struggles for Leipzig as Mukiele is looking to bring the ball out of defence and goes down too easily. Di Maria gathers possession and crosses into the box for Bernat who heads at goal and it goes over the line before Neymar smashes it over the line again.\n\n52' - FORSBERG HAS A GO\n\nThe substitute comes inside from the left flank and has a touch of space ahead of him. Rather than go for a pass he punts for a shot at goal but his effort is always rising. Leipzig have continued their strong start, however, and are causing PSG problems.\n\n50' - BETTER START FROM LEIPZIG\n\nNagelsmann's side have controlled almost all of the ball here so far having returned to a three-man defence, with Schick and Poulsen leading the line and Sabitzer, Kampl and Forsberg pulling the strings in the midfield. Promising start.\n\n46' - KICK-OFF!\n\nWe're back underway for the second half here and there have been two changes for Leipzig. Schick is on for Olmo and Forsberg is on for Nkunku as Nagelsmann's changes his style of attack.\n\nHALF-TIME!\n\nIt must be said, Paris Saint-Germain were in good form in the first half here. But the reality is that a set-piece and a defensive mistake from Leipzig have PSG two goals to the good. A disappointing first half to say the least for Nagelsmann and his side, but they are by no means out of this one yet. A huge half-time team talk coming from the German coach.\n\n44' - ALMOST THREE FOR PSG\n\nThe French side break once again down the right and it's Mbappe who is sent away into the Leipzig box. He looks up and cuts the ball back for Neymar, but he miscues his shot towards the near post. Leipzig are getting their time on the ball but aren't making the most of it, and are struggling to contain the French attack at the other end. Half-time will be crucial for Nagelsmann and his side.\n\n42' - PSG TWO AHEAD\n\nLeipzig hand PSG a second as Gulacsi's pass out from the back is misplaced and goes to the French side. The ball is played forward and Neymar flicks it beyond the Leipzig defence to Di Maria behind him, who then slots the ball past Gulacsi.\n\n38' - LACKLUSTER LEIPZIG\n\nNagelsmann's men have been a bit flustered by the occasion perhaps so far. Leipzig have given the ball away far more easily than they did against Atletico, and have conceded too many fouls for Nagelsmann's liking. He will be hoping his side can keep this at 1-0 into the break in order to re-group fully, as the tactician will certainly have some tricks up his sleeve for the second half.\n\n35' - NEYMAR HITS THE POST\n\nThe Brazilian goes for goal from all of 35 yards, wide right from the Leipzig box. Gulacsi is expecting a cross from the PSG free-kick and has to scramble back towards his own goal and he sees the ball bounce away off the post once again.\n\n33' - LEIPZIG CONCEDING PLENTY OF FOULS\n\nThe Bundesliga side have already committed 12 fouls so far tonight, but the tackling has been no firmer than they are used to making in the German top-flight. They are sticking to their guns with high-pressing and hard-fought challenges throughout the pitch.\n\n30' - MIDFIELD BATTLE HERE\n\nIn the last five minutes the ball has stayed almost exclusively in the middle of the pitch. Leipzig and PSG's midfield can barely be separated with Nagelsmann's side pressing well to make things difficult for the French side going forward. At the other end, Olmo, Nkunku and Poulsen are taking time to click again - as they did against Atletico.\n\n25' - BIG CHANCE FOR POULSEN\n\nLeipzig break well down the right and it's superb work from Laimer who battles his way into the PSG box. He's able to look up and spot Poulsen's run towards the near post and the Dane meets his pass, but his shot glances wide past the near post of Rico's goal. If that had been on target, it would have been tough to stop.\n\n23' - SABITZER FREE-KICK BLOCKED\n\nA good chance for Leipzig after Olmo was brought down 20 yards from the PSG goal. His free-kick was blocked behind, however, with the wall doing it's job and the chance goes away. But good work from Nagelsmann's side forcing their way forward again here. Still early days.\n\n20' - SILVA TAKES A KNOCK\n\nThe PSG captain has been taking some treatment after a hit to the face during a Leipzig corner but he will be able to carry on. Leipzig now just seeing more of the ball and being able to play their game slightly. But their French opposition are also pressing high and well.\n\n17' - HUGE SAVE FROM GULACSI\n\nHerrera plays Mbappe in behind the Leipzig defence into the penalty area and he goes for goal first-time, but Gulacsi is out quickly to close the angle and he's able to make an important save at his near post. Leipzig with their backs against the wall at the moment, but that won't faze them.\n\n16' - LEIPZIG PRESSING HARD\n\nPSG have enjoyed most of the possession here in the early goings but Leipzig have not allowed things to be easy for them. Most of the ball has been played around the PSG defence due to Leipzig's pressing. The Bundesliga side just need to keep the ball longer when they get it.\n\n13' - PSG TAKE THE LEAD\n\nDi Maria curls a free-kick into the Leipzig box and Marquinhos runs free to put the ball past Gulacsi with a header. An early goal for the French side, and plenty of time for Leipzig to respond.\n\n9' - SABITZER HAS A GO\n\nThe Austrian has time to turn around outside the PSG box looking for a pass. In the end, he decides to go for goal with the space afforded to him, but he doesn't get the connection he'd have hoped for on the ball and Rico makes a save.\n\n7' - PSG HAVE THE BALL IN THE NET, BUT...\n\nGulacsi's attempted clearance is blocked by Neymar and falls to Mbappe to easily put into the Leipzig net, but the play is called back as Neymar handled the ball in order to block it. A fast start to this game with chances for both sides.\n\n6' - NEYMAR HITS THE POST\n\nA tidy move from PSG as Mbappe is given time to turn and find a pass through the Leipzig defence for Neymar to run onto. He puts the ball beyond Gulacsi but it clips the outside of the post and goes out of play. First warning sign for Leipzig.\n\n5' - FOUR-MAN DEFENCE\n\nLeipzig and Nagelsmann have changed things up here, returning to a four-man defence with Mukiele at right-back and Angelino at left-back. Nkunku and Olmo remain the main supports for Poulsen up top.\n\n4' - FIRST CHANCE FOR LEIPZIG!\n\nUpamecano finds Olmo in space in midfield and he turns well to find Nkunku with his back to goal in the PSG box. The Frenchman turns and shoots, but his effort is blocked and bounces through to Rico in the French goal. A great start here from Leipzig.\n\n1' - KICK-OFF!\n\nWe're underway in Lisbon for this huge night in Leipzig's history. Can they reach the final? Let's find out...\n\n10 MINUTES TO GO!\n\nLeipzig will be finishing up their warm-ups now before returning to the changing rooms one last time before kick-off. It's a first time at this stage for all of these young players, one of the youngest squads in the entire competition this season. All of them will have dreamt of playing in a game like this tonight. Let's see if they can match their performance against Atletico to reach an incredible Champions League final, which could see them face Bundesliga rivals Bayern.\n\nADAMS WAITING IN THE WINGS\n\nLeipzig's match-winner against Atletico - USMNT star Tyler Adams - came on from the bench in the last round to make his mark and book his side's place in tonight's game. Once again, the midfielder is among the reinforcements for tonight, and he knows he's ready when he's needed.\n\n\"This fearless mentality that our team has, being such a young team, we go into these games thinking we can win everything. Confidence is key in these types of moments, but going out there and being able to execute is huge as well. I think that for a young team we have this fearless mentality, and obviously with a fearless coach it makes it a lot easier.\"\n\nClick here to read more!\n\nNAGELSMANN VS. TUCHEL\n\nWere it not for PSG coach Thomas Tuchel, Nagelsmann might not now be preparing Leipzig for a Champions League semi-final. Twelve years ago, Tuchel was coach of Augsburg's reserve team when centre-half Nagelsmann came to the realisation that his injured knee would not sustain a professional career. \"After my injury I didn't want to have anything to do with the sport,\" he told CNN. \"I wanted to get away for a while because I had invested so much time in it.\n\nClick here to read the full story on the friendship and mentorship between Nagelsmann and Tuchel, two German coaches made in the Bundesliga.\n\nNKUNKU AGAINST HIS FORMER SIDE\n\nThere's certainly a strong French connection in the Leipzig line-up tonight which will not only help them understand the PSG players on the pitch, but also how they want to play. Nkunku joined Leipzig last summer and faces the side who developed him through their academy tonight in his debut season in Germany. As well as Nkunku, of course, are Upamecano and Mukiele - both French themselves - who are tasked with stopping Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria tonight.\n\nFROM BUNDESLIGA 2 TO CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINALS\n\nThe Leipzig line-up tonight contains four of the seven players in Leipzig's squad that featured for them in their promotion-winning campaign in the Bundesliga 2 five years ago: Gulacsi, Klostermann, Sabitzer and Poulsen. The Danish striker, Poulsen, even captains the side once again with Orban - another of those seven, as well as Forsberg who has been with the club over the five years since their first days in the second division - out injured.\n\nLEIPZIG TEAMS NEWS\n\nJust one change for Leipzig from the win over Atletico Madrid. It sees Nordi Mukiele come into the three-man defence for Marcel Halstenberg, who picked up a head injury in the quarter-final. We will have to see whether it's Klostermann or Mukiele who starts on the left side of the defence, with Dayot Upamecano in the middle. Otherwise, it's all the start for Leipzig.\n\nWELCOME!\n\nWell ladies and gentleman, the next biggest night in RB Leipzig's history has arrived. After beating Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the quarter-finals, Nagelsmann and his side's reward is to face French Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain. It's the first time that Leipzig have reached this stage of any European competition and the first for PSG since 1994/95, but only one can move on to reach Sunday's final against either Bayern Munich or Lyon.\n\nLine-ups\n\nLeipzig: Gulacsi - Mukiele, Upamecano, Klostermann (Orban 83'), Angelino - Laimer (Halstenberg 62'), Kampl (Adams 64'), Sabitzer - Olmo (Schick 46'), Nkunku (Forsberg 46') - Poulsen (c)\n\nUnused subs: Mvogo, Tschauner, Haidara, Lookman, Novoa, Borkwoski, Wosz\n\nOut: Henrichs (ineligible), Hwang (ineligible), Konate (hip)\n\nCoach: Julian Nagelsmann\n\nPSG: Rico - Kehrer, Silva (c), Kimpembe, Bernat - Herrera (Verratti 83'), Marquinhos, Paredes (Draxler 83') - Di Maria (Sarabia 87'), Neymar, Mbappe\n\nUnused subs: Bulka, Innocent, Choupo-Moting, Icardi, Kurzawa, Diallo, Bakker, Gueye, Dagba\n\nOut: Areola (ineligible), Navas (hamstring)\n\nCoach: Thomas Tuchel\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?

The Monaco XI that reached the 2017 UCL semis\n\nIt was one of the most thrilling underdog runs seen in the Champions League for quite some time as Leanardo Jardim\u2019s Monaco battered their way to the semi-finals in 2016-17.\n\nManchester City and Borussia Dortmund were two of the big names to fall victim to Monaco\u2019s perfect blend of wily experience and youthful exuberance \u2013 and they ended up pipping PSG to the Ligue 1 title. But it is a side that would inevitably be torn apart soon after their semi-final defeat to Juventus.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Benjamin Mendy and, of course, Kylian Mbappe were all sold. But what happened to the side that beat Dortmund in their quarter-final second leg six years ago? We take a look at where they are now.\n\nGK: Danijel Subasic\n\nSubasic spent a further three years on the French Riviera before packing his bags in the summer of 2020.\n\nA year after the club\u2019s run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, the goalkeeper went one better on the international stage, reaching the World Cup final with Croatia, only to be undone by Mbappe and co. in Moscow.\n\nThe veteran spent a year out of the game as a free agent before rejoining Hajduk Split \u2013 whom Monaco signed him from back in 2012 \u2013 in 2021.\n\nAt the age of 38, he\u2019s now very much a backup \u2018keeper and has yet to play a minute this season. Although he has picked up a booking, which is impressive going.\n\nRB: Almamy Toure\n\nToure was a bit-part player for much of his time at the Stade Louis II but managed to make it into the side that played Dortmund thanks to the absence of Djibril Sidibe.\n\nThe youth graduate spent four seasons in the first team before seeking a fresh challenge, plumping for a move to Eintracht Frankfurt where he remains today.\n\nDebut Bundesliga goal \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCracking finish \u2714\ufe0f Almamy Tour\u00e9 won't be forgetting this one anytime soon \ud83d\udca5#BundesligaBangers pic.twitter.com/BDKHvCrCG8 \u2014 Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) April 24, 2020\n\nCB: Kamil Glik\n\nThe Poland legend was a rock at the back for Jardim\u2019s side in his first season. Joining in the summer of 2016, he became an ever-present, appearing in all 36 Ligue 1 games, and 13 of the club\u2019s European ones.\n\nHe left in 2020 to join Serie A side Benevento and he remains there today, having spent the last couple of years turning out for the club in the Italian second tier.\n\nCB: Jemerson\n\nOnce a first-choice centre-back in Monaco\u2019s Champions League campaign, Jemerson hasn\u2019t quite sustained those heights.\n\nJardim snapped him up from Atletico Mineiro in January 2016 and he played in 15 matches en-route to the semi-final the following season. October 2020 saw his contract terminated by mutual consent so he could return to Brazil with Corinthians, but he was released after less than a year with the club.\n\nAfter a brief stint with Metz he\u2019s now back in Brazil once again, turning out for boyhood club Atletico Madrid.\n\nLB: Benjamin Mendy\n\nHis form for Monaco earned a move to Pep Guardiola\u2019s Man City.\n\nMendy went on to make 50 Premier League appearances for City and remains contracted at the club, but he hasn\u2019t an appearance since 2021. Man City suspended him pending a trial after he was charged with multiple counts of rape and sexual assault.\n\nIn January he was found not guilty of six counts, but a further two charges will be retried in the summer.\n\nRW: Thomas Lemar\n\nLemar lived in Mbappe\u2019s shadow somewhat throughout the 2016-17 season but that did not stop the speculation machine from going into overdrive.\n\nThe Frenchman scored 14 goals in all competitions that season but still decided to wait for the right transfer. In the summer of 2018, Atletico Madrid splashed \u20ac70million on the winger.\n\nHe\u2019s had his moments since moving to the Spanish capital but hasn\u2019t shown consistency. At least has a La Liga winners medal to show for his efforts.\n\n\ud83d\udcab Thomas Lemar \ud83d\udd25 \ud83c\udf89 Wish the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid star a happy 23rd birthday! \ud83c\udf81#UCL pic.twitter.com/G4kIK4JQsD \u2014 UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) November 12, 2018\n\nDM: Tiemoue Bakayoko\n\nDefinitely one of the less inspiring success stories from this golden squad. After impressing at the heart of Monaco\u2019s midfield, Chelsea snapped him up for \u00a336million.\n\nIt is safe to say it was not worth that money. With just 43 appearances to his name in four seasons, it means Chelsea have paid around \u00a3800,000 for each appearance the Frenchman made.\n\nHe actually remains on their books today, but has been perenially loaned out \u2013 Milan, back to Monaco, Napoli and Milan once again.\n\nFunnily enough, Bakayoko now finds himself a Champions League semi-finalist once again, although he hasn\u2019t featured for the Rossoneri in Europe this season and has played just 38 minutes in Serie A.\n\nDM: Joao Moutinho\n\nFabinho \u2013 now at Liverpool, of course \u2013 likely would have featured for Monaco in the Dortmund quarter-final but was suspended.\n\nAnother member of the side\u2019s experienced spine, Moutinho waited until 2018 before also fleeing the Monaco nest, joining Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s Portuguese revolution at Wolves.\n\nThe midfield maestro was an essential cog in Jardim\u2019s machine, playing in all but one of their Champions League matches.\n\nMoutinho is now into his fifth season at Molineux but time finally appears to be catching up with him at the age of 36, stepping back into more of a fringe substitute role since the appointment of Julen Lopetegui.\n\nLW: Bernardo Silva\n\nOne of the club\u2019s standout creative forces in the 2016-17 campaign, Silva\u2019s electric performances in their last-16 clash with Manchester City clearly impressed Pep Guardiola.\n\nThat summer, City splashed \u00a345million on the attacking midfielder and his impact at the Etihad was immediate, directly contributing to 20 goals in 53 appearances as Pep won his first of three Premier League titles.\n\nIf anything, Silva has just got better and better over the years at the Etihad with his influence rarely waning.

They were seldom threatened by the much-vaunted Atl\u00e9tico in the round of 16, and backed that up with a job well done against Porto.\n\nKey player\n\nMason Mount initially became a regular fixture under Frank Lampard, but the England player's game has gone up a level since Thomas Tuchel arrived. He opened his UEFA Champions League account in the first leg against Porto, and is contributing plenty more besides on the biggest stage.\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nAppointed in January, new Blues boss Tuchel steered Paris to the UEFA Champions League final last season, as well as back-to-back Ligue 1 titles in 2019 and 2020. Before moving to France, he had success in Germany, leading Dortmund to cup glory in 2017.\n\nWhy they can win it\n\nStill beaten only twice since Tuchel took charge, Chelsea really are starting to gel under their German coach. If the front players can continue their progress of the past few months, there is nothing \u2013 and no one \u2013 for Chelsea to fear.

After winning Group C they posted home and away wins against both Gladbach and Dortmund to reach their first semi-final since 2016 still unbeaten.\n\nKey player\n\nCity have an embarrassment of riches but Kevin De Bruyne remains their creator-in-chief. His elegance, vision and immaculate passing range \u2013 not to mention his driving runs and spectacular finishing \u2013 make him one of the most enjoyable players to watch in world football. If still in doubt, check out his pass in the lead-up to Foden\u2019s first-leg winner against Dortmund.\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nIn 11 seasons as a first-team boss, Josep Guardiola has lifted eight league titles, but the last of his two managerial UEFA Champions League winners' medals came in 2011.\n\nWhy they can win it\n\nEngland\u2019s champions-elect have the bit between their teeth in Europe this season. Their attacking brilliance is long established but they\u2019ve added greater defensive solidity, with only three goals conceded in their ten games played so far.

Beaten twice in their opening three games, the French champions pulled up their socks to win their group, changed their coach and have raised the bar with stunning, ruthless wins away to Barcelona and Bayern.\n\nWatch all Paris' goals so far\n\nKey player\n\nSecond fiddle to Neymar in previous campaigns, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has seized the spotlight as he continues to fulfil his potential. The France striker did not get off the mark until Matchday 6, but since then the goals have flowed. Three at Barcelona, two in Munich \u2013 tie-winning contributions from a player whose pace, power and finishing take the breath away.\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nMauricio Pochettino ended a 13-month coaching hiatus when he took the Paris reins in January. The 49-year-old Argentinian reached the UEFA Champions League final with Tottenham in 2019 but departed before the close of the calendar year \u2013 the same fate as befell previous Paris boss Tuchel in 2020.\n\nWhy they can win it\n\nAny team that can win 4-1 at Barcelona and humble Bayern deserves to be feared.

While perhaps not as technically gifted as Toni Kroos, nor as artful as Luka Modri\u0107, the Brazilian is arguably the one of the midfield trio that Madrid dare not be without \u2013 as illustrated by his Player of the Match display at Anfield in the quarter-final second leg. He protects his back four so adeptly that he might well be the best player in his position in the world.\n\nWho's in charge?\n\nOne of the most vaunted players of his generation, Zidane's reputation as a coach was equally high after leading Madrid to three successive UEFA Champions League crowns. He quit in 2018, but returned for a second spell the following year.\n\nWhy they can win it\n\nThis is Real Madrid in the Champions League \u2013 enough said! They know how to get the job done in this tournament, even when not at their best, and they have a wealth of experience on and off the pitch.

Liverpool, Villarreal, Manchester City and Real Madrid have reached the semi-finals but only two of them will be able to make it to the final. Several teams have collapsed at this stage while others have succeeded.\n\nThe Champions League is Europe's premier competition\n\nThe Champions League has produced scintillating games season-after-season, especially in the semi-finals. Only the best of the best reach at this stage. A team that shows grit and will in this round, gets the opportunity to play in the final. But it is quite a task to get to the semi-finals as well.\n\nOn that note, let's take a look at five clubs with the most semi-final appearances in the Champions League era. (1992/93-2021/22)\n\n#5 Manchester United- 7\n\nManchester United v Atletico Madrid: Round Of Sixteen Leg Two - UEFA Champions League\n\nManchester United may not be at the top of the football pyramid anymore but are still one of the biggest clubs in the game. They also got through to the UCL knockout stages this season, only to be defeated by Atletico Madrid in the Round of 16 tie.\n\nHowever, during the days of Sir Alex Ferguson, the Red Devils would always go deep into the competition. The Old Trafford outfit have won the Champions League on three occasions, with two of them coming in the UCL era. But these numbers could have certainly been higher, especially since they have reached the semi-finals of the tournament seven times.\n\nMoreover, with the strength of his teams being better than most teams in Europe, Ferguson will regret not doing better in the tournament. It will now be down to Erik ten Hag to assemble a squad that can regularly reach the semi-finals of the UCL.\n\n#4 Chelsea- 8\n\nChelsea celebrate their victory against Manchester City in the 2021 UCL final\n\nChelsea have been one of the most successful English teams over the last two decades and for good reason. Since the late 90s and the early 2000s, the Blues have been regularly competing for the best trophies on the planet.\n\nOver the last 30 years, they have cemented themselves as one of the finest teams in world football and have won the UCL on two occasions. But they could have won several more if they had been a little more effective in the eight semi-finals they have reached in the Champions League era.\n\nThe West London club also had a chance to make it to another semi-final this season. However, Real Madrid denied them that opportunity with a thrilling comeback in their quarter-final tie.\n\nBar\u00e7a Universal @BarcaUniversal On this day, 10 years ago, Barcelona were knocked-out from the Champions League in the semi-finals against Chelsea.

The German side are the most successful side in their country and have been just as good in European competitions over the years.\n\nThe Bavarians have won the UCL trophy on six occasions but only three of them have come in the Champions League era. The last time they tasted success was in 2020 when Hansi Flick & Co. romped to European glory.\n\nBut over the last 30 years, they have reached the semi-finals of the competition 12 times, thereby showcasing how many more trophies they could have won.\n\nBayern Munich could have been higher up this list if they had defeated Villarreal in the quarter-finals of the tournament this season.\n\n#2 Barcelona- 12\n\nGerard Pique (R) and Ronald Araujo (L) in action against Bayern Munich\n\nBarcelona have enjoyed a rich taste of European success over the last three decades, thanks to the contributions of brilliant managers and world-class players.\n\nPeople like Johan Cruyff, Pep Guardiola and Lionel Messi have been the main reasons for the club's success in the UCL and rightly so. While the Spanish manager assembled one of the most frightening teams in Europe, the Argentine forward is arguably the greatest player to ever take the field.\n\nHence, it is no surprise that Barcelona have won the UCL five times, with four of them coming in the Champions League era. But this number could have certainly been more, especially since they reached the semi-finals of the tournament on 12 occasions.\n\nXavi will have to complete a rebuild at the Nou Camp in the coming months if his side are to reach the penultimate stage of the UCL next season.\n\n#1 Real Madrid-15\n\nReal Madrid in action against Chelsea in the 2021/22 UCL quarter-final 2nd leg\n\nReal Madrid are European royalty and have displayed the same time and again in their glorious history.\n\nLos Blancos haver won the UCL a record 13 times, with seven of those triumphs coming in the Champions League era.\n\nPFF FC @PFF_FC Real Madrid know a thing or two about Champions League semi-finals Real Madrid know a thing or two about Champions League semi-finals \ud83d\udc4a https://t.co/59T1YhZBCz\n\nWith illustrious players and managers part of the club, it is no surprise that they have reached the semi-finals on 15 occasions in the last 30 years.\n\nThis includes their tie against Manchester City this season, where they are currently trailing 4-3 after the first leg. But as they have displayed previously, Real Madrid are never down and out and hold the capabilities to turn around games.\n\nThe Spanish side have always been strong in European competitions.

Purported to have been recorded by Dembele in 2019, the video shows the France and Barcelona teammates laughing at staff attempting to fix a television in their hotel room. In it, Dembele is heard referring to \u201cugly faces\u201d and \u201cbackward language\u201d while Griezmann can be heard laughing.\n\n\u201cHello all, during these last few days, a private video dating back to 2019 has been circulating on social media,\u201d Dembele wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cIt all took place in Japan. It could\u2019ve taken place anywhere on the planet and I would\u2019ve used the same expression. \u201cI was therefore not targetting any community. I just happened to use this type of expression with my friends regardless of their origins. This video has since been made public. I appreciate therefore that it could\u2019ve hurt the people present in these images. Because of this, I would like to sincerely apologise to them.\u201d Following criticism on social media, Griezmann issued a statement of his own. \u201cI have always been completely against all forms of discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the past few days, certain people have wanted to paint me as someone that I am not. I firmly refute the accusations made against me and I\u2019m sorry if I have offended any of my Japanese friends.\u201d It is not the first time Griezmann has found himself in this kind of trouble.

I can\u2019t speak highly enough of Gareth and his coaching staff and the way that he\u2019s gone about his business over the last four years. \u201cHe\u2019s proved over the last four years that as an England manager it\u2019s always hard to please everyone, especially the public, in terms of the way he sets up and selection. But we trust him. Whatever team he picks or whatever style of play he wants to go with, it\u2019s the best one for the job.\u201d\n\n\n\n5 Jul 2021 15.39 BST More from Maguire: \u201cThe motivation is there,\u201d he said, surprising nobody. \u201cIt\u2019s the semi-final of the European Championship. Losing the semi-final at the World Cup hurt a lot. So we need to make sure when it comes on Wednesday night we get a positive feeling rather than the one we got against Croatia. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a lot better place than we were. The experience of that, we\u2019ve learnt from it and also the experience of the games in between as well, for example the Nations League. We\u2019ve had a lot of big games in that period to improve and a lot of time spent together on the training pitch, friendlies and qualifiers. Every game we play we feel we improve. \u201cIn this tournament, from the first game to the Ukraine game, there\u2019s a lot of differences in the principles that we\u2019re demanding from each other. Of course we\u2019re in a better place now, but we\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n5 Jul 2021 15.30 BST Harry Maguire on Gareth Southgate: \u201cI would be so happy for him if we went the distance,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning it was the aim before the tournament and it remains the aim now.

John is a winner and knows what is required to succeed at a club of this stature. \u201cHe will add steel and presence to our midfield along with his quality which makes our squad much stronger, and to procure a player of John\u2019s profile and experience is very pleasing.

Obviously we have been in the UK for quite a while now so to get to Rome, lovely weather and an amazing stadium, to play there in a quarter-final is something ticked off.\u201d James Corden, eh.\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Jul 2021 13.15 BST Pre-season: While England\u2019s players remain focussed on the Euros, plenty of their colleagues who play in the Premier League are back at their clubs to begin pre-season training today ahead of the big kick-off on the weekend commencing Friday 13 August, when Brentford will host Arsenal.

Mr Wenger was a guest on beIN Sports on Saturday night and was complimentary about England\u2019s performance. \u201cIt was the perfect night for English football,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perfect night for the English team. They didn\u2019t concede a goal, they secured an easy qualification and they could rest important players. \u201cThey scored three goals from crosses. Sometimes small things cause a big impact. Certainly the fact that Ukraine lost a centre back in the first half had an impact on the goals they conceded in the second half. They didn\u2019t even jump for the crosses! They\u2019re free headers. It\u2019s not expected at that level \u201cWhat was important for me tonight, for them, is that they didn\u2019t concede a goal. As long as you don\u2019t concede a goal the team focuses on defending well. That will be an important quality to go to the final and to win it\u201d. \"They have not found the complete formula offensively, but they have not conceded a goal!\"\n\n\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger has labelled England as \"super favorites\" for Euro 2020, hailing the defensive stability of the side. #beINEURO2020 #EURO2020 #UKRENG\n\n\n\nWatch Now - https://t.co/RRmQgctETJ pic.twitter.com/dSarCanxBl \u2014 beIN SPORTS (@beINSPORTS_EN) July 3, 2021\n\n\n\n5 Jul 2021 12.34 BST England training this morning.

But the same goes for us.\u201d The Real Sociedad forward claimed luck had nothing to do with their win over Switzerland in a penalty shoot-out, where he scored the decisive penalty. \u201cWe study goalkeepers and penalty shooters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have worked on penalties these days and surely the others will have done the same.

Their current manager, Kasper Hjulmand has been talking ahead of Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cGoing into Wembley with 60,000 [England fans] is a motivation and of course the motivation for us is to silence this crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be difficult but the boys are ready.

BBC Sport looks at some of the reasons why.\n\n1) Wales now the best home nation?\n\nEngland were the only team before Portugal to beat Wales at Euro 2016, but the Welsh topped their group and then went two rounds further than the English\n\nThe British Home Championship may have ended in 1984, with Wales not winning it outright since 1937 - but they can now justifiably call themselves the best team in Britain.\n\nFor years, Wales fans have had to put up with taunts from supporters of neighbouring England, who have won a World Cup and reached three World Cup or Euro semi-finals since the Welsh had last reached a major tournament.\n\nBut not any more. In reaching the semi-finals in France, they went two rounds better than England and Northern Ireland (both of whom they played on the way), while Scotland did not even qualify.\n\n2) Vokes and Chester > Giggs and Rush\n\nSam Vokes scored in a European Championship quarter-final. No Welsh player had played in one this time last week\n\nNeville Southall. Ryan Giggs. Ian Rush. Mark Hughes. These men all have something in common - world-class Welsh players who never played in a major international tournament.\n\nBut Hal Robson-Kanu, Sam Vokes, James Chester, Chris Gunter and Dave Edwards are among the Welsh players who will go down in history for featuring in their country's greatest football achievement.\n\nWales' only previous tournament appearance had been the 1958 World Cup. Their 58-year wait for another major tournament is a joint world record with the Dutch East Indies/Indonesia (1938 World Cup and 1996 Asian Cup).\n\n3) A rugby-loving nation turns football mad\n\nAll 27,500 tickets to watch the semi-final from Cardiff's Principality Stadium were taken quickly\n\nThere have always been plenty of people who claim Wales is a rugby, rather than football, nation first and foremost. But this Welsh run has reignited that debate.\n\nMore than half of the country was expected to watch the Portugal game - eclipsing the national television record for a sporting event, which was only set on Friday for their 3-1 quarter-final victory over Belgium.\n\nAn estimated 20,000 Wales fans are thought to have made their way to Lyon for the game, with plenty watching in the fan zone in the French city.\n\nFan zones were created across Wales, most notably at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, where 27,500 fans - the maximum capacity with a speedway track - filled the stadium. The first 20,000 tickets were snapped up within 90 minutes.\n\nAnother 10,000 were thought to have turned up to watch at a fan zone in Swansea.\n\nFormer Wales striker John Hartson, now a BBC pundit, said: \"Friday's win over Belgium was not just the proudest moment in Welsh football history, it was our greatest achievement in any sport.\n\n\"It feels like the whole country is together behind the team - I flew back to the UK later in the day and there were lots of Cardiff fans at the airport wanting photos with me, which does not happen often to a Swansea boy.\"\n\nDuring the tournament, the town of Bala changed its name to Bale and the Vale of Glamorgan became the Bale of Glamorgan for one night. external-link\n\n4) Hal who? Robson-Kanu makes himself a global star\n\nThere is often a player who gets a big move on the back of a good tournament. This summer's could very well be Hal Robson-Kanu. The 27-year-old took the gamble to let his Reading contract run out and it could have backfired when he was a doubt for Euro 2016 with an ankle injury. He was named only as a substitute in Wales' opening game, before coming on to score the winner against Slovakia.\n\nCombined with the fact he had only scored two international goals before - and averages one goal every 10 games in the Championship, turning down guaranteed employment was definitely a risk.\n\nBut he now has offers \"from around the world\" after scoring twice in France, most notably when he took Manchester City's Jason Denayer, Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini and Thomas Meunier, now of Paris St-Germain, out of the equation with a Cruyff turn before firing home against Belgium.\n\n\"I want to go somewhere which is progressive and has a level of success,\" he has said.\n\nCould he go one better than Gary Breen in 2002 when the Republic of Ireland defender almost joined Inter Milan after leaving Coventry, only to fail a medical?\n\n5) Wales are rolling in the money\n\nInternational football is one of the few areas of the game now that feels almost Corinthian at times - players playing for the love of their country, rather than a huge salary.\n\nBut money is still nice, right? Well, Wales have been coining it in during the Euros.\n\nThey got \u00a36.4m for getting to France and \u00a31.7m for their two Group B wins. Then \u00a31.3m for reaching the last 16, \u00a32.1m for making the quarters and another \u00a33.4m for being in the last four.\n\nSo that is a total of \u00a314.9m.\n\nFor context, the Football Association of Wales made a profit of \u00a320,000 in its last financial year.\n\n6) Rankings rise to help future seeding\n\nWales - 117th in the world five years ago - are expected to move up to 11th after Euro 2016, which would increase their chances of qualifying for future major tournaments.\n\nThey were among the top seeds for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers and were drawn with Austria, Serbia, the Republic of Ireland, Moldova and Georgia.\n\nA good world ranking could increase their seeding for Euro 2020 qualifying - as well as getting them in a higher division in the ultra-confusing 2018-19 Uefa Nations League.\n\n7) A manager in demand - but he's staying\n\nThe day before his team face Portugal in the semi-final of Euro 2016, Wales manager Chris Coleman is asked if he would like to manage Belgium.\n\nChris Coleman's stock has never been higher. He had a difficult start to life as Wales boss after taking over in 2012 following the death of Gary Speed and considered his future after a 6-1 defeat in Serbia in 2014 World Cup qualifying.\n\nBefore that he had managed Fulham, Real Sociedad, Coventry, who sacked him in 2010, and Greek second-tier side Larissa.\n\nBut that has all changed now. He has fielded questions asking whether he would be interested in taking over England, while the Belgian players were apparently so impressed by his tactics against them in the quarter-finals that one journalist asked if he had considered replacing Marc Wilmots as Belgium boss.\n\n\"I have to say the Belgium players are obviously very wise,\" Coleman joked.\n\n8) Bale: A superstar delivers\n\nDragon is only motivation I need - Bale\n\nSometimes you get the impression football superstars have more interest in playing for their clubs on more than \u00a3100,000 a week - trying harder and playing better - than for the love of their country. Not naming any names *coughs*, but Ryan Giggs won 64 caps in a professional career spanning 24 years (that is about two and a half caps a year).\n\nAt 26, Gareth Bale has 61 caps and you would find it hard to make such an argument against him.\n\nIn qualifying he scored a remarkable seven of Wales' 11 goals, at times it felt like he was single-handedly dragging his country to France.\n\nHe has kept that form up this summer, scoring three times and assisting another - to make him joint second in the Golden Boot race. \"The Dragon on my chest is all I need,\" he said, as if Wales fans didn't already love him enough.\n\n9) The future's bright, the future's red\n\nAaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale were both sensational for Wales in France this summer\n\nThis could herald a golden age for Welsh football. Of their regular starters in France, only captain Ashley Williams, 31, was in his 30s. The average age of Wales' Euro 2016 squad is 27.3 years, the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at the tournament.\n\nAt 25 and 26 respectively, Wales' two star players, Aaron Ramsey and Bale, are approaching the peak years of their careers.\n\nIn fact, come the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, Bale could be the best player at either tournament. Argentina's Lionel Messi has quit international football this summer, while Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal will be 33 in two years' time.\n\nAnd West Brom's Welsh manager Tony Pulis hopes the next generation can take inspiration.\n\n\"This team can inspire people to get outside and on to the pitch,\" he said. \"This group of players have surpassed the achievement of that side from 1958.\n\n\"I hope and pray the next time I go into a city in Wales, instead of seeing kids sitting playing on their computers or phones, you will see that they now have a new set of heroes - sportspeople - because of this team.\"\n\n10) Team spirit is through the roof\n\nEuro 2016: Wales defend England celebrations\n\nEvery other summer we read all about how England's players have to combat boredom at a major tournament, with Wayne Rooney again repeating this summer how \"it can be boring obviously at times\".\n\nBut Gareth Bale makes the Welsh camp sound more like a stag do. \"It's just like being with your mates all the time, being on holiday... we do everything together. We all enjoy spending so much time with each other.\"\n\nSome England fans were not happy with Wales' players celebrating enthusiastically after Iceland dumped England out of the tournament, but it shows a team spirit that may stand them in good stead going into 2018 World Cup qualifying."}]}
