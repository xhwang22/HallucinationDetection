He is the current head coach of Nottingham Forest having previously managed Swansea City and the England under-16 and under-17 set-ups.\n\nWith a relatively unimpressive playing career, highlighted by a two-year stint at Bangor City, Cooper's prowess comes via his coaching skills which have made him a highly sought after manager.\n\nHis notable work with the England youth teams included leading the under-17s to the final of the European Championship and victory in the World Cup. This success encouraged Swansea City to offer Cooper his first managerial role at club level in 2019.\n\nIn Cooper's two seasons at the South Wales outfit, he twice took the Swans to the play-offs. In his first season they lost out in the semi-finals to Brentford, who would again beat Cooper's side the next year, this time in the final. He left Swansea by mutual consent in the summer of 2021.\n\nIn September 2021 he was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest, taking the club from the relegation zone to the play-offs, where they beat Huddersfield at Wembley. Forest had spent 20 seasons in the second tier prior to his arrival.\n\nSteve Cooper's early coaching career\n\nWhile still playing for Wrexham, Cooper trained to earn his UEFA pro license which he attained at 27, making him one of the youngest ever coaches to do so.\n\nHe went on to take up a position at Wrexham's academy as head of youth development and later moved to Liverpool in 2008 to work as a coach.\n\nAfter three years, Cooper was promoted to academy manager. He left in 2014 when the opportunity to manage England's under-17s arose.\n\nIn 2017, he coached his under-17s to the final of the UEFA European U17 Championship, losing out to Spain on penalties. Redemption came at the U17 World Cup, where again his team reached the final, this time hammering Spain 5-2.\n\nSteve Cooper's club career\n\nAfter five years managing the England youth set-up, Cooper was enticed by a job at Championship side Swansea City at the end of the 2018/19 season.\n\nIn his two seasons at the club, his knowledge of England's talented youth set-up allowed him to sign players such as Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi, both of whom have gone on to represent the England first team.\n\nIn a dramatic end to his first season at the club, Swansea reached the play-offs on the final matchday of the season. A 91st-minute goal from Wayne Routledge secured a 4-1 victory over Reading but more crucially gave his side a superior goal difference to Nottingham Forest to pip the East Midlands club to sixth place.\n\nHowever despite a 1-0 win over Brentford in the first leg of the semi-finals, the Swans were defeated 3-1 at Griffin Park and missed out on the final.\n\nWell done Steve Cooper and all the players of @SwansOfficial getting to the play off final in Wembley\n\n\n\nCracking goal @Matt_Grimes8 pic.twitter.com/8t7zH7MSGv \u2014 \u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2N D L \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2\u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf (@NDLane1) May 22, 2021\n\nIn his second season, Cooper again guided his team into the play-offs with a much more comfortable fourth-placed finish.\n\nA 2-1 aggregate win over |Barnsley saw them into the final. However, once again, Cooper couldn't get the better of Thomas Frank's Brentford as they were beaten 2-0 at Wembley.\n\nA little over a month after the defeat, Swansea announced that Cooper would not be renewing his contract and would be leaving the club.\n\nTransforming Nottingham Forest\n\nIn September 2021, Chris Hughton was fired from his role as Nottingham Forest manager, with the club enduring their worst start to a season in over a century.\n\nForest were bottom of the table having taken only one point from their opening seven games. On September 21, Steve Cooper was named as Hughton's successor.\n\nAlmost immediately, Cooper transformed Forest and they began to rise up the table.\n\nHis expertise once again came into play during the January transfer window, signing young talented forwards Sam Surridge and Keinan Davis, as well as experienced centre-half Steve Cook - additions which would ultimately propel the club to the top end of the table.\n\nIn the 35 matches following his appointment, Forest picked up a remarkable 72 points.\n\nWith two games remaining, Forest were just three points off the automatic promotion spots. However, defeat at Bournemouth meant Cooper would once again have to go down the play-off route.\n\nNottingham Forest win the Championship play-off final to secure promotion to the Premier League \u00f0\u0178\u2018\n\n\n\nThey were bottom of the table when manager Steve Cooper took over in September \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00af pic.twitter.com/fMA8SxZ3xz \u2014 GOAL News (@GoalNews) May 29, 2022\n\nForest earned a 2-1 at Bramall Lane in the first leg of their semi-final against Sheffield United.\n\nHowever, Cooper's play-off curse seemed to be in full effect as a second-half comeback from the Blades saw the tie finish 3-3. Extra-time couldn't split the sides and it went down to a penalty shootout, in which Forest keeper Brice Samba's heroics sent his side to Wembley for the first time since 1992.\n\nForest defeated Huddersfield Town 1-0 in the final, meaning a first Premier League this century, with Cooper achieving something Forest managers before him had failed to do."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/10/swansea-managerial-vacancy-steve-cooper-england-under-17s", "page_content": "Steve Cooper is to become Swansea\u2019s manager in a bold move by the Championship club.

In the top four divisions their 15 goals conceded in 27 league games is second only to Manchester City\u2019s 14 in 22.\n\n\u201cThe mentality to keep the ball out of the back of the net is something like I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Hourihane said, \u201cit\u2019s top class.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s England Under-17s team, made up of Foden\u2019s \u201cgeneration-millennium\u201d, born in the year 2000, was a richly talented array of players. In 2019 he arrived at Swansea with the club in the process of selling their best. Oli McBurnie to Sheffield United; Daniel James to Manchester United and Jordan Ayew to Crystal Palace, as well as the expiration of contracts of players such as Leroy Fer and Martin Olsson. Last summer Cooper lost academy graduate and Wales international Joe Rodon to Spurs for \u00a311 million with add-ons \u2013 a bargain.\n\nWith American owners who have been reluctant to invest, it has fallen to Cooper to find younger, cheaper talent. At different times he has persuaded his former Under-17 World Cup winners Conor Gallagher, Brewster, Marc Guehi, Morgan Gibbs-White and Freddie Woodman to join on loan. Joel Latibeaudiere, captain of that Under-17s team, has now signed permanently. From outside that circle, Ben Wilmot and Sam Surridge broke into the England Under-21s side while on loan at the Liberty Stadium.\n\nCentre-half Ben Cabango, 20, was promoted from Swansea\u2019s Under-23s by Cooper and is now a senior Wales international. Older players have thrived too, including Andre Ayew, the last refugee from the days when Swansea played Premier League wages \u2013 \u00a380,000 a week in his case \u2013 returned from loan and has been a key figure. Ryan Bennett, Korey Smith, Jake Bidwell and Kyle Naughton have all been revitalised. Matt Grimes was made captain at 24.\n\nThe signing of Jamal Lowe, who has scored nine this season in the Championship, was a big deal for Swansea at \u00a3800,000 from Wigan Athletic. He chose Swansea for their style of play. They are often described as possession-based but their key characteristic has been to pass the ball forward quickly. It can give them lower possession counts but greater effectiveness in attacks.\n\nCooper and his long-term assistant, Mike Marsh, have brought much of what worked for them at the FA, in the years of success under former technical director Dan Ashworth, to Swansea. There is much emphasis on team meetings, and between individuals and coaches. There is a player leadership group and players are encouraged to take their own initiative.\n\nThe background in youth development without a major playing career means that Cooper, like Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers, both of whom had the same, has waited until his late thirties for a senior management role. He completed his Pro Licence at 26 \u2013 the youngest to do so. He was a coach at the Wrexham and then Liverpool academies before the FA.\n\nIn terms of net spend relative to points gained in the Championship, Swansea under Cooper have been comfortably in the top five over the past two seasons.\n\nThose kinds of returns are likely to catch the eye of a club more ambitious than Swansea, who seem unwilling to invest in retaining talent.
