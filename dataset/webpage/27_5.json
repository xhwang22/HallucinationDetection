Each of those ensembles brings out different articulation and tone colour qualities of the flute; and each, in its own way, engages in dialogue with the instrument, drawing richly on both tradition and the sonic environment contemporary to the artists. It is a fascinating journey through the world of Polish music, heard in the light of flute music, of an exceptional and unique sound.\n\nOn the album, we hear Grzegorz Olkiewicz, one of the most outstanding Polish flautists, that lends his voice to the flutes. He is accompanied by the famous Amadeus Chamber Orchestra of Polish Radio conducted by Agnieszka Duczmal and the Warsaw Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra.

His energetic and humorous Comedy Overture opens a guest concert by the Pozna\u0144 orchestra that is truly carnivalesque in spirit, but refined in content. In 1989 the Concerto for Cello and Wind Orchestra by Friedrich Gulda, a charismatic pianist and teacher to Martha Argerich, shocked both the philharmonic audience and supporters of the avant-garde with its fusion of classical music and the spirit of jazz. Today it is seen as a pioneering work, and one that is also incredibly good fun. As a finale, we have a rare opportunity to hear L\u00e9lio, an autobiographical composition by Berlioz, the continuation of his Symphonie fantastique. The Romantic hero \u2018comes back to life\u2019 after overdosing on opium following another disappointment in love. His salvation \u2013 of course! \u2013 is music.\n\n[Adam Suprynowicz, translated by John Comber]\n\nDuration of the concert (including break): approx. 120 minutes"}, {"url": "https://timenote.info/en/Tadeusz-Szeligowski", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski (13 September 1896 - 10 January 1963) was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer. His works include the operas The Rise of the Scholars, Krakatuk and Theodor Gentlemen, the ballets The Peacock and the Girl and Mazepa ballets, two violin concertos, chamber and choral works.\n\nAs a music teacher he was very well established in Vilnius, Lublin, Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw. He was also a respected music writer who frequently wrote for journals and magazines specialized in music such as the Kurier Wile\u0144ski, Tygodnik Wile\u0144ski, Muzyka and the Kurier Pozna\u0144ski. His achievements include the creation of the Poznan\u00b4 Philharmonic, where he served as its first director between the years 1947-1949, and the founding of the Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring, one of the most important festivals of contemporary music at the time.\n\nMusical education\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski was born on 13 September 1896 in Lvov, then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. Szeligowski\u2019s first music and piano teacher was his mother. Later he began studying music at the Conservatory of Music of the Polish Society in L'vov in the years 1910-1914, where he studied piano under the direction of Vilem Kurz, and then from 1818-1923 in Krak\u00f3w, where he studied piano with Zdzis\u0142aw Jachimecki and A. Peter, and composition with Boles\u0142aw Wallek-Walewski. Szeligowski's further education included musicology and law at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, where he received his doctorate in 1922. There he found work as repetiteur at the Krak\u00f3w Opera House, allowing him to become well acquainted with the opera repertoire.\n\nHe complemented his studies in music in the years 1929-1931 in Paris, where he met many composers of his time such as Sergei Prokofiev, George Enesco and Arthur Honegger. There he studied composition with Nadia Boulanger and orchestration with Paul Dukas. There he attended many concerts and intensely experienced the latest compositions by Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, ballet productions of many famous companies, as well as highly acclaimed performances by Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1923 Szeligowski worked in Vilnius, Lithuania, as lawyer and lecturer at the Conservatory of Music. There he met Karol Szymanowski and became a great admirer of his music. He also worked with a dramatic theatre called Reduta, composing music for many of its productions. Shortly after his return to Poland in 1931, he began teaching music in Pozna\u0144 until 1939, and then moved to Lublin for a little while after the World War II. From 1947-1962 he worked for The State Higher School Of Music (Pa\u0144stwowa Wyzsza Szko\u0142a Muzyczna) in Pozna\u0144, and from 1947-1950 he became director of the National Opera Academy, when on his own initiative the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic was created. In addition, he was the initiator of the festival of contemporary music, the \"Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring\", where modern music was then presented in all its glory, and one of the organizers of the H. Wieniawski International Violin Competition. From 1951-1962 Szeligowski worked in Warsaw, first for the faculty of the Fryderik Chopin University of Music in Warsaw, and later as director of the Polish Society of Composers.\n\nA large group of his graduates on composition include: Zbigniew Bargielski, Augustyn Bloch, Joanna Bruzdowicz, Wojciech Lukaszewski, Tadeusz Wojciech Maklakiewicz, Boleslaw Ocias, Witold Rudzinski, Marek Sart, Aleksander Szeligowski and Antoni Szuniewicz.\n\nAs a music writer\n\nLvov\u2019s musical scene at that time included a city opera, a symphonic orchestra, a music society and also a conservatory of music, and there Szeligowski was very active as a social organizer. Musicians such as Felix Weingartner and Oscar Nedbal usually visited the city and frequently performed works by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. From 1951-1954 he served as chairman of the Polish Composers Union, and from 1953 he worked for the Board of Polish Music Publishers and the Central Pedagogical Office for Arts Education (COPSA). Tadeusz Szeligowski died in Pozna\u0144 on 10 January 1963 and since 1965 he has been buried in the Pozna\u0144 Skalka crypt of Merit.\n\nAwards\n\nSzeligowski received numerous awards, among them:\n\n1949 \u2013 Third prize at the Second Composers' Competition for Chopin's Piano Sonata d-moll\n\n1949 \u2013 Second prize at the Polish Radio Competition for the song The Prince and the girl\n\n1950 \u2013 State prize of the second degree for The peacock and the girl, Arion, and the Lublin Wedding\n\n1951 \u2013 State prize of the first degree for the opera stage Rise of the scholars\n\n1963 \u2013 Prize Prime Minister of Poland for his music for children and youth\n\n1963 \u2013 Music Award of the PCU, awarded every 17 January by the Polish Composers Union (ZKP \u2014 Zwiazek Kompozytorow Polskich) for lifetime achievement (posthumous)\n\nAlso, he received numerous prizes and condecorations, including:\n\nThe City of Pozna\u0144 Music Prize\n\n1952 \u2013 Gold Cross of Merit (Z\u0141OTYM KRZYZEM ZAS\u0141UGI)\n\n1952 \u2013 Medal Order of Polonia Restituta\n\n1966 \u2013 A commemorative plaque designed by J\u00f3zef Kopczy\u0144ski and placed at House 22, Che\u0142mo\u0144ski street, in Pozna\u0144, where he lived from 1947.\n\nCompositions\n\nInstrumental Orchestral works\n\nThe Peasant King -

The soloist was the world-famous pianist, composer and future statesman Ignacy Jan Paderewski. The program of this historic concert included Paderewski\u2019s Piano Concerto in A minor and works by other Polish composers: Chopin, Moniuszko, Noskowski, Stojowski and \u017bele\u0144ski.\n\nIn its early years, the Orchestra relatively quickly achieved a high level of professionalism, attracting outstanding soloists and conductors from all over the world. Before World War I and in the inter-war period, Warsaw Philharmonic was the main centre of musical activity in Poland and also one of the major musical institutions in Europe. Almost all the outstanding conductors and soloists of the day performed in Warsaw with the city\u2019s Philharmonic Orchestra, including Edward Grieg, Arthur Honegger, Otto Klemperer, Sergey Prokofiev, Sergey Rakhmaninov, Maurice Ravel, Artur Rodzinski, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Claudio Arrau, Vladimir Horowitz, Wilhelm Kempff, Arthur Rubinstein, Bronis\u0142aw Huberman and Pablo Sarasate.\n\nThe first three International Chopin Piano Competitions (1927, 1932, 1937), in which the Orchestra participated, were held in Warsaw Philharmonic Hall, as well as the first International Wieniawski Violin Competition (1935) and the first Public Festival of Polish Arts (1937). Those events demonstrated Warsaw\u2019s active participation in European musical life.After 38 years of prosperity, the outbreak of World War II brought the activities of the Philharmonic to a temporary halt. The Hall was bombed and partially burnt in the first days of September 1939 and completely destroyed by the end of the war. The orchestra lost 39 of its 71 players.In the first years after the war, Olgierd Straszy\u0144ski and Andrzej Panufnik were among the conductors of Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. In January 1950, Witold Rowicki was appointed director and principal conductor. He took it upon himself to organise a new ensemble. Despite the lack of its own hall (performances were organised in e.g. sports halls and theatres) and difficult working conditions, the Orchestra, due to Rowicki\u2019s effort, became a leading Polish ensemble.On 21st February 1955, the new (rebuilt) Philharmonic Hall in Jasna St. was re-opened. It contained a concert hall holding an audience of more than one thousand, and a chamber music hall with 433 seats. On that day, Warsaw Philharmonic was granted the status of the National Philharmonic of Poland. This represented the status which the Philharmonic had achieved in Poland as the leading institution of its kind in the country.Their first concert abroad took place at the 1951 International Youth Festival in Berlin and was followed by a tour of Romania in 1952. In October 1952, a \u201cChoir Studio\u201d under the auspices of the Philharmonic was established. This studio was the origin of the mixed choir, which appeared for the first time in a symphony concert with the Orchestra in May 1953. Since then, the Choir has received the name of the Warsaw Philharmonic Choir with a status of a fully professional ensemble. Also at that time the Warsaw Philharmonic started to promote its own chamber music series, which it still does today.From 1955 until 1958 Bohdan Wodiczko, an outstanding musician and enthusiast of modern music conducted the Orchestra. Arnold Rezler and Stanis\u0142aw Skrowaczewski also worked with the Orchestra, and Roman Kuklewicz directed the Choir. It was a good period for the Philharmonic: the orchestra was enlarged, the hall gained an organ, and performances of modern music achieved great success leading to the establishment of the First International Festival of Contemporary Music, in October 1956, known as the Warsaw Autumn. With time, it became one of the world\u2019s most important festivals of its kind.In 1958 Witold Rowicki was again appointed artistic director and principal conductor of the Philharmonic, a post he held until 1977. Stanis\u0142aw Wis\u0142ocki and Andrzej Markowski also worked with the Orchestra at that time as permanent guest conductors. It was under Rowicki\u2019s direction that foreign tours and appearances in prestigious halls worldwide became a staple of the orchestra\u2019s activity.On 1st July 1977, Kazimierz Kord was appointed artistic director and principal conductor of the National Philharmonic and he directed the Orchestra till the end of the centenary celebrations in 2001. From the beginning of his work with the Orchestra, he emphasised broadening the range of repertoire. As a result, alongside symphonies, also oratorios and operas were included in the programmes for the following artistic seasons. A new venture was the series The National Philharmonic Presents recorded live and released on the Polskie Nagrania label. Presently Maestro Kazimierz Kord holds the position of Honorary Director of the National Philharmonic and maintains close contact with the Orchestra. At the beginning of the 1978/79 season, Henryk Wojnarowski took over the leadership of the choir while Tadeusz Struga\u0142a worked with the Orchestra as permanent guest conductor (1979 to 1990). Since January 2002, Antoni Wit has been General and Artistic Director of Warsaw Philharmonic \u2013 The National Orchestra and Choir of Poland.Today both the Warsaw Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and the Choir enjoy world-wide popularity and recognition. The orchestra has made over 100 tours on five continents. It has performed in all the major concert halls, winning applause from the audiences and critics for their charismatic music making. It has taken part in many international festivals \u2013 in Vienna, Berlin, Prague, Bergen, Lucerne, Montreux, Moscow, Brussels, Florence, Bordeaux and Athens. The Orchestra regularly participates in the International F. Chopin Piano Competitions and the Warsaw Autumn Festival. It also makes recordings for the Polish Radio and Television, Polish and international record companies, and records film music. The artistic achievements of the Warsaw Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra have frequently been rewarded with prestigious record awards. Recently, the Orchestra won the \u201cFryderyk 2002\u201d Record Academy Award in the special category of \u201cThe Most Outstanding Polish Music Recording\u201d for its record with pieces by Lutos\u0142awski, Meyer and Penderecki.The recording of Krzysztof Penderecki\u2019s St Luke Passion, made in 2002 for NAXOS and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic \u2013 The National Orchestra and Choir of Poland conducted by Antoni Wit, received the Classical Internet Awardand was nominated for the American Grammy Award in 2004.The CD recording of Penderecki\u2019s Polish Requiem by the same orchestral and choral forces (on Naxos) won another Grammy nomination in 2005, as well as the Japanese Record Academy Award 2005 (Record Geijutsu). In June 2005, Warsaw Philharmonic recorded Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 8 under the same label, winning the highest critical acclaim. Two other recordings by Warsaw Philharmonic \u2013 The National Orchestra of Poland received three Fryderyk Awards in 2005 (Chopin \u2013 Piano Concerto in E Minor op. 11, soloist: Rafa\u0142 Blechacz \u2013 Chronicle of the 15th Chopin Competition \u2013 in the category \u201cOrchestral Music\u201d and Lutos\u0142awski \u2013 Concerto for Orchestra and Cello Concerto, soloist: Rafa\u0142 Kwiatkowski \u2013 in two categories: \u201cContemporary Music\u201d and \u201cThe Most Outstanding Recording of Polish Music\u201d). 2007 brought another Grammy nomination, again for a composition by Penderecki \u2013 The Seven Gates of Jerusalem.Most recently, Warsaw Philharmonic \u2013 The National Orchestra of Poland conducted by Antoni Wit has begun recorded the complete orchestral and vocal-orchestral works by Szymanowski for Naxos. The first two CDs in this series: I. Violin Concertos (soloist: Ilya Kaler), Nocturne, Tarantella and II. Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 \u2013 were selected in the Editor\u2019s Choice of the British Gramophone magazine (in July 2007 and May 2008), while the third \u2013 containing Stabat Mater, Veni Creator, Litany to the Virgin Mary, Demeter and Penthesilea \u2013 was BBC Music Magazine\u2019s Editor\u2019s Choice in October 2008, and was nominated for Grammy. The Orchestra also recorded symphonic poems by Kar\u0142owicz for Naxos.\n\nApart from outstanding Polish artists, the Warsaw Philharmonic has hosted many eminent artists from all over the world, among them: Hermann Abendroth, Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Kathleen Battle, Joshua Bell, Teresa Berganza, Gary Bertini, Herbert Blomstedt, Alfred Brendel, Charles Dutoit, Philippe Entremont, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos, Robert Holl, Marek Janowski, Nigel Kennedy, Aram Khachaturian, Evgeny Kissin, Gidon Kremer, Lang Lang, Felicity Lott, Lorin Maazel, Mischa Maisky, Igor Markevitch, Kurt Masur, Yehudi Menuhin, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Midori, Shlomo Mintz, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Kent Nagano, David and Igor Oistrakh, Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini, Svyatoslav Richter, Helmuth Rilling, Mstislav Rostropovich, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Arthur Rubinstein, Jordi Savall, Andr\u00e1s Schiff, Isaac Stern, Leopold Stokowski, Igor Stravinsky, Henryk Szeryng, Pinchas Zukerman and many others."}, {"url": "https://wieniawski.com/2ivc.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nIt was a sheer stroke of luck! In late-summer of 1952 preparations held in Warsaw to revive the International Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition after the World War II break collapsed. There was simply no place to hold the event. A number of lesser-destroyed towns immediately declared their help. It was probably the suggestion made by Tadeusz Szeligowski, a resident of Pozna\u0144, previously appointed Chairman of the Competition\u2019s jury, that prevailed: on 23 September, the provincial authorities adopted a relevant resolution and sent a letter to the Minister of Arts and Culture, in which he was asked to \u201caccede to the request made on behalf of the citizens of Pozna\u0144...\u201d On 11 November, the minister did eventually accede and informed that he had designated Pozna\u0144 to become \u201cthe p e r m a n e n t seat to international violin competitions...\u201d, which by no means meant that he himself abandoned the role of their ultimate host. The Competition Secretariat was affiliated with the Ministry, and it was only its Office that opened in Pozna\u0144. A permit to make the Lubra\u0144ski Hall, another venue, besides the University Auditorium, available for the purposes of the Competition, had to come from the Deputy Minister of Higher Education. It would take hours to discuss in the capital how to adorn Pozna\u0144 for the occasion, who was going to show foreigners round the town, and what to show them, as well as where in the jury proceedings hall to place \u201ca coffee-machine and sweets stand\u201d. Meanwhile, the application list for the competition grew shorter by the day. \u201cCapitalist countries deny their participation in the Competition \u2014 informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs \u2014 quoting trifling reasons intended to hide the real ones\u201d. What were the real reasons? In its report, the Secretariat does not reveal any. Instead, we learn that \u201cin the current situation the Jury of the Competition shall be composed of representatives of people\u2019s democracies\u201d. It was also recommended that guests should be selected from among \u201cprogressive critics and musicologists from England, France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and Germany...\u201d. The West did not so much boycott, as ignored such offers; e.g. despite being issued official invitations, none of the three Americans, incl. Sydney Harth (!), arrived. Even Bulgarians wanted to cancel their participation, due to \u201cclimatic differences, which might adversely affect the instruments\u201d\n\nFortunately, the organizers in Pozna\u0144 did not loose their heads. The team, gathered around the Competition Office, which was headed by the Director of the Philharmonic, Zdzis\u0142aw \u015aliwi\u0144ski, enthusiastically and competently did what was necessary to receive the Competition. Interest of music-lovers was immense. The orchestra, conducted by Stanis\u0142aw Wis\u0142ocki and Jan Krenz, ran intense rehearsals. The Auditorium was cleaned, and the old \u201cBazar\u201d Hotel furnished with extra equipment, for it lacked not only bathrooms: there was not a single radio in the building (!).\n\nOn the night of 2 December 1952, a special train from Warsaw pulled up at Pozna\u0144\u2019s Central Station. It brought the participants, members of the jury, and the central organizing committee of the Second Wieniawski Competiton; a competition that was never to leave the town. It is a jewel, one of the most valuable gems of the national culture; it serves the whole musical world, and, excellently improved and developed by the inhabitants of Pozna\u0144, is the town\u2019s pride and showpiece.\n\n\n\n\n\nA poster of 2nd edition of Wieniawski Violin Competition designed by A.
