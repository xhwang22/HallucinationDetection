This selection by Nigel Milsom first appeared in Look \u2013 the Gallery\u2019s members magazine.\n\nNigel Milsom knows the Art Gallery of NSW collection well, having worked as a Gallery Services Officer in the 2000s. 'I spent four years as a GSO there and raced home to paint every day,' he says. 'I saw it as another part of my art education. I even used to paint there. I\u2019d go downstairs to the painting workshop and do text pieces and stuff.'\n\nIt didn\u2019t always endear him to his bosses, he confesses, but his dedication to his art eventually paid off, despite personal battles that culminated in a prison term in 2013. In 2012 he won the Sulman Prize, in 2013 the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize and last year he returned to the AGNSW as the winner of the Archibald Prize. When Look visited Milsom\u2019s Newcastle studio, the artist was preparing for an upcoming solo exhibition of painting, video and sculpture.\n\n'You can\u2019t let things like an Archibald define you,' he recently told the Newcastle Herald.

Now based in Newcastle Milsom received a BFA and MFA from the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales respectively.\n\nMilsom is a past winner of Australia\u2019s richest and best-known art prize, the Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW), Archibald Prize (2015). Milsom\u2019s powerful Archibald prize winning portrait portrayed his criminal barrister, Charles Waterstreet. The portrait depicts Waterstreet reaching out with his hands, as if he\u2019s \u2018here to help you\u2019.\n\n\n\nBrett Whiteley, Adam Cullen, Tim Storrier, Geoffrey Proud, and Ben Quilty, who described Milsom\u2019s prize as \u2018\u2018close to a masterpiece\u2019, are just a few former AGNSW Archibald Prize winners.\n\n\"I saw myself entirely differently but accept that my portrait is but an avatar of Nigel's extraordinary ability to push paint around the canvas with frenetic desire and with chilling effect.\" - Charles Waterstreet.\n\nAs infamous as he is talented, in 2014 Milsom was convicted and sent to prison following the armed robbery of a Glebe convenience store in 2012. At the time, he was wielding a tomahawk and under the influence of heroin, ice, and prescription drugs.\n\nBarrister, Charles Waterstreet appeared for Milsom during his trial for armed robbery. According to Nigel, during the court proceedings, his relationship with Waterstreet began to strengthen and he began to trust him. They became friends. Milsom\u2019s sentence was reduced on appeal to two years and four months\u2019 imprisonment, as a result of Waterstreet\u2019s defence."}, {"url": "https://www.thecommercialgallery.com/artist/nigel-milsom/biography", "page_content": "According to Milsom, a painting is successful only \u2018when it announces the limits of painting and shows you that whatever the image is, it\u2019s a painting\u2014a fabrication operating in very clear space ... whether it\u2019s illusion or not, it is just paint\u2014a material substance that can stand for many things\u2019. Ingrid Periz\n\n\n\n\n\nNigel Milsom (b. 1975, Albury, l. Newcastle) is a figurative painter of baroque abstractions. Formal contestations within each painting and within each exhibition (light versus dark, motion versus stasis, advantage and disadvantage) slip into more complex and more personal structures. Milsom has had a consistent studio practice over two and a half decades. While at times his paintings have been more provisional in nature, strong painting is his signature indebted to chiaroscuro persuasion and a highly distinctive personal style. Typically white paint figures on black paint ground with the occasional intervention of colour, Milsom\u2019s subjects are constructed energetically via a scaffold of construction lines that begin in ink studies and are left visible in the final work. His bodies are geometric form against a more gestural and more openly brushy sequence of marks. His subjects range widely and function abstractly as entry points to composition and pictorial pragmatics. While focused around an athletics of form, Milsom\u2019s slippages into social dynamics and cultural references are ubiquitous and operate in parallel \u2014 often including veiled music and literary motifs as well as autobiographical chapters.\n\nMilsom has been awarded three of Australia\u2019s most prestigious painting prizes: The Sir John Sulman Prize (2012), The Doug Moran National Portrait Prize (2013) and The Archibald Prize (2015). He received a Master of Fine Arts (Research) from the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales, Sydney in 2002.\n\n\n\nKey exhibitions\n\n\n\nKey readings\n\nCollections\n\nAllens Arthur Robinson Art Collection\n\nArtbank\n\nANZ Bank Art Collection\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales\n\nCampbelltown Arts Centre\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia Art Collection\n\nMaitland Regional Art Gallery\n\nMonash University Art Collection\n\nMurray Art Museum Albury\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Australia\n\nNewcastle Art Gallery\n\nWesfarmers Art Collection\n\nWollongong University Art Collection\n\n\u00bb View available artworks by Nigel Milsom"}, {"url": "https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/77.2008.1/", "page_content": "The series of over 30 paintings that this work belongs to were created by Milsom over a twelve month period. Milsom\u2019s subject is a series of photographs from 1926 by Aleksander Rodchenko of paper cut outs made by his wife Varvara Stepanova. These photographs were intended to illustrate a children\u2019s book of poems by Sergei Tretiakov entitled \u2018Samozveri\u2019, \u2018Auto animals\u2019 or \u2018Self animals.\u2019 The book was not published but the photographs appeared in two magazines \u2018Sovetskoe kino\u2019 and \u2018Novyi Lef\u2019. In the photographs Rodchenko experimented with perspective, dramatic angles and light and shadow to theatrical effect. The fact that the photographs were published in a cinematic magazine also suggests how they were viewed as closely connected with filmic animation.\n\nIn transcribing these photographs into paint Milsom has worked through many variations on the effect of painting light and shade. His palette is restricted to grays and whites, recalling the original black and white of the photographs. Yet inevitably the effect of paint on canvas is very different from the emulsion on paper of the original images and their subsequent reproductions. Milsom experiments with painting: brushing on, scraping back, cutting into, using both thicker impasto areas and watery passages and many other variations in order to capture the dramatic light, form and shadow of the originals.\n\nIn looking to the avant-garde past Milsom reinvigorates contemporary painting. While the figures have a sense of nostalgia for the original children\u2019s book illustrations, they also seem somewhat ominous and threatening. The clunky cut out forms transcribed into paint has something of the quality of a horror film - the smiling inanimate forms seem to come to life and divorced from their original narrative context we are not quite sure what they want from us. If the utopianism of the Russian avant-garde seems na\u00efve in retrospect after the mire of Stalinism, the cold war and eventual demise of Soviet communism; it was still a period of bold experimentation and an optimistic faith in the social power of art to contribute to a better world. Milsom\u2019s work seems to teeter between something of this utopianism and an ironic distance from vantage point of the early 21st century."}, {"url": "https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/561.2018/", "page_content": "Nigel Milsom's subject, Kerry Crowley, is an art dealer and a director of the Yuill/Crowley Gallery in Sydney, which she established in 1982. A well-known figure in the Australian art scene, she was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2008 for service to contemporary art in Australia. Milsom met her around 2000 while he was a student at the College of Fine Art. 'The late Nick Waterlow introduced us,' he says. 'I was working at the Ivan Dougherty Gallery and, knowing that I was a student, she said I could come and do some work for her if I wanted.

The boldness of the portrait reflects a strong woman, unafraid to speak her mind. 'She has a reputation for being a perfectionist and a bit difficult. She is to an extent but that's because she holds her artists' work so dear. She has a lovely warmth when you get to know her,' says Milsom. 'I've painted her in such a way her eyes look bloodshot.

He\u2019s a writer, a social environmentalist and is involved in film, photography and theatre too.

Nigel is a man of strong convictions and physical presence. He is also generous, uniquely talented and incisively articulate.\n\n\u2018I painted him again in 2015 \u2013 which is the portrait you see here \u2013 and he asked to have the first one, which now lives in his studio.

The startling thing was not only did I not know the person being reflected in the mirror, but I was certain the person looking at the reflection was not me.\u2019\n\n\u2018While this brief encounter unfolded, I found myself listening to an internal, quasi-philosophical argument between two voices about who the hell I was. On reflection \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 it became paramount that the difference between my idea of myself and my reflection in the mirror is just an idea, a construct. So, this painting is essentially an attempt to depict the way in which I came to feel a more enlightened connection to my identity and surroundings.\u2019\n\nBorn in 1975, Milsom lives and works in Newcastle.
