His mom has recently died after a long ordeal with cancer. His dad, Easy (Bruce Dern), is a good guy and in his corner. His brother, Guy (Jayce Bartok, who wrote the screenplay), sat out the entire illness in New York, seeking success as a rock or folk star, and has returned just too late for the funeral. Beagle is enraged at him. Beagle cared for his mom the whole three years.\n\nGeorgia, as played by Stewart, is not looking for sympathy. She's looking for sex and is very forthright about that. When a hairdresser asks her if she isn't rushing things, she says simply, \"I don't have a lot of time.\" Why did she choose Beagle? He's OK looking, he's not bothered by her disability, you can see he's gentle and perhaps she suspects she can get him to do what she wants.\n\nMasterson and her cast make these characters, and others, into specific people and not elements in a docudrama. Nobody is a \"type,\" certainly not Georgia's grandmother Marge (Elizabeth Ashley), the kind of woman you know once raised some hell and hasn't completely stopped. When Beagle happens to see his dad kissing Marge so soon after the funeral, he's devastated. This creates enormous tension among all three men in the family, and a connection between Beagle and Georgia they're not aware of.\n\nBeagle is three or four years older than Georgia, but behind her in emotional development, I sense. He's very naive. Georgia's mother (Melissa Leo, a best actress Oscar nominee this year) is suspicious of him, but has no hint of her daughter's plans for the unsuspecting boy. And Beagle's father is reassuring: \"My boy has no game in that area, I promise you.\"\n\nSo there are three simultaneous romances: Beagle and Georgia, Easy and Marge, and I forgot to mention Guy, who has a local girl named Stephanie (Miriam Shor) furious at him because he proposed marriage and then left for New York without even saying goodbye.\n\nYou might think with all of these plot lines and colorful characters, the movie turns into a carnival. Not at all. I won't say why. I'll only say it all leaves us feeling good about most of them. Masterson, like many actors, is an assured director even in her debut; working with her brother Pete as cinematographer, she creates a spell and a tenderness and pushes exactly as far as this story should go.\n\nNote: The film plays for a week starting today at Facets Cinematheque, and will have its DVD release on March 24."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/dawn-landes/biography", "page_content": "Dawn Landes Biography\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter\n\nMusical artist\n\nDawn Landes (born December 5, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.

Your less worthy films are drummed out of obscurity. Not only that, but your billing even on these other films is suddenly pushed to the top of the class. Almost overnight, everything you did before gets pushed toward the public\u2019s eye, for good or bad. Kristen Stewart has enjoyed a deserved boost to her career with the success of the teen vampire film, Twilight. Now the independent film The Cake Eaters is being released in time to coincide with Twilight\u2019s own DVD release. This is a film that most certainly would have found its way into release on its own, but I doubt that the timing is at all coincidental. On the film Stewart\u2019s billing is actually somewhere near the bottom of the front credits. On the box art she has amazingly leapfrogged the others and takes the top spot. That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t turn in a great performance here, and it doesn\u2019t mean that The Cake Eaters is a horrible film. But it\u2019s not a great film, and so any help it can get from one of its stars\u2019 rising popularity isn\u2019t going to hurt any.\n\nIt\u2019s more or less the story of two families in small town America. Easy (Dern) leads one clan. He\u2019s recently lost his wife and lives with his younger son, Beagle (Stanford). His older son, Guy (Bartok) has just returned from New York, where he was pursuing a music career. There is obviously some tension between the two brothers. In another family, we have Georgia (Stewart) who is suffering from a degenerative nervous disorder. It limits her mobility and slurs her speech. It also will eventually cause her heart to give out, so that she\u2019s aware she is on borrowed time. Her mother, Violet (Balsam) is an art photographer and specializes in partially nude photographs of Georgia. Her live in, Judd (Martin) is the more protective of Georgia. When Georgia and Beagle meet at a swap meet or rummage sale, they are attracted to each other. Georgia decides she wants to have sex so that she can experience it before she dies. Both teens are rather awkward personalities, and they begin to develop a bond, counter to the social norms around them. The relationship reminds me a lot of the one in Natalie Wood\u2019s Splendor In The Grass. The film unravels as secrets and relationships are revealed that bring all of the characters to a point of self examination.\n\nThe film has potential, but it never really comes into full bloom. It\u2019s directed by actress turned first time director Mary Stuart Masterson. The direction is often awkward. It appears that Masterson never has a lot of confidence in herself and fails to commit to the emotionally charged scenes. The performers are giving us riveting stuff, but the framing and editing deplete the scenes from any of the passion. She does a great job of presenting us with a snapshot of small town USA, but never gives us the compelling story she is trying so hard to deliver. The cast, for their part, give as good as they can. Stewart shows why she\u2019s such an up and coming talent. It\u2019s a difficult role, and she rarely falls out of step. She teams up well with Aaron Stanford, and the two of them give as good as Masterson will allow. Bruce Dern shows us that the old codger still has some acting chops in him. Jayce Bartok, who also wrote the script, is the weak link in the cast, offering very little but a moody figure best left in the background.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Cake Eaters is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The film begins and ends in full frame which threw me for a second. The overall picture quality is pretty good. It\u2019s all quite subdued and muted. So, colors are not really a standout feature of this film. Detail, however, is actually pretty good. It\u2019s a sharp picture with better than average black levels. The film sports a solid average 7.5 mbps, which is outstanding today for a standard definition release.\n\nAudio\n\nThe Dolby Digital 5.1 track very laid back. Even the score emphasizes the sleepy quiet little town atmosphere. It\u2019s all about the dialog, anyway, and that\u2019s what comes through very clearly.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nFor some reason these people really want you to work for every minute of the extras. In each of the three features, the option is divided into three parts, often under 2 minutes in length. There\u2019s never a play all option, so it\u2019s a lot of thumbing for very little content.\n\nDeleted Scenes: There are three for a total of about 4 minutes. You must access each separately.\n\nCast Interviews: In case you thought I was being unfair about the tie-in to Twilight of this release, this should confirm it. There are very short clips from Bruce Dern, Jesse L. Martin, and Aaron Stanford. Each answer the question: What did you think of Kristen Stewart? I\u2019d love to ask Bruce Dern what it means to have the \u201cseen the elephant look\u201d.\n\nBehind The Scenes: Wow, is this a waste of time. You get three pieces, each under two minutes. The last one is just 38 seconds. Two show short scenes being filmed. The first just shows Masterson talking to Stewart. Yawn!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis one\u2019s a bit slow and takes a long time finally getting nowhere. I was entertained enough by a couple of the performances, but it\u2019s not enough to give up any real money for this film. I suspect Twilight fans will want to check out Kristen Stewart. That\u2019s cool, but go the rental route. As for me? \u201cI think I\u2019ll go shredded wheat from now on.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/dawn-landes", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nDawn Landes was born on 5 December, 1980 in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, is an American singer-songwriter and musician.

A slice of rural life in a sleepy town, we are privy to a period of turmoil and discovery for two families living there. The Kimbrough's have recently lost their matriarch and a second family is dealing with the hardships of raising a child with Friedriech's Ataxia. Both groups are thrust together with some chance meetings, helping each other get through the tough times and remember the good in living life. There is a lot of heart on display and subtlety in its portrayal. We see just enough of every story thread to understand the emotions going on inside the heads of all the characters\u0097emotions that are very complicated and co-existing with their exact opposites: can love ever really exist separate from hate? The main catalyst for much of what occurs stems from the return of Guy Kimbrough, back from a three-year, self-imposed exile of rock n' roll life in NYC. It is an interesting welcome; one mixed with happiness at seeing him and disappointment in the fact that he abandoned them all when they needed him the most. Played by the screenwriter, Jayce Bartok, it is a role that bares similarities to the only other film I have seen him in, Suburbia. There he was a returning rockstar seeing how different he had become when re-connecting with old friends, here he is that same guy, only now with the realization that his dream is over. This is a one-way ticket back home to start over and hope to find what it was he lost in those years away. Needing to make amends with the father and brother he left, the girl he walked out on, and the mother he missed saying goodbye to, Bartok does well showing the sadness and regret along with the hope of rebirth.\n\n\n\nHis introduction back into the life of his brother has a very real effect on the younger Beagle. Played wonderfully by Aaron Stanford, (in a huge departure from his turn as Pyro in the X-Men films), he is reminded of how he had to put his life on hold to care for his parents, one dying and one unable to stay and watch. After meeting the granddaughter of his father's old friend/flame, he finds that he must start to live for himself. Although she is younger and afflicted with a debilitating muscular disease, the two find a bond and common ground with each other. They see someone like themselves, wanting to find a relationship and person to be with. The climax of their relationship is very strong and well played, allowing the audience to discover whether their connection was strictly of convenience or much more. Kristen Stewart is fantastic as the girl Georgia. The way she must control her body in order for the disease to be real is effective, but also her smile at the hand God dealt her is perfect. This young woman knows her fate and tries to overcome any feelings of sadness by just living.\n\n\n\nThe beauty of The Cake Eaters is that it unfolds very unassumingly, taking its story and its progression as naturally as possible. There are no twists and turns or bombastic moments to hit the audience over the head with. Instead we are allowed a glimpse into the world of this town, where flea markets, butcher shops, and outskirt motels are commonplace and well used. Each moment is completely authentic, from the acting to the relationships uncovered as the film goes on. Even some little moments shine above the rest like when Easy Kimbrough, (the always great Bruce Dern), is telling his girlfriend that he can't continue their relationship if it remains a secret. He is so heartfelt and she as well trying to keep him for herself in the way she had grown accustomed, but once the phone rings and she finds that her granddaughter has gone off with his son, she turns on him and screams that Beagle isn't good enough for Georgia. Emotion is a powerful thing and the blunt truth of that scene just rings completely true.\n\n\n\nWith subtle directing and the fearless use of quiet moments to let the actors breathe and do their thing, Masterson has crafted a gem of a film. I kept thinking of another film with similar tonal qualities and settings in Tully while watching. This is strange because I don't remember much about that film except for really enjoying it, yet somehow I just felt they had a kinship with each other. Definitely an independent feature, I hope it will be able to eventually break the festival circuit and get a proper release either theatrically or on DVD. It is definitely one worth watching for those interested in small character studies and really effective drama."}, {"url": "https://itsbiography.com/Dawn-Landes/", "page_content": "Dawn Landes Wiki \u2013 Dawn Landes Biography\n\nDawn Landes is a well-known celebrity from United States of America.
