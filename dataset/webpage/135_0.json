Kennedy, in full Robert Francis Kennedy, (born November 20, 1925, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.\u2014died June 6, 1968, Los Angeles, California), U.S. attorney general and adviser during the administration of his brother Pres. John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363) and later a U.S. senator (1965\u201368). He was son of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He was assassinated while campaigning for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nRobert interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II but returned to the university and graduated in 1948. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1951, he began his political career in Massachusetts the next year with the management of his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert first came into national prominence in 1953, when he was an assistant counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Joseph R. McCarthy (he resigned in mid-1953 but returned in 1954 as counsel to the Democratic minority). In 1957 he was chief counsel to the Senate select committee conducting investigations into labour racketeering, which led to his long-standing feud with James R. Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Kennedy resigned from the committee staff in 1960 to conduct his brother\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency. After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York. Within two years Kennedy had established himself as a major political figure in his own right. He became the chief spokesman for liberal Democrats and a critic of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the presidency. By June 4 he had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles\u2019 Ambassador Hotel. As he left through a kitchen hallway, he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Kennedy was buried near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

As attorney general, he fought organized crime and was a key supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. After JFK's assassination, Robert was elected to the U.S. Senate representing the state of New York. RFK was assassinated on June 5, 1968, during the California Democratic presidential primary. He died the next day.\n\nEarly Life & Siblings\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy, nicknamed Bobby, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925. His parents were Joseph, a rich businessman, and Rose, daughter of the mayor of Boston. Raised as devout Roman Catholics, Robert and his seven siblings enjoyed a life of wealth and privilege. Among Kennedy\u2019s older brothers was future U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n\nWhen Robert\u2019s father, Joseph Sr., became a U.S. ambassador to Britain, the family moved to England. As they had been in America, the Kennedy family members were regarded as handsome, charismatic and powerful, making them darlings of the press. The family returned to the States in 1939 as the threat of World War II was rapidly approaching.\n\nBack in Massachusetts, Robert graduated from Milton Academy prep school and then enrolled in Harvard. After his older brother Joseph was killed during World War II, Robert left Harvard to join the Navy. In 1946, he went back to Harvard and graduated with a degree in government two years later. Robert spent the next three years pursuing a law degree at the University of Virginia Law School. During that time he met and married his sister\u2019s roommate, a fellow student named Ethel Skakel. In 1951, the same year he graduated law school, Robert passed the Massachusetts bar exam.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nFresh out of law school, Kennedy joined the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division in 1951. In 1952 he resigned the position to lead his older brother John\u2019s senatorial campaign. In 1953 Kennedy became an advisor to the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations under Senator Joseph McCarthy. Kennedy left the position just six months later, objecting to McCarthy\u2019s unjust investigative tactics.\n\nCivil Rights\n\nIn 1954 Kennedy joined the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as chief counsel for the Democratic minority. Kennedy aptly expressed his approach to helping minorities achieve equal rights in a speech to South African students: \u201cEach time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\"\n\nIn 1957 Kennedy was appointed chief counsel to Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor of Management Field. Working under Senator McClellan, Kennedy uncovered the corruption of Teamsters union leader Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nIn 1960 Kennedy managed brother John\u2019s presidential campaign. When JFK was elected, Robert was made U.S. attorney general and became one of JFK\u2019s closest cabinet advisors. When JFK was assassinated in 1963, Robert resigned as attorney general the following September and announced his intent to run for a senate seat.\n\nKennedy ran successfully for senator of New York, and during his time in office, he continued to advocate for the poor and human rights and oppose racial discrimination and the escalation of involvement in the Vietnam War. He also set his sights on becoming a U.S. presidential candidate.\n\nAssassination\n\nIn 1968 Kennedy ran against Eugene McCarthy in the presidential election primaries. On June 5, 1968, following his victory speech at the California Democratic Primary at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Kennedy was shot several times by gunman Sirhan Sirhan. He died the next day at age 42, his promising presidential administration over before it began.\n\nFuneral\n\nOn June 6, Kennedy's body was taken to St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in NYC. The next morning a line of mourners extending 25 blocks long waited to pay their respects. By the afternoon hundreds of thousands more people bid farewell to Kennedy as they watched his coffin pass via funeral train en route to Washington, D.C. Kennedy was buried near his brother, John, at Arlington Cemetery.\n\nChildren\n\nKennedy and his wife Ethel had 11 children: Kathleen, Joseph, Robert Jr., David (1955\u20131984), Courtney, Michael (1958\u20131997), Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas, and Rory (b. 1968).

A graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia School of Law, Kennedy was appointed attorney general after his brother John Kennedy was elected president in 1960. In this role, Robert Kennedy fought organized crime and worked for civil rights for African Americans. In the Senate, he was a committed advocate of the poor and racial minorities, and opposed escalation of the Vietnam War. On June 5, 1968, while in Los Angeles campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Kennedy was shot. He died early the next day at age 42.\n\nRobert Kennedy: Early Years\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a wealthy financier, and Rose Kennedy, the daughter of a Boston politician.\n\nKennedy spent his childhood between his family\u2019s homes in New York; Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; Palm Beach, Florida; and London, where his father served as the American ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1940.\n\nDid you know? In 1965, Robert Kennedy was part of a group that was the first to ascend Mount Kennedy, which at the time was the highest unclimbed peak in North America. The 14,000-foot peak, named for John Kennedy, is located in Yukon, Canada.\n\nDuring World War II, Kennedy served in the U.S. Navy. In 1946 he was an apprentice seaman on the shakedown cruise of a naval destroyer named for his eldest brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr., a Navy pilot killed during the war.\n\nAfter completing his military service, in 1948 Kennedy graduated from Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and older brothers. He went on to attend law school at the University of Virginia, earning his degree in 1951.\n\nThat same year, Kennedy began working as a lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice. In 1952 he managed his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. The following year, Kennedy worked as an assistant counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by anticommunist crusader Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.\n\nIn the late 1950s, as chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, Kennedy gained national attention for investigating corruption in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a powerful trade union led by Jimmy Hoffa. Kennedy left the committee in 1959 to manage his brother John\u2019s successful presidential campaign.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Children\n\nOn June 17, 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children: Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, who was born six months after her father\u2019s death. The family lived at an estate called Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia.\n\nKennedy\u2019s oldest son, Joseph, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999, while his daughter Kathleen was lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003.\n\nRobert Kennedy as U.S. Attorney General\n\nAfter John F. Kennedy was elected president in November 1960, he named his brother Robert Kennedy as America\u2019s 64th attorney general. In this role, Kennedy continued to battle corruption in labor unions, as well as mobsters and organized crime. In 1964, Jimmy Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and fraud.\n\nAs attorney general, Kennedy also supported the civil rights movement for African Americans. In the fall of 1962, he sent thousands of federal troops to Oxford, Mississippi, to enforce a U.S. Supreme Court order admitting the first black student, James Meredith, to the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe state\u2019s segregationist governor, Ross Barnett, had attempted to bar Meredith, whose enrollment prompted riots and violence at the school.\n\nAdditionally, Kennedy worked with his brother, as well as his successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, on the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting, employment and public facilities.\n\nKennedy also acted as one of his brother\u2019s closest political advisors in the White House and was involved in important foreign policy decisions, including the administration\u2019s handling of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. He later wrote a book about the crisis, titled Thirteen Days, which was published posthumously in 1969.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy\n\nOn November 22, 1963, 46-year-old President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Robert Kennedy stayed on as attorney general under President Johnson until September 1964, when he resigned to embark on a campaign to represent New York in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDespite charges from some that he was a carpetbagger with little connection to the Empire State, Kennedy won the election and took office in January 1965.\n\nAs senator, Kennedy championed civil rights and social justice issues. He traveled to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, migrant workers\u2019 camps and urban ghettos to study the effects of poverty, and made trips abroad to such places as apartheid-ruled South Africa to advocate for the advancement of human rights.\n\nKennedy was also an outspoken critic of President Johnson\u2019s plans to escalate U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Presidential Bid\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy was urged by his supporters to run for president as an antiwar and socially progressive Democrat.\n\nHesitant until he saw positive primary returns for fellow antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on March 16, 1968, declaring, \u201cI do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I\u2019m obliged to do all I can.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 1968, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey became the key Democratic party hopeful, with McCarthy and Kennedy trailing closely behind. Kennedy conducted an energetic campaign and on June 4, 1968, won a major victory in the California primary.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Assassination\n\nIn the early hours of June 5, 1968, shortly after delivering a speech to celebrate his win in the California primary, Kennedy was shot in a kitchen corridor outside the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He died the next day at age 42.\n\nThe following year, Sirhan Sirhan, an immigrant from Palestine, was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder and sentenced to death. However, in 1972, after the California Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he remains today.\n\nOn June 8, at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City, Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy, U.S. senator from Massachusetts and the youngest Kennedy sibling, delivered a now-famous eulogy for his brother, remembering him as \u201ca good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\u201d\n\nAfter the funeral, Kennedy\u2019s coffin was taken by train from New York to Washington, D.C., with hundreds of thousands of mourners lining the tracks along the route. The train arrived in the nation\u2019s capital that night, and a motorcade transported Kennedy\u2019s body to Arlington National Cemetery for a rare nighttime burial."}, {"url": "https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy", "page_content": "Robert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh child in the closely knit and competitive family of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. \"I was the seventh of nine children,\" he later recalled, \"and when you come from that far down you have to struggle to survive.\"\n\nHe attended Milton Academy and, after wartime service in the Navy, received his degree in government from Harvard University in 1948. He earned his law degree from the University of Virginia Law School three years later. Perhaps more important for his education was the Kennedy family dinner table, where his parents involved their children in discussions of history and current affairs. \"I can hardly remember a mealtime,\" Robert Kennedy said, \"when the conversation was not dominated by what Franklin D. Roosevelt was doing or what was happening in the world.\"\n\nIn 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Connecticut, daughter of Ann Brannack Skakel and George Skakel, founder of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation. Robert and Ethel Kennedy later had eleven children. In 1952, he made his political debut as manager of his older brother John's successful campaign for the US Senate from Massachusetts.\n\nThe following year, he served briefly on the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Disturbed by McCarthy's controversial tactics, Kennedy resigned from the staff after six months. He later returned to the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations as chief counsel for the Democratic minority, in which capacity he wrote a report condemning McCarthy's investigation of alleged Communists in the Army. His later work as Chief Counsel for the Senate Rackets Committee investigating corruption in trade unions won him national recognition for exposing Teamsters' Union leaders Jimmy Hoffa and David Beck.\n\nIn 1960, he was the tireless and effective manager of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign. After the election, he was appointed Attorney General in President Kennedy's cabinet. While Attorney General, he won respect for his diligent, effective and nonpartisan administration of the Department of Justice.\n\nAttorney General Kennedy launched a successful drive against organized crime, and convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800% during his tenure. He also became increasingly committed to helping African Americans win the right to vote, attend integrated schools and use public accommodations. He demonstrated his commitment to civil rights during a 1961 speech at the University of Georgia Law School: \"We will not stand by or be aloof. We will move. I happen to believe that the 1954 [Supreme Court school desegregation] decision was right. But my belief does not matter. It is the law. Some of you may believe the decision was wrong. That does not matter. It is the law.\"\n\nIn September 1962, Attorney General Kennedy sent US Marshals and troops to Oxford, Mississippi to enforce a federal court order admitting the first African American student - James Meredith - to the University of Mississippi. The riot that had followed Meredith's registration at \"Ole Miss\" had left two dead and hundreds injured. Robert Kennedy believed that voting was the key to achieving racial justice and collaborated with President Kennedy in proposing the most far-reaching civil rights statute since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which passed eight months after President Kennedy's death.\n\nRobert Kennedy was not only President Kennedy's Attorney General, he was also his closest advisor and confidant. As a result of this unique relationship, the Attorney General played a key role in several critical foreign policy decisions. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, he helped develop the Kennedy administration's strategy to blockade Cuba instead of taking military action that could have led to nuclear war. He then negotiated with the Soviet Union on removal of the weapons.\n\nSoon after President Kennedy's death, Robert Kennedy resigned as Attorney General and, in 1964, ran successfully for the United States Senate from New York. His opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Kenneth Keating, labeled Kennedy a \"carpetbagger\" during the closely contested campaign. Kennedy responded to the attacks with humor. \"I have [had] really two choices over the period of the last ten months,\" he said at Columbia University. \"I could have stayed in - I could have retired. [Laughter.] And I - my father has done very well and I could have lived off him. [Laughter and applause.] ... I tell you frankly I don't need this title because I [could] be called General, I understand, for the rest of my life. [Laughter and applause.] And I don't need the money and I don't need the office space... [Laughter.] ... Frank as it is - and maybe it's difficult to believe in the state of New York - I'd like to just be a good United States Senator. I'd like to serve.\" Kennedy waged an effective statewide campaign and, aided by President Lyndon Johnson's landslide, won the November election by 719,000 votes.\n\nAs New York's Senator, he initiated a number of projects in the state, including assistance to underprivileged children and students with disabilities and the establishment of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation to improve living conditions and employment opportunities in depressed areas of Brooklyn. Since 1967, the program has been a model for communities all across the nation.\n\nThese programs were part of a larger effort to address the needs of the dispossessed and powerless in America - the poor, the young, racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to bring the facts about poverty to the conscience of the American people, journeying into urban ghettos, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta and migrant workers' camps. \"There are children in the Mississippi Delta,\" he said, \"whose bellies are swollen with hunger... Many of them cannot go to school because they have no clothes or shoes. These conditions are not confined to rural Mississippi. They exist in dark tenements in Washington, DC, within sight of the Capitol, in Harlem, in South Side Chicago, in Watts. There are children in each of these areas who have never been to school, never seen a doctor or a dentist. There are children who have never heard conversation in their homes, never read or even seen a book.\"\n\nHe sought to remedy the problems of poverty through legislation to encourage private industry to locate in poverty-stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare.\n\nRobert Kennedy was also committed to the advancement of human rights abroad. He traveled to Eastern Europe, Latin America and South Africa to share his belief that all people have a basic human right to participate in the political decisions that affect their lives and to criticize their government without fear of reprisal. He also believed that those who strike out against injustice show the highest form of courage. \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal,\" he said in a 1966 speech to South African students, \"or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\"\n\nKennedy was also absorbed during his Senate years by a quest to end the war in Vietnam. As a new Senator, Kennedy had originally supported the Johnson administration's policies in Vietnam, but also called for a greater commitment to a negotiated settlement and a renewed emphasis on economic and political reform within South Vietnam. As the war continued to widen and America's involvement deepened, Senator Kennedy came to have serious misgivings about President Johnson's conduct of the war. Kennedy publicly broke with the Johnson administration for the first time in February 1966, proposing participation by all sides (including the Viet Cong's political arm, the National Liberation Front) in the political life of South Vietnam. The following year, he took responsibility for his role in the Kennedy administration's policy in Southeast Asia, and urged President Johnson to cease the bombing of North Vietnam and reduce, rather than enlarge, the war effort. In his final Senate speech on Vietnam, Kennedy said, \"Are we like the God of the Old Testament that we can decide, in Washington, DC, what cities, what towns, what hamlets in Vietnam are going to be destroyed?... Do we have to accept that?... I do not think we have to. I think we can do something about it.\"\n\nOn March 16, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. It was, in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., \"an uproarious campaign, filled with enthusiasm and fun... It was also a campaign moving in its sweep and passion.\" Indeed, he challenged the complacent in American society and sought to bridge the great divides in American life - between the races, between the poor and the affluent, between young and old, between order and dissent. His 1968 campaign brought hope to an American people troubled by discontent and violence at home and war in Vietnam. He won critical primaries in Indiana and Nebraska and spoke to enthusiastic crowds across the nation.\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was fatally shot on June 5, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California shortly after claiming victory in that state's crucial Democratic primary. He was 42 years old. Although his life was cut short, Robert Kennedy's vision and ideals live on today through the work of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial in Washington, DC."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/robert-kennedy-4771654", "page_content": "Robert Kennedy was the attorney general of the United States in the administration of his older brother, President John F.

His father, Joseph Kennedy, was a banker and his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was the daughter of the former mayor of Boston, John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald. Robert was the seventh child in the family, and the third son.\n\nGrowing up in the increasingly wealthy Kennedy family, Robert lived a very privileged life as a child. When his father was named the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, the Kennedy children were featured in news stories and even movie newsreels depicting their travels to London.\n\nAs a teenager, Robert Kennedy attended Milton Academy, a prestigious prep school in a Boston suburb, and Harvard College. His education was interrupted when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy shortly after his oldest brother, Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., was killed in action in World War II. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Navy, but saw no action. He returned to college following the war's end, graduating from Harvard in 1948.\n\nKennedy entered law school at the University of Virginia, from which he graduated in the class of 1951.\n\nWhile in law school he dated Ethel Skakel, whom he had met while helping to manage his brother's congressional campaign. They were married on June 17, 1950. They would eventually have 11 children. Their family life, at a Virginia estate known as Hickory Hill, would become a focus of fascination for the public, as celebrities from the world of show business and sports would visit for parties which often involved touch football games.\n\nRobert Kennedy (left) and John Kennedy in a Senate hearing room. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nWashington Career\n\nKennedy joined the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice in 1951. In 1952, his older brother, Congressman John F. Kennedy, successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. Robert Kennedy then resigned from the Justice Department. He was hired as a staff attorney for the U.S. Senate committee run by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Kennedy worked for McCarthy's committee for five months. He resigned in the summer of 1953, after becoming disgusted with McCarthy's tactics.\n\nFollowing his interlude working with McCarthy, Kennedy moved to a staff job as an attorney working for the Democratic minority in the U.S. Senate. After the Democrats took the majority in the Senate in the elections of 1954, he became the chief counsel for the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\nKennedy convinced Senator John McClellan, who chaired the Investigations subcommittee, to form a select committee on labor racketeering. The new committee became known in the press as the Rackets Committee, as it specialized in investigating organized crime infiltration in labor unions. Senator John F. Kennedy served on the committee. With Robert as chief counsel often asking the questions of witnesses in lively hearings, the Kennedy brothers became familiar figures in the news.\n\nJimmy Hoffa gesturing to Robert Kennedy at a Senate hearing. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nKennedy vs. Jimmy Hoffa\n\nAt the Rackets Committee, Robert Kennedy focused on investigations of the Teamsters Union, which represented the nation's truck drivers. The union's president, Dave Beck, was widely assumed to be corrupt. When Beck was replaced by Jimmy Hoffa, who was rumored to be deeply associated with organized crime, Robert Kennedy began to target Hoffa.\n\nHoffa had grown up poor and had a well-deserved reputation as a tough guy in the Teamsters Union. He and Robert Kennedy could not have been more different, and when they squared off in a televised hearing in the summer of 1957, they became stars in a real-life drama. Hoffa, making wisecracks in a gravelly voice, was defiant in the face of Kennedy's pointed questioning. To anyone watching it seemed obvious that the two men despised each other. To Kennedy, Hoffa was a thug. To Hoffa, Kennedy was a \"spoiled brat.\"\n\nRobert Kennedy at the Justice Department, 1964. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nAttorney General\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, his brother Robert served as his campaign manager. After Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon, he began to select his cabinet, and there was talk of picking Robert Kennedy to be the nation's attorney general.\n\nThe decision was naturally controversial, as it sparked charges of nepotism. But the new president felt strongly that he needed his brother, who had become his most trusted adviser, in the government.\n\nAs attorney general of the U.S., Robert Kennedy continued his feud with Jimmy Hoffa. A team of federal prosecutors became widely known as the \"Get Hoffa Squad,\" and the Teamster boss was investigated by federal grand juries. Hoffa was eventually convicted and served a term in federal prison.\n\nRobert Kennedy was also focused on organized crime figures, and at one point advised President Kennedy not to deal with Frank Sinatra because of the singer's friendships with mobsters. Such events became fodder for later conspiracy theories that the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers were connected to organized crime.\n\nAs the Civil Rights Movement gained traction in the early 1960s, Kennedy, as attorney general, was often monitoring developments and at times sending federal agents to maintain order or enforce laws. A serious complication developed as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who hated Martin Luther King, wanted to tap King's phones and plant listening devices in his hotel rooms. Hoover was convinced that King was a communist and a enemy of the United States. Kennedy eventually acquiesced and gave approval to the wiretaps.\n\nSenator From New York\n\nFollowing his brother's violent death in November 1963, Robert Kennedy went into a period of mourning and sadness. He was still the nation's attorney general, but his heart wasn't in the job, and he was not happy working with the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Kennedy began to seriously think of running for a U.S. Senate seat in New York. The Kennedy family had lived in New York for a time during his childhood, so Kennedy had some link to the state. Yet he was portrayed by his opponent, the Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, as a \"carpetbagger,\" meaning someone who came into a state just to win an election.\n\nKennedy won the election in November 1964, and took office as a senator in early 1965. As the brother of the recently assassinated president, and someone who had been in the national news a decade, he immediately had a high profile on Capitol Hill.\n\nKennedy took his new job seriously, spending time studying local issues, visiting rural parts of New York State, and advocating for impoverished neighborhoods in New York City. He also traveled overseas, and put a focus on issues of poverty around the globe.\n\nOne issue would begin to dominate Kennedy's time in the Senate: the escalating and increasingly costly war in Vietnam. Though American involvement in Vietnam had been a feature of his brother's presidency, Kennedy came to believe the war was unwinnable and the loss of American lives needed to end.\n\nRobert Kennedy campaigning in Detroit in 1968. Andrew Sacks/Getty Images\n\nThe Anti-War Candidate\n\nAnother Democratic senator, Eugene McCarthy, had entered the race against President Johnson and nearly beat him in the New Hampshire primary. Kennedy sensed that challenging Johnson was not an impossible quest, and within a week he entered the race.\n\nKennedy's campaign immediately took off. He began attracting large crowds at campaign stops in states holding primaries. His campaign style was energetic, as he would plunge into crowds, shaking hands.\n\nTwo weeks after Kennedy's entry into the 1968 race, President Johnson shocked the nation announcing that he would not run again. Kennedy began to seem like the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, especially after strong showings in primaries in Indiana and Nebraska. After losing the primary in Oregon, he came back strong and won the California primary on June 4, 1968.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter celebrating his victory in a Los Angeles hotel ballroom, Kennedy was shot at close range in the hotel's kitchen in the early hours of June 5, 1968. He was taken to a hospital, where he died of a head wound on June 6, 1968.\n\nCrowds lined railroad tracks as Robert Kennedy's body returned to Washington. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nAfter a funeral mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, Kennedy's body was taken to Washington, D.C., by train on Saturday, June 8, 1968. In a scene reminiscent of the funeral train of Abraham Lincoln, mourners lined the railroad tracks between New York and Washington. He was buried that evening in Arlington National Cemetery, a short distance from President Kennedy's grave.\n\nHis killing, coming two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King, and less than five years after President Kennedy\u2019s murder, became one of the most memorable events of the 1960s. Robert Kennedy's assassination cast a pall over the election campaign. There was a feeling among many that he would have won the presidency in 1968, and the modern history of the United States would have been quite different.\n\nKennedy's younger brother, Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy kept the family's political tradition going, serving in the U.S. Senate until his death in 2009. Children and grandchildren of Robert Kennedy have also served in political office, including Joe Kennedy III, who represents a Massachusetts district in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSources:"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/robert-francis-kennedy", "page_content": "Guest Essay\n\nJoan Didion, the Death of R.F.K. and the Solution to a Decades-Old Mystery\n\nThe celebrated author wrote about having a breakdown.

Kennedy stood on the steps of Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayoral residence, and announced his candidacy for New York State Senator.\n\n\u201cAll that President Kennedy stood for, all that President Johnson is trying to accomplish, all the progress that has been made is threatened by a new and dangerous Republican assault,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIn this struggle, New York has a special role to play, a role which transcends the question of electoral votes for the presidency. For New York is the supreme testing ground for the most acute national problems of our time, the problems of racial harmony, of employment, of youth, of education, and the quality of urban and suburban life.\u201d\n\nThe campaign against incumbent Republican Senator Kenneth Keating was going to be a quick and fierce affair. Kennedy had less than three months to convince New Yorkers that a change in leadership was needed\u2026and that it should come via a politician from Massachusetts. But campaign stops, like the one shown in this video from Columbia University, helped seal the deal. On November 3, 1964, he won the seat in a landslide.\n\nThe 'Carpetbagger' Turned New York Senator\n\nNew York may have seemed an unlikely state for Kennedy. After all, he wasn\u2019t a resident of New York, or registered to vote there, and he had to obtain special permission to run in the state. While the New York Democratic Committee paved the way for him to run, his outsider status provided fodder for Keating\u2019s most pointed attack: that Kennedy was a \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d who couldn\u2019t possibly represent the interests of New Yorkers.\n\nWhile Kennedy had to contend with this criticism throughout his fall campaign, he gave one of his clearest responses during his stop at Columbia University. There, he explained that he was running because he wanted to, not because he needed to. \u201cI tell you frankly I don\u2019t need this title because I [could] be called General, I understand, for the rest of my life. And I don\u2019t need the money and I don\u2019t need the office space. Frank as it is \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s difficult to believe in the state of New York \u2014 I\u2019d like to just be a good United States Senator. I\u2019d like to serve.\u201d\n\nIn the Shadow of His Brother\n\nDespite what he may have said about his calling to serve\u2014or, at least, in addition to his calling\u2014Kennedy\u2019s bid for senator was in some ways his last chance at continuing the political career he began under his brother. After John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, RFK stayed on as Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson. But he didn\u2019t have the same influence with Johnson as he had with his brother. Moreover, the president had turned him down for the job he really wanted: vice-presidential candidate on Johnson\u2019s next ticket.\n\nSo with his prospects dimmed in the White House, Kennedy decided to take the opportunity in New York that he had initially turned down earlier that summer. In addition to his desire to continue his political career, Kennedy also wanted to carry on the legacy of his brother. As can be seen in many of his speeches, including his talk at Columbia, he often referenced the memory of his brother and the values that he had promoted.\n\nAs Thurston Clarke wrote in Vanity Fair in 2008, \u201cKennedy was still mourning his brother and endeavoring to live for him when he ran for the U.S. Senate from New York in the autumn of 1964, telling a friend that he wanted to ensure that the hopes J.F.K. had kindled around the world would not die, and saying in his victory statement that he had won \u2018an overwhelming mandate to continue the policies\u2019 of President Kennedy.\u201d\n\nA Senator Extraordinaire\n\nOn election day in 1964, Keating frantically made stops around the state in hopes of solidifying the vote. Kennedy, on the other hand, took seven of his kids to the Bronx Zoo and had lunch with his sister-in-law Jackie Kennedy. He won by 719,000 votes.\n\nDuring his three years in office, Kennedy launched an aggressive and impressive agenda. He took on poverty, particularly as it affected children and education, and he came out against the Vietnam War. He tackled issues that went far beyond the boundaries of his state and dedicated himself to furthering human rights on a global scale.\n\nGiven his actions as a Senator, it was perhaps not that surprising when Kennedy made another announcement on March 16, 1968, this time from the U.S. Senate Caucus Room: he had decided to run for president. Tragically, his candidacy would be cut short only a few months later when, like his brother, he was assassinated."}, {"url": "https://millercenter.org/president/kennedy/essays/kennedy-1961-attorney-general", "page_content": "Robert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was the seventh of nine children and the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy. Robert, known mostly as \"Bobby,\" attended Milton Academy and went on to receive a B.A. from Harvard University in 1948. During the summer following his graduation, he worked for the Boston Post as a war correspondent. In 1951, Robert Kennedy graduated from the University of Virginia Law School, serving for a short time thereafter as an attorney in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department.\n\nHe left in 1952, however, to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert Kennedy became assistant counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, then headed by Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI). He quickly resigned in July 1953, however, as a result of disagreements over the subcommittee's procedures. Kennedy then rejoined the subcommittee in 1954 as chief counsel for the minority party Democrats, and he later became chief counsel for the racketeering committee investigating illegalities in the management of trade unions.\n\nIn November 1959, Robert Kennedy became manager of his brother's presidential campaign. Following the Kennedy victory, the President-elect tapped his brother, on December 16, 1960, to be Attorney General. In that capacity, Robert Kennedy exposed the racketeer control of labor unions. His work on behalf of civil rights led to passage of the Kennedy administration's civil rights bill in July of 1964 and to protections regarding the black American's right to vote. Kennedy also set his sights on antitrust prosecution and reducing the growth of crime.\n\nAs the brother of the President, Robert Kennedy also had a unique role as adviser to the commander-in-chief. Robert was John's closest aide, especially after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. He was included in the decision-making process for all major foreign and domestic policy issues. During the Cuban missile crisis, Robert was a member of the Excom, the specially assembled group organized to determine America's response to nuclear weapons in Cuba. The attorney general would eventually voice opposition to air strikes on the island, opting instead for a \"quarantine.\" He played a crucial role in securing Excom support for a blockade of Cuba. Robert Kennedy also played a crucial role, through back-channel conversations with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, in gaining the removal of the missiles. Robert Kennedy resigned the attorney general post in 1964, following his brother's assassination, and waged a successful campaign to become a U.S. Senator from New York.\n\nIn the Senate, he worked for the cause of the urban poor and emerged as an outspoken critic of President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policy. Kennedy joined the race for the 1968 presidential election in March of that year, winning the primaries in Indiana, Nebraska, and California. On June 5, while campaigning in Los Angeles, Robert Kennedy was shot by Sirhan B. Sirhan, a Jordanian living in California.

In 1952, he made his political debut as manager of his older brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts. The following year, he served briefly on the staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Disturbed by McCarthy's controversial tactics, Kennedy resigned from the staff after six months.\n\nIn 1960 he was the tireless and effective manager of John's presidential campaign. After the election, he was appointed Attorney General in President Kennedy's Cabinet. While Attorney General he won respect for his diligent, effective and nonpartisan administration of the Department of Justice. Attorney General Kennedy became increasingly committed to the rights of African Americans to vote, receive an equal education, and use public accommodations. He was not only President Kennedy's Attorney General, he was also his closest advisor and confidant. As a result of this unique relationship, the Attorney General played a key role in several critical foreign policy decisions.\n\nSoon after President Kennedy's death, Robert Kennedy resigned as Attorney General and, in 1964, ran successfully for the United States Senate from New York. Kennedy waged an effective statewide campaign and, aided by President Lyndon Johnson's landslide, won the November election by 719,000 votes. As Senator, Kennedy helped initiate programs that were part of a larger effort to address the needs of the dispossessed and powerless in America - the poor, the young, racial minorities and Native Americans. He sought to bring the facts about poverty to the conscience of the American people, journeying into urban ghettos, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta and migrant workers' camps. Kennedy was also committed to the advancement of human rights abroad, and was also absorbed during his Senate years by a quest to end the war in Vietnam.\n\nOn March 18, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. In this campaign he challenged the complacent in American society and sought to bridge the great divides in American life - between the races, between the poor and the more affluent, between young and old, between order and dissent.

After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York.

His parents were Joseph, a rich businessman, and Rose, daughter of the mayor of Boston. Raised as devout Roman Catholics, Robert and his seven siblings enjoyed a life of wealth and privilege. Among Kennedy\u2019s older brothers was future U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n\nWhen Robert\u2019s father, Joseph Sr., became a U.S. ambassador to Britain, the family moved to England.

A graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia School of Law, Kennedy was appointed attorney general after his brother John Kennedy was elected president in 1960. In this role, Robert Kennedy fought organized crime and worked for civil rights for African Americans. In the Senate, he was a committed advocate of the poor and racial minorities, and opposed escalation of the Vietnam War. On June 5, 1968, while in Los Angeles campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Kennedy was shot. He died early the next day at age 42.\n\nRobert Kennedy: Early Years\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a wealthy financier, and Rose Kennedy, the daughter of a Boston politician.\n\nKennedy spent his childhood between his family\u2019s homes in New York; Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; Palm Beach, Florida; and London, where his father served as the American ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1940.\n\nDid you know? In 1965, Robert Kennedy was part of a group that was the first to ascend Mount Kennedy, which at the time was the highest unclimbed peak in North America. The 14,000-foot peak, named for John Kennedy, is located in Yukon, Canada.\n\nDuring World War II, Kennedy served in the U.S. Navy. In 1946 he was an apprentice seaman on the shakedown cruise of a naval destroyer named for his eldest brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr., a Navy pilot killed during the war.\n\nAfter completing his military service, in 1948 Kennedy graduated from Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and older brothers. He went on to attend law school at the University of Virginia, earning his degree in 1951.\n\nThat same year, Kennedy began working as a lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice. In 1952 he managed his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. The following year, Kennedy worked as an assistant counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by anticommunist crusader Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.\n\nIn the late 1950s, as chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, Kennedy gained national attention for investigating corruption in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a powerful trade union led by Jimmy Hoffa. Kennedy left the committee in 1959 to manage his brother John\u2019s successful presidential campaign.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Children\n\nOn June 17, 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children: Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, who was born six months after her father\u2019s death. The family lived at an estate called Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia.\n\nKennedy\u2019s oldest son, Joseph, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999, while his daughter Kathleen was lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003.\n\nRobert Kennedy as U.S. Attorney General\n\nAfter John F. Kennedy was elected president in November 1960, he named his brother Robert Kennedy as America\u2019s 64th attorney general. In this role, Kennedy continued to battle corruption in labor unions, as well as mobsters and organized crime. In 1964, Jimmy Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and fraud.\n\nAs attorney general, Kennedy also supported the civil rights movement for African Americans. In the fall of 1962, he sent thousands of federal troops to Oxford, Mississippi, to enforce a U.S. Supreme Court order admitting the first black student, James Meredith, to the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe state\u2019s segregationist governor, Ross Barnett, had attempted to bar Meredith, whose enrollment prompted riots and violence at the school.\n\nAdditionally, Kennedy worked with his brother, as well as his successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, on the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting, employment and public facilities.\n\nKennedy also acted as one of his brother\u2019s closest political advisors in the White House and was involved in important foreign policy decisions, including the administration\u2019s handling of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. He later wrote a book about the crisis, titled Thirteen Days, which was published posthumously in 1969.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy\n\nOn November 22, 1963, 46-year-old President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Robert Kennedy stayed on as attorney general under President Johnson until September 1964, when he resigned to embark on a campaign to represent New York in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDespite charges from some that he was a carpetbagger with little connection to the Empire State, Kennedy won the election and took office in January 1965.\n\nAs senator, Kennedy championed civil rights and social justice issues. He traveled to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, migrant workers\u2019 camps and urban ghettos to study the effects of poverty, and made trips abroad to such places as apartheid-ruled South Africa to advocate for the advancement of human rights.\n\nKennedy was also an outspoken critic of President Johnson\u2019s plans to escalate U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Presidential Bid\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy was urged by his supporters to run for president as an antiwar and socially progressive Democrat.\n\nHesitant until he saw positive primary returns for fellow antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on March 16, 1968, declaring, \u201cI do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I\u2019m obliged to do all I can.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 1968, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey became the key Democratic party hopeful, with McCarthy and Kennedy trailing closely behind. Kennedy conducted an energetic campaign and on June 4, 1968, won a major victory in the California primary.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Assassination\n\nIn the early hours of June 5, 1968, shortly after delivering a speech to celebrate his win in the California primary, Kennedy was shot in a kitchen corridor outside the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He died the next day at age 42.\n\nThe following year, Sirhan Sirhan, an immigrant from Palestine, was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder and sentenced to death. However, in 1972, after the California Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he remains today.\n\nOn June 8, at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City, Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy, U.S. senator from Massachusetts and the youngest Kennedy sibling, delivered a now-famous eulogy for his brother, remembering him as \u201ca good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\u201d\n\nAfter the funeral, Kennedy\u2019s coffin was taken by train from New York to Washington, D.C., with hundreds of thousands of mourners lining the tracks along the route. The train arrived in the nation\u2019s capital that night, and a motorcade transported Kennedy\u2019s body to Arlington National Cemetery for a rare nighttime burial."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2023/06/05/1179430014/robert-kennedy-rfk-assassination-anniversary", "page_content": "Robert Kennedy was killed 55 years ago.

As U.S. attorney general, he authorized the FBI to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr.'s telephones in 1963, because of suspicion that one of King's aides had communist ties.\n\nBut Kennedy was a well-known advocate for marginalized communities and spoke about racial equality during his campaign. Two months before his own death, Kennedy gave an impromptu speech to a mostly Black crowd in Indianapolis about the assassination of Dr. King.\n\n\"What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but love and compassion toward one another, a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer, whether they be white or whether be Black,\" he said.\n\nOn the day Kennedy died, Congress responded by expanding Secret Service protection to include major presidential candidates.

He was the seventh of nine children and the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy. Robert, known mostly as \"Bobby,\" attended Milton Academy and went on to receive a B.A. from Harvard University in 1948. During the summer following his graduation, he worked for the Boston Post as a war correspondent. In 1951, Robert Kennedy graduated from the University of Virginia Law School, serving for a short time thereafter as an attorney in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department.\n\nHe left in 1952, however, to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert Kennedy became assistant counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, then headed by Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI). He quickly resigned in July 1953, however, as a result of disagreements over the subcommittee's procedures. Kennedy then rejoined the subcommittee in 1954 as chief counsel for the minority party Democrats, and he later became chief counsel for the racketeering committee investigating illegalities in the management of trade unions.\n\nIn November 1959, Robert Kennedy became manager of his brother's presidential campaign. Following the Kennedy victory, the President-elect tapped his brother, on December 16, 1960, to be Attorney General. In that capacity, Robert Kennedy exposed the racketeer control of labor unions. His work on behalf of civil rights led to passage of the Kennedy administration's civil rights bill in July of 1964 and to protections regarding the black American's right to vote. Kennedy also set his sights on antitrust prosecution and reducing the growth of crime.\n\nAs the brother of the President, Robert Kennedy also had a unique role as adviser to the commander-in-chief. Robert was John's closest aide, especially after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. He was included in the decision-making process for all major foreign and domestic policy issues. During the Cuban missile crisis, Robert was a member of the Excom, the specially assembled group organized to determine America's response to nuclear weapons in Cuba. The attorney general would eventually voice opposition to air strikes on the island, opting instead for a \"quarantine.\" He played a crucial role in securing Excom support for a blockade of Cuba. Robert Kennedy also played a crucial role, through back-channel conversations with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, in gaining the removal of the missiles. Robert Kennedy resigned the attorney general post in 1964, following his brother's assassination, and waged a successful campaign to become a U.S. Senator from New York.\n\nIn the Senate, he worked for the cause of the urban poor and emerged as an outspoken critic of President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policy. Kennedy joined the race for the 1968 presidential election in March of that year, winning the primaries in Indiana, Nebraska, and California. On June 5, while campaigning in Los Angeles, Robert Kennedy was shot by Sirhan B. Sirhan, a Jordanian living in California.

His father, Joseph Kennedy, was a banker and his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was the daughter of the former mayor of Boston, John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald. Robert was the seventh child in the family, and the third son.\n\nGrowing up in the increasingly wealthy Kennedy family, Robert lived a very privileged life as a child. When his father was named the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, the Kennedy children were featured in news stories and even movie newsreels depicting their travels to London.\n\nAs a teenager, Robert Kennedy attended Milton Academy, a prestigious prep school in a Boston suburb, and Harvard College. His education was interrupted when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy shortly after his oldest brother, Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., was killed in action in World War II. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Navy, but saw no action. He returned to college following the war's end, graduating from Harvard in 1948.\n\nKennedy entered law school at the University of Virginia, from which he graduated in the class of 1951.\n\nWhile in law school he dated Ethel Skakel, whom he had met while helping to manage his brother's congressional campaign. They were married on June 17, 1950. They would eventually have 11 children. Their family life, at a Virginia estate known as Hickory Hill, would become a focus of fascination for the public, as celebrities from the world of show business and sports would visit for parties which often involved touch football games.\n\nRobert Kennedy (left) and John Kennedy in a Senate hearing room. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nWashington Career\n\nKennedy joined the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice in 1951. In 1952, his older brother, Congressman John F. Kennedy, successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. Robert Kennedy then resigned from the Justice Department. He was hired as a staff attorney for the U.S. Senate committee run by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Kennedy worked for McCarthy's committee for five months. He resigned in the summer of 1953, after becoming disgusted with McCarthy's tactics.\n\nFollowing his interlude working with McCarthy, Kennedy moved to a staff job as an attorney working for the Democratic minority in the U.S. Senate. After the Democrats took the majority in the Senate in the elections of 1954, he became the chief counsel for the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\nKennedy convinced Senator John McClellan, who chaired the Investigations subcommittee, to form a select committee on labor racketeering. The new committee became known in the press as the Rackets Committee, as it specialized in investigating organized crime infiltration in labor unions. Senator John F. Kennedy served on the committee. With Robert as chief counsel often asking the questions of witnesses in lively hearings, the Kennedy brothers became familiar figures in the news.\n\nJimmy Hoffa gesturing to Robert Kennedy at a Senate hearing. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nKennedy vs. Jimmy Hoffa\n\nAt the Rackets Committee, Robert Kennedy focused on investigations of the Teamsters Union, which represented the nation's truck drivers. The union's president, Dave Beck, was widely assumed to be corrupt. When Beck was replaced by Jimmy Hoffa, who was rumored to be deeply associated with organized crime, Robert Kennedy began to target Hoffa.\n\nHoffa had grown up poor and had a well-deserved reputation as a tough guy in the Teamsters Union. He and Robert Kennedy could not have been more different, and when they squared off in a televised hearing in the summer of 1957, they became stars in a real-life drama. Hoffa, making wisecracks in a gravelly voice, was defiant in the face of Kennedy's pointed questioning. To anyone watching it seemed obvious that the two men despised each other. To Kennedy, Hoffa was a thug. To Hoffa, Kennedy was a \"spoiled brat.\"\n\nRobert Kennedy at the Justice Department, 1964. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nAttorney General\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, his brother Robert served as his campaign manager. After Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon, he began to select his cabinet, and there was talk of picking Robert Kennedy to be the nation's attorney general.\n\nThe decision was naturally controversial, as it sparked charges of nepotism. But the new president felt strongly that he needed his brother, who had become his most trusted adviser, in the government.\n\nAs attorney general of the U.S., Robert Kennedy continued his feud with Jimmy Hoffa. A team of federal prosecutors became widely known as the \"Get Hoffa Squad,\" and the Teamster boss was investigated by federal grand juries. Hoffa was eventually convicted and served a term in federal prison.\n\nRobert Kennedy was also focused on organized crime figures, and at one point advised President Kennedy not to deal with Frank Sinatra because of the singer's friendships with mobsters. Such events became fodder for later conspiracy theories that the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers were connected to organized crime.\n\nAs the Civil Rights Movement gained traction in the early 1960s, Kennedy, as attorney general, was often monitoring developments and at times sending federal agents to maintain order or enforce laws. A serious complication developed as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who hated Martin Luther King, wanted to tap King's phones and plant listening devices in his hotel rooms. Hoover was convinced that King was a communist and a enemy of the United States. Kennedy eventually acquiesced and gave approval to the wiretaps.\n\nSenator From New York\n\nFollowing his brother's violent death in November 1963, Robert Kennedy went into a period of mourning and sadness. He was still the nation's attorney general, but his heart wasn't in the job, and he was not happy working with the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, Kennedy began to seriously think of running for a U.S. Senate seat in New York. The Kennedy family had lived in New York for a time during his childhood, so Kennedy had some link to the state. Yet he was portrayed by his opponent, the Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, as a \"carpetbagger,\" meaning someone who came into a state just to win an election.\n\nKennedy won the election in November 1964, and took office as a senator in early 1965. As the brother of the recently assassinated president, and someone who had been in the national news a decade, he immediately had a high profile on Capitol Hill.\n\nKennedy took his new job seriously, spending time studying local issues, visiting rural parts of New York State, and advocating for impoverished neighborhoods in New York City. He also traveled overseas, and put a focus on issues of poverty around the globe.\n\nOne issue would begin to dominate Kennedy's time in the Senate: the escalating and increasingly costly war in Vietnam. Though American involvement in Vietnam had been a feature of his brother's presidency, Kennedy came to believe the war was unwinnable and the loss of American lives needed to end.\n\nRobert Kennedy campaigning in Detroit in 1968. Andrew Sacks/Getty Images\n\nThe Anti-War Candidate\n\nAnother Democratic senator, Eugene McCarthy, had entered the race against President Johnson and nearly beat him in the New Hampshire primary. Kennedy sensed that challenging Johnson was not an impossible quest, and within a week he entered the race.\n\nKennedy's campaign immediately took off. He began attracting large crowds at campaign stops in states holding primaries. His campaign style was energetic, as he would plunge into crowds, shaking hands.\n\nTwo weeks after Kennedy's entry into the 1968 race, President Johnson shocked the nation announcing that he would not run again. Kennedy began to seem like the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, especially after strong showings in primaries in Indiana and Nebraska. After losing the primary in Oregon, he came back strong and won the California primary on June 4, 1968.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter celebrating his victory in a Los Angeles hotel ballroom, Kennedy was shot at close range in the hotel's kitchen in the early hours of June 5, 1968. He was taken to a hospital, where he died of a head wound on June 6, 1968.\n\nCrowds lined railroad tracks as Robert Kennedy's body returned to Washington. Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nAfter a funeral mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, Kennedy's body was taken to Washington, D.C., by train on Saturday, June 8, 1968. In a scene reminiscent of the funeral train of Abraham Lincoln, mourners lined the railroad tracks between New York and Washington. He was buried that evening in Arlington National Cemetery, a short distance from President Kennedy's grave.\n\nHis killing, coming two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King, and less than five years after President Kennedy\u2019s murder, became one of the most memorable events of the 1960s. Robert Kennedy's assassination cast a pall over the election campaign. There was a feeling among many that he would have won the presidency in 1968, and the modern history of the United States would have been quite different.\n\nKennedy's younger brother, Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy kept the family's political tradition going, serving in the U.S. Senate until his death in 2009. Children and grandchildren of Robert Kennedy have also served in political office, including Joe Kennedy III, who represents a Massachusetts district in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSources:"}, {"url": "https://www.grunge.com/222117/the-tragic-truth-about-robert-kennedys-death/", "page_content": "The Tragic Story Behind Robert Kennedy's Death\n\nTo some in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) seemed the country's last chance at a promising future. In the civil rights era, the former U.S. attorney general and candidate for the presidency built his platform around race reform and social justice issues. By doing so, RFK, who was the brother of the late President John F. Kennedy (JFK), sought to unite the economically underprivileged white working class and Black Americans. RFK was killed by an assassin before those goals could play out, though, and for this reason, Kennedy \u2014 much like his brother after he was struck down by an assassin's bullet five years earlier \u2014 remains a symbol of what might have been.\n\nOn the night that he died, RFK had won the all-important California primary when, after giving a victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, the politician made his way to exit the building through the pantry area. Around that same time, then-busboy Juan Romero shook Kennedy's hand to congratulate him on the victory when the White House hopeful was shot at close range. Pulling the trigger was 22-year-old Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian citizen angered by Kennedy's perceived support of Israel. RFK died the next day, and in the chaos, five others were wounded before the shooter was tackled and disarmed.\n\nSpeaking with the Los Angeles Times in 2015, Romero said RFK's death \"made me realize that no matter how much hope you have, it can be taken away in a second.\" RFK, Romero said, \"made me feel like a regular citizen.

He had been reluctant to run against a sitting president from his own political party, but he was eager to address the issues of civil rights, poverty, and the Vietnam War, which he believed President Johnson was handling poorly.As Kennedy embarked on his presidential campaign, there were certain challenges he realized he had to overcome. He, unlike his brother John, was not as easily charismatic or confident. At first, he was quiet and nervous speaking in front of the crowds that gathered for him. At times, he stumbled with his words and his voice and hands shook from nerves.However, as the campaign progressed, Senator Kennedy gained confidence in himself. He realized the crowds were there to see and support him for who he was, and not just because he was seen as the forbearer to his brother John\u2019s legacy. Overtime, he became more polished at articulating his thoughts regarding the issues he so deeply cared about. Senator Kennedy had originally favored intervention in Vietnam. However, as the situation there worsened, his position changed and he took an anti-war stance.On the evening of April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Kennedy was scheduled to deliver a campaign speech that night in Indianapolis, IN to a crowd of predominantly Black Americans. As he delivered the shocking news of King\u2019s assassination, he empathized with his supporters and encouraged them to find peaceful and productive ways to channel their sorrow. (Watch the speech) As violence broke out across many American cities that evening, Indianapolis stayed peaceful. John Lewis later remarked, \u201cHe {Kennedy} became the one man who could soothe the savage pain that swept through the city of Indianapolis, and there were no violent outbreaks there. I do remember calming my own sorrow in that dark hour by thinking, Dr. King is gone, but we still have Bobby.\"Only two months later, and just after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California, Kennedy was fatally wounded at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, CA.

He became so involved at the nonprofit that after he finished his 1,500 hours of community service, he was hired as its chief attorney after having passed the final portion of the bar exam in 1985.\n\nEnvironmental Activism\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has devoted much of his career to environmental causes. Getty Images\n\nIn 1998, Kennedy co-founded a bottled water company, Tear of the Clouds LLC, with Chris Bartle and John Hoving. A year later, he helped found Waterkeeper Alliance, a global umbrella group which supports local environmental organizations protect their respective bodies of water. In 2004, he became a co-host\u2014along with Mike Papantonio and Sam Seder\u2014of Ring of Fire, a syndicated U.S. talk radio show that focuses on American politics.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Kennedy\u2019s work centered on advocating for renewable energy development and encouraging citizens to protect their local waterways. In May of 2010, he was named a \u201cHero for the Planet\u201d by Time for his work with Riverkeeper, helping to restore the Hudson River. Kennedy\u2019s environmental activism also includes writing two books and numerous articles on issues affecting the environment. He served as senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council for many years.\n\nIn 2016, he joined thousands of concerned citizens and Native Americans from numerous tribes at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. He also denounced the use of militarized police against the peaceful protesters. \u201cToday, we stand in solidarity with the people of Standing Rock and commend the Sioux Nation for taking on this courageous fight on behalf of our country, humanity, and democracy,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAcross the nation, communities of color face environmental and public health threats most communities don\u2019t have to think about. This historic peaceful protest declares that all communities deserve clean water.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, after 33 years with Riverkeeper, Kennedy resigned as the New York\u2013based group\u2019s chief attorney and board member, citing a long-distance commute from his home on the West Coast and other commitments. Three years later, in November 2020, he left his position as president of Waterkeeper Alliance \u201cto devote himself, full-time, to other issues.\u201d He had been president since the nonprofit\u2019s founding in 1999, and during his tenure, Waterkeeper Alliance grew to include more than 350 groups across 48 countries.\n\nAnti-Vaccine Advocacy and Controversies\n\nMore recently, Kennedy has turned his focus to anti-vaccine activism, though he has said all his children were vaccinated and he got flu shots annually. He is known for his controversial views on the link between vaccinations and autism. He has been vocal against including the preservative thimerosal in vaccines, believing there is a government cover-up on its damaging effects on children. Peer-reviewed research studies have not found evidence of harmful side effects from thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nIn April 2015, Kennedy helped promote a film called Trace Amounts, which supports his views. The next year, he founded Children\u2019s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit previously known as the World Mercury Project. The group gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic, though Meta banned its accounts on Facebook and Instagram in August 2022 for violating the platforms\u2019 policies on spreading misinformation. Kennedy\u2019s personal Instagram account had previously been banned in February 2021.\n\nOver the years, he has made, then later apologized for, controversial statements connecting vaccine side effects and mandates to the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. His remarks have been widely condemned, including by his own family members.\n\n2024 Presidential Campaign\n\nHoping to continue his family\u2019s long lineage of public service, Kennedy filed a statement of candidacy for the 2024 presidential election on April 6, 2023. He is running for president as a Democrat. According to the Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s website, Kennedy began a leave of absence as the nonprofit\u2019s chairman and chief legal counsel days prior to his filing, on April 2.\n\nKennedy has been open about his political ambitions. In a 2007 magazine interview with Oprah Winfrey, he said being a father was one reason he hadn\u2019t yet run for office but that he was interested. When Winfrey asked if he would ever run for president, Kennedy said, \u201cIf opportunities came up for me to run for office, I would probably do it.\u201d\n\nLegal Troubles\n\nKennedy has had a few brushes with the legal system. As a teenager, he was arrested in Massachusetts for smoking marijuana and placed on 13 months\u2019 probation.\n\nIn September 1983 when he was 29 years old, Kennedy was arrested after experienced an apparent drug overdose during a flight to Rapid City, South Dakota. At the airport, police confiscated his luggage and found \u201ca small amount\u201d\u2014reportedly 183 milligrams\u2014of heroin. Shortly after, he entered a drug treatment program in New Jersey. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a felony possession charge and was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation, drug testing and treatment, and several hours of community service. Not long after, the charge was expunged from his record. In a 2007 interview, he said he had been sober for 23 years.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was arrested during a 2019 climate change protest at the U.S. Capitol. Getty Images\n\nDecades later, in 2001, he and several others\u2014including Al Sharpton and Jacqueline Jackson, the wife of Jesse Jackson\u2014were convicted of trespassing during a protest of U.S. Navy bombing exercises on Vieques island in Puerto Rico. Kennedy served a 30-day jail sentence. In 2019, he was arrested at the U.S. Capitol during a climate change protest, organized by actor Jane Fonda.\n\n\n\nWives and Children\n\nCheryl Hines and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., seen here at a celebrity ski event in 2016, got married in 2014. Getty Images\n\nKennedy married Emily Ruth Black, whom he met at the University of Virginia law school, in 1982. The couple had two children, Robert and Kathleen, and divorced in March 1994.\n\nLess than one month later, Kennedy married Mary Richardson during a ceremony that was held aboard a ship on the Hudson River. They had four children: Conor, Kyra, William and Aiden. On May 12, 2010, Kennedy filed for divorce from Mary Richardson Kennedy, and shortly after, she was arrested for drunk driving on two separate occasions. Mary was found dead in her home on May 16, 2012, and it was later determined that she had died of asphyxiation due to hanging. Their divorce had not been finalized at the time of her death.\n\nKennedy began dating actor Cheryl Hines in 2010. They met through Larry David, Hines\u2019 co-star on Curb Your Enthusiasm, who introduced them two years in a row. Kennedy and Hines married on August 2, 2014. She has a daughter from a previous marriage. Both Kennedy and Hines ski.\n\nHealth Challenges\n\nWhen he was in his 40s, Kennedy was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition affecting the voice box that causes strained speech. In a 2007 interview, he said his condition began as a mild tremble before progressing.\n\n\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Kennedy, in full Robert Francis Kennedy, (born November 20, 1925, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.\u2014died June 6, 1968, Los Angeles, California), U.S. attorney general and adviser during the administration of his brother Pres. John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363) and later a U.S. senator (1965\u201368). He was son of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He was assassinated while campaigning for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nRobert interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II but returned to the university and graduated in 1948. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1951, he began his political career in Massachusetts the next year with the management of his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert first came into national prominence in 1953, when he was an assistant counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Joseph R. McCarthy (he resigned in mid-1953 but returned in 1954 as counsel to the Democratic minority). In 1957 he was chief counsel to the Senate select committee conducting investigations into labour racketeering, which led to his long-standing feud with James R. Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Kennedy resigned from the committee staff in 1960 to conduct his brother\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency. After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York. Within two years Kennedy had established himself as a major political figure in his own right. He became the chief spokesman for liberal Democrats and a critic of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the presidency. By June 4 he had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles\u2019 Ambassador Hotel. As he left through a kitchen hallway, he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Kennedy was buried near his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Immediately after he announced to his cheering supporters that the country was ready to end its fractious divisions, Kennedy was shot several times by 24-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan. He was pronounced dead a day later, on June 6, 1968.\n\nThe summer of 1968 was a tempestuous time in American history. Both the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement were peaking. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated in the spring, igniting riots across the country. In the face of this unrest, President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to seek a second term in the upcoming presidential election. Robert Kennedy, John\u2019s younger brother and former U.S. Attorney General, stepped into this breach and experienced a groundswell of support.\n\nKennedy was perceived by many to be the only person in American politics capable of uniting the people. He was beloved by the minority community for his integrity and devotion to the civil rights cause. After winning California\u2019s primary, Kennedy was in the position to receive the Democratic nomination and face off against Richard Nixon in the general election.\n\nAs star athletes Rafer Johnson and Roosevelt Grier accompanied Kennedy out a rear exit of the Ambassador Hotel, Sirhan Sirhan stepped forward with a rolled up campaign poster, hiding his .22 revolver. He was only a foot away when he fired several shots at Kennedy. Grier and Johnson wrestled Sirhan to the ground, but not before five bystanders were wounded. Grier was distraught afterward and blamed himself for allowing Kennedy to be shot.\n\nSirhan, who was born in Palestine, confessed to the crime at his trial and received a death sentence on March 3, 1969. However, since the California State Supreme Court invalidated all death penalty sentences in 1972, Sirhan has spent the rest of his life in prison. According to the New York Times, he has since said that he believed Kennedy was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the oppression of Palestinians.

A graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia School of Law, Kennedy was appointed attorney general after his brother John Kennedy was elected president in 1960. In this role, Robert Kennedy fought organized crime and worked for civil rights for African Americans. In the Senate, he was a committed advocate of the poor and racial minorities, and opposed escalation of the Vietnam War. On June 5, 1968, while in Los Angeles campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Kennedy was shot. He died early the next day at age 42.\n\nRobert Kennedy: Early Years\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts, the seventh of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a wealthy financier, and Rose Kennedy, the daughter of a Boston politician.\n\nKennedy spent his childhood between his family\u2019s homes in New York; Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; Palm Beach, Florida; and London, where his father served as the American ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1940.\n\nDid you know? In 1965, Robert Kennedy was part of a group that was the first to ascend Mount Kennedy, which at the time was the highest unclimbed peak in North America. The 14,000-foot peak, named for John Kennedy, is located in Yukon, Canada.\n\nDuring World War II, Kennedy served in the U.S. Navy. In 1946 he was an apprentice seaman on the shakedown cruise of a naval destroyer named for his eldest brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr., a Navy pilot killed during the war.\n\nAfter completing his military service, in 1948 Kennedy graduated from Harvard University, the alma mater of his father and older brothers. He went on to attend law school at the University of Virginia, earning his degree in 1951.\n\nThat same year, Kennedy began working as a lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice. In 1952 he managed his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. The following year, Kennedy worked as an assistant counsel for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by anticommunist crusader Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin.\n\nIn the late 1950s, as chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, Kennedy gained national attention for investigating corruption in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a powerful trade union led by Jimmy Hoffa. Kennedy left the committee in 1959 to manage his brother John\u2019s successful presidential campaign.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Children\n\nOn June 17, 1950, Robert Kennedy married Ethel Skakel of Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children: Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, who was born six months after her father\u2019s death. The family lived at an estate called Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia.\n\nKennedy\u2019s oldest son, Joseph, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999, while his daughter Kathleen was lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003.\n\nRobert Kennedy as U.S. Attorney General\n\nAfter John F. Kennedy was elected president in November 1960, he named his brother Robert Kennedy as America\u2019s 64th attorney general. In this role, Kennedy continued to battle corruption in labor unions, as well as mobsters and organized crime. In 1964, Jimmy Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering and fraud.\n\nAs attorney general, Kennedy also supported the civil rights movement for African Americans. In the fall of 1962, he sent thousands of federal troops to Oxford, Mississippi, to enforce a U.S. Supreme Court order admitting the first black student, James Meredith, to the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe state\u2019s segregationist governor, Ross Barnett, had attempted to bar Meredith, whose enrollment prompted riots and violence at the school.\n\nAdditionally, Kennedy worked with his brother, as well as his successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, on the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting, employment and public facilities.\n\nKennedy also acted as one of his brother\u2019s closest political advisors in the White House and was involved in important foreign policy decisions, including the administration\u2019s handling of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. He later wrote a book about the crisis, titled Thirteen Days, which was published posthumously in 1969.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy\n\nOn November 22, 1963, 46-year-old President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Robert Kennedy stayed on as attorney general under President Johnson until September 1964, when he resigned to embark on a campaign to represent New York in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDespite charges from some that he was a carpetbagger with little connection to the Empire State, Kennedy won the election and took office in January 1965.\n\nAs senator, Kennedy championed civil rights and social justice issues. He traveled to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, migrant workers\u2019 camps and urban ghettos to study the effects of poverty, and made trips abroad to such places as apartheid-ruled South Africa to advocate for the advancement of human rights.\n\nKennedy was also an outspoken critic of President Johnson\u2019s plans to escalate U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Presidential Bid\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy was urged by his supporters to run for president as an antiwar and socially progressive Democrat.\n\nHesitant until he saw positive primary returns for fellow antiwar candidate Eugene McCarthy, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on March 16, 1968, declaring, \u201cI do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I\u2019m obliged to do all I can.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, 1968, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey became the key Democratic party hopeful, with McCarthy and Kennedy trailing closely behind. Kennedy conducted an energetic campaign and on June 4, 1968, won a major victory in the California primary.\n\nRobert Kennedy\u2019s Assassination\n\nIn the early hours of June 5, 1968, shortly after delivering a speech to celebrate his win in the California primary, Kennedy was shot in a kitchen corridor outside the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He died the next day at age 42.\n\nThe following year, Sirhan Sirhan, an immigrant from Palestine, was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder and sentenced to death. However, in 1972, after the California Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he remains today.\n\nOn June 8, at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City, Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kennedy, U.S. senator from Massachusetts and the youngest Kennedy sibling, delivered a now-famous eulogy for his brother, remembering him as \u201ca good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\u201d\n\nAfter the funeral, Kennedy\u2019s coffin was taken by train from New York to Washington, D.C., with hundreds of thousands of mourners lining the tracks along the route. The train arrived in the nation\u2019s capital that night, and a motorcade transported Kennedy\u2019s body to Arlington National Cemetery for a rare nighttime burial."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-F-Kennedy", "page_content": "Robert F.

John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363) and later a U.S. senator (1965\u201368). He was son of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He was assassinated while campaigning for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nRobert interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II but returned to the university and graduated in 1948. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1951, he began his political career in Massachusetts the next year with the management of his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert first came into national prominence in 1953, when he was an assistant counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Joseph R. McCarthy (he resigned in mid-1953 but returned in 1954 as counsel to the Democratic minority). In 1957 he was chief counsel to the Senate select committee conducting investigations into labour racketeering, which led to his long-standing feud with James R. Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Kennedy resigned from the committee staff in 1960 to conduct his brother\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency. After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York. Within two years Kennedy had established himself as a major political figure in his own right. He became the chief spokesman for liberal Democrats and a critic of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the presidency. By June 4 he had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles\u2019 Ambassador Hotel. As he left through a kitchen hallway, he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

Kennedy Jr. announces he's running for president\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy has long been the face of the anti-vaccine movement that draws support from the right.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nA familiar name has entered the 2024 presidential race to challenge President Biden for the Democratic nomination - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He made his formal announcement earlier today in Boston.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROBERT F KENNEDY JR: My mission over the next 18 months of this campaign and over my - throughout my presidency, will be to end the corrupt merger of state and corporate power...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKENNEDY: ...That is threatening now...\n\nCHANG: Now, Kennedy isn't just a member of one of America's most famous political dynasties. He's also an anti-vaccine activist, who's been criticized by his own family. NPR's Shannon Bond joins us now to explain more. Hey, Shannon.\n\nSHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.\n\nCHANG: So, OK. A lot of people, of course, know the Kennedy name, but can you remind us who exactly is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?\n\nBOND: Sure. He's the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of Bobby Kennedy. And Robert Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer, who is originally probably best known as an environmental activist. But as you said, he's not only become a central figure in the anti-vaccination movement, but he's also promoted other conspiracy theories, like the baseless idea that 5G telecom networks are being used to control people's behavior.\n\nCHANG: Wow. OK. How did Kennedy wind up as a leader in the anti-vax movement, though?\n\nBOND: Well, he said he is not opposed to vaccines. He frames his criticisms as being about safety. You know, and in his speech today, he didn't address vaccines directly, but he did raise concerns about chronic illnesses, autism, quote, \"poisoning our children.\" And these are all references to these debunked and false and misleading claims that he has promoted for years that undermine trust in vaccines.\n\nDuring - most recently, during the COVID pandemic, he opposed vaccine mandates and other public health measures. He promoted unproven treatments such as ivermectin. You know, and that did result in some of his social media accounts being taken down for spreading false health claims. He says that's censorship. But the pandemic also did a lot to raise his profile. And so we're in this sort of strange place now where Kennedy is this figure with this iconic Democratic name, but he's also now being embraced by many on the political right who have adopt anti-vax views.\n\nCHANG: Right. But he is running as a Democrat. Let me ask you - President Biden's approval rating with Democrats, I mean, it's pretty strong right now. Polls find that Democrats are also more willing to get vaccinated than are Republicans. So what is the rationale for Kennedy here because (laughter) this sounds kind of like a long shot, right?\n\nBOND: Yeah. And, you know, for a long time, Ailsa, vaccine opponents weren't particularly aligned with one political party. Here's how Annette Meeks, who's a lifelong Republican who runs the Freedom Foundation of Minnesota, a conservative think tank - here's how she put it.\n\nANNETTE MEEKS: In the early days, it really is kind of where the crunchy-granola left meets the far right.\n\nBOND: But that started to change even before COVID. You saw vaccine opponents begin to rally under the banner of what they called liberty or freedom. That seems to have really resonated with conservatives. And then when COVID came along, resistance of vaccines became linked with resistance to other things, like closing schools, wearing masks. Everything was filtered through this partisan divide. And, in fact, Kennedy does have some surprising sources of support. Donald Trump's former adviser, election-denier Steve Bannon, has publicly suggested Kennedy should enter the Republican primary, and the conspiracy theorist and Trump ally, Roger Stone, has his own suggestion that Trump should pick Kennedy as his running mate.\n\nCHANG: Huh.

Kennedy took part in a discussion on Twitter Spaces Monday, promoting his campaign as he challenges President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination for 2024.\n\nKennedy appeared on Twitter after Instagram temporarily blocked his campaign account due to his anti-vaxx comments. Twitter owner Elon Musk invited Kennedy to appear on his platform in response.\n\nKennedy is considered a long-shot for the nomination. While he is the son of monumental Democratic figure Bobby Kennedy, his views also set him at odds with many in his party.\n\nKennedy also held a town hall on Sirius Radio, where he tried to distance himself from Biden\u2019s policies, including when it comes to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBiden has surrounded himself with neo-cons who, for people who don\u2019t know, are a group of people that emerged in the late 90s and early 2000s, really around 1997, who, who believed that the collapse of the Soviet Union meant that the United States had earned the ability to rule the world,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI think we had a significant role in provoking the Russians to invade Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a position most mainstream politicians would disagree with, regardless of party. Aside from Ukraine, Kennedy\u2019s town hall was light on policy and heavier on his personal story.\n\nKennedy is not a typical Democrat. On the one hand, he is for addressing climate change, but also a big supporter of the second amendment. Kennedy has argued against gun restrictions, while many Democrats have supported gun control laws.\n\nKennedy\u2019s biggest focus is, he said, the government\u2019s lack of honesty. He said the public can\u2019t trust government agencies, and has said big tech and corporations are working with the government to monopolize the economy and censor the public.\n\nStill, the Kennedy name holds some weight in Democratic politics, even though the family has sort of disavowed him because of his views. He\u2019s also running at at time when many Democrats are expressing concerns about Biden\u2019s age.\n\nSo far, Kennedy is polling better than many would assume, coming in at 16% or 17% compared to Biden\u2019s 60%. Still, he has liabilities with voters including his vocal opposition to vaccines. Kennedy has pushed false theories linking vaccinations to autism, which have been disproven by science.\n\nKennedy also brought up the issue of debates, saying he would like to debate the president, but thinks that a debate would be a disadvantage for Biden."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/01/robert-kennedy-jr-president-candidate-conspiracy", "page_content": "Robert F Kennedy Jr, the conspiracy theorist and vaccine skeptic challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, told an interviewer he had \u201cconversations with dead people\u201d every day.\n\nKennedy\u2019s uncle, John F Kennedy, the 35th US president, was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. His father, Robert F Kennedy, the US attorney general and New York senator, was killed in Los Angeles five years later.\n\nIn an interview with the Free Press, Kennedy was asked how he thought his father and uncle would tackle challenges facing America today.\n\n\u201cI do meditations every day,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the nature of my meditations. I have a lot of conversations with dead people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a follow-up text,\u201d the Free Press said, Kennedy clarified: \u201cThey are one-way prayers for strength and wisdom. I get no strategic advice from the dead.\u201d\n\nThe Free Press said its interviewer was greeted at Kennedy\u2019s Los Angeles home by a guard \u201cwith an earpiece and a nondisclosure agreement\u201d. After the interviewer refused to sign the document, Kennedy \u201ccame out, shrugged, and led me inside\u201d.\n\nDescribing Kennedy\u2019s gilded but tragic family story, the Free Press noted that he thinks his father was probably killed by the CIA, and his uncle definitely.\n\nThe site also detailed Kennedy\u2019s transformation from environmental campaigner to vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist, a process accelerated by the Covid pandemic.\n\nKennedy\u2019s sister, the human rights campaigner Kerry Kennedy, has said: \u201cI love Bobby. I think he\u2019s just completely wrong on [Covid vaccines] and very dangerous.\u201d\n\nLast year, Kennedy went so far as to compare the US under lockdown to Germany under the Nazis, telling a rally in Washington: \u201cEven in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.\u201d\n\nThose remarks earned a rebuke from the Auschwitz Memorial, which accused Kennedy of \u201cexploiting the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured and murdered \u2026 including children like Anne Frank\u201d.\n\nKennedy apologised. His wife, Cheryl Hines, publicly disowned his remarks but now supports his White House run.\n\nKennedy, 69, is one of two quixotic Democratic challengers to Biden, 80, who is widely expected to be nominated to seek a second White House term.\n\nThe other, the self-help author Marianne Williamson, 70, has been hit by claims of bullying and reports of campaign resignations.\n\nKennedy told the Free Press he was running in part to reclaim a party he said had become \u201ca war party \u2026 the party of the neocons. It\u2019s become the party of Wall Street and the party of censorship, which, I think [is] antithetical to liberal values\u201d.\n\nSaying \u201cI\u2019ve always liked Joe Biden\u201d, he said the president was \u201ca function of a system that a growing majority of Americans don\u2019t trust\u201d.\n\nOf his populist positioning, Kennedy said: \u201cThere are people who are angry, and they deserve to be angry, and either Trump is going to sign them up, Donald Trump, for a ride into the darkness, or we can try to capture that energy and turn it into something positive for our country, something that is reflective of the highest ideals of the American experience.\u201d\n\nQuoting a great Democratic president, Franklin D Roosevelt, Kennedy added: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the party that tells people that the only thing to fear is fear itself.\u201d\n\nIn a recent CNN poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, Kennedy received 20% support."}, {"url": "https://laist.com/news/politics/robert-kennedy-was-killed-55-years-ago-how-should-he-be-remembered", "page_content": "Right now, we need your help during our short June member drive to keep the local news you read here every day going.

Kennedy (1925-1968) (D-NY), meets enthusiastic crowds in Seattle as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Speaking to more than 10,000 people at the University of Washington, and referring to the Vietnam War and the protests to it at home, Kennedy pledges \"We can do better. There are no easy solutions to the strife at home to our course in Vietnam, but there are ways we can do better.\"\n\nA Country Divided by the War in Vietnam\n\nSenator Kennedy began his campaign ten days earlier when, on March 16, 1968, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president. In doing so he explicitly withdrew support from the incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973), principally over the issue of U.S. policy in Vietnam.\n\nSenator Kennedy arrived at Sea-Tac Airport from Portland and he drove to the Hec Edmundson Pavilion. There he was met by an enthusiastic crowd sprinkled with supporters of Senator Eugene McCarthy. Senator McCarthy was also running for the Democratic nomination, and his campaign also focussed on U. S. involvement in Vietnam.\n\nSenator Kennedy received his loudest ovation when he said, \"I think I can negotiate an honorable peace in Vietnam.\" The response from the college crowd was much less enthusiastic when he spoke of correcting \"the inequities of the present draft system.\" The draft exempted matriculated college students. Men between the ages of 18 to 26 who were not enrolled in college were in the pool of draft-eligible men who were then drafted into the Army by lottery.\n\nSenator Kennedy drove to his campaign headquarters at 522 Union Street in downtown Seattle and there spoke to a crowd on a bullhorn. He was \"mobbed by teeny-boppers\" on his way to the Olympic Hotel, where he spoke to 800 people in the Georgia Room, including his sisters Patricia Lawford (b. 1924) and Jean Smith (b. 1928).\n\nThe visit was characterized by its informality. Seattle businessman Jim Whittaker (the first American to climb Mount Everest) served as the Washington State Chairman of the Kennedy campaign. After Seattle, the campaign moved to Idaho.\n\nOn March 31, 1968, President Johnson announced to the nation that he would not seek nor would he accept his party's nomination for president. On June 4, 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy was shot by an assassin in Los Angeles after winning the California primary election.

Kennedy who was elected in 1960 and served as President until his assassination in 1963. Kennedy\u2019s father Robert F. Kennedy was campaigning for president against incumbent Lyndon Johnson when he was assassinated in 1968.\n\nRichard Nixon ended up being the president-elect. Ted Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s uncle and a popular U.S. Senator who represented Massachusetts for 47 years until his death in 2009, made an unsuccessful bid for the Presidency, with sights set on unseating Jimmy Carter.\n\nAll three brothers grew up in a small house in Brookline, Massachusetts, which today is a registered landmark and known as the birthplace of John F. Kennedy.\n\nOutside of vaccines, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is every bit a Democrat, with staunch support of LGBT causes and abbortion.\n\nKennedy, named one of New York Times \u201cHeroes of the Planet,\u201d is also highly celebrated among climate change theorists, environmentalists, as well as human rights advocates for his efforts against carbon emissions, negotiating better homeland treaties for indigenous Americans, and protecting threatened watersheds.\n\nDisgruntled Biden Voters\n\nThe prospect of another Kennedy in The White House drew an diverse crowd to the historic Park Plaza Hotel in Boston.\n\nAmong was them Linda Brierdy, who traveled from Connecticut. The Catholic Democrat told The Epoch Times she has been disappointed \u201csince day one\u201d after voting for current President Joe Biden. She hopes Kennedy will win the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cThis is about courage, this is about alliance, and this is about leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cKennedy represents all three of those.\u201d\n\nBrierdy also likes that Kennedy vaccine mandates, saying while she is not opposed to vaccines, she favors informed consent and people\u2019s right to make their own medical decision.\n\nWhile he wishes Kennedy would run as an independent, Rhode Islander Elliot Minor, said he already has his vote. Like Brierdy, Minor told The Epoch Times he likes Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccine safety. He also feels like Kennedy would be the first president \u201cto actually drain the swamp.\u201dLike Brierdy, he voted for Biden, but has no plans to do so again.\n\nCharles Small, who flew in from Richmond, Virginia, was already wearing a Kennedy 2024 campaign pin. He is also switching his support from Biden to Kennedy. He said Kennedy had him hooked when he read on his campaign website that he was going after government corruption, especially the abuse of its regulatory powers.\n\nNina Moliver, a local from nearby Jamaica Plain and two time Biden voter, said Kennedy\u2019s fight for vaccine mandates is the primary reason she is supporting him. \u201cForced vaccines crosses a boundary for me,\u201d she said.\u201d She also added that \u201cthis is about the whole cartel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested anymore in the pseudo-left identity politics,\u201d she said. \u201cRobert is a true progressive.\u201d\n\nBostonians React\n\nOutside of Park Plaza though the reaction to Kennedy\u2019s bid for the Presidency was far more mixed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be better than sleepy Joe,\u201d a local Bostonian who asked not to be identified because he is a government employee, told The Epoch Times.\n\nBut Washington state resident Brian Walsh who was dining with his family just a few booths away from the fabled \u201cKennedy booth\u201d at the local Union Oyster House, told The Epoch Times, that Kennedy\u2019s vaccine stance alone, makes him oppose Kennedy and that he would like to see Joe Biden re-elected.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t vote for someone who promotes all that misinformation about vaccines,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nNina Moliver, a local from nearby Jamaica Plain and two time Biden voter, said Kennedy\u2019s fight against vaccines is the primary reason she is supporting him. \u201cForced vaccines crosses a boundary for me,\u201d she said.\u201d She also added that \u201cthis is about the whole cartel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested anymore in the pseudo-left identity politics,\u201d she said, \u201d Robert is a true progressive.\u201d\n\nJust a few blocks away a group of Suffolk University students who talked about \u201cmy body my choice\u201d when it came to abortion, told The Epoch Times that even though Kennedy was aligned with them on that, they also would not support him because of his position on vaccines.\n\nOne of the students, Maxwell Wright, a political science major who is graduating from Suffolk in just a few months, called Kennedy part of a \u201cdraconian emblematic dynasty that needs to go.\u201d\n\nSuffolk University professor Donna Giancola, a lifelong Bostonian, who was out with her students and shared their liberal views, said she is \u201copen to voting for Kennedy\u201d and told The Epoch Times she thought it was good \u201ca Kennedy was running.\n\nFrom The Epoch Times"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/crime/sirhan-sirhan", "page_content": "(1944-)\n\nSynopsis\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, on March 19, 1944. Sirhan moved to the United States at the age of 12, graduating from college in California. He later objected to Senator Robert Kennedy's support for Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. On June 5, 1968, Sirhan shot and killed Kennedy during a presidential primaries appearance, and was convicted of the crime the following year. Sirhan initially received the death penalty. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after a change in state law.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born on March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem. He was raised as a Palestinian Christian and was also born with Jordanian citizenship. Sirhan moved to the United States at the age of 12\u2014living first in New York and then in California, where he eventually attended Pasadena City College.\n\nA fervent Christian, Sirhan explored several denominations as an adult. He identified as a Baptist and Seventh Day Adventist before joining the occult Rosicrucians. He also worked at the stables for a race track in Arcadia.\n\nMurder of Robert Kennedy\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Sirhan shot and killed Senator Robert Kennedy, who was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president and had just won the California primary. Kennedy was the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, who'd been assassinated in 1963. Robert Kennedy had served as attorney general in his brother\u2019s cabinet and was the Democratic front-runner at the time of his death. Sirhan shot Kennedy four times, leading to his death 26 hours later. Several other victims sustained gunshot wounds from which they recovered.\n\nAs corroborated by an Inside Edition TV interview decades later, Sirhan greatly resented Kennedy\u2019s support of the Six-Day War intervention in Israel the previous year. The prosecuting attorneys in the subsequent trial had also pieced together these motives based on Sirhan\u2019s personal journals, seized from his home, and from his taped confession.\n\nTrial and Parole Requests\n\nSirhan was captured and disarmed at the scene of the crime. He confessed the murder to police a few days later, but then pleaded not guilty. Sirhan was tried at length, and a judge rejected his request to change his plea to guilty after papers were found in his home with highly implicating language. The defendant behaved strangely throughout the trial, potentially bolstering counsel\u2019s argument of diminished capacity at the time of the murder. The argument was not enough to sway the jury: Sirhan was convicted of premeditated murder on April 17, 1969, and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment three years later due to the California Supreme Court ruling in People v. Anderson, outlawing the death penalty in the state.\n\nOngoing requests for parole have been denied. (As of 2011, there have been 14 parole requests.) Sirhan\u2019s counsel has argued that their client has no memory of the murder due to brainwashing by the Rosicrucians or a political organization. There has also been talk of a second gunman, with a witness at the scene, Nina Rhodes-Hughes, stating there was an additional shooter. Having made previous statements that he acted alone and was under the influence of alcohol, Sirhan has also expressed remorse over his actions and claimed to have no memory of confessing to the murder of Robert Kennedy, either in police custody or during his trial.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Sirhan Bishara Sirhan\n\nBirth Year: 1944\n\nBirth date: March 19, 1944\n\nBirth City: Jerusalem\n\nBirth Country: Mandatory Palestine\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Sirhan Sirhan murdered Robert F.

Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, denied his parole in 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/27/sirhan-sirhan-bobby-kennedy-assassination-parole", "page_content": "The man who killed Robert F Kennedy was granted parole on Friday after two of the former attorney general, senator and presidential hopeful\u2019s sons spoke in favor of release and prosecutors declined to argue he should be kept behind bars.\n\nThe decision was a major victory for Sirhan Sirhan, 77, though it did not assure his release.\n\nThe ruling by the two-person panel at Sirhan\u2019s 16th parole hearing will be reviewed over 90 days by the California parole board.

Berry accused him of politicizing the parole process and putting his \u201cpolitical goals and agenda above that of the constitution\u201d.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is unclear how quickly a judge might rule on Berry\u2019s petition, and either side could appeal an adverse decision, but Sirhan is set for a new parole hearing on 1 March.\n\nSirhan originally was sentenced to death, but that sentence was commuted to life when the California supreme court briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972.\n\n\u201cTo have an immaculate record of almost five decades is the exception, not the rule.

Kennedy was recommended for parole in California.\n\nSirhan Sirhan \u2014 who was 24 when he shot and killed the senator at a Los Angeles hotel in 1968 \u2014 was deemed suitable for release by a two-person parole panel Friday afternoon, the first step toward making him a free man. The panel reached its decision, in part, after two of Kennedy\u2019s children expressed support for Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\nSirhan, a Palestinian immigrant who had written a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death, had said he was drunk and doesn\u2019t remember opening fire at the since-demolished Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nKennedy was considered a leading candidate for president and had just won primaries in South Dakota and California at the time of his death. He was murdered nearly five years after his brother, President John F. Kennedy, was shot and killed in Dallas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan, now 77, admitted to the killing in 1969 and has been in prison for 53 years. He originally faced the death penalty but his sentence was commuted to life after the state briefly outlawed capital punishment in the 1970s.\n\nThe two-person panel Sirhan appeared before Friday granted parole, but the decision is not final. Parole staff still have 90 days to review the matter. After that, Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 or whoever might replace him following next month\u2019s recall election \u2014 could still decide to block Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\nSirhan expressed deep remorse for the slaying Friday, and said he had given up alcohol and recommitted his life to peace during the decades he has spent housed in a San Diego prison.\n\n\u201cSen. Kennedy was the hope of the world and I injured, and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still responsible for being there and probably causing this whole incident, through my own gun or other guns.\u201d\n\nTwo of Kennedy\u2019s children submitted letters on Sirhan\u2019s behalf. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who has previously expressed doubt about Sirhan\u2019s guilt and echoed others\u2019 claims that a second gunman actually killed the senator \u2014 said he believed his father might extend mercy to Sirhan.\n\n\u201cWhile nobody can speak definitively on behalf of my father, I firmly believe that based on his own consuming commitment to fairness and justice, that he would strongly encourage this board to release Mr. Sirhan because of Sirhan\u2019s impressive record of rehabilitation,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote in a letter submitted in advance of Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nIn an interview with The Times late Friday, Kennedy Jr. said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d Sirhan had been recommended for release and reiterated concerns that the wrong man was convicted.\n\nKennedy, who was a teen at the time of the murder, pointed to an autopsy report indicating the senator had been shot from behind when Sirhan had been standing in front of Kennedy. Some have argued that this would have made it impossible for Kennedy to have been shot in the back by Sirhan, while others have said that Kennedy turned after the first shot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that the justice system showed some humanity,\u201d said Kennedy Jr., who has sometimes garnered criticism for indulging in conspiracy theories surrounding both his father\u2019s killing and the use of vaccines. \u201cI think that my father, who was the top administrator of justice in this country as attorney general and he fought to assure the justice system was humane. \u2026 He would be very happy with this result.\u201d\n\nPaul Schrade, a former Kennedy aide who was one of several bystanders wounded in the shooting, also said Friday that he believed Sirhan was innocent.\n\n\u201cI sympathize very clearly about the way that Sirhan\u2019s been treated,\u201d said Schrade, 96, from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cThis was his 16th parole board hearing, when the guy is not guilty.\u201d\n\nSchrade said that he hopes the granting of parole will push police to reopen their investigation of Kennedy\u2019s death.\n\nDouglas Kennedy also said that while he\u2019d lived in fear of Sirhan for years, he saw him now as \u201cworthy of compassion and love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really do believe any prisoner who is found to be not a threat to themselves or the world should be released,\u201d Douglas Kennedy wrote. \u201cI believe that applies to everyone, every human being, including Mr. Sirhan.\u201d\n\nOther family members, however, were not in support of the parole recommendation.\n\nIn a joint statement late Friday, six of Kennedy\u2019s surviving children \u2014 Joseph P. Kennedy II, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Christopher G. Kennedy, Maxwell T. Kennedy and Rory Kennedy \u2014 said they were devastated that the man who murdered their father received the recommendation.\n\n\u201cOur father\u2019s death is a very difficult matter for us to discuss publicly and for the past many decades we have declined to engage directly in the parole process,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe six Kennedy siblings said they adamantly opposed Sirhan\u2019s parole and release, and were \u201cshocked by a ruling\u201d they believe ignores standards for paroling \u201ca confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nThe siblings said that the parole board\u2019s decision \u201chas inflicted enormous additional pain,\u201d and that they were in disbelief that Sirhan would be recommended for release.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Parole Board staff, the full board and ultimately ... Newsom, to reverse this initial recommendation,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cIt is a recommendation we intend to challenge every step of the way, and we hope that those who also hold the memory of our father in their hearts will stand with us.\u201d\n\nAngela Berry, Sirhan\u2019s attorney, said the 77-year-old has not been accused of a serious violation of prison rules since 1972 and that prison officials have deemed him a low risk for violence. Sirhan first became eligible for parole in 1972. Between 1983 and 2006, he appeared before the parole board every one to two years, but was always denied. Beginning in 2006, those hearings were held just twice a decade. He was last denied release in 2016.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department, other relatives and several members of the public submitted letters opposing Sirhan\u2019s release, according to Parole Board Commissioner Robert Barton.\n\nSirhan\u2019s fate could now lie with Newsom, who has long idolized Kennedy and has a fondness for quoting the slain senator. Months after taking office, Newsom lined the hallways of the governor\u2019s office with more than 50 photographs of mourners who lined the railways to see Kennedy\u2019s funeral train as it carried his body from New York to Washington, D.C. more than a half century ago.\n\nErin Mellon, a spokeswoman for Newsom, said the governor will review Sirhan\u2019s case if it is presented to him.\n\nNewsom has not hesitated to reject the recommendations of parole boards in the past. In November, Newsom blocked the release of Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten. He did the same just last month for Royce Casey, one of three men who brutally murdered a 15-year-old boy in Nipomo more than two decades ago.\n\nStill, earlier this month Newsom faced harsh criticism for not blocking the release of David Weidert, who served four decades in prison for killing a developmentally disabled Clovis man whom he buried alive.\n\nWhile Sirhan\u2019s case would not reach the governor\u2019s desk until after the Sept. 14 recall election, the decision could still impact Newsom politically if he remains in power beyond next month. Rising crime has become a central issue of the effort to oust him from office and would likely remain so if Newsom seeks a second term in 2022.\n\nThe recommendation for Sirhan\u2019s release also came without opposition from L.A. County prosecutors, who are barred from fighting release at parole hearings under a policy enacted by reform-minded Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n.\n\nWhile Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s policy had been in effect for nearly nine months, it attracted new scrutiny this week because of Sirhan\u2019s case. Gasc\u00f3n has said it should be up to the parole board to determine an inmate\u2019s suitability for release, rather than prosecutors who are simply relitigating the facts of old cases, sometimes decades later.\n\n\u201cThe role of a prosecutor and their access to information ends at sentencing. The parole board, however, has all the pertinent facts and evaluations at their disposal, including how someone has conducted themselves over the last few decades in prison,\u201d Alex Bastian, a special adviser to Gasc\u00f3n, said in a statement.\n\nCritics of Gasc\u00f3n have said the parole policy is indicative of a broader abandonment of victims under his administration and some victims have complained that they felt helpless without an advocate present when they went to oppose the release of a loved one\u2019s killer earlier this year.\n\nAs news of the parole board\u2019s decision broke late Friday, some rushed to attack Gasc\u00f3n. The California District Attorneys Assn. released a statement bashing Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s policy as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLetting a victim or a victim\u2019s family member be at a parole hearing by themselves is just plain cruel. Gasc\u00f3n is completely abandoning his job,\u201d added L.A. County Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Hatami, a leading figure in the effort to recall Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cWe all know the parole board doesn\u2019t always get it right \u2014 it\u2019s not even close.\u201d\n\nBut during the hearing, Barton said the presence of a prosecutor would have had no impact on the board\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cObviously they opposed in the past and even if they had opposed it today our decision would be the same,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nWhile critics of Gasc\u00f3n have claimed the parole policy will end with a flood of violent criminals returning to the streets, statistics suggest otherwise. Records show the state parole board granted release in only about 19% of all cases it heard from 2018 to 2020, and that does not factor in cases where Newsom later blocked an inmate\u2019s release.\n\nTimes staff writers Anita Chabria and Gregory Yee contributed to this report, as did the Associated Press."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-08-30/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-essential-california", "page_content": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It\u2019s Monday, August 30. I\u2019m Justin Ray.\n\nOn Friday, the world learned that the man who gunned down Sen. Robert F. Kennedy might get released, sparking uproar and confusion.\n\nThe news was surprising to me for three reasons: (1) There was a lot of evidence he did the crime. Back in 1968, a 24-year-old Sirhan Sirhan was captured at the scene with a .22-caliber handgun in his hand. Three weeks before the shooting, he wrote a manifesto calling for Kennedy\u2019s death. (2) He had also previously been denied parole 15 times. (3) And I\u2019ll even say it: The victim wasn\u2019t just some person on the street; he assassinated a Kennedy. It felt like in terms of uphill battles, this was Mt. Everest covered in oil.\n\nYet here we are, with Sirhan, now 77, recommended for parole after serving more than 50 years in prison . It doesn\u2019t guarantee he will be released, but it is a big step in his quest for freedom. The Times has reported on how the case has split the Kennedy family , a curious detail in an autopsy report about the position of the gunshot wound that has fueled conspiracy theories, and background on Sirhan\u2019s legal battle for freedom . But we haven\u2019t talked about Sirhan\u2019s life.\n\nIn my quest to understand Sirhan, I have read magazine articles, a book by investigative journalist Dan E. Moldea , and listened to a podcast series. Here is a condensed overview of his early years, including an incident that appears to have changed his personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem, Palestine. As a child, it\u2019s likely he witnessed violence from the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. \u201cThere was probably a tremendous amount of trauma when Sirhan was small. There were villages being wiped out,\u201d Moldea\u2019s book quotes Sergeant Mike Nielsen as saying.\n\nIn 1956, the Sirhan family applied and qualified for U.S. visas as Palestinian refugees. They eventually moved to Pasadena. His father \u2014 described as a \u201cstrict disciplinarian, who beat young Sirhan\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t adapt to life in America and eventually abandoned his family. A high school teacher described Sirhan as having a \u201clanguage handicap,\u201d but said that he was \u201ccooperative [and] well-mannered.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating, he enrolled in Pasadena City College in fall of 1963, but he had poor attendance. The next year, he began coming home immediately after classes to care for his sister, Aida, who had leukemia. She died in March 1965 at the age of 29. Three months later, he dropped out of college.\n\nDuring the fall of 1965, Sirhan started working at Santa Anita racetrack. While there, he trained to be a jockey. The book says a foreman at the ranch told the LAPD, \u201cSirhan was a poor horse rider and was constantly being thrown or falling from horses that he was working.\u201d He quit in March 1966. Months later, he began working for Granja Vista del Rio Thoroughbred Horse Farm, near Corona. It was here that an incident would change his life.\n\nOn a foggy morning on Sept. 25, 1966, Sirhan fell from a mare named Hy-Vera, according to an article by Playboy . \u201cSirhan was thrown against a metal post, where he lay crumpled, crying and bleeding,\u201d wrote James McKinley. Sirhan later received a $2,000 settlement over the incident.\n\nThe accident had lasting health effects on Sirhan. In a podcast series created by the writers behind the popular HBO series \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s younger brother discussed how his personality changed: \u201cHe wanted to be by himself. It\u2019s kind of hard to put into words. He didn\u2019t want to be bothered. He was a little more irritable,\u201d Munir Sirhan said (On a side note, I\u2019ve noticed that many notorious killers experienced brain injuries during their childhoods, including California\u2019s Richard Ramirez and Glen Edward Rogers ).\n\nTwo years later, Sirhan would carry out the assassination, and RFK would become the third Kennedy son to die violently. Sirhan told The Times in 1985 : \u201cI originally had admired Sen. Kennedy. He was for the poor and downtrodden. He seemed to be for justice. But then he did things to support Israel, including backing the sending of 50 Phantom jets to Israel that I knew would be used to attack my people.

The son of a middle-class Christian Palestinian family uprooted by the violent offensive of Jewish militias from its native Jerusalem and forced to flee to the United States, at age 24 Sirhan found himself at the centre of major historical events.\n\nIn the early hours of June 5, 1968, he shot an Iver-Johnson .22 revolver at Senator Robert F Kennedy (RFK), minutes after he had given a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Despite contradictory evidence and witness accounts, Sirhan was summarily tried and sentenced for Kennedy\u2019s murder.\n\nSirhan\u2019s 50 years in prison are coloured by the failures of the US criminal justice system, in which racial disparities are apparent. A poor young unconnected Palestinian was easily convicted and accused of political fanaticism. Today, Sirhan would likely have been charged with \u201cterrorism\u201d.\n\nSirhan Sirhan has been denied parole 15 times. He was initially scheduled for release in 1984. Now 74 years old, this forever prisoner has served longer in jail than any Palestinian prisoner in Israel including Nael Barghouthi, who was imprisoned for 37 years, released and then re-imprisoned.\n\nWho is Sirhan Sirhan?\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born on March 19, 1944, in Jerusalem, the fifth son of Christian Orthodox parents. His father, Bishara, originally from the Palestinian village of Taybeh, worked for the British mandate government in Jerusalem\u2019s water department, and his mother, Mary Muzher, was from Bethlehem. Sirhan witnessed the 1947 bombing of Damascus Gate as a child, the death of his older brother, a man disembowelled by a bomb and other traumatic events.\n\nIn 1948, with Israel\u2019s seizure of mandate and Arab properties, Sirhan\u2019s father lost his job. The family had to move from the Musrara neighbourhood to what was then Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem, where they shared a single room with nine other families. They immigrated to the US when Sirhan was 12, but his father returned to Palestine after a family dispute.\n\nSirhan went to high school in California and then attended a community college for two years but dropped out and held various short-term manual jobs. He enjoyed attending horse races and was interested in becoming a jockey.\n\nHe worked as an exercise boy at the Granja Vista Del Rio ranch but quit after he fell from a horse. He and his immigrant family were motivated to keep away from serious trouble and were not connected to any radical organisations.\n\nSirhan was fascinated with the idea of mind control. He was not a gun person but acquired a gun from his brother in early 1968 \u201cfor target practice\u201d.\n\nWhat happened on June 5, 1968?\n\nHe acted strangely in the days just before the assassination. When questioned later, he stated that he drove downtown on June 4 because there was supposed to be an anniversary commemoration of the 1967 war, but he had the wrong date (the anniversary was to be commemorated on June 5).\n\nHe stopped at the Ambassador Hotel, where he quickly drank four Tom Collins cocktails. Kennedy, who had won the California presidential primaries, spoke in the main ballroom until after midnight, then was guided to exit through the kitchen and pantry area.\n\nKennedy was shaking busboy Juan Romero\u2019s hand when Sirhan, facing him, shot him. Five others were also hit and wounded.\n\nRFK had a small security detail. Congress did not authorise protection of presidential candidates until after his assassination. He wanted to be able to see and touch people, and he was reportedly averse to being spied on by the FBI.\n\nTwo of his guards, Roosevelt Grier, a football player and Rafer Johnson, an Olympic gold medalist, tackled Sirhan, and witnesses heard him say, \u201cI can explain. I did it for my country\u201d. Thane Eugene Cesar, a security guard, was standing behind RFK. There was also Bill Barry, an ex-FBI agent who had followed Kennedy into the kitchen pantry area, and two more guards.\n\nNumerous investigators and Sirhan\u2019s defence teams believe that a second shooter was involved. An audio recording made that night by a freelance reporter, Stanislaw Pruszynski, revealed the sounds of up to thirteen bullets according to analysts and that there was insufficient time between certain firings for one weapon to have been used.\n\nSirhan\u2019s Cadet model Iver-Johnson .22 revolver had only eight bullets. Three bullets hit Kennedy, two remaining in his body. A fourth bullet passed through his coat without injuring him. Five other people around him were also shot.\n\nIt has been suggested that there were three bullet holes in the ceiling and two bullets lodged in a doorframe, which the LAPD destroyed, along with the ceiling tiles.\n\nAccording to the medical examiner and coroner, Thomas Noguchi, the bullet that hit Kennedy behind his right ear was fired from a distance of one inch (2.54cm) to one and a half inches (3.81cm).\n\nYet, according to witnesses, Sirhan was no closer than 18 inches (46cm) to him. Some posited that he had turned his head at that moment and so Sirhan might have hit him. There have been suggestions that one of the security guards could have shot him.\n\nSirhan\u2019s attorneys William Pepper and Laurie Dusek maintain in a 2011 filing that led to another appeal for Sirhan, that the bullet hitting Kennedy\u2019s neck was not from Sirhan\u2019s gun and the bullet in evidence was switched for another.\n\nNot incidentally, William Pepper was the lawyer for James Earl Ray in the trial for the murder of Martin Luther King and argues that a conspiracy took place then.\n\nA \u2018lone wolf\u2019 or a conspiracy?\n\nSirhan claims to remember nothing beyond parking, going inside the hotel, being angry and drinking. A clipping was found in his pocket which quoted Kennedy: \u201cThe United States should without delay sell Israel the 50 Phantom jets she has so long been promised.\u201d\n\nMore damning, a notebook was found in his home that contained repetitive scribblings of \u201cRFK must die\u201d. His demeanour was, however, not of a drunk man. He appeared calm, but also not \u201cin complete control of his mind\u201d.\n\nTo Americans reading about the radical Palestinian political groups that emerged in the wake of Black September 1970, it seemed a no-brainer that an Arab would become an assassin.\n\nAs recently as May 24, 2018, an article in Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper tried to characterise Sirhan as the first \u201clone wolf\u201d killer. As someone who writes on \u201cterrorism\u201d, I\u2019ve learned that most \u201clone wolves\u201d are, in fact, not alone \u2013 they are assisted or instructed.\n\nSirhan\u2019s notebook also contained a sentence that Kennedy must die by June 5th. It was suggested this was because it was the anniversary of the 1967 war, although the Sirhan family\u2019s trauma and displacement were in 1948. He and his defence and psychological experts have argued this writing and the shooting were done under hypnosis.\n\nWhy might others have wanted to kill Robert F Kennedy? To prevent him from becoming president, or perhaps to end the war in Vietnam sooner.\n\nOthers held that RFK might have succeeded in uncovering who killed his brother, John. He reportedly never accepted the official version of the JFK assassination.\n\nIn any case, RFK\u2019s death was a huge loss for the liberals and the left in the US; he was charismatic, bore the Kennedy name and had been expected to win the presidency and carry on his brother John\u2019s legacy.\n\nDue to Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Hubert Humphrey ran for president and lost to Richard Nixon, which ended any hope of returning to the policies John F Kennedy had initiated.\n\nPolitical perceptions\n\nSirhan\u2019s testimony could not help him. Either he was politically motivated, or he was insane in the eyes of the public, except for those who began to believe that a conspiracy was at work. The idea of \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d was too novel a concept in 1968. Furthermore, many Americans didn\u2019t understand Sirhan\u2019s Palestinian identity, since many newspapers simply identified him as Jordanian. If they did know who the Palestinians were, they were unsympathetic.\n\nSirhan explained that he admired RFK but felt betrayed by his staunch support of Israel and intent to send it 50 bombers. His defence attorneys argued that he had been hypnotised and that due to his prior traumatic experiences, was not wholly responsible due to diminished capacity.\n\nThis defence was discounted. Some aspects of the evidence were never satisfactorily explained, and elements of the evidence were omitted or improperly recorded or destroyed when controlled by the Special Unit Senator, rather than the Los Angeles Police Department. Others were suspiciously lost or \u201cstolen\u201d.\n\nSirhan was sentenced to death in the gas chamber. However, the California Supreme Court ruled all capital cases to be a violation of California\u2019s Constitution and his sentence was commuted to life in prison.\n\nSirhan was housed in San Quentin Prison. His brother, Adel, and his mother, Mary, would travel to San Francisco to see him. There they stayed with a Palestinian friend who remembered Adel\u2019s assertions that Sirhan wasn\u2019t responsible for the assassination, even though he opened fire. Sirhan was later transferred to a correctional training facility in Soledad until 1992, and then to the state prison in Corcoran.\n\nOn March 1, 1973, while Sirhan was in San Quentin, armed members of the Black September group burst into the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Khartoum and took 10 hostages, including the US ambassador to Sudan, Cleo A Noel; Deputy Chief of Mission George Curtis Moore; Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Sheikh Abdullah al-Malhouk; his wife and children; and the Belgian and Jordanian charges d\u2019affaires to Sudan.\n\nFirst, the attackers demanded the release of some members of the Baader-Meinhoff group (a far-left West German organisation) and Sirhan Sirhan. Then they asked for the release of 90 Arabs being held by the Jordanian government, including Abu Daoud (said to have planned the 1972 Munich attacks).\n\nPresident Nixon refused to negotiate, and the gunmen killed their three Western hostages before they were captured by the Sudanese authorities. The US believed that Yasser Arafat was involved in directing this operation and that the Palestinian Liberation Organization gave the order to kill the three hostages.\n\nThis incident did nothing to help Sirhan with his legal efforts at a reversal, a new trial or parole. He also could not improve his chances by showing remorse for his crime, as he claimed not to remember it.\n\nCalls for a reinvestigation\n\nIn the early 2000s Sirhan\u2019s lawyer, Larry Teeter, argued that his first lawyer, Grant Cooper had been compromised by a conflict of interest and Sirhan won the right to a new trial.\n\nTeeter tried to have the venue for this new trial moved to Fresno, California but the motion was denied. Meanwhile, Sirhan\u2019s brother Adel, who had handled his affairs, died in the spring of 2001.\n\nA few months later, after the September 11 attacks, Sirhan was bizarrely accused of a connection to the suicide bombers because he had suddenly shaved his head and acquired a television just two days earlier.\n\nHis brother Munir explained to me that Sirhan was watching television during the attacks and had covered his head with a towel because he was cold. Apparently, the guards were suspicious of his mail, and that he was reading the Qur\u2019an.\n\nAlthough Christian, he was trying to retain his knowledge of the Arabic language. The warden placed special restrictions on him; he was questioned by the FBI and was unable to see visitors for an extended period.\n\nTeeter died in 2005, and Sirhan had no counsel for some years. In 2011, Sirhan\u2019s new defence team, Pepper and Dusek filed a motion for a new trial based on evidentiary claims.\n\nThese were supposed to include the testimony of Nina Rhodes-Hughes, a witness in the pantry, who said that despite her claim that there were two shooters, the authorities had altered her account of the events. Beside Rhodes-Hughes, four other witnesses heard more than eight shots, and the team highlighted other problematic details in evidence. However, the US District Court rejected their motion.\n\nSirhan had also shot Paul Schrade, a Kennedy confidant, the director of the United Auto Workers union, who recovered. At the age of 91, he testified at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing.\n\nHe has long believed there was a second shooter. He called for Sirhan\u2019s release and said \u201cthe evidence clearly shows that you [Sirhan Sirhan] were not the gunman who shot Robert Kennedy,\u201d but his testimony was disregarded by the parole commissioner.\n\nIn November 2013, Sirhan was moved to the Richard J Donovan prison in San Diego. Earlier last month, Robert F Kennedy, Jr visited him there and afterwards told the press that he supported the call for a reinvestigation of the assassination.\n\nSirhan\u2019s father, mother, and brothers, except for one, have all died. While his mother was still alive, she said that she prayed that he would be released, forgiven, as in the Biblical story of the prodigal son.\n\nThis petite woman, whose only valuables on arrival to the US were two mother-of-pearl brooches marked \u201cJerusalem\u201d, never saw that day. His brother Adel said the family never celebrated Christmas after 1968; \u201cwhat\u2019s the point when your family member is in jail?\u201d Unspoken was the word, \u201cforever\u201d.\n\nSirhan has always articulated distress at his people\u2019s treatment. Palestinians may see him as a casualty of their condition and an affirmation of their criminalisation in the justice systems. He, like many in Israel\u2019s jails, is a forever prisoner.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sirhan-sirhan-receives-death-penalty", "page_content": "On April 23, 1969, Sirhan Sirhan is sentenced to the death penalty after being convicted in the assassination of politician Robert F. Kennedy. In 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty.\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy, a U.S. senator from New York who had just won California\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, gave a victory speech in the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After the speech, Kennedy was making his way toward the hotel kitchen to greet supporters when he was shot three times at close range by Sirhan Sirhan with a .22 caliber revolver; a fourth bullet went through Kennedy\u2019s jacket. Five other people were shot as well, none fatally. Several of the senator\u2019s friends and aides subdued Sirhan on the scene.\n\nKennedy died at the hospital the next day, June 6, at age 42. The funeral for Kennedy, who served as U.S. attorney general from 1961 to 1964 and had been a senator since 1965, was held at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City. His body was then taken to Washington, D.C., by train, with thousands of people lining the route to pay their respects. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery next to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald on November 22, 1963.\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Palestinian immigrant born in Jerusalem in 1944, moved to the United States with his family as a boy and attended high school in California. He later stated he killed Robert Kennedy because the senator had supported Israel in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Following a three-month trial, during which Sirhan\u2019s lawyers argued he was mentally unstable at the time of the murder, he was convicted on April 17, 1969. On April 23, he was given the death penalty. However, in 1972, the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty and Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison. His requests for parole have been denied over a dozen times, and he continues to serve his time in a California prison."}, {"url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Robert-F-Kennedy-Jr-Sirhan-Sirhan-didn-t-16686114.php", "page_content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom will soon decide the fate of Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of killing my father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968. Gov. Newsom has stated he reveres my father and will consider the wishes of my family members. My family, however, is divided; I and two of my nine surviving siblings feel strongly that Sirhan\u2019s release best reflects my father\u2019s legacy.\n\nAfter more than 50 years in prison, the state\u2019s own psychiatrists and the parole board deem that Sirhan poses no threat to society. During a three-hour meeting with him in 2018, I was impressed with the genuineness of Sirhan\u2019s remorse for his role in my father\u2019s shooting, even though he has always claimed to have no memory of those moments. Sirhan wept, clenched my hands and asked for forgiveness from me, from my siblings and from my mother for his part in the tragedy. At 77, he seems gentle, humble, kindhearted, frail and harmless.\n\nMy father had a pious Catholic\u2019s belief in redemption, forgiveness and justice. His favorite quote, from Aeschylus, urged that we should \u201ctame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of the world.\u201d By upholding the parole board\u2019s decision to release Sirhan, Newsom has the opportunity to demonstrate the humanity, compassion and idealism of our justice system to which my father devoted his life.\n\nI also hope that the governor will consider the overwhelming evidence that Sirhan is not my father\u2019s killer.\n\nFor many years, I accepted the orthodoxy that Sirhan was responsible. After all, dozens of eyewitnesses in the Ambassador Hotel pantry saw him fire his gun from just a few feet in front of my father. But in 2016, my father\u2019s close friend, Paul Schrade, persuaded me to read Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi\u2019s autopsy report and to listen to audio recordings and review other evidence indicating that Sirhan could not have been the murderer.\n\nSirhan fired only two shots directly at my dad. One of them struck Schrade in the head. The other likely lodged in a door jamb behind my father. Five men then tackled and pinned Sirhan to a steam table and diverted his gun away from my father. From beneath that dogpile, Sirhan squeezed off six more shots, emptying his chamber as five of the six shots hit bystanders. This accounts for seven of the eight rounds in Sirhan\u2019s gun. The only audio recording of the shooting, however, suggests that at least 13 shots may have been fired. The Los Angeles Police Department had the audiotape at the time of Sirhan\u2019s trial, but illegally concealed it from his lawyers and the public for 20 years. Meanwhile, according to Tim Tate and Brad Johnson\u2019s 2018 book \u201cThe Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy,\u201d FBI agents found several additional bullet holes in the pantry, further indicating more than eight shots were fired.\n\nAccording to the autopsy, all four shots that struck my father (one shot passed harmlessly through his suit) were fired from behind at a steep upward angle toward the ceiling. All shots were from within a few inches, with two leaving gun powder residue in the wounds, suggesting that the assassin was standing close behind my father, shielding his weapon with his body while all attention focused on Sirhan.\n\nMortally wounded, my father turned and tore off the clip-on tie of a recently hired security guard named Thane Eugene Cesar, who had clutched my father\u2019s elbow from behind and steered him toward the steam table where Sirhan was waiting.\n\nRecords of the case demonstrate that Los Angeles police investigators bullied and badgered eyewitnesses to change their statements regarding the number of shots and to silence those who say they saw Cesar draw and shoot his gun and those who reported conspirators dashing from the scene. Police also inexplicably and illegally destroyed thousands of pieces of evidence, including 2,410 photographs of the crime scene before and after the shooting as well as the door frames and ceiling tiles in the pantry with vital bullet evidence, while Sirhan\u2019s case was still on appeal.\n\nSirhan\u2019s anemic defense team never challenged prosecutorial inconsistencies; his attorney was facing criminal charges for illegal conduct on behalf of mob boss Johnny Roselli, who played a key role in the CIA\u2019s Castro assassination program. Sirhan\u2019s trial was thus akin to a sentencing hearing. This attorney bullied Sirhan into conceding guilt at the outset and actively blocked the inclusion of ballistics and other evidence that might have proven him innocent.\n\nFor these reasons, I have called for a new investigation into the case.\n\nI believe Cesar killed my father. He was in the exact position to fire the shots as described in the autopsy. Three witnesses saw him draw his gun \u2014 which he later admitted \u2014 and one said she saw him fire it. The Los Angeles police never bothered to examine the gun. Cesar, who was moonlighting that night from his high-security clearance job at the Lockheed plant, acknowledged a loathing for the Kennedys and their race-mixing sympathizers. In her 2018 book, \u201cA Lie Too Big to Fail,\u201d researcher Lisa Pease claims that Cesar described himself as a \u201cCIA contract agent.\u201d\n\nBedeviled by questions about his involvement in my father\u2019s murder, Cesar fled to the Philippines. I was in negotiations with him in 2018, before reports of his death in September 2019. After first agreeing to meet with me, he gradually escalated his price to $25,000 for the privilege of interviewing him.\n\nThe pain that we all feel from my father\u2019s death should not prevent us from pursuit of the truth. I firmly believe the idea that Sirhan murdered my dad is a fiction that is impeding justice. If Newsom overrules Sirhan\u2019s parole, he will become just one more California official who claims to love my father but persists in denying him justice.\n\nRobert F.

Here\u2019s what you may not know about him.\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born into a Christian family in the Palestinian section of Jerusalem in 1944. By the time he turned 3, witnessing violent clashes stemming from the war for Israeli independence was a daily occurrence.\n\nHis mother, Mary, said that as a youngster Sirhan had seen a man ripped to pieces by a bomb during an attack in his neighborhood. The image haunted her son, she said, and he would never be the same.\n\nWhen he was 12, his family emigrated to the United States on a special visa granted to Palestinian refugees. The family stayed briefly in New York and then moved on to California where Sirhan attended junior high, high school and community college.\n\nHis faith was important to him, according to his mother. He even complained to her once that children of his age did not take religion seriously enough.\n\nHe joined the Baptist church and was briefly a Seventh-day Adventist. In 1966, two years before he would kill Kennedy, he turned to an occult organization called the Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosae Crucis, or the Rosicrucians. The organization studies mystical and philosophical doctrines and how they apply to modern life.\n\nSirhan never settled into a career but held a series of menial jobs. At one point, he was working at the Santa Anita racetrack, and at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 115 pounds, he had hopes of one day becoming a jockey. That plan had not panned out, and by the end of May 1968, Sirhan was adrift with no job prospects.\n\nPhotographer David Hume Kennerly on memories of RFK on 55th anniversary of his assassinationhttps://t.co/jpOrlSSQXY \u2014 Mike Mathews @memathews@twit.social (@memathews) June 6, 2023\n\nKilling Kennedy\n\nLate on June 4, 1968, election returns in the California and South Dakota Democratic primaries for president were counted and Kennedy was declared the winner. As the people who had been crammed into the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles cheered, Kennedy\u2019s victory speech recalled the themes that had propelled him to victory that night \u2013 resetting the moral compass of the country, the fight against poverty and hunger in the United States, peace in Vietnam.\n\nFrom the stage, he acknowledged supporters by name and thanked volunteers \u2013 many of them in their late teens and 20s \u2013 who had worked hard for him in California, a state vital to his run for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cMy thanks to all of you. Now it\u2019s on to Chicago and let\u2019s win there,\u201d Kennedy said to the crowd.\n\nWhile Kennedy was ending his speech in the ballroom, Sirhan was in the hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry area with a .22-caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet handgun in his pocket. Two hotel employees would later say they saw Sirhan near the service elevator close to the door that leads into the Embassy Ballroom as Kennedy came down earlier to give his victory speech.\n\nAccording to Jesus Perez and Martin Petrusky, Sirhan asked if Kennedy would be returning through the kitchen area, the same way as he had gone to the stage. Petrusky and Perez told him they did not know. Both men remembered that Sirhan lingered around the elevator area as Kennedy spoke from the stage.\n\nIt was not the first time Sirhan had been in the hotel, according to testimony at his trial. The prosecution was able to place him there on June 3, two days before Kennedy was shot. According to testimony, he was noticed by someone who worked at the Ambassador because he seemed to be out of place.\n\nTwo days before he was spotted at the hotel, Sirhan visited the Lock, Stock \u2018N Barrel gun shop, according to testimony. He purchased two boxes of .22-caliber hollow-point bullets. Early on June 4, hours before he would confront Kennedy in the hotel kitchen, he visited the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club to practice at its gun range.\n\nSirhan was waiting with the gun in the service area as Kennedy finished speaking. Kennedy was led off the stage, through a door and down a hallway toward the Colonial Room of the hotel where the press was waiting to talk to him.\n\nAccording to witnesses, Kennedy was moving slowly through the pantry, shaking hands with some of the people who worked there. Kennedy reached out to shake the hand of a busboy, Juan Romero, when Sirhan, smiling, moved toward Kennedy, planted his right foot, raised his arm and shouted \u201cKennedy, you son of a bitch,\u201d and began shooting.\n\nKennedy was hit three times \u2014 one bullet went into his armpit, a second hit him in the back and the third went into the back of his head behind his right ear. A fourth bullet tore a hole in his jacket. He fell to the floor bleeding as those in his entourage, including former NFL star Rosey Grier, writer George Plimpton, Olympic track star Rafer Johnson, journalist Pete Hamill and others, wrestled Sirhan down, pried the gun from his hand, grabbed him up and slammed him down on some metal steaming tables.\n\n\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Sirhan screamed. \u201cI can explain. I did it for my country. I love my country.\u201d\n\nBefore the gun was wrested from his hand, five others in the pantry \u2014 Paul Schrade, William Weisel, Ira Goldstein, Elizabeth Evans and Irwin Stroll \u2014 were shot. All five would recover from their wounds.\n\nRomero, an Ambassador busboy, knelt to help Kennedy, who was on the floor, bleeding from his head and back. According to Romero, he bent down to hear Kennedy reportedly ask, \u201cIs everybody OK?\u201d Romero told The Los Angeles Times, \u201cI told him \u2018Yes, everybody\u2019s OK\u2019. And then he turned away from me and said, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThose were the last words he spoke. Kennedy died about 26 hours later, having never regained consciousness.\n\n\u201cSomeone said he\u2019s been shot!\u201d 55 yrs ago today. Chaos at the Ambassador Hotel as Sen. Robert F.

In the spiral notebook showed evidence of a growing rage against all Zionists, with Kennedy\u2019s name mentioned throughout.\n\nOne entry even named the date by which Sirhan said Kennedy should die. The date was June 5, the day Kennedy was shot. June 5, 1968, was the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and Syria.\n\nSirhan was angry with Kennedy for his support of Israel and his support for the U.S. selling jet fighters to Israel. He said he had made the decision to kill Kennedy after he heard him say in a speech in the spring of 1968 that he would support giving the planes to Israel.\n\nThe entry on May 18, 1968, read, \u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th.\u201d Other entries more hauntingly read, \u201cdie, die, die, die, die.\u201d\n\nCaught, confessed, convicted\n\nSirhan refused to speak or to identify himself after he was taken into custody in the hotel\u2019s pantry that night. It wasn\u2019t until June 9, four days after the shooting, that he confessed to police that he was the one who shot Kennedy. Despite the confession, Sirhan pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nThe trial was set for January 1969.\n\nOpening statements began in February, and, after a three-month trial in which his defense team argued he was mentally ill, Sirhan was found guilty of Kennedy\u2019s murder. He was sentenced to death in California\u2019s gas chamber.\n\nSirhan testified in his own defense, saying he had no memory of killing Kennedy, and that he had been drunk the night of the shooting. He testified that he had borne no \u201cill-will towards Kennedy.\u201d\n\nAfter three years in prison, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned California\u2019s death penalty law, and Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison. He has remained an inmate of the state of California since.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy with children and John Glenn at Disneyland two days before 1968 California Presidential primary, fifty-five years ago today: pic.twitter.com/rHEHE93poS \u2014 Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) June 3, 2023\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThrough the years, Sirhan changed aspects of his story in some ways but has always repeated the claim that he does not remember what took place in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel.\n\nConspiracy theories were born even as Sirhan was being restrained in the moments after the shooting According to Hamill, someone yelled as Sirhan was being slammed onto the table, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him. Don\u2019t kill him. No Jack Ruby!\u201d\n\nMany thought Sirhan a patsy, the same thing Lee Harvey Oswald called himself following JFK\u2019s assassination. They said larger forces used him as a cover so someone else could kill another Kennedy.\n\nIn 2011, Sirhan\u2019s lawyers claimed in court papers that he had been speaking to and had been hypnotized by a psychiatrist. According to the filings, Sirhan revealed that while he shot Kennedy, he had not killed him and that he had seen a flash from the gun of the person who did kill him. The flash came from behind Kennedy, Sirhan said under hypnosis.\n\nOne of his attorneys said Sirhan also revealed under hypnosis that a \u201cgirl in the polka-dot dress\u201d tapped or pinched him on the arm and that when that happened he was conditioned to believe that he was on a weapons firing range and he was to begin firing.\n\nUnder hypnosis, he remembered meeting the girl that night and that she led him to the pantry, according to an Associated Press report.\n\n\u201cI am trying to figure out how to hit on her.... That\u2019s all that I can think about,\u201d he said in one interview cited in the documents. \u201cI was fascinated with her looks .... She never said much. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with an unspoken unavailability.\u201d\n\nWhen he was not under hypnosis, he remembered nothing about the shooting, according to his attorneys.\n\nSirhan\u2019s defense team in 1969 claimed Kennedy\u2019s autopsy proved that he could not have killed the senator because the fatal shot entered his head from behind his right ear. Sirhan was standing in front of Kennedy.\n\nIn a parole hearing in 2016, Paul Schrade, one of the five other people injured in the shooting, apologized to Sirhan for not helping him before by testifying at his parole hearings. It was the first time Schrade had seen Sirhan since 1969. Schrade said the evidence clearly showed a second gunman had been in the kitchen pantry.\n\n\u201cI should have been here long ago and that\u2019s why I feel guilty for not being here to help you and to help me,\u201d Schrade said in the hearing.\n\nSchrade since called for the investigation into Kennedy\u2019s shooting be reopened.\n\nOther conspiracy theories claim:\n\nThe CIA was involved in Kennedy\u2019s death. According to a story in the Guardian, a CIA agent named David Morales once bragged to friends while talking about the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, \u201cI was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\u201d\n\nStill, others have wondered how Sirhan shot Kennedy in the back if he was standing in front of him as he fired the gun. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2005 that Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi found: \u201cEyewitnesses put Sirhan no closer than 18 inches from Kennedy, but Noguchi testified that when the fatal wound was inflicted the gun was 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches from Kennedy\u2019s ear. His testimony fed conspiracy theories that Sirhan had not acted alone.\u201d \u201cBased solely on the examination of the remains and the scene afterwards, I came to the conclusion that Senator Bobby Kennedy was shot by a small caliber gun from the right side of the back of the head,\u201d Noguchi said.\n\nA radio reporter recorded the sound of 13 shots being fired in the pantry. Sirhan\u2019s gun held only eight bullets.\n\nAn actress and Kennedy campaign volunteer, Nina Rhodes-Hughes, was in the pantry when the shooting started and she reported to the FBI that she heard anywhere from 12-14 shots that night. \u201cThere were at least 12, maybe 14. And I know there were because I heard the rhythm in my head,\u201d Rhodes-Hughes told CNN in 2012. She says she believes senior FBI officials altered statements she made to the agents to \u201cconform with what they wanted the public to believe, period.\u201d\n\nAccording to some witnesses, a security guard standing behind Kennedy at the time was seen drawing his weapon. That man, Thane Cesar, later passed a polygraph test that included questions about whether he shot Kennedy.\n\nThrough the years other theories have been advanced and even members of Kennedy\u2019s family have wondered if the right man is in prison for the assassination. Robert Kennedy\u2019s son, Robert Kennedy Jr., told The Washington Post that he believes that there were two shooters in the kitchen pantry that night. \u201cThere were too many bullets,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire 13 shots out of an eight-shot gun.\u201d\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. is running for president in 2024."}]}
