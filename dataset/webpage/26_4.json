{"Thomas Harriot was born in Oxford.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Harriot", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot, also spelled Hariot, (born 1560, Oxford, Eng.\u2014died July 2, 1621, London), mathematician, astronomer, and investigator of the natural world.\n\nLittle is known of him before he received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Oxford in 1580. Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz Astronomy and Space Quiz\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

English mathematician, astronomer, and natural scientist Thomas Harriot introduced some of the symbols used in algebra today. He published very little but left thousands of pages of manuscripts, which scholars did not closely study until the mid-20th century.\n\nHarriot was born in 1560 in Oxford, England. He lived at Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s home in London, England\u2014Durham House\u2014which was a center for Raleigh\u2019s preparations to sponsor a colony on Roanoke Island in \u201cVirginia\u201d (now in North Carolina). Harriot was deeply involved. While living at Durham House, he worked out mathematical solutions to various navigational problems, devised navigational instruments, helped organize and raise funds for the expeditions, and kept Raleigh\u2019s accounts. He may have gone on the first expedition Raleigh sent to Roanoke Island in 1584. Harriott was certainly on the next one, from April 1585 to July 1586, which he described in 1588 in A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\u2014Harriot\u2019s only book published in his lifetime. By 1589 Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1590s the political tide in England began to turn against Raleigh. Harriot found a new patron in Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland, who gave him an estate in Durham, England, in 1595. Percy also gave Harriot the use of a house near London as a residence and scientific laboratory for his studies in astronomy, meteorology, optics, chemistry, and mathematics. Harriot applied mathematics to the bending of light and to the path of a cannonball shot from a gun (ballistics). He was the first to discover the principle of the refraction of light now called Snell\u2019s law, which the Dutch scientist Willebrord Snell discovered independently 20 years after Harriot.\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603, Raleigh was arrested and charged with treason. In the course of his trial, both he and Harriot were accused of atheism, although there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings to substantiate the charge. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Harriot was arrested on suspicion of having cast King James\u2019s horoscope; his patron, Percy, was also arrested. Harriot was soon released, but Percy remained in the Tower of London until 1621.\n\nWith both of his former patrons in prison, Harriot returned his attention to his studies of optics and astronomy. His reputation reached the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who initiated an exchange of letters. Harriot observed Halley\u2019s comet and, like his Italian contemporary Galileo, used a telescope to observe sunspots and the moons of Jupiter. In 1609 and 1610 Harriot drew sketches of the Moon as viewed through a telescope.\n\nHarriot\u2019s last eight years were marred by having cancer of the nose and by Raleigh\u2019s execution, which Harriot was present to witness. Harriot died in London on July 2, 1621. His Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (\u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d) was published posthumously in 1631. Both the editor and Harriot himself introduced some of the mathematical symbols used in algebra today. Harriot was among the first to solve mathematical equations involving negative and complex roots and imaginary numbers."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/mathematics-biographies/thomas-harriot", "page_content": "Harriot, Thomas\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nReprinted in Major Problems in American Colonial History\n\nPublished in 1999\n\nEdited by Karen Ordahl Kupperman\n\n\"...some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men...\"\n\nE nglish exploration of North America began with the voyages of Italian-born navigator John Cabot (c.1450\u2013c.1499), who reached the region that eventually became known as New England in 1497. By 1502 fishermen were sending cod (a type of fish used for food) from Labrador, Canada, and New England to the port of Bristol, England. As early as 1508\u20131509 Cabot's son Sebastian (c. 1476\u20131557) had explored the Atlantic coast, but the English did not establish a permanent presence on the continent for another hundred years. Although Bartholomew Gosnold (d. 1607) briefly attempted to colonize New England in 1602, the English settlers were not prepared for life in the New World. Nevertheless published reports of Gosnold's venture described North America as \"the goodliest continent that ever we saw, promising more by farre than we any way did expect.\" Eager investors formed business ventures in the hopes of exploiting the bountiful resources in the wilderness.\n\nEnglish explorers were also trying to find a northwest passage, a natural waterway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, which would provide more direct access to Asia. In 1576 Martin Frobisher (c.1535\u20131594) undertook a series of voyages to Greenland to search for a water route, but each time his ships were stopped by ice in the Canadian Arctic. In 1578 English navigator Humphrey Gilbert (c.1539\u20131583) was given a patent (contract granting specific rights) by Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) to explore and colonize North America. On his second expedition, in 1585, he reached Newfoundland and claimed the region for England. Discovering some fishermen living on the site of present-day St. John's, Gilbert appointed himself governor of the settlement. According to a few scholars, Gilbert established the first English colony in the New World, although most historians give that distinction to Jamestown, Virginia (see \"The Founding of Jamestown\").\n\nDuring the return trip to England, Gilbert was lost at sea. The North America patent was then transferred to his half brother, Walter Raleigh (1554\u20131618), who secured the support of influential noblemen and navigators for another attempt to establish a settlement. In 1584 Raleigh appointed Philip Amadas (1550\u20131618) and Arthur Barlowe to head an expedition to explore the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. Reaching the outer banks of present-day North Carolina, the expedition party came in contact with the Roanokes, Native Americans who inhabited Roanoke Island and the surrounding region. After a brief stay the Englishmen took two Native Americans, Manteo and Wachese, back to England. Amadas and Barlowe gave enthusiastic reports about Roanoke, claiming the island offered favorable trading prospects and an excellent location for a military fort. Impressed by the success of the mission, Elizabeth I knighted Raleigh and named the region Virginia in honor of herself (she was called the \"Virgin Queen\" because she refused to marry).\n\nRaleigh immediately organized a venture to establish a permanent colony at Roanoke. He assembled five ships and two boats, which he placed under the command of English navigator Richard Grenville (1542\u20131591). Among the party of 108 men\u2014mainly soldiers and servants\u2014was Thomas Harriot (1560\u20131621), a mathematician and Raleigh's tutor, who was given the task of surveying Virginia. (Surveying is a branch of mathematics that involves determining the area of any portion of the Earth's surface, the lengths and directions of bounding lines, and the contour of the surface.) Manteo and Wachese were to serve as interpreters, and artist John White (?\u20131593) planned to make drawings of animal and plant life in North America. Upon arriving at Roanoke in July 1585, the expedition got off to a bad start. First, Grenville determined that the island was not appropriate for a permanent military base. Then he ordered the burning of a Native American village when he discovered a silver cup was missing.\n\nLater the next month Grenville departed Roanoke for the Caribbean. Before leaving he placed colonist Ralph Lane (1530\u20131603) in charge of one hundred men. He then ordered the men to find a better site for the settlement and construct a fort and other buildings. In spite of Grenville's earlier aggression toward the Native Americans, the Englishmen had a good relationship with the Roanoke (also called Wiroan) people and their chief, Wingina. Lane freely explored the area, White sketched plants and animals, and Harriot conducted a detailed survey of the land. Harriot also recorded his observations of Native American life, language, and customs. As spring approached, the colonists ran out of food, so Lane took the drastic step of demanding corn from Wingina. Although the chief offered some land and seeds, Lane over-looked his generosity and concluded that the Native Americans were planning an attack. Lane therefore decided to strike first, and in the conflict Wingina and several of his people were killed.\n\nThe murder of Wingina and other Roanokes only made the food shortage at Roanoke worse because neighboring Native American groups avoided contact with the Europeans. The struggling colony was in desperate straits by June 1586, when English seaman Francis Drake (1540?\u20131596) paid a surprise visit on his way back from the Caribbean. Anxious to go home, all but three of the settlers boarded Drake's ship and set sail for England. About a year after their return Harriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.\n\nThings to Remember While Reading A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia:\n\nHarriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia primarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys.\n\nprimarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys. When the English initially organized the Roanoke expeditions they were motivated by the prospect of making profits on precious metals and trade in North America. Nevertheless, like the Spanish and French, they were also intent on converting Native American \"savages\" to Christianity (see \"New Mexico Indians Eager for Conversion\" and \"Jolliet and Marquette Explore the Mississippi\"). Note Harriot's statement that \"Some religion they [Native Americans] have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\" Later he observed that the Native Americans kept no written records. This was because they had a rich oral tradition, whereby master storytellers passed myths and legends down from generation to generation (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\").\n\nHarriot commented that \"some of the people [the Wiroans] could not tell whether to think us gods or men.\" Compare the Wiroans' confusion to the reactions of the Tlingits of Southeast Alaska (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\") and the Tainos in the Caribbean (see \"Christopher Columbus Reports to Ferdinand and Isabella\") upon meeting Europeans for the first time.\n\nHistorians maintain that Harriot showed unusual insight into problems that would eventually develop between Native Americans and European colonists. For instance, he wrote that native peoples \"are not to be feared, but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\" Later he observed, \"If there fall out any wars between us & them,\" the English would have \"advantages against them in so many manner of ways.\"\n\nHarriot described the friendly relations the English enjoyed with Wingina and the Wiroans. Although the situation changed drastically after Lane initiated the attack that resulted in the deaths of the chief and several other Wiroans.\n\nThe Wiroans died in great numbers after the Englishmen visited their towns, a \"marvelous accident\" that puzzled both Harriot and the Wiroans. Since none of the Englishmen were stricken, the deaths were undoubtedly caused by diseases they had carried with them from Europe. Disease was a major factor in the near-extermination of the Native American population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nKeep in mind that Harriot wrote A Brief and True Report for a sixteenth-century audience. Since his language and writing style are unfamiliar to twentieth-century readers, explanatory notes are included in the following excerpts from the document.\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nHarriot opened his report with a detailed description of the appearance and customs of Native Americans, whom he called \"natural inhabitants.\" He remarked that native peoples did not have sophisticated tools, nor did they have any weapons except bows and arrows for fighting against the English settlers (\"to offend us withal\"):\n\nIt resteth I [I pause to] speak a word or two of the natural inhabitants, their natures and manners, . . as that you know, how that they in respect of troubling our inhabiting and planting, are not to be feared, [they pose no threat to our settlement] but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\n\nThey are a people clothed with loosemantles made of Deer skins, & aprons of the same round about their middles; all else naked; . . having no edge tools or weapons of iron or steel to offend us withal, neither know they how to make any: those weapons that they have,\n\nMantles\n\nMantles: Cloaks\n\nare only bows made ofWitch hazel, & arrows of reeds, flat edgedtruncheons also of wood about a yard long, neither have they anything to defend themselves but targets made of barks, and somearmours made of stickswickered together with thread. . . .\n\nHarriot observed that the Native Americans admired English customs (\"our manner of knowledges and crafts\"), which they found superior to their own. Consequently they wanted to please and cooperate with the English (\"and have greater respect for pleasing and obeying us\"). He went on to describe Native Americans' wars with one another, observing that battle strategy (\"set battles\") was rare, except when there happened to be (\"it fall out\") fighting in the forest. At this point Harriot made his prediction about the Native Americans' lack of preparation for wars with Europeans. Since they could not defend themselves against superior battle plans and weaponry, they could be expected to run away from confrontation. Yet he praised their \"excellence of wit,\" and he predicted that the English could eventually civilize them and convert them to Christianity (the \"true religion\"):\n\nTheir manner of wars amongst themselves is either by sudden surprising one another most commonly about the dawning of the day, or moonlight, or else byambushes, or some subtle devices [secretive methods]. Set battles are very rare, except it fall out where there are many trees, where either part may have some hope of defence, after the delivery of every arrow, in leaping behind some [tree] or other.\n\nIf there fall out any wars between us & them, what their fight is likely to be, we having advantages against them so many manner of ways, as by our discipline, our strange weapons and devices else [other devices], especially byordinance great and small, it may be easily imagined; by the experience we have had in some places, the turning up of their heels against us in running away was their best defence. In respect of us they are a people poor, and for want of skill and judgment in the knowledge and use of our things, do esteem ourtrifles before things of greater value: Notwithstanding in their proper manner considering the want of such means as we have [in spite of not having our advantages], they seem veryingenious; For although they have no such tools, nor any such crafts, sciences and arts as we. . . they should desire our friendships & love, and have the greater respect for pleasing and obeying us. Whereby may be hoped if means of good government be used, [if we govern them properly] that they may in short time be brought to civility and embracing of true religion.\n\nWitch hazel\n\nWitch hazel: Shrub or tree with slender-petaled yellow flowers borne in late fall or early spring\n\nTruncheons\n\nTruncheons: Clubs\n\nArmours\n\nArmours: Hand-held weapons\n\nWickered\n\nWickered: Woven\n\nAmbushes\n\nAmbushes: Surprise attacks\n\nOrdinance\n\nOrdinance: Weapons and ammunition\n\nTrifles\n\nTrifles: Things of little value\n\nIngenious\n\nIngenious: Clever, resourceful\n\nHarriot reported that the Native Americans believed in an eternal god who created other gods. Nevertheless he dismissed their views as simply \"some religion\" that was \"far from the truth\" and would make the task of conversion easier for the English. Notice that Native Americans, like Christians, believed in immortality, heaven, and hell:\n\nSome religion they have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\n\nThey believe that there are many Gods which they call Mont\u00f3ac, but of different sorts and degrees; one only chief and great God, which hath been from all eternity. Who as they affirm when he purposed to make the world, made first other gods of a principal order to be as means and instruments to be used in the creation and government to follow; and after the Sun, Moon, and Stars as petty gods. . . . First they say were made waters, out of which by the gods was made all diversity of creatures that are visible or invisible.\n\nFor mankind they say a woman was made first, which by the working of one of the gods, conceived and brought forth children: And in such sort [in this manner] they say they had their beginning. But how many years or ages have passed since, they say they can make no relation, having no letters nor other such means as we to keep records of the particularities of times past, but only tradition from father to son. . . .\n\nThey believe also theimmortality of the soul, that after this life as soon as the soul is departed from the body, according to the works it hath done, it is either carried to heaven thehabitacle of gods, there to enjoy perpetual bliss and happiness, or else to a great pit or hole, which they think to be in the furthest parts of their part of the world toward the sunset, there to burn continually: the place they call Popogusso. . . .\n\nImmortality\n\nImmortality: The state of being free from death\n\nHabitacle\n\nHabitacle: Dwelling place\n\nIn this final excerpt Harriot described the Wiroans' reactions to Christianity. They accepted the Englishmen's faith, eventually rejecting their own. They grew to fear the Christian God. For instance, the Wiroans blamed illness or crop failure on the wrath of the Englishmen's god. In fact, whenever the Englishmen encountered hostility or resentment in Native American villages, the inhabitants began dying within a few days after they left. Both Harriot and the Wiroans seemed to make a connection between the mysterious deaths and offenses toward the Englishmen. The Wiroans therefore concluded that the Englishmen were gods, especially since they had no women with them. (The earliest Virginia expeditions were comprised only of men.) The true reason for the illnesses, however, was that the Native Americans were not immune to the diseases that the Europeans often carried.\n\nWiroans with whom we dwelt called Wingina, and many of his people would be glad many times to be with us at our prayers, and many times call upon us both in his own town, as also in others whither he sometimes accompanied us, to pray and singPsalms; hoping thereby to be partaker of the same effects which we by that means also expected [hoping to gain the same benefits from our religion].\n\nTwice this Wiroans [Wingina] was sogrievously sick that he was like to die, and as he laylanguishing, doubting of any help by his own priests, and thinking he was in such danger for offending [because he had offended] us and thereby our god, sent for some of us to pray and be a means [connection] to our God that it would please him either that he [Wingina] might live, or after death dwell with him [God] in bliss, so likewise were the requests of many others in the like case.\n\nOn a time also when their corn began to wither by reason of adrought which happened extraordinarily, fearing [they feared] that it had come to pass by reason that in something they had displeased us, many would come to us & desire us to pray to our God of England, that he would preserve their corn, promising that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruit.\n\nThere could at no time happen any strange sickness, losses, hurts, or any other cross [misfortune] unto them, but that they wouldimpute to us the cause or means thereof for offending or not pleasing us. . . .\n\nPsalms\n\nPsalms: A book in the Old Testament containing sacred songs and poems\n\nGrievously\n\nGrievously: Terribly\n\nLanguishing\n\nLanguishing: Suffering\n\nDrought\n\nDrought: A period of prolonged dryness that causes extensive damage to crops or prevents their successful growth\n\nImpute\n\nImpute: Attribute\n\nThere was no town where we had any subtle device practiced against us [the inhabitants showed hostility], we leaving it unpunished or not revenged (because we sought by all means possible to win them by gentleness) but that within a few days after our departure from every such town, the people began to die very fast, and many in short space; in some towns about twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, & in one six score [one hundred twenty], which in truth was very many in respect of their numbers. This happened in no place that we could learn but where we had been where they used some practice against us, and after such time; The disease also was sostrange, that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; the like by report of the oldest men in the country never happened before, time out of mind. A thing specially observed by us, as also by the natural inhabitants themselves. . . .\n\nThis marvelous accident in all the country wrought so strange opinions of us, that some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men . . . because . . . there was no man of ours known to die, or that was especially sick: they noted also that we had no women among us, neither that we did care for any of theirs.\n\nSome therefore were of opinion that we were not born of women, and therefore notmortal, but that we were men of an old generation many years past then risen again to immortality.\n\nMortal\n\nMortal: Human\n\nWhat happened next . . .\n\nSoon after the departure of the colonists Grenville returned to Roanoke with a new load of supplies and six hundred additional men. He found the colony deserted\u2014no one knows what happened to the three men who had remained on the island. Eventually Grenville decided to return to England and recruit more settlers. He left fifteen men at Roanoke to plant crops and build dwellings in preparation for the new colonists. By that time, however, Raleigh had lost interest in colonizing Virginia. John White, the artist who accompanied Grenville in 1585, therefore took over the project and acquired the backing of several investors for another expedition.\n\nWhite's plan was to start a new colony called the City of Raleigh, which would be located north of Roanoke in the Chesapeake Bay area. White would be the governor of the new colony. Since this settlement would be devoted to families and farming instead of military defense, the party included seventeen women, nine children, and ninety-four men. When the ships reached North America in late 1587, the pilot refused to go any farther than Roanoke. Forced to remain at the old settlement, the colonists discovered that the fifteen men left by Grenville were gone, possibly driven out by Native Americans. Consequently crops had not been planted and there was no suitable housing. The only solution was for White to go back to England for more supplies and additional men. Before departing he told the colonists to move to another location if they had any problems and to leave a message telling him where to find them.\n\nThe \"lost\" colony\n\nAfter a three-year absence John White returned from England in 1591, only to find Roanoke deserted. The fate of the inhabitants of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. These excerpts from White's journal describe what he found at the site.\n\nAugust 17 . . . we espied [spied] toward the north end of the island the light of a great fire through the woods, to which we presently rode. When we came right over against it, we let fall our grapnel [anchor] near the shore and sounded with a trumpet a call, and afterwards many familiar English tunes of songs, and called to them friendly. But we had no answer. We therefore landed at daybreak, and coming to the fire, we found the grass and sundry [numerous] rotten trees burned about the place.... In all this way we saw in the sand the print of the savages' feet of two or three sorts trodden the night, and as we entered up the sandy bank, upon a tree, in the very brow thereof, were curiously carved these fair Roman letters CRO; which letters presently we knew to signify the place where I should find the planters seated, according to a secret token agreed upon between them and me at my last departure from them, which was that they should not fail to write or carve on the tree or posts of the doors the name of the place where they should be seated; for at my coming away they were prepared to remove from Roanoke 50 miles in the main. Therefore at my departure from them in 1587 I willed them that if they should happen to be distressed in any of those places, that then they should carve over the letters or name a cross; but we found no such sign of distress. And having well considered of this, we passed towards the place where they were left in sundry houses, but we found the houses taken down, and the place very strongly enclosed with a high palisade [fence] of great trees . . . and one of the chief trees or posts at the right side of the entrance had the bark taken off, and five foot from the ground in fair capital letters was graven [carved] CROATOAN without any cross or sign of distress. . . . This could be no other but the deed of the savages our enemies.\n\nReprinted in: Colbert, David, ed. Eyewitness to America. New York: Pantheon Books, 1997, pp. 11\u201312.\n\nIn the meantime, war had been brewing between England and Spain. When the conflict erupted in 1588\u2014as White was about to sail from England back to North America\u2014contact between England and Roanoke was cut off. In 1591, after the English defeated the Spanish Armada, White was finally able to return to Roanoke. By that time the settlers had all vanished without a trace, and White found only two clues to their whereabouts: the word \"Croatan\" carved on a fence post and the letters \"Cro\" etched into a tree trunk. The English suspected that the colonists' disappearance was somehow linked with the Croatoans, a friendly Native American tribe who lived on Croatoan Island about fifty miles south of Roanoke.\n\nThe Roanoke settlers were never found, and the fate of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. Numerous theories about their disappearance have evolved over the centuries. They could have died as the result of a natural disaster such as disease, starvation, hurricane, flood, or tornado. They could have tried to return to England and their ship sank at sea. More outlandish explanations include pirates coming ashore and kidnapping all the inhabitants. The most reassuring conclusion is that the colonists joined a nearby Native American tribe, with whom they intermarried and prospered.\n\nAfter the dismal failure of the Roanoke colony the English made no other attempts to colonize North America for nearly twenty years. They realized they had neither the skills nor the money to establish permanent settlements in a strange and hostile land. One modern historian has noted that venturing into the wilderness of North America in the sixteenth century was similar to landing on the moon in the twentieth century. Moreover, the English, like the Spanish, were primarily interested in conquering Native American empires that would yield instant wealth with such treasures as precious metals and jewelry. Yet by the late 1590s Europeans had seized most of the available riches in the New World.\n\nDid you know . . .\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia was immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times.\n\nwas immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times. Harriot may have performed some of the earliest scientific experiments in North America. In addition to conducting a survey of Virginia, he helped another member of the 1585 expedition, German scientist Joachim Ganz, search for copper and other precious metals. Archaeologists excavating the Roanoke site have found equipment that Harriot and Ganz probably used to test metals and ores.\n\nJohn White was the grandfather of Virginia Dare (1587\u2013?), the first European reported to be born in America. Nine days before White's departure from Roanoke, Virginia was born to his daughter Eleanor and his son-in-law Ananais Dare. All three Dares disappeared with the other Roanoke colonists, and White died without ever knowing what happened to his family.\n\nEvidence discovered in 1998 has led historians to speculate that the Roanoke colonists may have been driven out by a drought (a period of prolonged dryness that causes damage to crops). Scientists studying the rings of a bald cypress in southeastern Virginia found that a seven-year drought was occurring at the same time the second group of settlers arrived at Roanoke in 1587. In fact, it was the most severe period of dryness in more than eight hundred years. Thus a food shortage could have forced the colonists to seek another location for their community.\n\nFor more information\n\n\"The Cabot Dilemma: John Cabot's 1497 Voyage & the Limits of Historiography\" in Documents Relevant to the United States Before 1700.http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/9061/USA/colonial/bef1700.html Available September 30, 1999.\n\nCampbell, Elizabeth A.

(University of Oxford; source of image: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThomas Harriot (c.1560\u20131621)\n\nThomas Harriot was born around 1560 in Oxfordshire, possibly in the city of Oxford. Little is known about his family background, except that his father was a commoner and that he had a married sister; he did not marry himself.\n\nIn December 1577, Harriot matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, and received the degree of BA at Easter, 1580. Having soon thereafter acquired a reputation for being skilled mathematically, he was employed by Sir Walter Raleigh (1552/4\u20131618) from at least 1584 to teach him and his sea captains the science of navigation in preparation for Raleigh\u2019s enterprise to establish a settlement in America. Harriot himself travelled to the New World and was a member of the short-lived colony on Roanoke Island, Virginia from June 1685 until his return to England with Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540\u20131596) the following year. He had previously studied the Algonquin language with two native Americans who had been brought over to England in 1584, and used this knowledge to study the social and religious customs of the native people he encountered in Virginia along with the territory\u2019s flora and fauna. After his return, Harriot published, in 1588, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found land of Virginia, which can be largely seen as a defence of Raleigh\u2019s colonial enterprise.\n\nFrom at least 1591 onwards, Harriot became an active member of the scientific circle around Henry Percy (1564\u20131632), ninth earl of Northumberland, conducting astronomical observations and optical experiments, partly aimed at improving navigational techniques. After Raleigh\u2019s star began to wane, Percy took on the role of being Harriot\u2019s patron. He granted Harriot rents from an estate in county Durham and gave him the use of a house on the grounds of Syon House, Isleworth. For his part, Harriot built up and maintained a substantial library and carried out an extensive range of scientific experiments and theoretical investigations on physical, chemical, astronomical, and other topics. Astronomically, he anticipated Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) in recognizing that the orbits of the planets were not circular. However, as he came to recognize himself, it was particularly in mathematics that Harriot excelled, making notable innovations and discoveries in the field of algebra, where he was able to build on the achievements of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603). Unfortunately, none of his mathematical papers were published during his lifetime, while his most complete work, the posthumously-published Artis analyticae praxis (1631) was disfigured through the poor editing of Walter Warner (1563\u20131643).\n\nBoth of Harriot\u2019s erstwhile patrons met with ill-fortune. Raleigh was suspected of involvement with a plot to kill King James and incarcerated at the Tower before eventually being beheaded in 1618. Rumours that Percy had known of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 led to him likewise being imprisoned at the Tower until 1621. While there, he was regularly visited by the three most accomplished members of his circle, notably Nathaniel Torperley (1564\u20131632), Robert Hues (1553\u20131632), and Harriot, who kept him abreast of their continuing researches.\n\nA malicious tumour led to Harriot\u2019s death in the house of a friend in Threadneedle Street, London, on 2 July 1621, a month before Percy\u2019s release from the Tower. He was buried in the nearby church of St Christopher le Stocks, which was later destroyed in the Great Fire. His extensive scientific papers, long feared lost, were rediscovered at Petworth House, Sussex, in the late eighteenth century; the bulk of them have in recent years been deposited in the British Library by Lord Egremont."}, {"url": "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/thomas-harriot-9780190271855", "page_content": "\"While other historians less literate in science and mathematics might have written Harriot's biography in a different manner, she has provided to us a well-written guide to this mysterious scientist who measured everything during the six productive decades of his life.\" - Larry E.

Who was he? From somewhere deep in our granular memories of historical figures we recall that he might have been a scientist, or a mathematician, or perhaps a philosopher. It turns out he was all three and more. Add astronomer, navigational researcher, cartographer, linguist, and explorer to his CV and you have a strikingly notable figure. Add mapping the moon\u2019s surface, telescopic studies of sunspots, calculating the periods of revolution of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and discovering the laws of free fall to his lifetime achievements, and you have a picture of a major biography. He corresponded with Johannes Kepler, discovered Snell\u2019s law before Willebrord Snellius (Snell) did, and discovered properties of the prism and the nature of the rainbow long before Newton was born. So why do we know so little about him?\n\nHarriot never published his work, except for one 48-page booklet, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.Footnote 1 He worked on a large number of manuscripts that were never published. Publishing was just not his thing. Rather, he followed his intellectual passions wherever they led, with a humble indifference to deserved credit. Perhaps that is why his contributions to mathematics, physics, and astronomy were so forgotten, until now with Robyn Arianrhod\u2019s publication of Thomas Harriot: A Life in Science. On April 9, 1585, a three-masted sailing ship named the Tiger left the safety of Plymouth on the southwest coast of England and headed for the open ocean.\n\nRight there, from that first sentence, and on through the next 265 pages, the extraordinary portrait of Thomas Harriot expands like the vast unexplored sea between England and Roanoke Island to take us on a journey through an adventurous life of geographic and scientific exploration.\n\nWhen Harriot was just a boy, English explorers were searching the northernmost parts of North America for quick routes from England to the riches of silks and spices of Asia. Then, in 1580, Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe, plundering some Spanish treasure ships en route. But North America was still just a watering hole and trading stop, and so Sir Walter Raleigh planned other quests. He sent a fleet of seven ships under the command of his cousin Sir Richard Grenville to America, expecting to establish a base, form a colony, and found an English settlement. Only four ships made it to that long, thin series of islands we now call the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Harriot, at the age of twenty-five, along with 160 passengers and crew, was on the overcrowded Tiger. He was often up on deck acting as navigational consultant, taking astronomical readings, and experimenting with ways to improve his instruments for navigating. When he was not required for these activities, he used the time to observe the ship itself, recording the technical terms for its various parts, noting details of ropes and rigging, mulling over the ideal ratio between a ship\u2019s dimensions and the height of its masts, and generally taking note of the day-to-day work of the crew.\n\nNavigating across vast expanses of ocean was often a trial-and-error enterprise confounded by unexpected winds and storms. In 1569, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator created a conformal map projection of the world that later became the standard for nautical navigation. The map locally preserved angles with the meridians while distorting the sizes of objects as latitudes increased from the equator toward the poles. Mercator was not the first to project the curved world onto a plane. Fourteen centuries earlier, the Greco-Roman mathematician astronomer Ptolemy had done something similar, but not with a world that circled the entire spherical globe. The so-called Mercator projection was a cylindrical projection: wrap the globe in a cylinder meeting at the equator, and from that globe\u2019s center, project the points of the surface of the globe onto the wrapped cylinder. Then uncurl the cylinder. Once it is lying flat, you have a Mercator map of the globe. That idea solved a significant problem. If a ship kept its bearing as if it were to sail straight according to a compass, let\u2019s say making an angle \u03b1 northeast with respect to the lines of longitude, the ship would actually follow a spiral path on its course toward the North Pole without ever getting there. To help sailors adjust navigation, Mercator created a corrective chart that represented the spiral path as the straight line it intuitively seemed to be, using straight lines on the flat map to represent longitudes that are not evenly spaced; rather, they increase in spacing as one moves northward. It seemed a strange spacing to be used for navigational purposes, a spacing that, it appeared, no one other than Mercator understood mathematically, until Harriot figured it out using clever tools of trigonometry to provide the first full mathematical solution. Later, he was the first to mathematically find the length of the spiral curve itself, which is today called a loxodrome, or rhumb line. It was the first ever calculation of the exact length of a curve.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Harriot\u2019s early life. Even the exact date of his birth is not recorded where it should be. Records show that he was a commoner, so he must have been quite intelligent as a young lad to be admitted to Oxford at seventeen years of age and attain a degree in 1580. Yet Thomas Harriot is a biography of an enigmatic character whose mind was filled with both intellectual and geographical adventure when he arrived in London with an Oxford bachelor of arts degree and little else\u2026 and soon attracted a wealthy patron: the tall and dashing Walter Raleigh. Thanks to Robyn Arianrhod and her careful research, we now have a brilliant picture of the man brought to life through his accomplishments, from the moment he sailed to the Outer Banks and spent time on Roanoke Island creating a thirty-six-letter phonetic alphabet to record the native Algonquian language.\n\nThe one part of Harriot\u2019s mathematical work for which he is best known is his work on algebra, in which he did fundamental research on the theory of equations and solutions of equations having negative or imaginary roots. For this he concocted new symbols, and used them to their full advantage. Arianrhod tells us: He was arguably the best algebraist of the early seventeenth century, in the decades between Vi\u00e8te\u2019s death in 1603 and the rise of Descartes in the late 1630s.\n\nHarriot was living at a time when mathematical symbols were beginning to find their way into conventional mathematics. He was just twelve years old when Rafael Bombelli\u2019s 1572 L\u2019Algebra was published with symbols representing exponents indexed by numerals. Five years later he was admitted to Oxford. Even by that time, Simon Stevin\u2019s L\u2019Arithm\u00e9tique, with its sophisticated use of symbols, had not yet appeared.\n\nAs late as the early seventeenth century, mathematics writing in Europe was still essentially rhetorical, although in some countries, certain frequently used words had already been abbreviated. Later, those abbreviated words became further abbreviated, and by the 1630s, through the writings of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, Simon Stevin, and eventually Harriot and Descartes, the abbreviations became so compacted that all the once-apparent connections to their origins became lost forever.\n\nToday we have the symbolic expression x2 \u2212 2x + 1, which draws the mind from the special circumstance to the general form ax2 + bx + c, so we can conceive of x2 \u2212 2x + 1 as merely a representative of the species. In Harriot\u2019s time, some writers would still write what we know to be (x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 as The square of the sum of the unknown quantity and a number equals the sum of the squares of the unknown and the number, augmented by twice the product of the unknown and the number.\n\nBut symbolic notation had already taken form in the writing of powers of a variable as repeated letters, so that, for instance, an would be written as a juxtaposition of n copies of the letter a. Just imagine what the mind had to transcend in order to process natural language with all its ambiguities while manipulating words in order to convince oneself of how true the equation is! As late as 1591, Vi\u00e8te would have written the polynomial x2 \u2212 3x + 9 as A quad \u2212 3 in A+9 plano. Harriot would have written that same polynomial as xx \u2212 3x + 9. Like Vi\u00e8te, Harriot manipulated algebraic equations without the use of power indexing, which came only later. Until that point in time, mathematicians were interested in the zeros of polynomials\u2014that is, in the numbers that would make the polynomial equal to zero.\n\nHarriot had the ingenious idea of first setting the polynomial equal to zero, thereby setting up an equation, a polynomial equation, and asking for the numbers that satisfy the equation, something we now do naturally. It was not just a grammatical difference. It opened a door to a whole new way of thinking about polynomials. Harriot saw that a polynomial could be built up from a product of its factors, just as a compound number could. For example, because x4 \u2212 4x3 \u2212 19x2 + 106x \u2212 120 = 0 factors into linear polynomials as (x \u2212 2)(x \u2212 3)(x \u2212 4)(x + 5), the polynomial can equal zero only for the values of x that make one of the factors equal to zero, namely 2, 3, 4, and \u20135.\n\nIt was a game-changer\u2014the problem of finding zeros of polynomials quickly became the problem of factoring polynomials. It was a slight grammatical maneuvering that advanced the possibility that every polynomial equation has a root, possibly a real number or a complex number. Proving this fact generally with satisfactory rigor was beyond seventeenth-century means.\n\nSuch a general proof would have to wait almost two hundred years, when it would take on the general form that we now know as the fundamental theorem of algebra. Setting polynomials to zero gave mathematicians a sense of proper algebraic form. By putting all terms to the left side of an equation and leaving an isolated zero on the right, the form comes to the forefront, that is, the equation x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 falls into a category recognizably distinct from, say, 3x + 2 = 0, and the equation 5x3 + 2x2 + 3x + 2 = 0 falls into a third category. Algebra was not just about equations, but also about forms.\n\nAlgebra was just one of Harriot\u2019s many interests and talents. On the pages of Thomas Harriot you get a mathematician with a probing mind who sees the world as his laboratory. When coming to refraction, for example, Harriot looked at the printed works of others and found errors. So he took his own measurements one day, then the next, then the next days for ten days. He would repeat his measurements for months and years before accepting them as true gauges of nature that were somewhat independent of atmospheric and geological variables. He was aware of the possibility of hidden variables and waited to have enough repetitions to be satisfied that his data were sufficiently accurate.\n\nHe immersed a staff in water and marked off the positions of the images as they appeared when viewed through the water. He was surely not the first to perform such an experiment; curious Babylonians must have done the same. Arianrhod\u2019s book reads smoothly through the more technical arguments, so that the reader feels that everything is visual and easy. We might not know exactly how Harriot got his refraction data, but Arianrhod tells us that we can perform the experiment at home. \u201cYou can get the idea by immersing a straw in a flat-bottomed glass of water,\u201d she tells us before giving the details of how to collect the data. \u201cHarriot marked off these points carefully, and repeated the process as he changed the angle of the staff.\u201d She illustrates this with a diagram (Figure A). Figure A The path of a light ray passing from air to water. (Redrawn from Figure 16b of the book under review, adapted from Harriot\u2019s manuscript BL Add MS 6789 f406r. Courtesy of Robyn Arianrhod.) Full size image\n\nIn the figure, the light ray is traveling from air to water (a denser medium) contained in the rectangle bcd. Harriot is tracing the ray from the water to the air (from d to a) when i < r. The immersed segment of the staff appears bent upward (segment bf) compared with the actual immersed portion of the staff (bd). The line abf is the line of sight to the refracted image as the ray passes from water to air (and to the observer\u2019s eye). Harriot measured bd, cd, and bf. Since sin r = bc/bf and tan i = bc/cd, one can find i and r from trigonometric tables.\n\nHarriot had access to such tables. The first trig table was compiled as far back as the second century b.c.e. by Hipparchus of Nicaea and extended by Ptolemy in the second century c.e. It was done by tabulating the corresponding values of the arcs and chords of a series of angles. Al-Khwarizmi also produced tables of sines, cosines, and tangents in the ninth century, and new versions by Vi\u00e8te and Clavius were published in the 1580s, so Harriot was well aware that he could convert all of his markings into trigonometric quantities. Without measuring any angles directly, he was able to make a table of angles of incidence and refraction from his linear measurements. He knew that sin r = bc/bf and tan i = bc/dc, and from this he deduced the sine law of refraction. He also showed that each pair of refractive media has a particular ratio of sines, or as we say today, every medium has a characteristic index of refraction.\n\nThroughout every mathematical and scientific explanation, Arianrhod keeps us well informed and interested, as if she were talking directly to us. She says: you will notice by experimenting with a straw, it takes a skilled and patient experimenter to take reasonably accurate measurements giving one pair of angles, let alone for the large number needed to uncover the law of refraction. That is likely why few, if any, of Harriot\u2019s peers had studied refraction in this meticulous way. She is inviting us to perform the simple experiment ourselves. What a wonderful experiment this is for middle-school math students to learn Snell\u2019s law as n 1 sin i = n 2 sin r, where n 1 and n 2 are the respective indices of refraction.\n\nWe now know the law from the Fermat principle, which tells us that light travels on whatever path takes the least time. By that principle, it is relatively easy to see the beautiful formula that ties refraction angle i to incidence angle r. However, Harriot did not know of Fermat\u2019s principle, since Pierre de Fermat had not yet been born when Harriot was performing his light experiments in 1597. So he had to approach the problem another way. Arianrhod tells us that many scientists before Harriot carried out similar experiments and came upon inaccurate or invalid results. Ptolemy somehow believed, incorrectly, that the angle of refraction has a direct, essentially proportional, relationship with the angle of incidence. This is approximately true for small angles, but hardly true, even approximately, in general. And back in the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon wrote a treatise on refraction through lenses. But those experiments were, for the most part, understood to be thought experiments, not \u201crigorous, repeated practical ones.\u201d\n\nThe beauty of this biography is that it gives us the whole person on balance, with almost equal attention to extensively varied exploits. The first third of the book is adventurous, with an expedition to Virginia and lively glimpses into Harriot\u2019s teachings of astronomy and navigation in the era of European exploration of the Americas. Then we come to his infatuations with algebra and rainbows, and his correspondence in Latin with Johannes Kepler on elliptical planetary motion, the atomic theory of matter, and the different ways in which cannonballs could be stacked to fill space. In 1591, Harriot worked out a formula giving the number of spheres that could be stacked on a given area and height, a formula that had become useful in models of atomic packing. He mentioned the packing problem to Kepler, pointing out that the most stable way to stack cannonballs on ships was also the densest packing of spheres, accomplished by placing each layer so that the centers of the spheres were above the centers of the holes in the layer below. That was an intuitive conjecture, but Kepler could not prove it. Five years after his correspondence with Harriot, he wrote an essay, The Six-Cornered Snowflake, on why snowflakes always have sixfold symmetry, which includes Harriot\u2019s principle of the best way to stack cannonballs on ships.Footnote 2 For the next 410 years it was known as Kepler\u2019s conjecture. It even found its way into a part of Hilbert\u2019s eighteenth problem. In 1998, Thomas Callister Hales, of the University of Michigan, provided evidence of its validity by a computer analysis of all possible individual cases, and a formal proof was accepted in 2017.Footnote 3\n\nBesides delicately describing Harriot\u2019s treatments of polynomials, refractions, notational innovations, and sphere packing, Arianrhod deftly communicates to us Harriot\u2019s interests in language, analytic geometry, binomial coefficients, the binomial theorem, projectile motion, spherical triangles, solar rotation, the orbit of Halley\u2019s comet, the shape of a rainbow, compound interest, quantitative analysis of population growth, sunspots, and moon mapping. Woven through all this math and science is a dynamic history, including the tale of Harriot\u2019s brief imprisonment for his coincidental connection with Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy, coconspirators of the Gunpowder Plot to assassinate King James I, and a discussion of the work of many renowned scientists, mathematicians, and thinkers of the time.\n\nI learned much from the many enjoyable hours I spent reading this captivating book. In embarking on this well-crafted literary work you will soon develop a confident sense that either Harriot is with you in the room, or you are with him on the high seas on Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s Tiger.

Lienhard\n\nToday, England's Galileo. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them.\n\nW e get so focused on Galileo that we forget he was not working in a vacuum. For example, let's meet Thomas Harriot, born in 1560 in Oxford, England, four years before Galileo. Harriot would travel far before his and Galileo's paths touched.\n\nFirst, after he graduated from Oxford, Walter Ralegh hired him for his knowledge of maps and navigation. Ralegh took him off to Virginia and the Roanoke Colony. Harriot spent two years in the New World, where he became addicted to tobacco. His report, written after his re-turn, praised tobacco's healing powers. Naturally, he died at the early age of 61 from cancer of the nose.\n\nAfter his America adventure, up until the Gunpowder Plot, Harriot worked on problems of geometry, algebra, and optics. His patron was an amateur scientist, the Earl of Northumberland. When the Plot failed, he and the Earl were marched off to the Tower of London as suspects. Harriot was soon released for lack of evidence. The Earl languished there for seventeen years.\n\nBut the Earl had settled a house and pension on Harriot. So he continued his studies, now veering ever more strongly toward optics. Practical telescopes had appeared in the Netherlands in 1608 and the next year Harriot had one. Whether he'd bought it or built his own, we don't know; but he turned it upon the night skies.\n\nAristotle's science, now woven into Church doctrine, held that the Moon was a perfect crystalline substance. Harriot saw, and sketched, a jagged dividing line between lit and unlit portions of the moon. Just a few months later, Galileo built his own telescope and saw the same thing. It was a severe challenge to Aristotle.\n\nAt first, Galileo made better sketches. And, surprisingly, he got away with claiming the supposedly perfect Moon to be, in fact, rough. Galileo's troubles with the Church began later, when he agreed with Copernicus that the solar system is centered, not on the Earth, but on the Sun.\n\nHarriot had to be, and was, more cautious. Already under suspicion of being an unbeliever, he just recorded what he saw, without making any claims about the nature of the Moon. However, by 1611, he'd drawn the first detailed map of the Moon's surface.\n\nBoth Galileo and Harriot then called another heavenly object's perfection into question -- the Sun. Others had reported naked-eye observations of spots on the Sun. Then, late in the year 1610, both Harriot and Galileo used their telescopes to remove all doubt that the Sun was spotted.\n\nThere's so much more. Harriot identified Snell's law of optics twenty years before Snell did. He'd learned to speak Algonquin in America. It was he who showed that algebra could be done, not in clumsy words, but by manipulating symbols -- as we do today.\n\nWhy then should this brilliant polymath be so invisible? Perhaps it's because history itself is too large to hold. Maybe one Galileo is all we can tolerate in each era.\n\nI'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work.\n\n(Theme music)\n\nJ. A.

There he prepared, a navigational text which has not survived. He also encouraged Ralegh to follow in the footsteps of Sir Humphrey Gilbert in exploring and colonizing the New World. After Gilbert's death in 1583, Ralegh, with Harriot's help, prepared for an expedition to America. Although Ralegh hoped to command the 1584 voyage, Queen Elizabeth would not permit him to do so.

Unable to go himself, Ralegh named Harriot as his representative, charged with assessing the area's economic potential and describing the natives. John White was to make maps and to prepare drawings of the new land and its inhabitants. During the voyage Harriot made a number of observations. He tested dead reckoning against celestial navigation, noted the variation of the compass, and must have observed the eclipse of the sun on 19 April. Harriot also gathered plants as samples of the richness to be obtained by colonization. Once in America Harriot and White began their task of making a permanent record of the people and products of the new world. They noted commercially profitable plants and mineral resources. Harriot may have been in the group that explored the Chowan and Roanoke rivers and he may have spent part of the winter of 1585-1586 on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. His scientific knowledge impressed the Indians who learned to trust him.\n\nBy the summer of 1586, when Sir Francis Drake arrived, the colonists were in dire straits. Supplies were low and the Indians unfriendly. He gave them a ship; however, a storm forced it out to sea. He then offered the colonists passage home. In their haste to depart much of the work of Harriot and White was lost.\n\nAlthough Ralegh sent a second colony to Roanoke Island in 1587, he also had a colonial venture in Ireland where Harriot joined him and lived at the Abbey of Molanna near Youghal in County Waterford. There he prepared for publication the first English treatise on the new world. A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia, published in 1588. An important early account of America, it was included by Hakluyt in 1589 in his Principal navigations. The following year Theodor De Bry issued elaborate editions in Latin, English, French, and German adding plates of twenty-one of John White's drawings for which Harriot wrote captions. It established Harriot and White as leading authorities on America. Harriot helped to prepare the defenses for the invasion of the Spanish Armada. He developed a large collection of maps and ruttiers, worked with Emery Molyneaux in improving terrestrial globes, and assisted Gerard Mercator in developing accurate map projections. Harriot was one of the first modern scientists to use mathematics to analyze natural phenomena. His study of the piling of bullets let him to study the atomic structure of matter. His study of the trajectory of bullets led him to consider the laws of motion and falling bodies; thus, he performed the same experiments in England that Galileo conducted in Italy. This research led him to discover the law of refraction many years before the Dutchman Willebrord Snell. He worked on mirrors and lenses and may have made an independent discovery of a telescope.\n\nDuring this period Ralegh's fortunes declined. His colonization attempts in the new world and in Ireland were disastrous. His favor with Queen Elizabeth, source of his wealth, had been jeopardized by his marriage to one of her ladies in waiting. Though he continued to be close to Ralegh, Harriot found a new patron, Ralegh's longtime friend, Henry Percy, ninth Earl of Northumberland.\n\nIn 1595 Northumberland granted Harriot a lifetime interest in his land holdings at Brampton in county Durham and established him in a house adjacent to his residence, Syon House, Isleworth. By 1597, Harriot was listed as a regular pensioner at 80 pounds per annum-the same amount the Earl's younger brothers received. With the support of Ralegh and Northumberland, Harriot could live like a gentleman and pursue new scientific knowledge without worrying about income.\n\nThe accession of James I in 1603 was bad for Ralegh, who was soon charged with treason, convicted, and thrown into the Tower. Two years later, because of a remote connection with the Gunpowder Plot, Northumberland followed him there. Harriot, questioned about that plot and accused by James of casting the royal horoscope, was imprisoned for a time, but later released. He became the main link between Ralegh and Northumberland in the Tower and the outside world, assisted Ralegh in his writing of the Historie of the World, and instructed the Earl's heir in the elements of mathematics and navigation.\n\nBetween 1606 and 1608 Harriot was in correspondence with Johannes Kepler, comparing notes on their experiments in the refraction of light and giving the scientific explanation to the dispersion of light in the rainbow. By 1609 he possessed a six-power telescope and began a series of observations of the moon. He developed at least eight new telescopes (called perspective truncks) ranging in power from eight to fifty. Harriot observed the phases of Venus, which proved the validity of the Copernican cosmology; made more that thirty drawings of the moon, which led to the first telescopic moon map; and determined the time of quadrature so that he could calculate the distance of the moon from the sun. In December 1610, almost simultaneously with Galileo, he discovered sunspots. In October 1610 he first saw the satellites surrounding Jupiter; two years later he calculated the distances of the moons from the planet and computed the periods of their revolution. He also observed the comets of 1607 (Halley's comet) and 1618 and determined that they followed elliptical orbits.\n\nSuffering from cancer of the nose in his later years, Harriot died in 1621 at the home of Thomas Buckner, a mercer who lived on Threadneedle Street near the Royal Exchange. Buckner may have been the \"Thomas Bookener\" who was with Harriot on Roanoke Island in 1585-1586. Harriot was buried in the chancel of St. Christopher le Stocks, on the site of the present Bank of England. His grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666.\n\nCredits:\n\nText by John Shirley; edited by lebame houston and Wynne Dough"}], "Thomas Harriot was born around 1560.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Harriot", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot, also spelled Hariot, (born 1560, Oxford, Eng.\u2014died July 2, 1621, London), mathematician, astronomer, and investigator of the natural world.\n\nLittle is known of him before he received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Oxford in 1580. Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz All About Astronomy\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

His tentative date of birth is based on this information. Notes written at the time indicate that he was raised in Oxfordshire and his father was a commoner. Nothing else for certain is known about his early life. Hariot arrived at Oxford with exceptional talents in mathematics and the sciences, but at a time when these subjects were not particularly valued. This was beginning to change, however, as English adventurers began to recognize the connection between mathematics and the navigational arts necessary to further the nation\u2019s developing interests in colonization, piracy, privateering, and trade, especially in North America. At Oxford, Hariot met Richard Hakluyt (the younger), who went on to edit the influential Principall Navigations of the English Nation (1589), a polemic on behalf of future English colonization disguised as a history of past English successes. Hariot also probably knew Thomas Allen, an Oxford faculty member who collected the latest manuscripts, books, and instruments connected with mathematics and astronomy. After receiving a BA from Oxford in 1580, Hariot relocated to London, where his interest in applying mathematics and astronomy to questions of navigation brought him to the attention of Walter Raleigh. A favorite of Queen Elizabeth I, Raleigh had obtained permission to establish English colonies in North America. By 1583, Hariot was serving Raleigh at his London residence, Durham House, by focusing on open-sea navigation. The Portuguese and Spanish understood how to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the New World, but the English, with notable exceptions such as Sir Francis Drake, did not and were forced to hug the coasts. Before he could teach it, Hariot needed to master the subject himself, and he set about collecting, building, and learning to use standard navigational instruments, including the astrolabe, cross staff, and sextant. He studied the mathematics required to determine one\u2019s position in the open ocean, collected the best sea charts and maps, and learned the basics of astronomy necessary to navigate by the stars, moon, and sun. He then began lecturing to Raleigh\u2019s sea captains on these subjects in his room at Durham House and collected the knowledge in the now-lost Arcticon. Raleigh was planning to attempt a colony on the mid-Atlantic coast of North America and in 1584 sent a reconnaissance voyage that landed on Roanoke Island. There, commanders Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe met and returned to England with two Virginia Indians, Manteo and Wanchese. Recognizing that communication with the Indians would be crucial for a successful colony, Hariot worked with the two men and learned to speak their form of the Algonquian language. Hariot even developed his own phonetic alphabet, which allowed him to record the sounds of Algonquian words and to create a now-lost English-Algonquian dictionary. Hariot\u2019s work in this area made him one of the most advanced linguists of the day and recommended him as a member of Raleigh\u2019s Roanoke expedition in 1585.\n\nRoanoke and A briefe and true report A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia The Roanoke colonists were mostly military men, the most prominent exceptions being Hariot and the artist John White, who had served as expedition artist on one of Martin Frobisher\u2019s voyages to Greenland. The colonists arrived at Roanoke late in June 1585, but one of their ships ran aground and they lost much of their provisions. After the departure in August of the colony\u2019s two commanders, Sir Richard Grenville and Thomas Cavendish, Ralph Lane assumed governorship, and his relations with the local Indians were friendly at first. The situation deteriorated, however, as the Englishmen failed to find reliable sources of food, and when Sir Francis Drake arrived in June 1586, Lane decided to return the surviving colonists to England. The year had not been a waste for Hariot, though. With the help of Manteo and Wanchese, and in the company of John White, he had explored the area surrounding Roanoke and, with White, joined a party that sailed north to the Chesapeake Bay and up the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers, even encountering the Chesapeake Indians at their principal town of Skicoac. He and White used these travels to collaborate on the first accurate maps of the east coast of North America. Using angle-measuring tools to establish latitude and longitude, Hariot mapped out triangle-shaped areas and either recorded these angles in a notebook for later use or, while in the field, sketched these triangles directly onto a sheet of paper attached to a plane table. White, an accomplished painter and illustrator, then finished the maps. While some of the White-Hariot maps remained in manuscript form and did not receive wide circulation, others\u2014such as the small map of Roanoke Island and the large map of the entire Outer Banks region\u2014appeared in Theodor de Bry\u2019s illustrated edition of Hariot\u2019s A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia, becoming models for their time of accurate cartography in the New World. A briefe and true report was, perhaps, Hariot\u2019s most important contribution to England\u2019s colonization efforts. First published in 1588, it appeared again the next year as part of Richard Hakluyt (the younger\u2019s) Principall Navigations. Hakluyt then convinced de Bry to publish a third version as the initial volume in his America series. This last includes etchings of the White-Hariot maps as well as etchings based on White\u2019s watercolor portraits of Virginia Indians and scenes of Indian life. Published in English, French, German, and Latin, the de Bry version enjoyed a wide European audience. While the Report is sometimes considered scientific, it is more accurately viewed as commercial discourse. Throughout, Hariot argues four related points. First, the 1585 colony failed because many members of the colony were unprepared for the rigors of colonization. Although these men slandered the colony and its leaders upon arriving home, in Hariot\u2019s view Raleigh\u2019s colonization program should be allowed to continue. Second, the Roanokes and other Indian tribes are not to be feared by the English, who possess superior technology and culture. Third, the land in Virginia is abundant enough to provide future colonists with adequate food and building materials. And fourth, Virginia offers a less expensive source for a wide range of trade goods, including shipping supplies, dyes for the cloth industry, and wine.\n\nLater Years In 1595, Hariot received land from Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, to allow him to continue his scientific and mathematical work. Percy was imprisoned in 1605 for his connection to the Gunpowder Plot, an attempt on the life of King James I on behalf of greater freedom for English Catholics. Hariot\u2019s connection to Percy also landed him in prison, but only briefly. (Percy\u2019s younger brother George was one of the original Jamestown colonists.) Sir Walter Raleigh also ran afoul of the king and was beheaded in 1618. In the meantime, Hariot pursued his interest in astronomy. His unpublished notes on the appearance of Halley\u2019s Comet in 1607 were later used to accurately calculate its orbit. In 1609, he used a telescope of his own making to sketch the moon\u2014four months before the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei more famously accomplished the same feat. In 1610, he was the first to observe sunspots, and in 1611, he produced the first map of the moon. Hariot died in London on July 2, 1621, of cancer of the nose, probably caused by heavy tobacco use. A posthumous work, Artis Analyticae Praxis, published in 1631, helped to establish the English school of algebra."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/mathematics-biographies/thomas-harriot", "page_content": "Harriot, Thomas\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nReprinted in Major Problems in American Colonial History\n\nPublished in 1999\n\nEdited by Karen Ordahl Kupperman\n\n\"...some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men...\"\n\nE nglish exploration of North America began with the voyages of Italian-born navigator John Cabot (c.1450\u2013c.1499), who reached the region that eventually became known as New England in 1497. By 1502 fishermen were sending cod (a type of fish used for food) from Labrador, Canada, and New England to the port of Bristol, England. As early as 1508\u20131509 Cabot's son Sebastian (c. 1476\u20131557) had explored the Atlantic coast, but the English did not establish a permanent presence on the continent for another hundred years. Although Bartholomew Gosnold (d. 1607) briefly attempted to colonize New England in 1602, the English settlers were not prepared for life in the New World. Nevertheless published reports of Gosnold's venture described North America as \"the goodliest continent that ever we saw, promising more by farre than we any way did expect.\" Eager investors formed business ventures in the hopes of exploiting the bountiful resources in the wilderness.\n\nEnglish explorers were also trying to find a northwest passage, a natural waterway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, which would provide more direct access to Asia. In 1576 Martin Frobisher (c.1535\u20131594) undertook a series of voyages to Greenland to search for a water route, but each time his ships were stopped by ice in the Canadian Arctic. In 1578 English navigator Humphrey Gilbert (c.1539\u20131583) was given a patent (contract granting specific rights) by Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) to explore and colonize North America. On his second expedition, in 1585, he reached Newfoundland and claimed the region for England. Discovering some fishermen living on the site of present-day St. John's, Gilbert appointed himself governor of the settlement. According to a few scholars, Gilbert established the first English colony in the New World, although most historians give that distinction to Jamestown, Virginia (see \"The Founding of Jamestown\").\n\nDuring the return trip to England, Gilbert was lost at sea. The North America patent was then transferred to his half brother, Walter Raleigh (1554\u20131618), who secured the support of influential noblemen and navigators for another attempt to establish a settlement. In 1584 Raleigh appointed Philip Amadas (1550\u20131618) and Arthur Barlowe to head an expedition to explore the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. Reaching the outer banks of present-day North Carolina, the expedition party came in contact with the Roanokes, Native Americans who inhabited Roanoke Island and the surrounding region. After a brief stay the Englishmen took two Native Americans, Manteo and Wachese, back to England. Amadas and Barlowe gave enthusiastic reports about Roanoke, claiming the island offered favorable trading prospects and an excellent location for a military fort. Impressed by the success of the mission, Elizabeth I knighted Raleigh and named the region Virginia in honor of herself (she was called the \"Virgin Queen\" because she refused to marry).\n\nRaleigh immediately organized a venture to establish a permanent colony at Roanoke. He assembled five ships and two boats, which he placed under the command of English navigator Richard Grenville (1542\u20131591). Among the party of 108 men\u2014mainly soldiers and servants\u2014was Thomas Harriot (1560\u20131621), a mathematician and Raleigh's tutor, who was given the task of surveying Virginia. (Surveying is a branch of mathematics that involves determining the area of any portion of the Earth's surface, the lengths and directions of bounding lines, and the contour of the surface.) Manteo and Wachese were to serve as interpreters, and artist John White (?\u20131593) planned to make drawings of animal and plant life in North America. Upon arriving at Roanoke in July 1585, the expedition got off to a bad start. First, Grenville determined that the island was not appropriate for a permanent military base. Then he ordered the burning of a Native American village when he discovered a silver cup was missing.\n\nLater the next month Grenville departed Roanoke for the Caribbean. Before leaving he placed colonist Ralph Lane (1530\u20131603) in charge of one hundred men. He then ordered the men to find a better site for the settlement and construct a fort and other buildings. In spite of Grenville's earlier aggression toward the Native Americans, the Englishmen had a good relationship with the Roanoke (also called Wiroan) people and their chief, Wingina. Lane freely explored the area, White sketched plants and animals, and Harriot conducted a detailed survey of the land. Harriot also recorded his observations of Native American life, language, and customs. As spring approached, the colonists ran out of food, so Lane took the drastic step of demanding corn from Wingina. Although the chief offered some land and seeds, Lane over-looked his generosity and concluded that the Native Americans were planning an attack. Lane therefore decided to strike first, and in the conflict Wingina and several of his people were killed.\n\nThe murder of Wingina and other Roanokes only made the food shortage at Roanoke worse because neighboring Native American groups avoided contact with the Europeans. The struggling colony was in desperate straits by June 1586, when English seaman Francis Drake (1540?\u20131596) paid a surprise visit on his way back from the Caribbean. Anxious to go home, all but three of the settlers boarded Drake's ship and set sail for England. About a year after their return Harriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.\n\nThings to Remember While Reading A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia:\n\nHarriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia primarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys.\n\nprimarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys. When the English initially organized the Roanoke expeditions they were motivated by the prospect of making profits on precious metals and trade in North America. Nevertheless, like the Spanish and French, they were also intent on converting Native American \"savages\" to Christianity (see \"New Mexico Indians Eager for Conversion\" and \"Jolliet and Marquette Explore the Mississippi\"). Note Harriot's statement that \"Some religion they [Native Americans] have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\" Later he observed that the Native Americans kept no written records. This was because they had a rich oral tradition, whereby master storytellers passed myths and legends down from generation to generation (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\").\n\nHarriot commented that \"some of the people [the Wiroans] could not tell whether to think us gods or men.\" Compare the Wiroans' confusion to the reactions of the Tlingits of Southeast Alaska (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\") and the Tainos in the Caribbean (see \"Christopher Columbus Reports to Ferdinand and Isabella\") upon meeting Europeans for the first time.\n\nHistorians maintain that Harriot showed unusual insight into problems that would eventually develop between Native Americans and European colonists. For instance, he wrote that native peoples \"are not to be feared, but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\" Later he observed, \"If there fall out any wars between us & them,\" the English would have \"advantages against them in so many manner of ways.\"\n\nHarriot described the friendly relations the English enjoyed with Wingina and the Wiroans. Although the situation changed drastically after Lane initiated the attack that resulted in the deaths of the chief and several other Wiroans.\n\nThe Wiroans died in great numbers after the Englishmen visited their towns, a \"marvelous accident\" that puzzled both Harriot and the Wiroans. Since none of the Englishmen were stricken, the deaths were undoubtedly caused by diseases they had carried with them from Europe. Disease was a major factor in the near-extermination of the Native American population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nKeep in mind that Harriot wrote A Brief and True Report for a sixteenth-century audience. Since his language and writing style are unfamiliar to twentieth-century readers, explanatory notes are included in the following excerpts from the document.\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nHarriot opened his report with a detailed description of the appearance and customs of Native Americans, whom he called \"natural inhabitants.\" He remarked that native peoples did not have sophisticated tools, nor did they have any weapons except bows and arrows for fighting against the English settlers (\"to offend us withal\"):\n\nIt resteth I [I pause to] speak a word or two of the natural inhabitants, their natures and manners, . . as that you know, how that they in respect of troubling our inhabiting and planting, are not to be feared, [they pose no threat to our settlement] but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\n\nThey are a people clothed with loosemantles made of Deer skins, & aprons of the same round about their middles; all else naked; . . having no edge tools or weapons of iron or steel to offend us withal, neither know they how to make any: those weapons that they have,\n\nMantles\n\nMantles: Cloaks\n\nare only bows made ofWitch hazel, & arrows of reeds, flat edgedtruncheons also of wood about a yard long, neither have they anything to defend themselves but targets made of barks, and somearmours made of stickswickered together with thread. . . .\n\nHarriot observed that the Native Americans admired English customs (\"our manner of knowledges and crafts\"), which they found superior to their own. Consequently they wanted to please and cooperate with the English (\"and have greater respect for pleasing and obeying us\"). He went on to describe Native Americans' wars with one another, observing that battle strategy (\"set battles\") was rare, except when there happened to be (\"it fall out\") fighting in the forest. At this point Harriot made his prediction about the Native Americans' lack of preparation for wars with Europeans. Since they could not defend themselves against superior battle plans and weaponry, they could be expected to run away from confrontation. Yet he praised their \"excellence of wit,\" and he predicted that the English could eventually civilize them and convert them to Christianity (the \"true religion\"):\n\nTheir manner of wars amongst themselves is either by sudden surprising one another most commonly about the dawning of the day, or moonlight, or else byambushes, or some subtle devices [secretive methods]. Set battles are very rare, except it fall out where there are many trees, where either part may have some hope of defence, after the delivery of every arrow, in leaping behind some [tree] or other.\n\nIf there fall out any wars between us & them, what their fight is likely to be, we having advantages against them so many manner of ways, as by our discipline, our strange weapons and devices else [other devices], especially byordinance great and small, it may be easily imagined; by the experience we have had in some places, the turning up of their heels against us in running away was their best defence. In respect of us they are a people poor, and for want of skill and judgment in the knowledge and use of our things, do esteem ourtrifles before things of greater value: Notwithstanding in their proper manner considering the want of such means as we have [in spite of not having our advantages], they seem veryingenious; For although they have no such tools, nor any such crafts, sciences and arts as we. . . they should desire our friendships & love, and have the greater respect for pleasing and obeying us. Whereby may be hoped if means of good government be used, [if we govern them properly] that they may in short time be brought to civility and embracing of true religion.\n\nWitch hazel\n\nWitch hazel: Shrub or tree with slender-petaled yellow flowers borne in late fall or early spring\n\nTruncheons\n\nTruncheons: Clubs\n\nArmours\n\nArmours: Hand-held weapons\n\nWickered\n\nWickered: Woven\n\nAmbushes\n\nAmbushes: Surprise attacks\n\nOrdinance\n\nOrdinance: Weapons and ammunition\n\nTrifles\n\nTrifles: Things of little value\n\nIngenious\n\nIngenious: Clever, resourceful\n\nHarriot reported that the Native Americans believed in an eternal god who created other gods. Nevertheless he dismissed their views as simply \"some religion\" that was \"far from the truth\" and would make the task of conversion easier for the English. Notice that Native Americans, like Christians, believed in immortality, heaven, and hell:\n\nSome religion they have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\n\nThey believe that there are many Gods which they call Mont\u00f3ac, but of different sorts and degrees; one only chief and great God, which hath been from all eternity. Who as they affirm when he purposed to make the world, made first other gods of a principal order to be as means and instruments to be used in the creation and government to follow; and after the Sun, Moon, and Stars as petty gods. . . . First they say were made waters, out of which by the gods was made all diversity of creatures that are visible or invisible.\n\nFor mankind they say a woman was made first, which by the working of one of the gods, conceived and brought forth children: And in such sort [in this manner] they say they had their beginning. But how many years or ages have passed since, they say they can make no relation, having no letters nor other such means as we to keep records of the particularities of times past, but only tradition from father to son. . . .\n\nThey believe also theimmortality of the soul, that after this life as soon as the soul is departed from the body, according to the works it hath done, it is either carried to heaven thehabitacle of gods, there to enjoy perpetual bliss and happiness, or else to a great pit or hole, which they think to be in the furthest parts of their part of the world toward the sunset, there to burn continually: the place they call Popogusso. . . .\n\nImmortality\n\nImmortality: The state of being free from death\n\nHabitacle\n\nHabitacle: Dwelling place\n\nIn this final excerpt Harriot described the Wiroans' reactions to Christianity. They accepted the Englishmen's faith, eventually rejecting their own. They grew to fear the Christian God. For instance, the Wiroans blamed illness or crop failure on the wrath of the Englishmen's god. In fact, whenever the Englishmen encountered hostility or resentment in Native American villages, the inhabitants began dying within a few days after they left. Both Harriot and the Wiroans seemed to make a connection between the mysterious deaths and offenses toward the Englishmen. The Wiroans therefore concluded that the Englishmen were gods, especially since they had no women with them. (The earliest Virginia expeditions were comprised only of men.) The true reason for the illnesses, however, was that the Native Americans were not immune to the diseases that the Europeans often carried.\n\nWiroans with whom we dwelt called Wingina, and many of his people would be glad many times to be with us at our prayers, and many times call upon us both in his own town, as also in others whither he sometimes accompanied us, to pray and singPsalms; hoping thereby to be partaker of the same effects which we by that means also expected [hoping to gain the same benefits from our religion].\n\nTwice this Wiroans [Wingina] was sogrievously sick that he was like to die, and as he laylanguishing, doubting of any help by his own priests, and thinking he was in such danger for offending [because he had offended] us and thereby our god, sent for some of us to pray and be a means [connection] to our God that it would please him either that he [Wingina] might live, or after death dwell with him [God] in bliss, so likewise were the requests of many others in the like case.\n\nOn a time also when their corn began to wither by reason of adrought which happened extraordinarily, fearing [they feared] that it had come to pass by reason that in something they had displeased us, many would come to us & desire us to pray to our God of England, that he would preserve their corn, promising that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruit.\n\nThere could at no time happen any strange sickness, losses, hurts, or any other cross [misfortune] unto them, but that they wouldimpute to us the cause or means thereof for offending or not pleasing us. . . .\n\nPsalms\n\nPsalms: A book in the Old Testament containing sacred songs and poems\n\nGrievously\n\nGrievously: Terribly\n\nLanguishing\n\nLanguishing: Suffering\n\nDrought\n\nDrought: A period of prolonged dryness that causes extensive damage to crops or prevents their successful growth\n\nImpute\n\nImpute: Attribute\n\nThere was no town where we had any subtle device practiced against us [the inhabitants showed hostility], we leaving it unpunished or not revenged (because we sought by all means possible to win them by gentleness) but that within a few days after our departure from every such town, the people began to die very fast, and many in short space; in some towns about twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, & in one six score [one hundred twenty], which in truth was very many in respect of their numbers. This happened in no place that we could learn but where we had been where they used some practice against us, and after such time; The disease also was sostrange, that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; the like by report of the oldest men in the country never happened before, time out of mind. A thing specially observed by us, as also by the natural inhabitants themselves. . . .\n\nThis marvelous accident in all the country wrought so strange opinions of us, that some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men . . . because . . . there was no man of ours known to die, or that was especially sick: they noted also that we had no women among us, neither that we did care for any of theirs.\n\nSome therefore were of opinion that we were not born of women, and therefore notmortal, but that we were men of an old generation many years past then risen again to immortality.\n\nMortal\n\nMortal: Human\n\nWhat happened next . . .\n\nSoon after the departure of the colonists Grenville returned to Roanoke with a new load of supplies and six hundred additional men. He found the colony deserted\u2014no one knows what happened to the three men who had remained on the island. Eventually Grenville decided to return to England and recruit more settlers. He left fifteen men at Roanoke to plant crops and build dwellings in preparation for the new colonists. By that time, however, Raleigh had lost interest in colonizing Virginia. John White, the artist who accompanied Grenville in 1585, therefore took over the project and acquired the backing of several investors for another expedition.\n\nWhite's plan was to start a new colony called the City of Raleigh, which would be located north of Roanoke in the Chesapeake Bay area. White would be the governor of the new colony. Since this settlement would be devoted to families and farming instead of military defense, the party included seventeen women, nine children, and ninety-four men. When the ships reached North America in late 1587, the pilot refused to go any farther than Roanoke. Forced to remain at the old settlement, the colonists discovered that the fifteen men left by Grenville were gone, possibly driven out by Native Americans. Consequently crops had not been planted and there was no suitable housing. The only solution was for White to go back to England for more supplies and additional men. Before departing he told the colonists to move to another location if they had any problems and to leave a message telling him where to find them.\n\nThe \"lost\" colony\n\nAfter a three-year absence John White returned from England in 1591, only to find Roanoke deserted. The fate of the inhabitants of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. These excerpts from White's journal describe what he found at the site.\n\nAugust 17 . . . we espied [spied] toward the north end of the island the light of a great fire through the woods, to which we presently rode. When we came right over against it, we let fall our grapnel [anchor] near the shore and sounded with a trumpet a call, and afterwards many familiar English tunes of songs, and called to them friendly. But we had no answer. We therefore landed at daybreak, and coming to the fire, we found the grass and sundry [numerous] rotten trees burned about the place.... In all this way we saw in the sand the print of the savages' feet of two or three sorts trodden the night, and as we entered up the sandy bank, upon a tree, in the very brow thereof, were curiously carved these fair Roman letters CRO; which letters presently we knew to signify the place where I should find the planters seated, according to a secret token agreed upon between them and me at my last departure from them, which was that they should not fail to write or carve on the tree or posts of the doors the name of the place where they should be seated; for at my coming away they were prepared to remove from Roanoke 50 miles in the main. Therefore at my departure from them in 1587 I willed them that if they should happen to be distressed in any of those places, that then they should carve over the letters or name a cross; but we found no such sign of distress. And having well considered of this, we passed towards the place where they were left in sundry houses, but we found the houses taken down, and the place very strongly enclosed with a high palisade [fence] of great trees . . . and one of the chief trees or posts at the right side of the entrance had the bark taken off, and five foot from the ground in fair capital letters was graven [carved] CROATOAN without any cross or sign of distress. . . . This could be no other but the deed of the savages our enemies.\n\nReprinted in: Colbert, David, ed. Eyewitness to America. New York: Pantheon Books, 1997, pp. 11\u201312.\n\nIn the meantime, war had been brewing between England and Spain. When the conflict erupted in 1588\u2014as White was about to sail from England back to North America\u2014contact between England and Roanoke was cut off. In 1591, after the English defeated the Spanish Armada, White was finally able to return to Roanoke. By that time the settlers had all vanished without a trace, and White found only two clues to their whereabouts: the word \"Croatan\" carved on a fence post and the letters \"Cro\" etched into a tree trunk. The English suspected that the colonists' disappearance was somehow linked with the Croatoans, a friendly Native American tribe who lived on Croatoan Island about fifty miles south of Roanoke.\n\nThe Roanoke settlers were never found, and the fate of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. Numerous theories about their disappearance have evolved over the centuries. They could have died as the result of a natural disaster such as disease, starvation, hurricane, flood, or tornado. They could have tried to return to England and their ship sank at sea. More outlandish explanations include pirates coming ashore and kidnapping all the inhabitants. The most reassuring conclusion is that the colonists joined a nearby Native American tribe, with whom they intermarried and prospered.\n\nAfter the dismal failure of the Roanoke colony the English made no other attempts to colonize North America for nearly twenty years. They realized they had neither the skills nor the money to establish permanent settlements in a strange and hostile land. One modern historian has noted that venturing into the wilderness of North America in the sixteenth century was similar to landing on the moon in the twentieth century. Moreover, the English, like the Spanish, were primarily interested in conquering Native American empires that would yield instant wealth with such treasures as precious metals and jewelry. Yet by the late 1590s Europeans had seized most of the available riches in the New World.\n\nDid you know . . .\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia was immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times.\n\nwas immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times. Harriot may have performed some of the earliest scientific experiments in North America. In addition to conducting a survey of Virginia, he helped another member of the 1585 expedition, German scientist Joachim Ganz, search for copper and other precious metals. Archaeologists excavating the Roanoke site have found equipment that Harriot and Ganz probably used to test metals and ores.\n\nJohn White was the grandfather of Virginia Dare (1587\u2013?), the first European reported to be born in America. Nine days before White's departure from Roanoke, Virginia was born to his daughter Eleanor and his son-in-law Ananais Dare. All three Dares disappeared with the other Roanoke colonists, and White died without ever knowing what happened to his family.\n\nEvidence discovered in 1998 has led historians to speculate that the Roanoke colonists may have been driven out by a drought (a period of prolonged dryness that causes damage to crops). Scientists studying the rings of a bald cypress in southeastern Virginia found that a seven-year drought was occurring at the same time the second group of settlers arrived at Roanoke in 1587. In fact, it was the most severe period of dryness in more than eight hundred years. Thus a food shortage could have forced the colonists to seek another location for their community.\n\nFor more information\n\n\"The Cabot Dilemma: John Cabot's 1497 Voyage & the Limits of Historiography\" in Documents Relevant to the United States Before 1700.http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/9061/USA/colonial/bef1700.html Available September 30, 1999.\n\nCampbell, Elizabeth A.

He is described by Fauvel and Goulding as \"the greatest mathematician that Oxford has produced\".\n\n\"We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on Friday 20 December 1577 he matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to be 1560 and we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been found (although a number of possible relatives have been identified).\"\n\nSources"}, {"url": "http://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=thomas-harriot", "page_content": "A portrait believed to be of Thomas Harriot. 1602. (University of Oxford; source of image: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThomas Harriot (c.1560\u20131621)\n\nThomas Harriot was born around 1560 in Oxfordshire, possibly in the city of Oxford. Little is known about his family background, except that his father was a commoner and that he had a married sister; he did not marry himself.\n\nIn December 1577, Harriot matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, and received the degree of BA at Easter, 1580. Having soon thereafter acquired a reputation for being skilled mathematically, he was employed by Sir Walter Raleigh (1552/4\u20131618) from at least 1584 to teach him and his sea captains the science of navigation in preparation for Raleigh\u2019s enterprise to establish a settlement in America. Harriot himself travelled to the New World and was a member of the short-lived colony on Roanoke Island, Virginia from June 1685 until his return to England with Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540\u20131596) the following year. He had previously studied the Algonquin language with two native Americans who had been brought over to England in 1584, and used this knowledge to study the social and religious customs of the native people he encountered in Virginia along with the territory\u2019s flora and fauna. After his return, Harriot published, in 1588, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found land of Virginia, which can be largely seen as a defence of Raleigh\u2019s colonial enterprise.\n\nFrom at least 1591 onwards, Harriot became an active member of the scientific circle around Henry Percy (1564\u20131632), ninth earl of Northumberland, conducting astronomical observations and optical experiments, partly aimed at improving navigational techniques. After Raleigh\u2019s star began to wane, Percy took on the role of being Harriot\u2019s patron. He granted Harriot rents from an estate in county Durham and gave him the use of a house on the grounds of Syon House, Isleworth. For his part, Harriot built up and maintained a substantial library and carried out an extensive range of scientific experiments and theoretical investigations on physical, chemical, astronomical, and other topics. Astronomically, he anticipated Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) in recognizing that the orbits of the planets were not circular. However, as he came to recognize himself, it was particularly in mathematics that Harriot excelled, making notable innovations and discoveries in the field of algebra, where he was able to build on the achievements of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603). Unfortunately, none of his mathematical papers were published during his lifetime, while his most complete work, the posthumously-published Artis analyticae praxis (1631) was disfigured through the poor editing of Walter Warner (1563\u20131643).\n\nBoth of Harriot\u2019s erstwhile patrons met with ill-fortune. Raleigh was suspected of involvement with a plot to kill King James and incarcerated at the Tower before eventually being beheaded in 1618. Rumours that Percy had known of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 led to him likewise being imprisoned at the Tower until 1621. While there, he was regularly visited by the three most accomplished members of his circle, notably Nathaniel Torperley (1564\u20131632), Robert Hues (1553\u20131632), and Harriot, who kept him abreast of their continuing researches.\n\nA malicious tumour led to Harriot\u2019s death in the house of a friend in Threadneedle Street, London, on 2 July 1621, a month before Percy\u2019s release from the Tower. He was buried in the nearby church of St Christopher le Stocks, which was later destroyed in the Great Fire. His extensive scientific papers, long feared lost, were rediscovered at Petworth House, Sussex, in the late eighteenth century; the bulk of them have in recent years been deposited in the British Library by Lord Egremont."}, {"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/Thomas-Harriot/325789", "page_content": "(1560\u20131621). English mathematician, astronomer, and natural scientist Thomas Harriot introduced some of the symbols used in algebra today. He published very little but left thousands of pages of manuscripts, which scholars did not closely study until the mid-20th century.\n\nHarriot was born in 1560 in Oxford, England. He lived at Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s home in London, England\u2014Durham House\u2014which was a center for Raleigh\u2019s preparations to sponsor a colony on Roanoke Island in \u201cVirginia\u201d (now in North Carolina). Harriot was deeply involved. While living at Durham House, he worked out mathematical solutions to various navigational problems, devised navigational instruments, helped organize and raise funds for the expeditions, and kept Raleigh\u2019s accounts. He may have gone on the first expedition Raleigh sent to Roanoke Island in 1584. Harriott was certainly on the next one, from April 1585 to July 1586, which he described in 1588 in A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\u2014Harriot\u2019s only book published in his lifetime. By 1589 Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nIn the 1590s the political tide in England began to turn against Raleigh. Harriot found a new patron in Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland, who gave him an estate in Durham, England, in 1595. Percy also gave Harriot the use of a house near London as a residence and scientific laboratory for his studies in astronomy, meteorology, optics, chemistry, and mathematics. Harriot applied mathematics to the bending of light and to the path of a cannonball shot from a gun (ballistics). He was the first to discover the principle of the refraction of light now called Snell\u2019s law, which the Dutch scientist Willebrord Snell discovered independently 20 years after Harriot.\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603, Raleigh was arrested and charged with treason. In the course of his trial, both he and Harriot were accused of atheism, although there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings to substantiate the charge. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, Harriot was arrested on suspicion of having cast King James\u2019s horoscope; his patron, Percy, was also arrested. Harriot was soon released, but Percy remained in the Tower of London until 1621.\n\nWith both of his former patrons in prison, Harriot returned his attention to his studies of optics and astronomy. His reputation reached the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who initiated an exchange of letters. Harriot observed Halley\u2019s comet and, like his Italian contemporary Galileo, used a telescope to observe sunspots and the moons of Jupiter. In 1609 and 1610 Harriot drew sketches of the Moon as viewed through a telescope.\n\nHarriot\u2019s last eight years were marred by having cancer of the nose and by Raleigh\u2019s execution, which Harriot was present to witness. Harriot died in London on July 2, 1621. His Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (\u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d) was published posthumously in 1631. Both the editor and Harriot himself introduced some of the mathematical symbols used in algebra today. Harriot was among the first to solve mathematical equations involving negative and complex roots and imaginary numbers."}, {"url": "https://plus.maths.org/content/thomas-harriot-lost-pioneer", "page_content": "It's International Year of Astronomy and all eyes are on Galileo Galilei, whose astronomical observations 400 years ago revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. But few people know that Galileo wasn't the first to build a telescope and turn it on the stars. That honour falls to a little-known mathematician called Thomas Harriot, who might have become a household name, had he bothered to publish his results. This article is a tour of his work.\n\nThis portrait was once believed to be of Thomas Harriot, but modern evidence indicates that it is probably not him.\n\nWhen the prestigious Royal Society was established in 1660, it quickly launched a seven year search for the lost papers of Thomas Harriot, a London mathematician and empirical scientist who had died decades before. The quest failed, but when the papers finally came to light a century later, they included a system of symbolic algebra, workable binary numbers, the sine law of refraction and detailed telescopic observations of the Moon and sunspots: all mathematical and scientific firsts. While Harriot's intellectual achievements had been gathering dust, much of his pioneering work was discovered by others, so his name never made it into the history books.\n\nWe know little of Thomas Harriot's background and early life and we can't even be sure of what he looked like \u2014 the authenticity of the portrait on the right is disputed. He was born around 1560, four years before Galileo and a lifetime ahead of Newton. Soon after graduating from Oxford University in 1580, he was living and working in the London home of Walter Raleigh, then one of Queen Elizabeth's favoured courtiers. Acting as Raleigh's accountant, Harriot tutored sea captains in navigation and gained early fame as an anthropologist and ethnographer.\n\nFinding his way in the world\n\nAt Raleigh's instruction, the twenty-five year old Harriot spent a year in present-day North Carolina on the first, and ill-fated, expedition to set up a New World British colony, on Roanoke Island. Charged with mapping and surveying the new country, Harriot also documented the area's natural history and the customs of the local Algonquin peoples. He viewed the indigenous inhabitants as rightful owners of their land and was probably the first Englishman to communicate with them in their own language, even inventing an alphabet to represent their unique range of linguistic sounds. On his return home he published A briefe and true account of the new found land of Virginia with John White, the first English-language publication on the Americas and one that's still studied on early American literature courses. Harriot also promoted the new habit of smoking tobacco, recommending it as it \"purgeth superfluous fleame and ... openeth all the pores and passages of the body\".\n\nMercator's projection enlarges areas close to the poles. The red circles indicate the level of distortion. The spacing between the lines of latitude increases as you move towards the poles. Image courtesy Stefan Kuhn.\n\nDuring his time with Raleigh, Harriot focused his mathematical efforts on navigational matters. The map of the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator was already revolutionising marine navigation, and even today is still the most familiar representation of our world. The Mercator projection was so valuable to marine navigation because it transforms lines of constant bearing on the surface of the Earth (the paths traced out when following a fixed direction as given by a compass) into straight line segments on the map. But like all projections of the spherical Earth onto a two-dimensional map, the Mercator projection comes with some distortion, in this case enlarging the areas near the poles. A measure of this distortion is the spacing between the lines of latitude, which increases towards the poles.\n\nUnfortunately, Mercator had not explained how to calculate the spacing of the lines of latitude on his chart, leaving future map makers none the wiser about the exact distortion of dimensions. In the 1580s Harriot gave a mathematical explanation of the progressive increase of distances between them, and some years later he computed tables of these meridional parts. It was left to Harriot's contemporary, English Cartographer Edward Wright, however, to publish the first table of latitudes in 1599. Some years later the Scottish mathematician John Napier invented the logarithm, enabling us to express the height on the map of a line of latitude with angle on the globe as\n\nGetting light right\n\nwhereis the radius of the Earth, and the equator is given by the line\n\nWhen Raleigh fell out of favour with the Queen for secretly marrying one of her ladies-in-waiting, he was imprisoned in the Tower and Harriot fell under the patronage of Sir Henry Percy, the ninth Earl of Northumberland. Known as the \"wizard\" earl for his free-thinking interest in science, Northumberland provided Harriot with a handsome pension of \u00a380 a year, spacious rooms at his London home, Syon House (where Harriot lived for over twenty years) and the services of a talented technical assistant. Harriot was now free to pursue a range of scientific interests, but his focus remained on the mathematics relating to seafaring, navigation, surveying and astronomy.\n\nThe law of refraction relates the angle at which a ray of light meets the medium (\u03b8 1 ) to the angle of refraction (\u03b8 2 ).\n\nInspired by his own observations at sea, he developed techniques for correcting errors in navigational tools such as the cross staff, an instrument used to determine a ship's latitude by measuring the altitude of the Sun or pole star. His consideration of the effect of the refraction of light in the atmosphere on these observations may have been what drove him to embark on a systematic experimental and mathematical study of how light is bent by different media.\n\nFrom the updated table he scrawled in a published book on optics, it's probable these experiments resulted in Harriot calculating the sine law of refraction, which relates the angle at which a ray of light hits the surface of a medium to the angle by which the ray is bent by the medium. Although the law, stated below, had already been mentioned in a tenth century manuscript by the Arab mathematician Ibn Sahl, Harriot and his contemporaries were unaware of this. Harriot's notes do not state the law explicitly, but the table of angles he derived is too exact to be a result of experiment. His faith in the power of mathematics to describe physical laws must have encouraged him to interpret the results geometrically, and he must have been aware that the ratio of the sines of the two angles remains constant. In fact, it is equal to the ratio of the speed at which light travels through air and the speed at which light travels through the medium:\n\nWith applications for lens design, this relationship would have been of interest for Harriot's later work developing perspective trunckes or telescopes. The Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius shared his own discovery of the sine law with friends twenty years after Harriot's work but, though the law is now named after Snellius (also called Snell), it was actually Ren\u00e9 Descartes who formally published it another decade later.\n\nBallistics, cannonballs and fireworks\n\nWith seafaring comes warfare, and in the early 17th century Harriot correctly depicted the path of a projectile as a tilted parabola, where the descending segment is shorter and steeper than the ascending one, by taking into account gravity acting on the vertical component and air resistance on the horizontal. Galileo experimented with projectiles a few years later, but the parabolic theory was actually published by Bonaventura Cavalieri, one of Galileo's disciples.\n\nOn November 4th 1605, Harriot had the misfortune to dine at Syon with his patron, Northumberland, and a distant cousin of the Earl, Thomas Percy, who turned out to be a key conspirator in the gunpowder plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Three days later, Percy was dead and both Northumberland and Harriot were arrested. Harriot spent a month in the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, accused by King James I, who distrusted mathematicians as astrologers and magicians, of secretly casting a horoscope on him. Harriot wrote to the Privy Council protesting his innocence, denying any meddling in matters of state and describing himself as \"contented with a private life for the love of learning that I may study freely.\" He was released a few weeks later. Northumberland was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Tower, where Harriot regularly visited both him and Raleigh, now sentenced to death for high treason.\n\nThe face-centred cubic packing (left) consists of layers of spheres. Each layer is positioned so that the spheres rest on the 'holes' of the layer below. This arrangement is not unique, the hexagonal close packing (right) is constructed in a similar way and is equally efficient.\n\nHarriot remained at Syon and soon entered into correspondence with the German mathematician Johannes Kepler, discussing, among other things, the problem of stacking spheres. Harriot had previously drawn up charts showing the ground space needed to store stacks of cannonballs on board Raleigh's ships, and had become intrigued by the question of how to stack the balls most efficiently. This was no doubt the prompter for Kepler's suggestion in 1611 that the most efficient arrangements of equally sized spheres in space are given by the so-called face-centred cubic packing and the hexagonal close packing, shown in the image on the left. This fact is familiar to greengrocers around the world, but as a mathematical statement that requires proof it turned out to be fiendishly difficult. It wasn't until nearly 400 years later, in 1998, that the mathematician Thomas Hales announced a proof which relied on a vast number of computer calculations. No human could possibly check all the calculations within a lifetime, so the validity of the proof has remained controversial to this day. (You can find out more about Kepler's conjecture and the controversy in the Plus article Welcome to the maths lab.)\n\nThe two mathematicians also discussed Harriot's work on rainbows and his investigation of refraction. Harriot thought that a light ray hitting the surface of a transparent medium was partially reflected and partially refracted because the medium contained solid parts, akin to atoms (which resist the ray), and empty spaces (which the rays penetrate). He even invited Kepler to imagine entering into an atom with him to see what wonders they would find in \"Nature's House\". To Harriot's amazement, Kepler declined.\n\nPerhaps inspired by the idea of matter being comprised by either points or empty space, Harriot developed a binary number system almost a century before the German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, who is usually credited with being the first to describe the modern binary number system, which underlies the workings of all our computers. Harriot manipulated the numbers by addition, subtraction and multiplication. His papers even show him experimenting with ternary, quaternary, quinternary and higher number systems.\n\nReaching for the stars and venturing into abstraction\n\nBy the summer of 1609, Harriot had acquired a magnifying \"truncke\" or telescope, which could magnify objects by a factor of six. His observations of the moon are the first ever recorded astronomical observations using a telescope. As ever, he didn't publish, and Galileo gained the credit when he made his own observations six months later. Harriot used telescopes which could magnify up to a factor of 32 to draw detailed lunar maps, follow Jupiter's satellites, track comets and catalogue nearly 500 sunspot observations.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope: Astronomy has come a long way since the time of Harriot. Image courtesy NASA.\n\nDespite the impressive list of achievements above, Harriot is actually best-known for his work in algebra and, in his will, it was only his mathematical papers that he requested be collected and published. There is much debate about how important Harriot's algebraic work was, mostly due to the disorganised structure of his papers and the badly edited collection produced after his death. But his symbolic system of algebra, which dispensed with wordy descriptions and represented unknowns with letters and operations with symbols, could be manipulated independently from what it represented, according to its own rules and axioms. If this seems familiar to anyone who's studied algebra at school, it is. Like his earlier representation of the Algonquin language, Harriot's visual symbolism made mathematics accessible in a totally new way.\n\nHarriot wasn't just responsible for developing new representations of mathematics, though. He tackled equations by carrying all the terms containing a power of the unknown to the left side of the equation, with the constant term on the right. He used algebraic zero and the concepts of greater than and less than, expressing them as symbols.He worked on cubic equations, coming up with symbolic solutions and noting that a cubic with roots , and factorises as\n\nAnd he derived negative and even complex roots of equations, at a time when others viewed these as \"impossible\".\n\nFor the last eight years of his life, Harriot was plagued by a cancerous tumour on his nostril, almost certainly caused by smoking. He died aged 61 while visiting the City of London. His grave in the Chancel of St Christopher le Stocks was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 but a modern plaque stands on the site, now part of the Bank of England.\n\nPublish or perish?\n\nIn accordance with his will, the Artis Analyticae Praxis, a collection of Harriot's work on the theory of equations and the solution of numerical polynomial equations, was published ten years after his death. His reputation for many years relied on this edited volume which included many mistakes and discrepancies from his original papers.\n\nWhy didn't he publish any of the 7000 manuscript pages in his lifetime? No one is quite sure. Perhaps the security of his annual pension meant he had no need to establish a reputation for himself. Perhaps he considered his discoveries the property of his patrons. Perhaps he just wasn't interested. His lifelong friend, Sir William Lower, wrote in 1610 that \"too great reservedness hath rob'd you of those glories\" and urged Harriot to let his \"countrie and frinds injoye the comforts they would have in the true and greate honor you would purchase your selfe by publishing some of your choise works\", but to no avail.\n\nWhen Harriot's papers were finally unearthed in the late 18th century, among the stable accounts of Northumberland's country home, Petworth House in Sussex, they were disorganised and muddled, with few descriptions to help interpret them. Many were obviously written for Harriot's own personal entertainment, including acrostics, anagrams, hieroglyphics and puzzles. In among his major investigations were diversions to calculate the optimum size for the mast of a ship, the maximum supportable population of the world and the gaseous yield of a burning candle, as well as plans for the redesign of Syon House's drainage systems.\n\nThe German astronomer who discovered the papers, Frans Xavier Zach, was quick to promote Harriot's great work to the world, but there is still much debate about the level of his achievements. While descriptions of Harriot as an English Galileo or Kepler may be misplaced, there is no doubt that he committed his life to finding mathematical descriptions of observations of the natural world and applied himself to an amazingly broad range of practical problems. If he had published in his day, perhaps his contribution could have been greater, and his name would be much more familiar to us all.\n\nFurther reading\n\nA more extensive biography, along with details of Harriot's work on binary numbers and the story of his lost papers can be found in the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive.\n\nYou can also read Harriot's only published works, A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia and Artis Analyticae Praxis.\n\nAbout the author\n\nAnna Faherty read physics at Cambridge before working in publishing for fifteen years.

Harriot then worked for Henry Percy, the Ninth Earl of Northumberland (1564\u20131632). From Percy, Harriot received extensive lands and a substantial pension. He devoted the remainder of his life working for himself, so to speak, conducting experiments with the refraction of light and the trajectory of projectiles. His astronomical drawings recorded what later become known as Halley\u2019s Comet, and his invention of the perspective trunk led to the invention of the telescope.\n\nHarriot\u2019s scientific objectivity, observational powers, and notice of concrete particulars contribute to the valuable record of his A Briefe and True Report. This work had an impact not only in England but also the Continent.\n\nImage \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): Thomas Harriot at Syon Park"}, {"url": "https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/a-briefe-and-true-report-of-the-new-found-land-of-virginia-1588/", "page_content": "Hariot was born around 1560 and graduated from Oxford University in 1580. A mathematician with broad intellectual interests, he was intrigued by the prospect of unexplored lands across the Atlantic Ocean and joined Walter Raleigh at his Durham House estate, where he lectured on open-ocean navigation. During the winter of 1584\u20131585, Hariot learned some elements of the Algonquian language from two Native Americans, Manteo and Wanchese, who were brought back from an expedition to Roanoke Island in 1584.\n\nWhile some scholars believe it\u2019s possible that Hariot joined that 1584 expedition, he certainly was along when Sir Richard Grenville and 600 or so colonists arrived at Roanoke on June 26, 1585. Hariot and the expedition artist John White explored and mapped the area around Roanoke, carrying out Raleigh\u2019s request that they present him with both textual and visual depictions of the settlement and its surroundings. During the winter of 1585\u20131586, Hariot or White (or both) accompanied a group of English colonists north to the Chesapeake Bay, where they encountered the Virginia Indians of Tsenacomoco.\n\nAlthough Raleigh was principally interested in the types of commodities, particularly potentially valuable ones, available in the Virginia colony, he also charged Hariot and White with representing the exotic local flora and fauna, as well as the appearance, character, and practices of the Indians they met. Hariot\u2019s writings, in partnership with White\u2019s delicate but vivid watercolor paintings, depict numerous aspects of the Indians\u2019 lives and culture, including their bodies and clothing; their diets; the layouts of their homes and towns; their religious practices; their methods of agriculture, fishing, hunting, and boat-building; and the way in which they waged war upon their enemies. Taken in combination, Hariot\u2019s words and White\u2019s images presented the\n\nNew World as simultaneously exotic and reassuring to English readers. Virginia, in their description, was a land of lush vegetation and amicable natives, and thus was an ideal site for continued efforts at colonization, despite this initial effort\u2019s lack of success.\n\nHariot, White, and their fellow colonists abandoned the Roanoke settlement for England in 1586, bringing with them Hariot\u2019s notebooks and White\u2019s watercolors. In 1588, the first edition of what became known as A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia, presumably composed by Hariot from his notes throughout the year 1587, was published as a small volume, devoid of illustrations, and attracting relatively little notice. The following year, however, Hariot\u2019s text gained a broader readership when it appeared in the first edition of The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation, a collection of accounts compiled by Richard Hakluyt (the younger). It was published again in Hakluyt\u2019s second edition (1598\u20131600). Then, in 1590, the Flemish printer Theodor de Bry included both Hariot\u2019s text and White\u2019s images\u2014transformed by de Bry into copperplate engravings\u2014in the first edition of his own collection, Grand and petit voyages. Published in English, French, German, and Latin, de Bry\u2019s Grand and petit voyages went through seventeen editions between 1590 and 1620, and many elaborate copies were commissioned by wealthy patrons across Europe who valued the books both as sources of information and as precious art objects. Readers considered the engravings\u2014particularly those that depicted the bodies, clothing, and daily life of the Indians\u2014to be especially fascinating. Although they described only the inhabitants of the region around the Roanoke settlement, they soon came to represent all indigenous Americans in the minds of many early modern western European readers.\n\nThe reprinting of Hariot\u2019s text in both the Hakluyt and the de Bry compendia had a seismic effect upon its readers, especially those Englishmen interested in the nation\u2019s colonial ventures. By the time Hariot\u2019s book had reached a wide audience, the failure of the so-called Lost Colony of Roanoke, led by John White, had become common knowledge within cosmopolitan circles. While Hariot\u2019s optimistic predictions of a highly fertile land populated by welcoming natives had not been borne out, the promise of a \u201cnew found land of Virginia\u201d remained alluring and encouraged influential Englishmen to continue their efforts to found a permanent settlement in North America. According to the historian James Horn, Hariot \u201chad crafted a coherent argument in favor of colonization and described the means by which colonies would benefit their sponsors, settlers, and the nation,\u201d and it was this argument that would, within a few decades, lead to the landing at Jamestown."}], "Thomas Harriot was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford.": [{"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz Astronomy and Space Quiz\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/mathematics-biographies/thomas-harriot", "page_content": "Harriot, Thomas\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nReprinted in Major Problems in American Colonial History\n\nPublished in 1999\n\nEdited by Karen Ordahl Kupperman\n\n\"...some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men...\"\n\nE nglish exploration of North America began with the voyages of Italian-born navigator John Cabot (c.1450\u2013c.1499), who reached the region that eventually became known as New England in 1497. By 1502 fishermen were sending cod (a type of fish used for food) from Labrador, Canada, and New England to the port of Bristol, England. As early as 1508\u20131509 Cabot's son Sebastian (c. 1476\u20131557) had explored the Atlantic coast, but the English did not establish a permanent presence on the continent for another hundred years. Although Bartholomew Gosnold (d. 1607) briefly attempted to colonize New England in 1602, the English settlers were not prepared for life in the New World. Nevertheless published reports of Gosnold's venture described North America as \"the goodliest continent that ever we saw, promising more by farre than we any way did expect.\" Eager investors formed business ventures in the hopes of exploiting the bountiful resources in the wilderness.\n\nEnglish explorers were also trying to find a northwest passage, a natural waterway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, which would provide more direct access to Asia. In 1576 Martin Frobisher (c.1535\u20131594) undertook a series of voyages to Greenland to search for a water route, but each time his ships were stopped by ice in the Canadian Arctic. In 1578 English navigator Humphrey Gilbert (c.1539\u20131583) was given a patent (contract granting specific rights) by Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603) to explore and colonize North America. On his second expedition, in 1585, he reached Newfoundland and claimed the region for England. Discovering some fishermen living on the site of present-day St. John's, Gilbert appointed himself governor of the settlement. According to a few scholars, Gilbert established the first English colony in the New World, although most historians give that distinction to Jamestown, Virginia (see \"The Founding of Jamestown\").\n\nDuring the return trip to England, Gilbert was lost at sea. The North America patent was then transferred to his half brother, Walter Raleigh (1554\u20131618), who secured the support of influential noblemen and navigators for another attempt to establish a settlement. In 1584 Raleigh appointed Philip Amadas (1550\u20131618) and Arthur Barlowe to head an expedition to explore the mid-Atlantic coast of North America. Reaching the outer banks of present-day North Carolina, the expedition party came in contact with the Roanokes, Native Americans who inhabited Roanoke Island and the surrounding region. After a brief stay the Englishmen took two Native Americans, Manteo and Wachese, back to England. Amadas and Barlowe gave enthusiastic reports about Roanoke, claiming the island offered favorable trading prospects and an excellent location for a military fort. Impressed by the success of the mission, Elizabeth I knighted Raleigh and named the region Virginia in honor of herself (she was called the \"Virgin Queen\" because she refused to marry).\n\nRaleigh immediately organized a venture to establish a permanent colony at Roanoke. He assembled five ships and two boats, which he placed under the command of English navigator Richard Grenville (1542\u20131591). Among the party of 108 men\u2014mainly soldiers and servants\u2014was Thomas Harriot (1560\u20131621), a mathematician and Raleigh's tutor, who was given the task of surveying Virginia. (Surveying is a branch of mathematics that involves determining the area of any portion of the Earth's surface, the lengths and directions of bounding lines, and the contour of the surface.) Manteo and Wachese were to serve as interpreters, and artist John White (?\u20131593) planned to make drawings of animal and plant life in North America. Upon arriving at Roanoke in July 1585, the expedition got off to a bad start. First, Grenville determined that the island was not appropriate for a permanent military base. Then he ordered the burning of a Native American village when he discovered a silver cup was missing.\n\nLater the next month Grenville departed Roanoke for the Caribbean. Before leaving he placed colonist Ralph Lane (1530\u20131603) in charge of one hundred men. He then ordered the men to find a better site for the settlement and construct a fort and other buildings. In spite of Grenville's earlier aggression toward the Native Americans, the Englishmen had a good relationship with the Roanoke (also called Wiroan) people and their chief, Wingina. Lane freely explored the area, White sketched plants and animals, and Harriot conducted a detailed survey of the land. Harriot also recorded his observations of Native American life, language, and customs. As spring approached, the colonists ran out of food, so Lane took the drastic step of demanding corn from Wingina. Although the chief offered some land and seeds, Lane over-looked his generosity and concluded that the Native Americans were planning an attack. Lane therefore decided to strike first, and in the conflict Wingina and several of his people were killed.\n\nThe murder of Wingina and other Roanokes only made the food shortage at Roanoke worse because neighboring Native American groups avoided contact with the Europeans. The struggling colony was in desperate straits by June 1586, when English seaman Francis Drake (1540?\u20131596) paid a surprise visit on his way back from the Caribbean. Anxious to go home, all but three of the settlers boarded Drake's ship and set sail for England. About a year after their return Harriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.\n\nThings to Remember While Reading A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia:\n\nHarriot published A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia primarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys.\n\nprimarily to encourage English colonization in North America. Many consider it to be the first description of Native Americans to be written in English. In the report Harriot also included a survey of the geographic features of Roanoke, nearby islands, and portions of the mainland. It is one of the earliest known statistical land surveys. When the English initially organized the Roanoke expeditions they were motivated by the prospect of making profits on precious metals and trade in North America. Nevertheless, like the Spanish and French, they were also intent on converting Native American \"savages\" to Christianity (see \"New Mexico Indians Eager for Conversion\" and \"Jolliet and Marquette Explore the Mississippi\"). Note Harriot's statement that \"Some religion they [Native Americans] have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\" Later he observed that the Native Americans kept no written records. This was because they had a rich oral tradition, whereby master storytellers passed myths and legends down from generation to generation (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\").\n\nHarriot commented that \"some of the people [the Wiroans] could not tell whether to think us gods or men.\" Compare the Wiroans' confusion to the reactions of the Tlingits of Southeast Alaska (see \"The Coming of the First White Man\") and the Tainos in the Caribbean (see \"Christopher Columbus Reports to Ferdinand and Isabella\") upon meeting Europeans for the first time.\n\nHistorians maintain that Harriot showed unusual insight into problems that would eventually develop between Native Americans and European colonists. For instance, he wrote that native peoples \"are not to be feared, but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\" Later he observed, \"If there fall out any wars between us & them,\" the English would have \"advantages against them in so many manner of ways.\"\n\nHarriot described the friendly relations the English enjoyed with Wingina and the Wiroans. Although the situation changed drastically after Lane initiated the attack that resulted in the deaths of the chief and several other Wiroans.\n\nThe Wiroans died in great numbers after the Englishmen visited their towns, a \"marvelous accident\" that puzzled both Harriot and the Wiroans. Since none of the Englishmen were stricken, the deaths were undoubtedly caused by diseases they had carried with them from Europe. Disease was a major factor in the near-extermination of the Native American population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nKeep in mind that Harriot wrote A Brief and True Report for a sixteenth-century audience. Since his language and writing style are unfamiliar to twentieth-century readers, explanatory notes are included in the following excerpts from the document.\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia\n\nHarriot opened his report with a detailed description of the appearance and customs of Native Americans, whom he called \"natural inhabitants.\" He remarked that native peoples did not have sophisticated tools, nor did they have any weapons except bows and arrows for fighting against the English settlers (\"to offend us withal\"):\n\nIt resteth I [I pause to] speak a word or two of the natural inhabitants, their natures and manners, . . as that you know, how that they in respect of troubling our inhabiting and planting, are not to be feared, [they pose no threat to our settlement] but that they shall have cause both to fear and love us, that shall inhabit with them.\n\nThey are a people clothed with loosemantles made of Deer skins, & aprons of the same round about their middles; all else naked; . . having no edge tools or weapons of iron or steel to offend us withal, neither know they how to make any: those weapons that they have,\n\nMantles\n\nMantles: Cloaks\n\nare only bows made ofWitch hazel, & arrows of reeds, flat edgedtruncheons also of wood about a yard long, neither have they anything to defend themselves but targets made of barks, and somearmours made of stickswickered together with thread. . . .\n\nHarriot observed that the Native Americans admired English customs (\"our manner of knowledges and crafts\"), which they found superior to their own. Consequently they wanted to please and cooperate with the English (\"and have greater respect for pleasing and obeying us\"). He went on to describe Native Americans' wars with one another, observing that battle strategy (\"set battles\") was rare, except when there happened to be (\"it fall out\") fighting in the forest. At this point Harriot made his prediction about the Native Americans' lack of preparation for wars with Europeans. Since they could not defend themselves against superior battle plans and weaponry, they could be expected to run away from confrontation. Yet he praised their \"excellence of wit,\" and he predicted that the English could eventually civilize them and convert them to Christianity (the \"true religion\"):\n\nTheir manner of wars amongst themselves is either by sudden surprising one another most commonly about the dawning of the day, or moonlight, or else byambushes, or some subtle devices [secretive methods]. Set battles are very rare, except it fall out where there are many trees, where either part may have some hope of defence, after the delivery of every arrow, in leaping behind some [tree] or other.\n\nIf there fall out any wars between us & them, what their fight is likely to be, we having advantages against them so many manner of ways, as by our discipline, our strange weapons and devices else [other devices], especially byordinance great and small, it may be easily imagined; by the experience we have had in some places, the turning up of their heels against us in running away was their best defence. In respect of us they are a people poor, and for want of skill and judgment in the knowledge and use of our things, do esteem ourtrifles before things of greater value: Notwithstanding in their proper manner considering the want of such means as we have [in spite of not having our advantages], they seem veryingenious; For although they have no such tools, nor any such crafts, sciences and arts as we. . . they should desire our friendships & love, and have the greater respect for pleasing and obeying us. Whereby may be hoped if means of good government be used, [if we govern them properly] that they may in short time be brought to civility and embracing of true religion.\n\nWitch hazel\n\nWitch hazel: Shrub or tree with slender-petaled yellow flowers borne in late fall or early spring\n\nTruncheons\n\nTruncheons: Clubs\n\nArmours\n\nArmours: Hand-held weapons\n\nWickered\n\nWickered: Woven\n\nAmbushes\n\nAmbushes: Surprise attacks\n\nOrdinance\n\nOrdinance: Weapons and ammunition\n\nTrifles\n\nTrifles: Things of little value\n\nIngenious\n\nIngenious: Clever, resourceful\n\nHarriot reported that the Native Americans believed in an eternal god who created other gods. Nevertheless he dismissed their views as simply \"some religion\" that was \"far from the truth\" and would make the task of conversion easier for the English. Notice that Native Americans, like Christians, believed in immortality, heaven, and hell:\n\nSome religion they have already, which although it be far from the truth, yet being as it is, there is hope it may be the easier and sooner reformed.\n\nThey believe that there are many Gods which they call Mont\u00f3ac, but of different sorts and degrees; one only chief and great God, which hath been from all eternity. Who as they affirm when he purposed to make the world, made first other gods of a principal order to be as means and instruments to be used in the creation and government to follow; and after the Sun, Moon, and Stars as petty gods. . . . First they say were made waters, out of which by the gods was made all diversity of creatures that are visible or invisible.\n\nFor mankind they say a woman was made first, which by the working of one of the gods, conceived and brought forth children: And in such sort [in this manner] they say they had their beginning. But how many years or ages have passed since, they say they can make no relation, having no letters nor other such means as we to keep records of the particularities of times past, but only tradition from father to son. . . .\n\nThey believe also theimmortality of the soul, that after this life as soon as the soul is departed from the body, according to the works it hath done, it is either carried to heaven thehabitacle of gods, there to enjoy perpetual bliss and happiness, or else to a great pit or hole, which they think to be in the furthest parts of their part of the world toward the sunset, there to burn continually: the place they call Popogusso. . . .\n\nImmortality\n\nImmortality: The state of being free from death\n\nHabitacle\n\nHabitacle: Dwelling place\n\nIn this final excerpt Harriot described the Wiroans' reactions to Christianity. They accepted the Englishmen's faith, eventually rejecting their own. They grew to fear the Christian God. For instance, the Wiroans blamed illness or crop failure on the wrath of the Englishmen's god. In fact, whenever the Englishmen encountered hostility or resentment in Native American villages, the inhabitants began dying within a few days after they left. Both Harriot and the Wiroans seemed to make a connection between the mysterious deaths and offenses toward the Englishmen. The Wiroans therefore concluded that the Englishmen were gods, especially since they had no women with them. (The earliest Virginia expeditions were comprised only of men.) The true reason for the illnesses, however, was that the Native Americans were not immune to the diseases that the Europeans often carried.\n\nWiroans with whom we dwelt called Wingina, and many of his people would be glad many times to be with us at our prayers, and many times call upon us both in his own town, as also in others whither he sometimes accompanied us, to pray and singPsalms; hoping thereby to be partaker of the same effects which we by that means also expected [hoping to gain the same benefits from our religion].\n\nTwice this Wiroans [Wingina] was sogrievously sick that he was like to die, and as he laylanguishing, doubting of any help by his own priests, and thinking he was in such danger for offending [because he had offended] us and thereby our god, sent for some of us to pray and be a means [connection] to our God that it would please him either that he [Wingina] might live, or after death dwell with him [God] in bliss, so likewise were the requests of many others in the like case.\n\nOn a time also when their corn began to wither by reason of adrought which happened extraordinarily, fearing [they feared] that it had come to pass by reason that in something they had displeased us, many would come to us & desire us to pray to our God of England, that he would preserve their corn, promising that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruit.\n\nThere could at no time happen any strange sickness, losses, hurts, or any other cross [misfortune] unto them, but that they wouldimpute to us the cause or means thereof for offending or not pleasing us. . . .\n\nPsalms\n\nPsalms: A book in the Old Testament containing sacred songs and poems\n\nGrievously\n\nGrievously: Terribly\n\nLanguishing\n\nLanguishing: Suffering\n\nDrought\n\nDrought: A period of prolonged dryness that causes extensive damage to crops or prevents their successful growth\n\nImpute\n\nImpute: Attribute\n\nThere was no town where we had any subtle device practiced against us [the inhabitants showed hostility], we leaving it unpunished or not revenged (because we sought by all means possible to win them by gentleness) but that within a few days after our departure from every such town, the people began to die very fast, and many in short space; in some towns about twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, & in one six score [one hundred twenty], which in truth was very many in respect of their numbers. This happened in no place that we could learn but where we had been where they used some practice against us, and after such time; The disease also was sostrange, that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; the like by report of the oldest men in the country never happened before, time out of mind. A thing specially observed by us, as also by the natural inhabitants themselves. . . .\n\nThis marvelous accident in all the country wrought so strange opinions of us, that some people could not tell whether to think us gods or men . . . because . . . there was no man of ours known to die, or that was especially sick: they noted also that we had no women among us, neither that we did care for any of theirs.\n\nSome therefore were of opinion that we were not born of women, and therefore notmortal, but that we were men of an old generation many years past then risen again to immortality.\n\nMortal\n\nMortal: Human\n\nWhat happened next . . .\n\nSoon after the departure of the colonists Grenville returned to Roanoke with a new load of supplies and six hundred additional men. He found the colony deserted\u2014no one knows what happened to the three men who had remained on the island. Eventually Grenville decided to return to England and recruit more settlers. He left fifteen men at Roanoke to plant crops and build dwellings in preparation for the new colonists. By that time, however, Raleigh had lost interest in colonizing Virginia. John White, the artist who accompanied Grenville in 1585, therefore took over the project and acquired the backing of several investors for another expedition.\n\nWhite's plan was to start a new colony called the City of Raleigh, which would be located north of Roanoke in the Chesapeake Bay area. White would be the governor of the new colony. Since this settlement would be devoted to families and farming instead of military defense, the party included seventeen women, nine children, and ninety-four men. When the ships reached North America in late 1587, the pilot refused to go any farther than Roanoke. Forced to remain at the old settlement, the colonists discovered that the fifteen men left by Grenville were gone, possibly driven out by Native Americans. Consequently crops had not been planted and there was no suitable housing. The only solution was for White to go back to England for more supplies and additional men. Before departing he told the colonists to move to another location if they had any problems and to leave a message telling him where to find them.\n\nThe \"lost\" colony\n\nAfter a three-year absence John White returned from England in 1591, only to find Roanoke deserted. The fate of the inhabitants of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. These excerpts from White's journal describe what he found at the site.\n\nAugust 17 . . . we espied [spied] toward the north end of the island the light of a great fire through the woods, to which we presently rode. When we came right over against it, we let fall our grapnel [anchor] near the shore and sounded with a trumpet a call, and afterwards many familiar English tunes of songs, and called to them friendly. But we had no answer. We therefore landed at daybreak, and coming to the fire, we found the grass and sundry [numerous] rotten trees burned about the place.... In all this way we saw in the sand the print of the savages' feet of two or three sorts trodden the night, and as we entered up the sandy bank, upon a tree, in the very brow thereof, were curiously carved these fair Roman letters CRO; which letters presently we knew to signify the place where I should find the planters seated, according to a secret token agreed upon between them and me at my last departure from them, which was that they should not fail to write or carve on the tree or posts of the doors the name of the place where they should be seated; for at my coming away they were prepared to remove from Roanoke 50 miles in the main. Therefore at my departure from them in 1587 I willed them that if they should happen to be distressed in any of those places, that then they should carve over the letters or name a cross; but we found no such sign of distress. And having well considered of this, we passed towards the place where they were left in sundry houses, but we found the houses taken down, and the place very strongly enclosed with a high palisade [fence] of great trees . . . and one of the chief trees or posts at the right side of the entrance had the bark taken off, and five foot from the ground in fair capital letters was graven [carved] CROATOAN without any cross or sign of distress. . . . This could be no other but the deed of the savages our enemies.\n\nReprinted in: Colbert, David, ed. Eyewitness to America. New York: Pantheon Books, 1997, pp. 11\u201312.\n\nIn the meantime, war had been brewing between England and Spain. When the conflict erupted in 1588\u2014as White was about to sail from England back to North America\u2014contact between England and Roanoke was cut off. In 1591, after the English defeated the Spanish Armada, White was finally able to return to Roanoke. By that time the settlers had all vanished without a trace, and White found only two clues to their whereabouts: the word \"Croatan\" carved on a fence post and the letters \"Cro\" etched into a tree trunk. The English suspected that the colonists' disappearance was somehow linked with the Croatoans, a friendly Native American tribe who lived on Croatoan Island about fifty miles south of Roanoke.\n\nThe Roanoke settlers were never found, and the fate of the \"lost colony\" remains a mystery. Numerous theories about their disappearance have evolved over the centuries. They could have died as the result of a natural disaster such as disease, starvation, hurricane, flood, or tornado. They could have tried to return to England and their ship sank at sea. More outlandish explanations include pirates coming ashore and kidnapping all the inhabitants. The most reassuring conclusion is that the colonists joined a nearby Native American tribe, with whom they intermarried and prospered.\n\nAfter the dismal failure of the Roanoke colony the English made no other attempts to colonize North America for nearly twenty years. They realized they had neither the skills nor the money to establish permanent settlements in a strange and hostile land. One modern historian has noted that venturing into the wilderness of North America in the sixteenth century was similar to landing on the moon in the twentieth century. Moreover, the English, like the Spanish, were primarily interested in conquering Native American empires that would yield instant wealth with such treasures as precious metals and jewelry. Yet by the late 1590s Europeans had seized most of the available riches in the New World.\n\nDid you know . . .\n\nA Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia was immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times.\n\nwas immensely popular among Englishmen who entertained visions of an exciting and prosperous life in the New World. By 1610 the book had been reprinted seventeen times. Harriot may have performed some of the earliest scientific experiments in North America. In addition to conducting a survey of Virginia, he helped another member of the 1585 expedition, German scientist Joachim Ganz, search for copper and other precious metals. Archaeologists excavating the Roanoke site have found equipment that Harriot and Ganz probably used to test metals and ores.\n\nJohn White was the grandfather of Virginia Dare (1587\u2013?), the first European reported to be born in America. Nine days before White's departure from Roanoke, Virginia was born to his daughter Eleanor and his son-in-law Ananais Dare. All three Dares disappeared with the other Roanoke colonists, and White died without ever knowing what happened to his family.\n\nEvidence discovered in 1998 has led historians to speculate that the Roanoke colonists may have been driven out by a drought (a period of prolonged dryness that causes damage to crops). Scientists studying the rings of a bald cypress in southeastern Virginia found that a seven-year drought was occurring at the same time the second group of settlers arrived at Roanoke in 1587. In fact, it was the most severe period of dryness in more than eight hundred years. Thus a food shortage could have forced the colonists to seek another location for their community.\n\nFor more information\n\n\"The Cabot Dilemma: John Cabot's 1497 Voyage & the Limits of Historiography\" in Documents Relevant to the United States Before 1700.http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/9061/USA/colonial/bef1700.html Available September 30, 1999.\n\nCampbell, Elizabeth A.

In those days talented young men from humble origins were sometimes educated at the expense of noble patrons, who needed clerks to write letters, keep accounts, and fight on the legal frontiers of property disputes. It seems that Adam benefitted from the patronage of Edmund Earl of Cornwall and lord of the manor of Brome, a cousin of King Edward I. If this was the case, Adam must soon have quit the Earl\u2019s household, since in the early 1290s he was a clerk in Chancery, writing documents in the service of the crown. There, it may be surmised, he established a reputation for efficiency, perhaps bordering on ruthlessness. His first really high-profile commission came in the years 1297-1301 when he was given the unpopular job of overseeing forced sales of produce (at unfavourable prices) to provision the King\u2019s armies fighting in Scotland. It is impossible to know whether the revulsion expressed by some contemporaries at what they saw as an abuse of royal power affected Adam in any way, though his subsequent work as a tax-collector between 1305 and 1323 was almost certainly plain sailing by comparison.\n\nDuring these years Adam was also acting in a legal capacity, as an attorney at first, and then as a judge in special commissions and at the Staple, which implies some legal training coupled with knowledge of mercantile affairs. An education in Common Law would have been acquired at the Inns of Court, sometimes referred to as medieval England\u2019s \u2018third university\u2019, as well as on-the-job in royal service. There is no evidence that Adam attended university, though he worked alongside several clerks who had, and their influence can be detected in the foundation of the college in 1326. His financial acumen was sharpened dealing with other people\u2019s money in his role as a clerk, while on the side he was also acting as a creditor, perhaps as a middle-man raising money for third parties. The details of Adam\u2019s financial, legal, and administrative career might make him seem a precursor of today\u2019s \u2018revolving door\u2019 between the worlds of politics and finance, but there were important differences that make such trans-historical comparisons a false friend to the understanding of the past. Not least among these is the fact that all clerks in royal service were \u2013 quite literally \u2013 clerics, men of the church. It is likely that Adam was ordained in minor orders at an early stage in his career, though he may never have proceeded to major orders as a priest. Clerks in Chancery were often presented to clerical benefices in the King\u2019s gift, which would have given them an income from agricultural produce and tithe receipts. Despite holding various rectories across the country Adam should not be imagined as a peripatetic priest. Rather, as a royal administrator, judge, and small\u00adtime financier, he was an absentee clergyman, paying vicars (from the Latin vice: deputy) to sing divine services and minister to his parishioners.\n\nOne of Adam\u2019s benefices was the rectory of St Mary\u2019s in Oxford, which he was awarded in 1320. The rectory building was located opposite St Mary\u2019s Church, on the site of the present Third Quad, and it was here in 1324 that Adam set about establishing a community of scholars under the control of himself as Rector. With a license from King Edward II, Adam bought up property in Oxford whose rental income would support these scholars, including Tackley\u2019s Inn on the High Street which is still in the college\u2019s possession and remains in use as student accommodation. Adam was unusual amongst the founders of colleges in being intimately involved in the life of the university. As Rector of St Mary\u2019s he had persuaded Thomas Cobham, the Bishop of Worcester, to pay for the construction of Congregation House, which would be the university\u2019s first common library and lecture room, and he more than once represented the Chancellor of the University in court. Soon, however, Adam became more ambitious, and persuaded Edward II to allow him to upgrade the scholars of St Mary\u2019s into a fully-fledged college with a set of statutes based on those of Merton. Although the King was favourable, Adam\u2019s project coincided with the collapse of Edward\u2019s authority, and it was only by dealing with Hugh Despenser, the emerging focus of political power, that the college received its \u2018royal\u2019 foundation charter on 21 January 1326.\n\nAdam was the first Provost of the college he founded, the House of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Oxford, and he was as energetic in finding the funds to add to its endowment as he was in negotiating the turbulent political situation at the beginning of Edward III\u2019s reign. In 1329 he acquired the house known as La Oriole, on the site of the present Front Quad, from the nephew of the King of Castile. By the time of Adam\u2019s death on 16 June 1332 the college comprised six Fellows, and was standing financially on its own feet. Adam left no stipulations for preference to be given to \u2018founder\u2019s kin\u2019 or the scholars of his home region in future elections of fellows, which gave the college a freedom unique within Oxford. He was buried in St Mary\u2019s Church.\n\nMore about Adam de Brome: Oxford National Dictionary of Biography\n\n[1] This account is based upon that of Jeremy Catto in Oriel College: A History (OUP, 2013), pp. 14-27, where a fuller account of Adam de Brome\u2019s life and the foundation of the college may be found."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/thomas-harriot-0", "page_content": "Thomas Harriot\n\n1560?-1621\n\nEnglish Mathematician\n\nT homas Harriot invented the signs for \"greater than\" (>) and \"less than\" (<) in use today, and was one of the first mathematicians to use a number of now-commonplace symbols. Much of his work involved astronomy, navigation, and geometry: an employee and associate of Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618), he was at the center of English efforts to conquer the seas and the New World.\n\nHarriot was educated at St. Mary's Hall, Oxford University, from whence he received his B.A. in 1580. For a time, he appears to have worked as a mathematics tutor in London before securing employment with Raleigh in 1584. The famous gentleman-explorer needed someone to teach navigation to his sailors, and for this purpose Harriot composed a manuscript\u2014long since lost\u2014called the Articon.\n\nDuring the following year, Raleigh sent Harriot with a group of colonists to Roanoke Island off the coast of what is now North Carolina. (These were not the inhabitants of the famous \"Lost Colony\": the first settlement lasted only 10 months before being disbanded, and the doomed Lost Colony settlers arrived in 1587.) Working with artist John White (d. 1593?), Harriot was responsible for studying the indigenous peoples, as well as the local vegetation, animal life, and other natural resources. He published A Briefe and True Report, an account of his findings, in 1588.\n\nDuring the three decades that followed, Harriot's patrons\u2014first Raleigh and then Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), for whom he went to work in 1595\u2014ran afoul of the English royal house. Harriot himself, though occasionally caught up in the turmoil even to the extent of being accused of atheism in 1603, in general passed the time unscathed, and continued his scientific observations. He studied the parabolic path of projectiles; determined the specific weights of materials; calculated the areas of spherical triangles, and thus confirmed that the Mercator projection preserves angles; independently discovered the sine law of refraction associated with Willebrord Snell (1580-1626); built telescopes; and in 1607, long before the birth of Edmund Halley (1656-1742), observed what came to be known as Halley's Comet.\n\nAs an astronomer, Harriot also made a map of the Moon (1609), calculated the orbits of Jupiter's moons (1610-12), studied sunspots and the Sun's rotation speed (1610-13), and observed another comet (1618). In his writings as a mathematician, not only did he become the first to use > and <, he was one of the first to adopt the plus sign and minus sign, lowercase letters for variables, and the equal sign of Robert Recorde (1510-1558). He was also among the first to write an equation with the sum of all terms equal to zero, as is common today.\n\nFor a decade, from the mid-1580s to the mid-1590s, Harriot had lived on an Irish property granted him by Raleigh. From 1595, however, he had resided at Northumberland's estate at Syon, and continued there even after Northumberland was arrested by King James in 1605. By the time his patron was released from the Tower of London in 1622, Harriot was dead, having succumbed to a cancer of the nostril on July 2, 1621. (Raleigh was dead, too, executed by James in 1618.) Harriot left behind a vast array of papers, many of them published as Artis analyticae praxis, a significant algebra text, in 1631.\n\nJUDSON KNIGHT"}, {"url": "https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/history/2012/05/30/thomasharriotatoriel2012/", "page_content": "\u2018The whole earth, a present for a Prince\u2019: Molyneux\u2019s English globes and the creation of a global vision in Harriot\u2019s time\n\nThursday 31 May 2012 at 5pm in The Champneys Room, Oriel College\n\nby Dr Lesley B Cormack, Professor of History and Dean of the Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta\n\nAfter the lecture, it will also be possible to visit an exhibition of books related to 16th-century navigation and map-making in the college\u2019s Senior Library.\n\nSee also the accompanying online exhibition with maps and other illustrations\n\nWho was Thomas Harriot?\n\n(taken from the Oriel College, Oxford website)\n\n\u201cThomas Harriot, mathematician and natural philosopher, was born in Oxfordshire; matriculated at Oxford in 1577 as a member of St Mary Hall (which united with Oriel College in 1902), and was awarded a BA degree at Easter 1580.\n\nHarriot developed the skills of astronomical navigation, and was employed by Sir Walter Ralegh (another member of Oriel) to teach Ralegh and his sea captains about navigation and prepare him for his journey to establish a settlement in America, although in the end, Ralegh himself was not part of that expedition.\u201d more\n\nRelated exhibitions\n\nThe Renaissance in Astronomy: books, globes and instruments of the 16th century, Museum of the History of Science, Oxford"}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Harriot,_Thomas", "page_content": "\u200bHARRIOT, THOMAS (1560\u20131621), mathematician and astronomer, was born at Oxford, probably in the parish of St. Mary, in 1560. Ashmole believed that he came of a Lancashire family. He entered St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, and graduated B. A. on 12 Feb. 1580. Sir Walter Raleigh then engaged him to reside with him as his mathematical tutor, and sent him out to Virginia as a surveyor with Sir Richard Grenville's expedition in 1585. Harriot returned to England at the end of the following year, and published at London in 1588 'A Brief and True Report of the new-found Land of Virginia,' a work 'remarkable for the large views it contains in regard to the extension of industry and commerce,' and one of the earliest examples of a statistical survey on a large scale (Edinburgh Review, lxxi. 11). It excited much notice, appeared in Latin in De Bry's 'Americ\u00e6 Descriptio' (Frankfort, 1590), and was included in the third volume of Hakluyt's 'Voyages' (London, 1600). Among the mathematical instruments by which the wonder of the Indians was excited, Harriot mentions 'a perspective glass whereby was showed many strange sights.'\n\nAbout this time Raleigh introduced him to Henry, earl of Northumberland, who admired his affability and learning, and allowed him to the end of his life a pension of 300l. a year. After his committal to the Tower in 1606, the earl kept a handsome table there for Harriot and his mathematical friends, Walter Warner and Thomas Hughes, who became known as the 'three magi' of the Earl of Northumberland. The company was often joined by Raleigh. The earl assigned to Harriot in 1607 a residence at Sion House, near Isleworth, where he continued to study and observe until his death, on 2 July 1621, of a cancer in the nose. His case is mentioned by Dr. Alexander Reid, the physician who attended him (Chirurgicall Lectures, p. 307). His body was removed with much \u200bceremony to St. Christopher's Church in London, where a monument, destroyed in the great fire, was erected to him by his executors, Robert Sidney, Viscount Lisle, and Sir Thomas Aylesbury [q. v.] The inscription, preserved by Stow (Survey of London, i. ii. 123, ed. Strype), celebrates his successful pursuit of all the sciences, and calls him 'Dei Triniunius cultor piissimus.' In his 'Report of Virginia' Harriot speaks with reverence of the Christian religion, and the lines in Dr. Corbet's poem on the comet of 1618, referring to\n\n\u2060deep Harriot's mine,\n\n\u2060In which there is no dross, but all refine,\n\nhave been interpreted in favour of his orthodoxy. Wood, however, asserts that he 'made a philosophical theology, wherein he cast off the Old Testament.' It is possible that reference is made to Harriot and to his popular reputation as a rationalist in the 'opinion' ascribed to Christopher Marlowe, 'that Moyses was but a Juggler, and that one Heriots can do more than hee '(cf. Harl. MS. 6853, f. 320).\n\nHarriot's health was long weak. He complained to Kepler on 2 Dec. 1606 of inability to write or even think accurately upon any subject, which may explain his failure to complete and publish his discoveries. Sir William Lower warned him in 1609 that his procrastination might lead to the anticipation of some of his ' rarest inventions and speculations.' Among Harriot's anticipated discoveries Lower mentions the ellipticity of the planetary orbits, a ' curious way to observe weights in water,' and ' the great invention of algebra,' the ' garland ' for which had been snatched by Viete. Lower adds that these were small discoveries in comparison with others in Harriot's 'storehouse.'\n\nThe posthumous publication of Harriot's ' Artis Analyticae Praxis ad JEquationes Algebraicas resolvendas ' (London, 1631) was due to Sir Thomas Aylesbury, who induced Warner, by the promise of the continuance of his pension from the Earl of Northumberland, to 'draw out some piece fit to be published' from his friend's manuscripts. This work embodies the inventions by which Harriot virtually gave to algebra its modern form. The important principle was introduced by him that every equation results from the continual multiplication of as many simple ones as there are units in the index of its highest power, and has consequently as many roots as it has dimensions. He first brought over to one side, and thus equated to zero all the terms of an equation; he adverted to the existence of negative roots, improved algebraical notation, and invented the signs of inequality > and <. Dr. Wallis's claim on behalf of the 'incomparable' author to have laid the foundation, 'without which the whole superstructure of Descartes had never been' (A Treatise of Algebra, p. 126, 1685), raised a sharp controversy, scarcely yet extinct, between French and English mathematicians. Dr. Pell remarked that had Harriot 'published all he knew in algebra, he would have left little of the chief mysteries of that art unhandled.' But Warner's promise (Epilogue to Harriott's Praxis, p. 180) of continuing his editorial labours remained unfulfilled.\n\nHarriot's will was not found, but Camden states that he divided his papers between Sir Thomas Aylesbury and Viscount Lisle. Aylesbury's share, transmitted to his son-in-law, the Earl of Clarendon, never came to light, though diligently inquired for in 1662-3 by the Royal Society (Birch, Hist. R. Society, i. 120, 309). The remainder, handed over by Lord Lisle to his father-in-law, the Earl of Northumberland, descended from him to the Earl of Egremont, and were discovered at Petworth Castle by Baron von Zach in 1784, buried beneath a pile of old stable accounts. His account of the contents published in the Berlin 'Ephemeris' for 1788, and translated into English, was disfigured by some inaccuracies corrected later by Professor Rigaud. Von Zach designed to write from these new materials a biography of Harriot, and in 1786 made a proposal to the university of Oxford for its publication, but he merely transmitted in 1794, without any illustrative text, the selected original manuscripts which it should have accompanied. These were submitted to Dr. Robertson, the Savilian professor of astronomy, who reported in 1802 that their publication would show Harriot to have been very assiduous in his studies and observations, but could not contribute to advance science (Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, vi. 314). They are now at Petworth Castle, having been restored to Lord Egremont, by whom the remaining papers, being seven-eighths of the entire, were presented to the British Museum.\n\nHarriot was known only as a mathematician until Von Zach's disclosures showed him to have been an astronomer as well. He applied the telescope to celestial purposes almost simultaneously with Galileo. In July 1609 he is said to have made with its help two sketches of the moon (Encycl. Brit. xvl. 528, 8th ed.), and he commenced on 17 Oct. 1610 a series of observations on ' the new-found planets about Jupiter,' continued until 26 Feb. 1612, and accompanied by calculations of I their orbits, and graphical notes of their con\u200bfigurations. He made 199 observations of sun-spots from 8 Dec. 1610 to 18 Jan. 1613, and determined from them the sun's axial rotation. His telescopes magnified up to fifty times. He first saw the comet of 1607 (Halley's) from Ilfracombe on 17 Sept. His observations upon it were made with a 'cross-staff' giving the distances of the nucleus from various stars. They were published by Von Zach (Berlin Astr. Jahrbuch, 1793, l ter Suppl. Band), and reduced by Bessel, who computed an orbit from them (Monatliche Correspondenz, x. 425). Harriot observed the third comet of 1618 from Sion House nine times between 30 Nov. and 25 Dec. He stated the length of its tail on 11 Dec. at forty degrees.\n\nHarriot corresponded on optical subjects with Kepler, 1606-9 (Kepleri Opera Omnia, ii. 67-74). In one letter he refuted experimentally the opinion that refraction varies with density ; others show him to have been a systematic meteorological observer, and to have prepared a treatise on the rainbow and colours. A tract by him, 'De Motuet Collisione Corporum,' was in Lord Brouncker's hands about 1670 ; his 'Ephemeris Chrysometria' is preserved in manuscript at Sion House. The Egremont collection of his papers in the British Museum is bound in eight large volumes (Addit. MSS. 6782-9), filled chiefly with miscellaneous calculations. The seventh volume contains, besides fragments on mechanics, hydrostatics, specific gravity, and magnetism, a letter from Nathaniel Torporley (f. 117), and the eighth includes letters from Sir William Lower and one from Sir Thomas Aylesbury. A further deposit of Harriot's mathematical papers forms part of the Harleian MSS. (6001-2, 6083). Among them are tracts on harmony, solid geometry, infinite series, extracts from the gospel of St. Matthew translated into French, a short phoranomical treatise (6083, f. 236), and a 'Trait\u00e9 d'Algebre' (in French), in which ad- vances are made towards the application of algebra to geometry. Harriot was designated by Wood 'the universal philosopher' (Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ii. 230), and a wide contemporary admiration is attested by Kepler's expressions towards him. His 'Report of Virginia' was published in German at Leipzig in 1607."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97707-2_1", "page_content": "Rumors have been circulated since the mid-16th century that the telescope was not invented in early 17th century Holland but in Elizabethan England, some half a century before. A telescopic device appears to have been constructed by the noted English polymath Leonard Digges (1515\u2013c. 1559) as early as the first half of the 1500s and later reiterated by his son, Thomas Digges, in a communication dated to 1571:\n\n[H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon , Planets and Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. Archimedes also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of Syracuse. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places.\n\nThis intriguing tract, which appears on page 5 of the preface to his posthumously published book Pantometria (1571), provides the modern reader with an intriguing glimpse of a telescopic device made with lenses and mirrors. In a lively debate that took place in March 1993 organized by the Scientific Instrument Society (SIS) and held at Burlington House, London, Colin Ronan spoke in favor of the existence of such an early telescope, while the late Professor Gerard Turner, based at the Museum for the History of Science, Oxford, UK, provided a robust counterpoint. During the debate, a replica of the alleged Digges telescope was presented to all in attendance.\n\nThe device consisted of a simple biconvex objective lens, the light of which was incident to a focusing mirror that relayed the image to the eye. Mounted inside a wooden tube, the device magnified 11 times and did produce an enlarged image, but with a very narrow field of view, and was additionally plagued by chromatic aberration \u2013 a consequence of using a singlet lens as an objective. There is, as yet, no consensus on whether such a telescope ever saw the light of day.\n\nHarriot and his assistant, Christopher Tooke, set up a telescope magnifying 6 times on the grounds of Syon Park, and on the clement evening of July 26, 1609, turned it on a five-day-old crescent Moon, immediately sketching what he saw. Various lunar \u2018seas\u2019 are included in these lunar portraits, including the Mare Crisium, Tranquilitatis and Fecunditatis, as well as some rugged lunar features situated along the terminator, which modern scholars have identified as Theophilus and Cyrillus. Curiously, this first sketch does not record any craters, although 6\u00d7 is certainly large enough to resolve several of the more prominent ones.\n\nOut of sheer curiosity, in a separate investigation, this author used a modern spyglass with an uncoated, 1-inch diameter object glass, also having a magnification of 6\u00d7, in the wee small hours (01:30 h UT) of January 1, 2016, to record observations of the last quarter Moon and Jupiter, as they cleared the treetops in the eastern sky. Like Harriot\u2019s telescope, the spyglass gave an erect, correctly orientated image but enjoyed a much larger field of view (approximately 4 angular degrees). Nonetheless, this author could confirm that many lunar craters can indeed be observed with a steady hand, as well as clearly showing various maria . Turning to Jupiter, then just a few degrees above the Moon, the telescope could clearly reveal four Galilean satellites all to one side of the planet (Fig. 1.3).\n\nFig. 1.3 The author\u2019s 6\u00d7 achromatic spyglass used to corroborate Harriot\u2019s observations. (Image by the author) Full size image\n\nIt will come as somewhat of a surprise to the contemporary reader not acquainted with a Galilean telescope that, despite its very low magnifying power, its field of view was very restrictive \u2013 typically just over half the diameter of the full Moon! As a result, Harriot could not have seen the entire countenance of the lunar crescent even at the low magnifications his telescopes delivered. Incredibly, though, Harriot made many more drawings of the Moon, some of which display finer cartographic details than Galileo\u2019s later drawings, but they were frustratingly left undated. When we take into account the radically different personalities of both Galileo (explored in the next chapter) and Harriot, we can see that both men had entirely different modi operandi. Harriot, having spent time in Virginia, was a draughtsman and well acquainted with mapmaking. His methods were slow and methodical. Harriot was categorically not seeking fame and fortune in the same way that Galileo was, and, according to Dr. Chapman , because Harriot had two high profile friends on \u2018death row\u2019 in the Tower, he had little desire to make himself conspicuous.\n\nBy the closing weeks of 1609, Harriot dispatched Tooke, his able technician, to the residence of Sir William Lower at Trefenti, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, instructing him to fashion several other Galilean cylinders in order that he and his philosophical chums, a one Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Protheroe (and possibly a few others), could begin their own telescopic investigations of the Moon and other celestial bodies. The surviving exchanges between Harrriot and the \u2018Carmartenshire philosophers,\u2019 clearly unveil their avowed acceptance of the Copernican system, as well as Kepler\u2019s elliptical theory of planetary orbits. This meeting may well be first known record of an astronomical society, the members of which were to confirm Galileo\u2019s monumental telescopic work by observing the large Jovian satellites and the erstwhile \u201cinvisible\u201d stars in the Pleiades.\n\nOver the next few years, Harriot was to complete his now famous Moon maps, as well as embarking on a detailed study of the Sun. His method involved observing the intensely bright solar disk, when it was near the horizon and veiled behind mist and thin cloud (the reader should, under no circumstances, attempt such an observation!). Harriot is credited as the co-discover of sunspots, recording them at or about the same time as Galileo, and possibly earlier than Christopher Scheiner (1573\u20131650) and Johannes Fabricius (1587\u20131616), who themselves yielded additional evidence against the time-honored cosmology of Ptolemy (Fig. 1.4).\n\nFig. 1.4 Christoph Scheiner (1573\u20131650), the Jesuit priest and astronomer, with his telescope shown on his left. (Image courtesy of Wiki Commons. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Scheiner#/media/File:Scheiner_christoph.gif) Full size image\n\nOver the next 2 years, Harriot was to carry out some 450 observations of the Sun and its dark spots, never once claiming their discovery for himself, studying how they moved across its otherwise brilliant face, breaking up and sometimes even disappearing. Indeed, modern scholars were able to establish a solar rotation period of 27.154 days from Harriot\u2019s drawings \u2013 uncannily close to the modern accepted value of 27.2753 days. This affirms the accuracy and attention to detail so central to Harriot\u2019s methodology.\n\nAccording to Dr. Chapman , Tooke may have made improvements to the basic Dutch trunke, and referring to a study conducted by the distinguished historian of astronomy and cosmology, the late Professor John North (1934\u20132008) identified no less than six telescopes associated with Harriot and the \u2018Trefentine\u2019 philosophers, which ranged in power from 6\u00d7 up to 50\u00d7. Tooke is likely to be among the first bona fide telescope makers in Britain, a tradition that was to be continued over the following centuries.\n\nAlthough Harriot embraced the Christian message from his youth, even writing the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the Algonquin language , some scholars have suggested that he may have experienced a brief religious hiatus as he approached middle age. Doubtless, the revolution heralded by the application of the telescope to the celestial realm had raised new questions in the minds of his learned contemporaries. Why were the astronomical bodies puckered and imperfect? How did God create everything from nothing? Was His divine hand needed at every stage, from the formation of atoms to the completion of worlds? Was the allegory of the universe even attributed to a personal God or was it merely blind chance? These questions weighed heavily in the mind of Thomas Harriot.\n\nDr. Chapman acknowledges that nothing firm can be adduced from Harriot\u2019s surviving notes and correspondences, but he is inclined to the view that the world\u2019s first telescopic astronomer re-embraced his Christian heritage in the final decade of his life, as evidenced by his 1615 correspondence with the king\u2019s physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne, who assured Harriot of the certainty of the existence of one all-powerful God. From his days in Virginia, Harriot had taken to \u2018drinking\u2019 tobacco smoke, as his contemporaries had referred to it. Earlier physicians had hailed the new wonder drug as an effective remedy to counter the \u201cdangerous moist humors of the body.\u201d But three decades of heavy inhalation of tobacco smoke was to take its toll on Harriot\u2019s health, and he developed a cancerous lesion on his nose.\n\nBecause many tumors of this sort have a tendency to metastasize, spreading to other organs of the body via the lymph nodes, Harriot was arguably history\u2019s first clearly attested tobacco-induced cancer victim, dying on July 2, 1621. He was laid to rest at his local Parish Church of St. Christopher-le-Stocks, located in the heart of the city of London. And while the church was razed to the ground by the Great Fire of 1666 and another resurrected on the original site by none other than Sir Christopher Wren (1632\u20131723), this too was eventually demolished in 1781 in order to make way for a grand new building that would became the headquarters of the Bank of England. In the 1970s, however, the gravestone dedicated to Thomas Harriot was recovered, and, in his honor, a new plaque carrying his gravestone inscription was unveiled inside the bank.\n\nIt is difficult to crystallize the legacy of Thomas Harriot, being so far removed from him in time, but these words come to mind; learned, diligent, enterprising, kind, loyal, uncompetitive, humble and God-fearing.

We meet annually at the University of Durham or Birkbeck, University of London (on alternate years).\n\nContact us: to discuss any aspect of the Seminar's activities, please contact Dr Stephen Clucas, THS Chair.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Thomas Harriot Seminar was established by Dr Cecily Tanner, formerly Lecturer at Imperial College, London. From 1967, it met in Oxford under the leadership of Professor David Quinn of Liverpool and Dr Alistair Crombie of Oxford. The seminars were organised by Dr JD North (and latterly by Dr JJ Roche), under the presidency of Dr Crombie. The first was held at All Souls, but the rest were held at Trinity College, where Dr Crombie was a Fellow. The last Oxford seminar was held in April 1983.\n\nIn 1977, Dr Tanner financed a meeting in Durham which met every two years from 1979 under the chairmanship of Professor GR Batho, until his death in 2013. From 1988 to 1999 biennial seminars were also held in Cambridge. Since 2013, the Seminar has been chaired by Dr Stephen Clucas (Reader in Early Modern Intellectual History at Birkbeck, University of London), who was Vice Chairman of the Seminar from 1990-2013. The Seminar now alternates between the University of Durham and Birkbeck.\n\nThe Durham Harriot Seminar published a series of 35 occasional papers and a catalogue of the Tanner Papers in the University of Liverpool. These are no longer available, but we hope to put PDFs of them online in the near future.\n\nThe money provided by Dr Tanner to endow the Seminar has been supplemented since her death in 1992 by Lord Egremont. The money Dr Tanner gave Professor Batho in 1977 was put into the hands of the Durham University Treasurer and the stewardship of the Treasurer has resulted in the Seminar being adequately endowed for the foreseeable future. Help is given to students to attend meetings and money has been provided to assist with relevant publications.\n\nLord Egremont is the Patron of the Thomas Harriot Seminar.\n\nMeetings\n\nThe THS welcomes any interested persons to its meetings.

Throughout his working life, he was supported by the patronage, at different times, of Sir Walter Raleigh and Henry Percy, the 9th earl of Northumberland; he was never, after his student years, affiliated with an academic institution or commercial organization. From 1585 to 1586 he participated in Raleigh\u2019s colony on Roanoke Island, and he may have visited Virginia as early as 1584; upon his return, he published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). This was his only work published during his lifetime. Very soon after the Virginia sojourn, Harriot was living on and surveying Raleigh\u2019s estates in Ireland.\n\nBritannica Quiz Faces of Science\n\nIn 1595 Percy settled upon Harriot an estate in Durham, England, and soon provided him with a house near London, which he also used as a scientific laboratory to pursue original research in astronomy, meteorology, optics, and what are now characterized as pure and applied mathematics. In particular, he performed experiments in ballistics and the refraction of light. He was one of the first, if not the first, to consider the imaginary roots of equations. Much of his earliest as well as latest mathematical work bore on questions of navigation, including such issues as the construction of rhumb lines (or loxodromes) on sailing charts. He also devised a novel form of cross-staff, an early navigational instrument. (See navigation: latitude measurements.) Although, after his early voyages, he pursued a life of research, it was not a life free of turmoil, since his principal patron, Raleigh, was imprisoned in 1603 in the Tower of London on orders of King James I of England. Harriot witnessed Raleigh\u2019s execution in 1618. In the turmoil following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, Harriot was arrested upon suspicion of having cast the king\u2019s horoscope, though he was soon released. (Percy, as a co-conspirator in the plot, joined Raleigh in the Tower of London.) From the early 1590s, Harriot had developed a reputation for atheism and was referred to rather obliquely as a conjurer by Raleigh\u2019s enemies. However, there is nothing in Harriot\u2019s writings or those of his friends to substantiate any non-Christian beliefs; the accusations may merely reflect his likely belief in atomism, which at the time was considered by some to obviate the necessity for the existence of God.\n\nConcurrently with Galileo Galilei\u2019s introduction of telescopic observations of the heavens in 1609, Harriot commenced telescopic observations, some systematic, others not. He drew charts of the Moon, followed the paths of the moons of Jupiter, and observed sunspots. He also observed comets.\n\nDuring his lifetime Harriot was known in England among the philosophically inclined, and his reputation extended to the continent to the extent that the astronomer Johannes Kepler initiated a correspondence with him. His only other book, however, was the posthumously published Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas (1631; \u201cApplication of Analytical Art to Solving Algebraic Equations\u201d). (The editor of this work introduced the signs \u2219 for multiplication, > for greater than, and < for less than.) Although Harriot published little and kept some of his studies secret, such as the discovery of the sine law of refraction (now known as Snell\u2019s law), his work was not done in isolation; he drew around himself a group of admiring scholars, at least some of whom were cognizant of some of his discoveries. In subsequent centuries Harriot was never forgotten, but it has been mainly since the mid-20th century that scholars have made close and systematic studies of his thousands of pages of manuscripts and uncovered the full extent of his investigations."}, {"url": "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Harriot/", "page_content": "20\n\n1577\n\n1560\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1580\n\n1583\n\n1587\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1584\n\n1585\n\n86\n\n9\n\n1585\n\n19\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1586\n\n1586\n\n1588\n\n1589\n\n1590\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1590\n\n1595\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1597\n\n1597\n\n1601\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1621\n\n20\n\n1637\n\n1590\n\n1590\n\n1607\n\n1600\n\n1599\n\n1600\n\n24\n\n1603\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n1605\n\n27\n\n1621\n\n1605\n\n1605\n\n1606\n\n(\n\n)\n\n17\n\n1607\n\n(\n\n)\n\n26\n\n1609\n\n9\n\n5\n\n6\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1611\n\n32\n\n17\n\n1610\n\n26\n\n1612\n\n199\n\n8\n\n1610\n\n18\n\n1613\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1614\n\n1618\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1618\n\n1603\n\n29\n\n1618\n\n1613\n\n1615\n\n(\n\n)\n\n12\n\n1591\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1998\n\n(\n\n)\n\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n(1631)\n\n10\n\nwas a mathematician and astronomer who founded the English school of algebra. He is described inby Fauvel and Goulding as:-yet his name has only recently become widely known, and even now his achievements are not fully appreciated by most mathematicians.We know very little of Harriot's youth. In fact all that is known is that on FridayDecemberhe matriculated at the University of Oxford with an entry in the official records giving his age as seventeen, his father as a plebeian, and his birthplace Oxfordshire. It is from this record that his date of birth is deduced to beand we know that his father was a \"commoner\" but the very fact that Harriot was entering Oxford means that it is unlikely that he came from the poorest classes. Despite extensive searches of the Oxfordshire records, no further information concerning his birth or parentage has been foundalthough a number of possible relatives have been identifiedAs an undergraduate at Oxford, Harriot was a student at St Mary's Hall. He became friends with Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Allen, both lecturers at the university, but not at St Mary's Hall. Harriot graduated inand went to London. It is not clear exactly what he did in his first few years there but, probably from late, he entered Sir Walter Raleigh's service. Hakluyt, dedicating a preface to Raleigh in February, wrotesee for example:-Harriot wrote a text called Arcticon which was never published and unfortunately no copies have ever been found. This work was essentially his lecture course given at Durham House, Raleigh's lodgings in The Strand in London, where Harriot lived at this time. The lectures were given to the seamen who were being gathered by Raleigh to participate in his expeditions to the New World. Pepper describes the advances in navigational techniques made by Harriot by the time he wrote Arcticon:-As Roche notes in:-It was not only as a navigational instructor that Raleigh employed Harriot. He was involved with the design of the ships for Raleigh's expeditions as well as being involved in the construction of the vessels and selecting the seamen. He was Raleigh's accountant, being responsible for obtaining funding for the expeditions and keeping all the accounts.Raleigh had the captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe make an expedition to Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina in. Although there is no direct evidence that Harriot made this voyage, Quinn inargues convincingly that he was one of those making this preliminary survey. Harriot was certainly on a voyage to Virginia organised by Raleigh in. He sailed from Plymouth onAprilon board the Tiger and his observations of a solar eclipse onApril have allowed modern scientists to compute the exact position of the ship on that day. Harriot made many notes during his time in the New World, being particularly interested in the language and customsparticularly the eating habitsof the inhabitants. The object of the voyage was to colonise the New World but it was not successful in this aim.Drake was engaged in sea battles with the Spanish when he learnt that they intended to prevent the British colonists becoming established. Although Drake met up with the colonists, in Junethere were severe storms and there was a hurried return to England by Harriot and most of the party. Harriot, together with Drake's ships, landed at Portsmouth in Julyand he went immediately to Raleigh to report on the expedition. He published A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia in, a book in which he recommends the smoking of tobacco which he himself had learnt to do in Virginia. However, he also wrote a full account of the voyage which, for some reason, he never published and, despite strenuous attempts to find a copy, seems lost.By the time Harriot had returned, Raleigh had turned his attention to Ireland. Harriot carried out surveys of the Lismore estate, which was owned by Raleigh, beginning in. Nine years later he was still involved in working out the acreage of plots being leased on the estate. However the political situation was about to change and this would have dramatic implications for Harriot.Already in thes there were allegations against Raleigh of atheism. The charges were against Raleigh's school and \"the conjurer that is master thereof\". Harriot felt that this was a reference to him and he discussed the allegations with John Dee who also felt that the charges might relate to him. There is no reason to believe that Harriotor Raleighwere atheists but certainly they were free thinkers and Harriot's scientific approach to the world was, to say the least, viewed with great suspicion by the church. As well as problems caused by allegations, Dee and Harriot discussed scientific and mathematical matters in thes.Harriot had now moved from working for Raleigh to working for Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke had around him a circle of friends who were scholars, many of whom held a atomistic views. Raleigh's life became so chaotic that Harriot had sought the support of a patron who could provide more stability for his scientific pursuits. Inthe Duke made property in Durham over to Harriot and he moved up the social ladder becoming a member of the \"landed gentry\". Harriot also later held estates in Cornwall and Norfolk. Not long after the Durham transaction, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syonnear Kew outside Londonwhich Harriot used both as a residence and as a scientific laboratory.We certainly know from manuscripts which survive that Harriot was engaged in deep studies of optics at Syon by. Although init states that he had discovered the sine law of refraction of light before, in fact we now know that the precise date of Harriot's important discovery was July. As with all his other mathematical discoveries, however, Harriot did not publish his findings. It is somewhat ironical, however, that Snell to whom the discovery of this law is now attributedwas not the first to publish the result. Snell 's discovery was in, aboutyears after Harriot's discovery, but the result was not published until Descartes put it in print inOne of the optical problems which Harriot did study in thes was Alhazen 's problem. He gave a solution to Alhazen 's problem which involved considering an equivalent problem, namely the problem of the maximum intercept formed between a circle and a diameter of a chord rotating about a point on a circle. The author ofconjectures that Harriot may have used infinitesimal techniques in demonstrating the equivalence of these problems, and certainly we know that Harriot introduced ideas later rediscovered by Barrow Optics was not the only topic to occupy Harriot during this period. He had been asked by Raleigh in the earlys to apply his mathematical skills to the science of gunnery. At this time ideas of the trajectory taken by a projectile were still dominated by Aristotle 's thinking. Harriot resolved the forces acting on the projectile into horizontal and vertical components. He understood that air resistance acted throughout the whole flight, and that gravity acted on the vertical component. He came very close to a vector analysis solution of the problem of finding the velocity of the projectile and, certainly by, he came to the conclusion that the path of the projectile was a tilted parabola . He made one error, however,:-Other topics which Harriot began to work on beforewere problems of chemistry. He worked intensively on chemistry for almost exactly a year from Mayto Mayand, although his experiments were conducted with a new scientific precision, he made no discoveries of particular note.Raleigh had been a particular favourite of Elizabeth I and, when she died onMarch, it was clear that Raleigh's fortunes would change. Perhaps it is less clear that Harriot, by this time not so closely associated with Raleigh, would find problems too. James I became king and he quickly saw Raleigh as someone opposed to his claims to the throne. Henry Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, had taken care to put himself on a good footing with James with a letter of support for him only days before Elizabeth died. In July plots were discovered against James and Raleigh was arrested and charged with high treason.Raleigh attempted suicide but failed. He then sought Harriot's help in obtaining evidence on his behalf. Raleigh was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. Poor Harriot was singled out in the judgement as being an atheist and an evil influence. His attempts to help Raleigh had been based on Christian principlesto which undoubtedly he adheredbut this had rather damaged Raleigh as Harriot was seen an atheist using Christian principles for convenience. Harriot was devastated and for about a year undertook no new scientific work as he tried to come to terms with what was happening. Raleigh received a last-minute reprieve from the death sentence but was imprisoned in the Tower of London.Another plot was to lead to further trouble. OnNovemberGuy Fawkes and others were arrested for attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament. Four others, including Thomas Percy, the grandson of Henry Percy, were also arrested as the main conspirators. Harriot was held on suspicion of being involved and imprisoned in the Gatehouse. He was interrogated on the charge that he had cast a horoscope of King James in an attempt to use magical powers to influence the King's future. OnNovember Henry Percy, Harriot's patron, was also put in the Tower where he remained untilwhen he was released. No evidence seems to have been found against Harriot and, although he remained in the Gatehouse for some while writing several letters requesting his release, he was a free man probably by the end ofAs soon as he was released, Harriot returned to his work on optics. He now considered more complex systems and employed Christopher Tooke as a lens grinder from early. His work on light now moved to the dispersion of light into colours. He began to develop a theory for the rainbow and, by Kepler had heard of the remarkable results on optics achieved by Harriot. Kepler wrote to Harriot, but the correspondence never really achieved any significant exchange of ideas. Perhaps Harriot was too wary of the difficulties that his work had nearly brought on him, or perhaps he didas he claimed to Kepler ) still intend to publish his results if his health permitted. still intend to publish his results if his health permitted.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on The appearance of a comet attracted Harriot's attention and turned his scientific mind towards astronomy. He observed a comet on 17 September September 1607 from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as from Ilfracombe which would later be identified as Halley's Comet. 's Comet. Kepler had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend had discovered the comet six days earlier but it would be the observations of Harriot and his friend ( and student and student ) William Lower which eventually were used by William Lower which eventually were used by Bessel to compute its orbit. to compute its orbit.\n\n\n\nHis astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On His astronomy brought back to the fore, Harriot went on to make the earliest telescopic observations in England. On 26 July July 1609 at at 9 p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time p.m. he sketched the Moon which was at that time 5 days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of days old, viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 6 .

I saw but one and that alone\n\nhe must have already been aware of\n\n's discovery. As with all his scientific discoveries, Harriot did not publish his results. These observations of Jupiter's moons were made between\n\n17\n\nOctober\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n26\n\nFebruary\n\n1612\n\n.\n\nHe was the first to discover sunspots, making\n\n199\n\nobservations between\n\n8\n\nDecember\n\n1610\n\nand\n\n18\n\nJanuary\n\n1613\n\n. The first observation of sunspots was made while he was observing Jupiter's moons. From the data he collected he was able to deduce the period of the Sun's rotation. However, around this time his scientific work basically came to an end. He seems to have had his spirits brought low by the deaths of his friends and lost the spirit to continue research\n\n(\n\nwhich had brought him much trouble despite his lack of publications\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOf the few pieces of work done by Harriot after\n\n1614\n\n, one was his observation of another comet in\n\n1618\n\n(\n\nthere were three visible comets that year and Harriot observed the third\n\n)\n\nfrom Syon House. In\n\n1618\n\nRaleigh, who had been shown the clemency of imprisonment in\n\n1603\n\nrather than death, was put to death. Raleigh was executed on\n\n29\n\nOctober\n\n1618\n\nin a public execution, with Harriot present to witness the event. However, by this time Harriot was already suffering from the cancer of the nose which eventually led to his death.\n\nThe cancer seems to have started around\n\n1613\n\n, about the time when Harriot lost interest in pushing forward his mathematical and scientific research. He consulted the top specialist in\n\n1615\n\nwho wrote report on the consultation. He described Harriot as\n\n(\n\nsee for example\n\n)\n\n:-\n\n... a man somewhat melancholy. ... A cancerous ulcer in the left nostril eats up the septum of his nose and in proportion to its size holds the lips hard and turned upwards. It has gradually crept well into the nose. This evil the patient has suffered the last two years.\n\nHarriot would suffer this \"evil\" for a further three years before the cancer took his life.\n\nThere are a few other major mathematical achievements due to Harriot which we should mention. He exhibited the logarithmic spiral as the\n\nof a\n\non a sphere, a projection he proved to be\n\n. The loxodromes are the straight lines on the\n\nmap, which Harriot computed with great precision. In fact in order to achieve this degree of precision, Harriot introduced finite-difference interpolation.\n\nThere is an interesting history to a problem which has only recently been solved, yet originated with Harriot. Raleigh asked Harriot to solve certain problems regarding the stacking of cannonballs. On a manuscript dated\n\n12\n\nDecember\n\n1591\n\n(\n\nSunday\n\n)\n\n, Harriot set out a table to answer Raleigh's questions. He shows how, if the number of cannonballs is given, one can compute the number of cannonballs to be placed in the base of a pyramid with a triangular, square or oblong base. Raleigh posed a second question, which Harriot also answered, namely given the pyramid of cannonballs, compute the number in the pile.\n\nHarriot was too much the mathematician to stop there, however. From a study of how the cannonballs could fill space, he considered the implications for the\n\nof matter which he believed in. Later, in his correspondence with\n\nabout atomic theory, Harriot mentioned the packing problem.\n\ncould not solve the problem but he believed that the densest packing of spheres would be attained if in each layer the centres of the spheres were above the centres of the holes in the layer below. This seems intuitively obvious, but resisted proof until\n\n1998\n\nwhen Thomas Hales of the University of Michigan\n\n(\n\nwith the help of hours of computer generated data\n\n)\n\nfinally proved the conjecture.\n\nThe one part of Harriot's work which we have not yet described is the mathematical work for which, in some ways, he is best known, namely his work on algebra. He introduced a simplified notation for algebra and his fundamental research on the theory of equations was far ahead of its time. As an example of his abilities to solve equations, even when the roots are negative or imaginary, we reproduce his solution of an equation of degree\n\n4\n\n. The example in question is in his own handwriting and reproduced in\n\n.\n\naaaa - 6aa + 136a = 1155 ------------------------------------ aaaa -2aa + 1 = 4aa -136a + 1156 aa - 1 = 2a - 34 33 = 2a - aa aa - 2a = -33 aa - 2a + 1 = +1 - 33 a - 1 = \u221a-32 1 - a = \u221a-32 a = 1 + \u221a-32 a = 1 - \u221a-32 ------------------------------------ aa - 1 = 34 - 2a aa + 2a = 35 aa + 2a + 1 = 1 + 35 a + 1 = \u221a36 a = \u221a36 - 1 = 5 ------------------------------------ -a - 1 = \u221a36 a = -\u221a36 - 1 = -7\n\n.\n\nHarriot invented certain symbols which are used today. However, the symbols < for \"less than\" and > for \"greater than\" were not due to Harriot\n\n(\n\nas is often claimed\n\n)\n\n, but were introduced by the editor of Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n\u24c9 ( The analytical art by which algebraic equations can be resolved )\n\n- Harriot himself used different symbols. There is still scholarly debate on how much Harriot was influenced by\n\n, or whether notation and ideas introduced by\n\nwere learnt by him from Harriot.\n\nAs we have seen from the example above, Harriot did outstanding work on the solution of equations, recognising negative roots and complex roots in a way that makes his solutions look like a present day solution. He made the observation that if\n\na , b , c a, b, c a , b , c\n\nare the roots of a\n\nthen the cubic is\n\n( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0 (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0 ( x \u2212 a ) ( x \u2212 b ) ( x \u2212 c ) = 0\n\n. This is a major step forward in understanding which Harriot then carried forward to equations of higher degree.\n\nAlthough he was far ahead of his time, his work had far less influence than it should have done since, as we have remarked repeatedly above, he published no mathematical work in his lifetime. Even his work on algebra Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas\n\n(1631)\n\nwas published\n\n10\n\nyears after his death and was edited by people who did not fully appreciate the depth of his work. For example, it does not discuss negative solutions.\n\nReferences (show)\n\nJ A Lohne, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography ( New York 1970 - 1990) .\n\nSee THIS LINK.

A telescopic device appears to have been constructed by the noted English polymath Leonard Digges (1515\u2013c. 1559) as early as the first half of the 1500s and later reiterated by his son, Thomas Digges, in a communication dated to 1571:\n\n[H]is divine mind aided with this science of Geometrical mensurations, found out the quantities, distances, courses, and strange intricate miraculous motions of these resplendent heavenly Globes of Sun, Moon , Planets and Stares fixed, leaving the rules and precepts thereof to his posterity. Archimedes also (as some suppose) with a glass framed by revolution of a section Parabolicall, fired the Roman navy in the sea coming to the siege of Syracuse. But to leave these celestial causes and things done of antiquity long ago, my father by his continual painful [painstaking] practices, assisted with demonstrations Mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places.\n\nThis intriguing tract, which appears on page 5 of the preface to his posthumously published book Pantometria (1571), provides the modern reader with an intriguing glimpse of a telescopic device made with lenses and mirrors. In a lively debate that took place in March 1993 organized by the Scientific Instrument Society (SIS) and held at Burlington House, London, Colin Ronan spoke in favor of the existence of such an early telescope, while the late Professor Gerard Turner, based at the Museum for the History of Science, Oxford, UK, provided a robust counterpoint. During the debate, a replica of the alleged Digges telescope was presented to all in attendance.\n\nThe device consisted of a simple biconvex objective lens, the light of which was incident to a focusing mirror that relayed the image to the eye. Mounted inside a wooden tube, the device magnified 11 times and did produce an enlarged image, but with a very narrow field of view, and was additionally plagued by chromatic aberration \u2013 a consequence of using a singlet lens as an objective. There is, as yet, no consensus on whether such a telescope ever saw the light of day.\n\nHarriot and his assistant, Christopher Tooke, set up a telescope magnifying 6 times on the grounds of Syon Park, and on the clement evening of July 26, 1609, turned it on a five-day-old crescent Moon, immediately sketching what he saw. Various lunar \u2018seas\u2019 are included in these lunar portraits, including the Mare Crisium, Tranquilitatis and Fecunditatis, as well as some rugged lunar features situated along the terminator, which modern scholars have identified as Theophilus and Cyrillus. Curiously, this first sketch does not record any craters, although 6\u00d7 is certainly large enough to resolve several of the more prominent ones.\n\nOut of sheer curiosity, in a separate investigation, this author used a modern spyglass with an uncoated, 1-inch diameter object glass, also having a magnification of 6\u00d7, in the wee small hours (01:30 h UT) of January 1, 2016, to record observations of the last quarter Moon and Jupiter, as they cleared the treetops in the eastern sky. Like Harriot\u2019s telescope, the spyglass gave an erect, correctly orientated image but enjoyed a much larger field of view (approximately 4 angular degrees). Nonetheless, this author could confirm that many lunar craters can indeed be observed with a steady hand, as well as clearly showing various maria . Turning to Jupiter, then just a few degrees above the Moon, the telescope could clearly reveal four Galilean satellites all to one side of the planet (Fig. 1.3).\n\nFig. 1.3 The author\u2019s 6\u00d7 achromatic spyglass used to corroborate Harriot\u2019s observations. (Image by the author) Full size image\n\nIt will come as somewhat of a surprise to the contemporary reader not acquainted with a Galilean telescope that, despite its very low magnifying power, its field of view was very restrictive \u2013 typically just over half the diameter of the full Moon! As a result, Harriot could not have seen the entire countenance of the lunar crescent even at the low magnifications his telescopes delivered. Incredibly, though, Harriot made many more drawings of the Moon, some of which display finer cartographic details than Galileo\u2019s later drawings, but they were frustratingly left undated. When we take into account the radically different personalities of both Galileo (explored in the next chapter) and Harriot, we can see that both men had entirely different modi operandi. Harriot, having spent time in Virginia, was a draughtsman and well acquainted with mapmaking. His methods were slow and methodical. Harriot was categorically not seeking fame and fortune in the same way that Galileo was, and, according to Dr. Chapman , because Harriot had two high profile friends on \u2018death row\u2019 in the Tower, he had little desire to make himself conspicuous.\n\nBy the closing weeks of 1609, Harriot dispatched Tooke, his able technician, to the residence of Sir William Lower at Trefenti, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, instructing him to fashion several other Galilean cylinders in order that he and his philosophical chums, a one Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Protheroe (and possibly a few others), could begin their own telescopic investigations of the Moon and other celestial bodies. The surviving exchanges between Harrriot and the \u2018Carmartenshire philosophers,\u2019 clearly unveil their avowed acceptance of the Copernican system, as well as Kepler\u2019s elliptical theory of planetary orbits. This meeting may well be first known record of an astronomical society, the members of which were to confirm Galileo\u2019s monumental telescopic work by observing the large Jovian satellites and the erstwhile \u201cinvisible\u201d stars in the Pleiades.\n\nOver the next few years, Harriot was to complete his now famous Moon maps, as well as embarking on a detailed study of the Sun. His method involved observing the intensely bright solar disk, when it was near the horizon and veiled behind mist and thin cloud (the reader should, under no circumstances, attempt such an observation!). Harriot is credited as the co-discover of sunspots, recording them at or about the same time as Galileo, and possibly earlier than Christopher Scheiner (1573\u20131650) and Johannes Fabricius (1587\u20131616), who themselves yielded additional evidence against the time-honored cosmology of Ptolemy (Fig. 1.4).\n\nFig. 1.4 Christoph Scheiner (1573\u20131650), the Jesuit priest and astronomer, with his telescope shown on his left. (Image courtesy of Wiki Commons. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Scheiner#/media/File:Scheiner_christoph.gif) Full size image\n\nOver the next 2 years, Harriot was to carry out some 450 observations of the Sun and its dark spots, never once claiming their discovery for himself, studying how they moved across its otherwise brilliant face, breaking up and sometimes even disappearing. Indeed, modern scholars were able to establish a solar rotation period of 27.154 days from Harriot\u2019s drawings \u2013 uncannily close to the modern accepted value of 27.2753 days. This affirms the accuracy and attention to detail so central to Harriot\u2019s methodology.\n\nAccording to Dr. Chapman , Tooke may have made improvements to the basic Dutch trunke, and referring to a study conducted by the distinguished historian of astronomy and cosmology, the late Professor John North (1934\u20132008) identified no less than six telescopes associated with Harriot and the \u2018Trefentine\u2019 philosophers, which ranged in power from 6\u00d7 up to 50\u00d7. Tooke is likely to be among the first bona fide telescope makers in Britain, a tradition that was to be continued over the following centuries.\n\nAlthough Harriot embraced the Christian message from his youth, even writing the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the Algonquin language , some scholars have suggested that he may have experienced a brief religious hiatus as he approached middle age. Doubtless, the revolution heralded by the application of the telescope to the celestial realm had raised new questions in the minds of his learned contemporaries. Why were the astronomical bodies puckered and imperfect? How did God create everything from nothing? Was His divine hand needed at every stage, from the formation of atoms to the completion of worlds? Was the allegory of the universe even attributed to a personal God or was it merely blind chance? These questions weighed heavily in the mind of Thomas Harriot.\n\nDr. Chapman acknowledges that nothing firm can be adduced from Harriot\u2019s surviving notes and correspondences, but he is inclined to the view that the world\u2019s first telescopic astronomer re-embraced his Christian heritage in the final decade of his life, as evidenced by his 1615 correspondence with the king\u2019s physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne, who assured Harriot of the certainty of the existence of one all-powerful God. From his days in Virginia, Harriot had taken to \u2018drinking\u2019 tobacco smoke, as his contemporaries had referred to it. Earlier physicians had hailed the new wonder drug as an effective remedy to counter the \u201cdangerous moist humors of the body.\u201d But three decades of heavy inhalation of tobacco smoke was to take its toll on Harriot\u2019s health, and he developed a cancerous lesion on his nose.\n\nBecause many tumors of this sort have a tendency to metastasize, spreading to other organs of the body via the lymph nodes, Harriot was arguably history\u2019s first clearly attested tobacco-induced cancer victim, dying on July 2, 1621. He was laid to rest at his local Parish Church of St. Christopher-le-Stocks, located in the heart of the city of London. And while the church was razed to the ground by the Great Fire of 1666 and another resurrected on the original site by none other than Sir Christopher Wren (1632\u20131723), this too was eventually demolished in 1781 in order to make way for a grand new building that would became the headquarters of the Bank of England. In the 1970s, however, the gravestone dedicated to Thomas Harriot was recovered, and, in his honor, a new plaque carrying his gravestone inscription was unveiled inside the bank.\n\nIt is difficult to crystallize the legacy of Thomas Harriot, being so far removed from him in time, but these words come to mind; learned, diligent, enterprising, kind, loyal, uncompetitive, humble and God-fearing. Despite not marrying and raising children, he lived a fulfilled life without a bad word to say about his fellow men, rendered all the more remarkable owing to his great wealth and lifelong connection with the rich and powerful."}, {"url": "https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/hariot-thomas-ca-1560-1621/", "page_content": "Oxford and Durham House Hariot enters the historical record with his matriculation at Oxford in 1577 at the age of seventeen. His tentative date of birth is based on this information. Notes written at the time indicate that he was raised in Oxfordshire and his father was a commoner. Nothing else for certain is known about his early life. Hariot arrived at Oxford with exceptional talents in mathematics and the sciences, but at a time when these subjects were not particularly valued. This was beginning to change, however, as English adventurers began to recognize the connection between mathematics and the navigational arts necessary to further the nation\u2019s developing interests in colonization, piracy, privateering, and trade, especially in North America. At Oxford, Hariot met Richard Hakluyt (the younger), who went on to edit the influential Principall Navigations of the English Nation (1589), a polemic on behalf of future English colonization disguised as a history of past English successes. Hariot also probably knew Thomas Allen, an Oxford faculty member who collected the latest manuscripts, books, and instruments connected with mathematics and astronomy. After receiving a BA from Oxford in 1580, Hariot relocated to London, where his interest in applying mathematics and astronomy to questions of navigation brought him to the attention of Walter Raleigh. A favorite of Queen Elizabeth I, Raleigh had obtained permission to establish English colonies in North America. By 1583, Hariot was serving Raleigh at his London residence, Durham House, by focusing on open-sea navigation. The Portuguese and Spanish understood how to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the New World, but the English, with notable exceptions such as Sir Francis Drake, did not and were forced to hug the coasts. Before he could teach it, Hariot needed to master the subject himself, and he set about collecting, building, and learning to use standard navigational instruments, including the astrolabe, cross staff, and sextant. He studied the mathematics required to determine one\u2019s position in the open ocean, collected the best sea charts and maps, and learned the basics of astronomy necessary to navigate by the stars, moon, and sun. He then began lecturing to Raleigh\u2019s sea captains on these subjects in his room at Durham House and collected the knowledge in the now-lost Arcticon. Raleigh was planning to attempt a colony on the mid-Atlantic coast of North America and in 1584 sent a reconnaissance voyage that landed on Roanoke Island. There, commanders Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe met and returned to England with two Virginia Indians, Manteo and Wanchese. Recognizing that communication with the Indians would be crucial for a successful colony, Hariot worked with the two men and learned to speak their form of the Algonquian language. Hariot even developed his own phonetic alphabet, which allowed him to record the sounds of Algonquian words and to create a now-lost English-Algonquian dictionary. Hariot\u2019s work in this area made him one of the most advanced linguists of the day and recommended him as a member of Raleigh\u2019s Roanoke expedition in 1585.\n\nRoanoke and A briefe and true report A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia The Roanoke colonists were mostly military men, the most prominent exceptions being Hariot and the artist John White, who had served as expedition artist on one of Martin Frobisher\u2019s voyages to Greenland. The colonists arrived at Roanoke late in June 1585, but one of their ships ran aground and they lost much of their provisions. After the departure in August of the colony\u2019s two commanders, Sir Richard Grenville and Thomas Cavendish, Ralph Lane assumed governorship, and his relations with the local Indians were friendly at first. The situation deteriorated, however, as the Englishmen failed to find reliable sources of food, and when Sir Francis Drake arrived in June 1586, Lane decided to return the surviving colonists to England. The year had not been a waste for Hariot, though. With the help of Manteo and Wanchese, and in the company of John White, he had explored the area surrounding Roanoke and, with White, joined a party that sailed north to the Chesapeake Bay and up the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers, even encountering the Chesapeake Indians at their principal town of Skicoac. He and White used these travels to collaborate on the first accurate maps of the east coast of North America. Using angle-measuring tools to establish latitude and longitude, Hariot mapped out triangle-shaped areas and either recorded these angles in a notebook for later use or, while in the field, sketched these triangles directly onto a sheet of paper attached to a plane table. White, an accomplished painter and illustrator, then finished the maps. While some of the White-Hariot maps remained in manuscript form and did not receive wide circulation, others\u2014such as the small map of Roanoke Island and the large map of the entire Outer Banks region\u2014appeared in Theodor de Bry\u2019s illustrated edition of Hariot\u2019s A briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia, becoming models for their time of accurate cartography in the New World. A briefe and true report was, perhaps, Hariot\u2019s most important contribution to England\u2019s colonization efforts. First published in 1588, it appeared again the next year as part of Richard Hakluyt (the younger\u2019s) Principall Navigations. Hakluyt then convinced de Bry to publish a third version as the initial volume in his America series. This last includes etchings of the White-Hariot maps as well as etchings based on White\u2019s watercolor portraits of Virginia Indians and scenes of Indian life. Published in English, French, German, and Latin, the de Bry version enjoyed a wide European audience. While the Report is sometimes considered scientific, it is more accurately viewed as commercial discourse. Throughout, Hariot argues four related points. First, the 1585 colony failed because many members of the colony were unprepared for the rigors of colonization. Although these men slandered the colony and its leaders upon arriving home, in Hariot\u2019s view Raleigh\u2019s colonization program should be allowed to continue. Second, the Roanokes and other Indian tribes are not to be feared by the English, who possess superior technology and culture. Third, the land in Virginia is abundant enough to provide future colonists with adequate food and building materials. And fourth, Virginia offers a less expensive source for a wide range of trade goods, including shipping supplies, dyes for the cloth industry, and wine.\n\nLater Years In 1595, Hariot received land from Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, to allow him to continue his scientific and mathematical work. Percy was imprisoned in 1605 for his connection to the Gunpowder Plot, an attempt on the life of King James I on behalf of greater freedom for English Catholics. Hariot\u2019s connection to Percy also landed him in prison, but only briefly. (Percy\u2019s younger brother George was one of the original Jamestown colonists.) Sir Walter Raleigh also ran afoul of the king and was beheaded in 1618. In the meantime, Hariot pursued his interest in astronomy. His unpublished notes on the appearance of Halley\u2019s Comet in 1607 were later used to accurately calculate its orbit. In 1609, he used a telescope of his own making to sketch the moon\u2014four months before the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei more famously accomplished the same feat. In 1610, he was the first to observe sunspots, and in 1611, he produced the first map of the moon. Hariot died in London on July 2, 1621, of cancer of the nose, probably caused by heavy tobacco use. A posthumous work, Artis Analyticae Praxis, published in 1631, helped to establish the English school of algebra."}, {"url": "https://theconversation.com/the-scientific-genius-who-eschewed-fame-remembering-thomas-harriot-400-years-on-163167", "page_content": "Four hundred years ago, on July 2 1621, a remarkable Englishman named Thomas Harriot died in London. He left behind some 8,000 pages of scientific research, but it is only in recent decades that scholars have uncovered their treasures.\n\nAnd what they show is that Harriot independently made many significant discoveries now attributed to other, more famous scientists. Some scholars have called him \u201cthe English Galileo\u201d and \u201cthe greatest British mathematical scientist before Newton\u201d.\n\nYet Harriot died without publishing a single word of this extraordinary output. His tale reminds us that, while we may sometimes think science progresses through a series of famous pioneers who single-handedly overturn entrenched beliefs, the story is rarely so simple.\n\nWhat did Harriot discover?\n\nFor instance, we learn in school that Galileo Galilei initiated telescopic astronomy and discovered the law of falling motion. But Harriot independently did both of these things.\n\nHe also deduced fledgling general laws governing the motion of everyday objects, again independently of Galileo, and before Ren\u00e9 Descartes. (Half a century later, Isaac Newton developed the definitive laws of motion.)\n\nHarriot studied light, too, discovering the secret of colour and the nature of the rainbow before Newton, and finding the law of refraction (which we know today as Snell\u2019s law) before the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snell.\n\nHe also made a mathematical study of population growth before Thomas Malthus, developed a completely symbolic form of sophisticated algebra before Descartes, discovered binary arithmetic before Gottfried Leibniz, and took steps on the road to calculus with his work on infinite series.\n\nThe law of falling bodies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 that Harriot\u2019s work on gravity was fully reconstructed, by the German scholar Matthias Schemmel.\n\nAs Schemmel pointed out, Harriot and his contemporary Galileo were heirs to essentially the same body of knowledge. It\u2019s perhaps not so surprising, then, that they made some of the same breakthroughs. There are plenty of examples of independent co-discoveries in history, most famously that of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nThe law of falling motion says that without air resistance all objects, no matter their size or mass, fall from the same height at the same rate.\n\nLegend has it Galileo dropped balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to study how they fell. Nobody knows if this is true, but Harriot had the same idea: he recorded the time, in pulse beats, that it took for different objects falling from as high as 55\u00bd feet (about 17 metres) to reach the ground.\n\nRead more: Copernicus' revolution and Galileo's vision: our changing view of the universe in pictures\n\nBoth Harriot and Galileo devised more accurate experiments, however, from which they derived a mathematical understanding of how things fall.\n\nThis combination of experiment and mathematics is now the accepted way to derive a law of nature. Quantifying observations means others can test the results, and use them to make useful predictions.\n\nHarriot and Galileo were not the first to understand the role of observation and mathematics in this context, of course. But they were among the most successful of the pre-Newtonian pioneers.\n\nGalileo didn\u2019t publish his work on gravity until after Harriot had died, and there\u2019s no evidence that the two men ever met or corresponded.\n\nThe law of refraction and the shape of the rainbow\n\nThe German astronomer Johannes Kepler, however, did correspond briefly with Harriot. Kepler had been working on the nature of light and vision when word reached him that Harriot had unravelled two mysteries: the law of refraction, and why the rainbow has its magical colours and its unique shape.\n\nThe law of refraction describes how light bends when it passes from one medium into another, which explains how an image can be focused by a glass lens or why your leg looks wobbly when you dip it in a swimming pool.\n\nHarriot derived this law 20 years before Snell, but there\u2019s a popular belief that the 10th-century Baghdad-based scholar Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ibn Sahl beat even Harriot. This is not quite right: Ibn Sahl is a notable pioneer whose geometrical diagram of light focussed by a lens gives, in hindsight, the correct refractive path. But there\u2019s no evidence he deduced his result from experiment, or that he understood the general properties of refraction.\n\nJudging from his surviving papers even Snell failed to generalise his result, which he, like Ibn Sahl, never wrote as the neat trigonometric equation we use today. Harriot, by contrast, did: his derivation of the general law of refraction is another example of his rigorous blend of experiment and mathematics.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why are rainbows round?\n\nHarriot\u2019s other adventures\n\nIf only Harriot had published! In the early stage of his career, though, he was bound by commercial secrecy, for his first patron was the controversial statesman and entrepreneur Sir Walter Raleigh. Harriot was also busy dodging heretic hunters and sailing the high seas as Raleigh\u2019s navigational advisor.\n\nRaleigh had delusions of empire and glory, and wanted to establish a trading colony in today\u2019s USA before the Spanish beat him to it. The one work Harriot did publish in his lifetime was \u201ca brief and true report\u201d on the economic potential of Raleigh\u2019s chosen American site.\n\nHarriot\u2019s contribution to colonialism has justly attracted its share of criticism. Nonetheless, his report is still widely praised for its sympathetic depiction of the way of life of the North Carolina Algonquian people, as it was when Europeans first set foot on their land. Harriot learned the local language, and enjoyed much about the year he spent living with the Algonquians.\n\nWhat he loved doing most, though, was mathematics and physics. He was neither flamboyant nor ambitious, and when he was wrongfully imprisoned through an unlucky connection with the Gunpowder Plot (a failed attempt to assassinate King James I), he told his jailers he just wanted\n\nto live a private life for the love of learning that I might study freely.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the late 1590s Harriot had found a second patron, Henry Percy, the ninth earl of Northumberland. It was then that he was able to study the mysteries of nature and the marvels of mathematics for their own sakes, rather than the \u201capplied\u201d work he had done for Raleigh.\n\nHaving two generous patrons meant Harriot did not need to publicise his discoveries to attract funding, the way Galileo did. Nor did he care about fame, despite being urged by friends to claim his priority. His manuscripts do contain several almost finished treatises, but it seems he was so busy doing science that he never managed to put his results together for the printer.\n\nAfter his death, well-meaning scholars carved up his manuscripts in an attempt to study and publish them. In the process, however, all the papers disappeared, seemingly lost forever. Then, 150 years later, the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver Zach discovered them, locked safely away in Northumberland\u2019s castle.\n\nMost of the papers were then given to the British Museum. They are now in the British Library, where I had the privilege of studying them.

Much of his work involved astronomy, navigation, and geometry: an employee and associate of Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618), he was at the center of English efforts to conquer the seas and the New World.\n\nHarriot was educated at St. Mary's Hall, Oxford University, from whence he received his B.A. in 1580. For a time, he appears to have worked as a mathematics tutor in London before securing employment with Raleigh in 1584. The famous gentleman-explorer needed someone to teach navigation to his sailors, and for this purpose Harriot composed a manuscript\u2014long since lost\u2014called the Articon.\n\nDuring the following year, Raleigh sent Harriot with a group of colonists to Roanoke Island off the coast of what is now North Carolina. (These were not the inhabitants of the famous \"Lost Colony\": the first settlement lasted only 10 months before being disbanded, and the doomed Lost Colony settlers arrived in 1587.) Working with artist John White (d. 1593?), Harriot was responsible for studying the indigenous peoples, as well as the local vegetation, animal life, and other natural resources. He published A Briefe and True Report, an account of his findings, in 1588.\n\nDuring the three decades that followed, Harriot's patrons\u2014first Raleigh and then Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland (1564-1632), for whom he went to work in 1595\u2014ran afoul of the English royal house. Harriot himself, though occasionally caught up in the turmoil even to the extent of being accused of atheism in 1603, in general passed the time unscathed, and continued his scientific observations. He studied the parabolic path of projectiles; determined the specific weights of materials; calculated the areas of spherical triangles, and thus confirmed that the Mercator projection preserves angles; independently discovered the sine law of refraction associated with Willebrord Snell (1580-1626); built telescopes; and in 1607, long before the birth of Edmund Halley (1656-1742), observed what came to be known as Halley's Comet.\n\nAs an astronomer, Harriot also made a map of the Moon (1609), calculated the orbits of Jupiter's moons (1610-12), studied sunspots and the Sun's rotation speed (1610-13), and observed another comet (1618). In his writings as a mathematician, not only did he become the first to use > and <, he was one of the first to adopt the plus sign and minus sign, lowercase letters for variables, and the equal sign of Robert Recorde (1510-1558). He was also among the first to write an equation with the sum of all terms equal to zero, as is common today.\n\nFor a decade, from the mid-1580s to the mid-1590s, Harriot had lived on an Irish property granted him by Raleigh. From 1595, however, he had resided at Northumberland's estate at Syon, and continued there even after Northumberland was arrested by King James in 1605. By the time his patron was released from the Tower of London in 1622, Harriot was dead, having succumbed to a cancer of the nostril on July 2, 1621. (Raleigh was dead, too, executed by James in 1618.) Harriot left behind a vast array of papers, many of them published as Artis analyticae praxis, a significant algebra text, in 1631.\n\nJUDSON KNIGHT"}, {"url": "https://lens.monash.edu/@science/2021/07/26/1383475/the-scientific-genius-who-eschewed-fame-remembering-thomas-harriot-400-years-on", "page_content": "Four hundred years ago, on 2 July, 1621, a remarkable Englishman named Thomas Harriot died in London. He left behind some 8000 pages of scientific research, but it\u2019s only in recent decades that scholars have uncovered their treasures.\n\nAnd what they show is that Harriot independently made many significant discoveries now attributed to other, more famous scientists. Some scholars have called him \u201cthe English Galileo\u201d and \u201cthe greatest British mathematical scientist before Newton\u201d.\n\nYet Harriot died without publishing a single word of this extraordinary output. His tale reminds us that, while we may sometimes think science progresses through a series of renowned pioneers who single-handedly overturn entrenched beliefs, the story is rarely so simple.\n\nWhat did Harriot discover?\n\nFor instance, we learn in school that Galileo Galilei initiated telescopic astronomy and discovered the law of falling motion. But Harriot independently did both of these things.\n\nThomas Harriot\u2019s 1609 map of the Moon, drawn by observing through a telescope. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHe also deduced fledgling general laws governing the motion of everyday objects, again independently of Galileo, and before Ren\u00e9 Descartes. (Half a century later, Isaac Newton developed the definitive laws of motion.)\n\nHarriot studied light, too, discovering the secret of colour and the nature of the rainbow before Newton, and finding the law of refraction (which we know today as Snell\u2019s law) before the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snell.\n\nHe also made a mathematical study of population growth before Thomas Malthus, developed a completely symbolic form of sophisticated algebra before Descartes, discovered binary arithmetic before Gottfried Leibniz, and took steps on the road to calculus with his work on infinite series.\n\nThe law of falling bodies\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2008 that Harriot\u2019s work on gravity was fully reconstructed, by the German scholar Matthias Schemmel.\n\nAs Schemmel pointed out, Harriot and his contemporary Galileo were heirs to essentially the same body of knowledge. It\u2019s perhaps not so surprising, then, that they made some of the same breakthroughs. There are plenty of examples of independent co-discoveries in history, most famously that of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nThe law of falling motion says that without air resistance, all objects, no matter their size or mass, fall from the same height at the same rate.\n\nLegend has it Galileo dropped balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to study how they fell. Nobody knows if this is true, but Harriot had the same idea \u2013 he recorded the time, in pulse beats, that it took for different objects falling from as high as 55\u00bd feet (about 17 metres) to reach the ground.\n\nRead more: Copernicus' revolution and Galileo's vision: Our changing view of the universe in pictures\n\nBoth Harriot and Galileo devised more accurate experiments, however, from which they derived a mathematical understanding of how things fall.\n\nThis combination of experiment and mathematics is now the accepted way to derive a law of nature. Quantifying observations means others can test the results, and use them to make useful predictions.\n\nHarriot and Galileo weren\u2019t the first to understand the role of observation and mathematics in this context, of course. But they were among the most successful of the pre-Newtonian pioneers.\n\nGalileo didn\u2019t publish his work on gravity until after Harriot had died, and there\u2019s no evidence that the two men ever met or corresponded.\n\nThe law of refraction and the shape of the rainbow\n\nThe German astronomer Johannes Kepler, however, did correspond briefly with Harriot. Kepler had been working on the nature of light and vision when word reached him that Harriot had unravelled two mysteries \u2013 the law of refraction, and why the rainbow has its magical colours and unique shape.\n\nThe law of refraction describes how light bends when it passes from one medium into another, which explains how an image can be focused by a glass lens, or why your leg looks wobbly when you dip it in a swimming pool.\n\nA diagram from Ibn Sahl\u2019s 10th-century treatise on optics showing the path of light refracted by a lens. Image: Wikimedia\n\nHarriot derived this law 20 years before Snell, but there\u2019s a popular belief that the 10th-century Baghdad-based scholar Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd al-\u02bfAl\u0101\u02be ibn Sahl beat even Harriot. This is not quite right \u2013 Ibn Sahl is a notable pioneer whose geometrical diagram of light focused by a lens gives, in hindsight, the correct refractive path. But there\u2019s no evidence he deduced his result from experiment, or that he understood the general properties of refraction.\n\nJudging from his surviving papers, even Snell failed to generalise his result, which he, like Ibn Sahl, never wrote as the neat trigonometric equation we use today. Harriot, by contrast, did. His derivation of the general law of refraction is another example of his rigorous blend of experiment and mathematics.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why are rainbows round?\n\nHarriot\u2019s other adventures\n\nIf only Harriot had published! In the early stage of his career, though, he was bound by commercial secrecy, for his first patron was controversial statesman and entrepreneur Sir Walter Raleigh. Harriot was also busy dodging heretic hunters, and sailing the high seas as Raleigh\u2019s navigational advisor.\n\nThomas Harriot published only one work in his lifetime \u2013 a report on his stay in North America in the 1580s. Image: Wikimedia\n\nRaleigh had delusions of empire and glory, and wanted to establish a trading colony in today\u2019s US before the Spanish beat him to it. The one work Harriot did publish in his lifetime was \u201ca brief and true report\u201d on the economic potential of Raleigh\u2019s chosen American site.\n\nHarriot\u2019s contribution to colonialism has justly attracted its share of criticism. Nonetheless, his report is still widely praised for its sympathetic depiction of the way of life of the North Carolina Algonquian people, as it was when Europeans first set foot on their land. Harriot learned the local language, and enjoyed much about the year he spent living with the Algonquians.\n\nWhat he loved doing most, though, was mathematics and physics. He was neither flamboyant nor ambitious, and when he was wrongfully imprisoned through an unlucky connection with the Gunpowder Plot (a failed attempt to assassinate King James I), he told his jailers he just wanted ...\n\n\u201c... to live a private life for the love of learning that I might study freely\u201d.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the late 1590s, Harriot had found a second patron, Henry Percy, the ninth earl of Northumberland. It was then that he was able to study the mysteries of nature and the marvels of mathematics for their own sakes, rather than the \u201capplied\u201d work he had done for Raleigh.\n\nHaving two generous patrons meant Harriot didn\u2019t need to publicise his discoveries to attract funding, the way Galileo did. Nor did he care about fame, despite being urged by friends to claim his priority. His manuscripts do contain several almost-finished treatises, but it seems he was so busy doing science that he never managed to put his results together for the printer.\n\nAfter his death, well-meaning scholars carved up his manuscripts in an attempt to study and publish them. In the process, however, all the papers disappeared, seemingly lost forever. Then, 150 years later, the Hungarian astronomer Franz Xaver Zach discovered them, locked safely away in Northumberland\u2019s castle.\n\nMost of the papers were then given to the British Museum. They\u2019re now in the British Library, where I had the privilege of studying them. (They\u2019re also available online.)\n\nAs for Harriot, no one knows much about him as a person \u2013 not even his birthday. Nevertheless, he\u2019s fascinated scholars for the past half-century (as I discovered some years ago when I set out to bring his story to a wider, non-specialist readership).\n\nThat\u2019s because despite the lack of biographical data, those precious manuscripts show that what mattered most to Harriot himself was mathematics and science.

From 1967, it met in Oxford under the leadership of Professor David Quinn of Liverpool and Dr Alistair Crombie of Oxford. The seminars were organised by Dr JD North (and latterly by Dr JJ Roche), under the presidency of Dr Crombie. The first was held at All Souls, but the rest were held at Trinity College, where Dr Crombie was a Fellow. The last Oxford seminar was held in April 1983.\n\nIn 1977, Dr Tanner financed a meeting in Durham which met every two years from 1979 under the chairmanship of Professor GR Batho, until his death in 2013. From 1988 to 1999 biennial seminars were also held in Cambridge. Since 2013, the Seminar has been chaired by Dr Stephen Clucas (Reader in Early Modern Intellectual History at Birkbeck, University of London), who was Vice Chairman of the Seminar from 1990-2013. The Seminar now alternates between the University of Durham and Birkbeck.\n\nThe Durham Harriot Seminar published a series of 35 occasional papers and a catalogue of the Tanner Papers in the University of Liverpool. These are no longer available, but we hope to put PDFs of them online in the near future.\n\nThe money provided by Dr Tanner to endow the Seminar has been supplemented since her death in 1992 by Lord Egremont. The money Dr Tanner gave Professor Batho in 1977 was put into the hands of the Durham University Treasurer and the stewardship of the Treasurer has resulted in the Seminar being adequately endowed for the foreseeable future. Help is given to students to attend meetings and money has been provided to assist with relevant publications.\n\nLord Egremont is the Patron of the Thomas Harriot Seminar.\n\nMeetings\n\nThe THS welcomes any interested persons to its meetings.

Harriot was strongly identified with Sir Walter Raleigh's free\u2010thinking \u201cSchool of Atheisme\u201d and had once served as Raleigh's onetime mathematical tutor and scientific advisor. Another associate was the poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe (1564\u20131593). But unlike his colorful poet\u2010companions, Harriot seems to have been personally reserved and quiet, a perfectionist whose knowledge of mathematics was extensive but who published little during his lifetime.\n\nIn 1585, when he was in his early 20s, Harriot accompanied Raleigh as surveyor and cartographer on an expedition to Virginia. Although he planned an encyclopedic account of the New World, he actually produced only \u201cA brief and true report of the new\u2010found land of Virginia,\u201d which became widely known through Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1598\u20131600), a collection of the voyages made by English adventurers like Raleigh.\n\nBut these had been the adventures of a younger man. Harriot was already 50 when he first turned a telescope toward the 5\u2010day\u2010old Moon on the evening of 26 July 1609 (5 August). Though magnifying 6\u00d7, his \u201ctrunke,\u201d as he called it, must have been of very poor optical quality, since it showed very little detail. For that matter, Harriot seems to have had very little insight into the true nature of what he was seeing\u2014about as little as was shown on a slightly later occasion by his friend Sir William Lower, who used one of Harriot's telescopes to make his own observations of the Moon from Kidwelly in Wales. Lower wrote memorably to Harriot on February 6, 1610 (O.S.).\n\nAccording as you wished I have observed the moone in all his changes. In the new I discover manifestlie the earthshine, a little before the dichotomie that spot which represents unto me the man in the moone (but without a head) \u2026. A little after neare the brimme of the gibbous parts like starres, much brighter then the rest and the whole brimme along, lookes like unto the description of coasts, in the dutch bookes of voyages. In the full she appeares like a tarte that my cooke made me the last weeke. Here a vaine of bright stuffe, and there of darke, and so confused lie al over.\n\nAlthough Galilei easily had the finest telescopes available at the time, we must not allow this fact to obscure Galilei's uncanny talent as an observer. The contrast between Galilei's decisive results and Harriot's and Lower's early attempts demonstrate Galilei's genius as an observer. Galilei was certain that the Moon was \u201csprinkled over with prominences and depressions,\u201d and was measuring the heights of lunar peaks before his contemporaries even realized that some of the features they were seeing were shadows cast by mountains."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/renaissance-quarterly/article/abs/thomas-harriot-and-his-world-mathematics-exploration-and-natural-philosophy-in-early-modern-england-robert-fox-ed-farnham-ashgate-publishing-limited-2012-xviii-256-pp-12495/4A316295187CF6751CA2CE665D99621A", "page_content": "This is the second of two volumes of essays edited by Robert Fox collecting the annual Thomas Harriot lectures given at Oriel College, Oxford, between 1990 and 2009 (the first was published in 2000). Thomas Harriot (1560\u20131621) left behind a considerable body of manuscripts on a wide range of subjects, including mathematics, optics, alchemy, astronomy, and mechanics. The core of this volume is the question of Harriot\u2019s status as a mathematician, or as a natural philosopher, and specifically whether it is correct to describe him as an \u201cEnglish Galileo.\u201d As the essays by Jacqueline Stedall, Jon Pepper, and Ian Maclean attest, Harriot\u2019s brilliance as a mathematician is incontestable. Pepper places Harriot squarely in the great mathematical tradition stretching from Eudoxus to Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, emphasizing the originality of his work on the binomial theorem, exponential series, and triangular numbers. Harriot\u2019s move from geometrical to algebraic formulations of problems, Pepper argues, is the \u201cmost notable\u201d aspect of his mathematics (25); Stedall focuses precisely on the systematic nature of Harriot\u2019s algebraic work, looking closely at Harriot\u2019s new methods of solving quadratic and other polynomial equations (which made significant advances on the published work of his French contemporary Vi\u00e8te); Maclean\u2019s essay looks at Harriot\u2019s abiding interest in combinations and permutations.\n\nMatthias Schemmel and John Henry, however, have very different conceptions of Harriot\u2019s career. For Schemmel (author of The English Galileo [2009]), Harriot\u2019s work on projectile trajectories and free fall makes an instructive parallel with the natural-philosophical achievements of Galileo. Schemmel\u2019s historical-epistemological approach attends to the different \u201cinferential pathways\u201d followed by Harriot and Galileo in their works on mechanics based on a very similar body of \u201cshared knowledge\u201d (106\u201310). Working independently on the same \u201cchallenging problems\u201d in ballistics, Schemmel argues, Harriot and Galileo raised \u201cvirtually identical questions\u201d about central problems in mechanics (92). Schemmel points out that Harriot\u2019s knowledge of free fall and the shape of ballistic trajectories by 1621 was essentially the same as Galileo\u2019s in 1638, with both employing the same inclined-plane conception of projectile motion (98\u2013101). If anything, Harriot was \u201cmore successful than Galileo in consistently relating the concept of velocity to the graphical representation of motion\u201d (110). For Schemmel, then, Harriot\u2019s achievements entitle him to be considered an \u201cEnglish Galileo,\u201d and at the least suggest a \u201cconvergence of the lines of development in Early Modern Mechanics\u201d (111).\n\nWhile not explicitly refuting Schemmel\u2019s claims, Henry argues that while Galileo amalgamated \u201cspeculative natural philosophy with mathematical and experimental traditions,\u201d Harriot \u201cremained first and foremost a mathematical practitioner\u201d (117\u201318). While he concedes that there are some elements of Harriot\u2019s work that could be construed as natural philosophical (his work on optics, impacts, and atomism), and says that \u201cHarriot was willing to play the natural philosopher sometimes\u201d (130), he ultimately sees Harriot\u2019s forays into natural philosophy as either a failure or a symptom of his \u201cuncompromising perfectionism\u201d (134, 136\u201337). For Henry, Harriot must be excluded from a list of figures (like Galileo and Descartes) who were both mathematicians and natural philosophers, who mediated between what Jim Bennett has called \u201cthe mechanics\u2019 philosophy\u201d and mechanical philosophy, because his work shows little interest in causal explanations (132).\n\nRobert Goulding\u2019s essay paints a different picture. Harriot\u2019s work on optics, he argues, was \u201cconnected with his abiding concern with the structure of matter\u201d (32), and he shows that Harriot\u2019s understanding of refraction was based on an atomistic model (41\u201343) and that his optical experiments were a \u201cspecies of alchemical experimentation\u201d (48). Harriot\u2019s experiments on color dispersion were more thorough than those of Newton sixty years later (37), and his work on refraction established \u201cthe most important new optical principles since Ptolemy\u201d (33). Stephen Pumfrey, working within the perspective of patronage studies, compares Harriot\u2019s failure to publish his lost navigational treatise, the Arcticon (ca. 1583), with Edward Wright\u2019s published Certaine errors in navigation (1599). This highly instructive comparison shows the importance of \u201cpatronly support\u201d for print publication of specialized works (143) and seeks to demonstrate that Harriot\u2019s often-discussed \u201cfailure\u201d to print was in fact \u201cnormal\u201d in late sixteenth-century England, where mathematicians and their patrons were often \u201ccontent with manuscript circulation\u201d (143). Mark Nicholls reflects on the fortunes of Harriot\u2019s patron Walter Raleigh, while Pascal Brioist argues that Harriot\u2019s experiences on the voyages to Virginia sponsored by Raleigh show Harriot\u2019s \u201cspecial capacity to absorb all sorts of practical knowledge\u201d (200) in his notes on the language of seamen and his methodical taxonomy of the sails and riggings of the ships on which he sailed to the New World. Now that Harriot\u2019s manuscripts (through the heroic efforts of Stedall, Schemmel, and Goulding) are available online via ECHO (http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/scientific_revolution/harriot), we can expect more work on this intriguing figure, and more searching questions of the kind raised by this excellent volume."}]}
