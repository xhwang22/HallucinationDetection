However, when taking a deeper dive into the artistry of all things music, the discussion often turns to other topics, such as the differences between Mixtapes vs. Albums, or the differences between EP vs. LP.\n\nRegardless of where you are on the music listening spectrum, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve seen these terms before. But, you may not be quite sure what they actually mean. We\u2019re here to define these terms, review the differences between an EP vs. LP vs. album, and share a few of the best of each of these album types. After reading this blog, you will feel like a pro next time you visit a record store.\n\nWhat is an EP?\n\nAn EP stands for an extended play album. It is usually in reference to a vinyl record but could also be a CD or digital download. The listening format isn\u2019t what defines an EP but rather how many tracks are included, or album length. Compared to a full length album, an EP album is a short album but has more songs than a single. A typical EP album, like the The Format: EP, has about four to six tracks, depending on the genre or artist\u2019s decision.\n\nHowever, even if an EP just has two or three songs, there are no time limitations to how long a song can be. That means you could still have nearly an hour-long listening experience from the entire release if the songs on the record are extended. For example, six tracks at around 12 minutes each fits into the EP album format.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing an EP vs. LP album, EPs are a way for indie artists to get their music heard (and funded) before producing a full-length long play album. They\u2019re often used for promotional purposes and to have ready when distributing to a record label and producers.\n\nVinyl EPs: What Sets Them Apart?\n\nWhile a small collection of songs can be called an EP across all mediums, vinyl EPs stand out for their uniqueness and collectibility. Unlike records on CD or in digital formats, vinyl EPs are physically different from their LP counterparts.\n\nLike David Bowie, vinyl EPs can easily be identified by their quirky physical characteristics, including their:\n\nSize \u2013 Any diehard Prince fan can tell you that great things come in small packages.

Spin rate \u2013 The speed at which a record turns on a player, or turntable speed, is measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). The majority of 7-inches are pressed to spin at 45 RPM, hence their nickname 45s. Less commonly, EPs can be produced to turn at 33 1/3 RPM, but it\u2019s not the industry standard.2\n\nThe unique properties of the 7-inch actually helped shape EPs as we know them. A standard 7-inch turning at 45 RPM can hold about six minutes of music per side\u2014the perfect amount for a couple choice tunes from a mid-20th century crooner.2\n\nThus, since the 45 rose to prominence around 1950, they\u2019ve always come packed with a few quick and killer songs. One thing that has changed about them, however, is how they\u2019re viewed by the music industry.\n\nOriginally, 45s were seen as a form of competition to the standard full-length records (LPs) that we all know and love. The Battle of the Speeds pitted LP vs EP, and critics believed one format would emerge victorious over the other and become the go-to for the industry.2\n\nBut in the end, who won the epic war of EP vs LP?\n\nUltimately, the winners are all music fans\u2014who now have two wonderful ways to enjoy new music and songs from their favorite artists.\n\nWhat is an LP?\n\nAn LP refers to a long-playing or long play record or a full-length album. When comparing an EP vs. LP, think of the EP record as a warm-up to the headlining performance, a musical appetizer to the main course. An LP album is typically between 10 to 12 tracks and anywhere from 30 to 50+ minutes long. Keep in mind when listening to music on vinyl, a record can only hold 40 minutes of music per side, which is why some extended track albums aren\u2019t found on vinyl.\n\nFinally, when it comes to the difference between an EP vs LP vs album, LPs and albums are more often used interchangeably. For an EP, you may also find it referenced as a recording since an album represents a much longer body of work.\n\nWhat Makes Vinyl LPs Special?\n\nUnlike the term EP, people generally don\u2019t refer to albums as LPs unless they\u2019re pressed onto vinyl. Hence, LP is more of a name for the medium rather than a catch-all for full-length releases.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean that all records pressed onto vinyl are LPs. Besides their longer track count, LPs can be distinguished from EPs by their:\n\n12 inches of glory \u2013 Sometimes, size really does matter. Not only does the larger surface mean more songs can be jammed onto an LP than an EP, but it also provides a larger canvas for artists to express themselves visually. Some LPs, such as Tool\u2019s limited edition etched Fear Inoculum collection, use the vinyl\u2019s surface as a medium for artistic expression as much as the music itself.\n\nSlow turning speed \u2013 Unlike EPs zipping away at 45 RPM, LPs spin at a more lackadaisical 33 1/3 RPM. There are 12-inch records that turn at 45 RPM, but rare Maxi Singles such as M83\u2019s Go! are completely distinct entities from traditional LPs.\n\n\u2013 Sometimes, size really does matter. Not only does the larger surface mean more songs can be jammed onto an LP than an EP, but it also provides a larger canvas for artists to express themselves visually. Some LPs, such as Tool\u2019s limited edition etched collection, use the vinyl\u2019s surface as a medium for artistic expression as much as the music itself. \u2013 Unlike EPs zipping away at 45 RPM, LPs spin at a more lackadaisical 33 1/3 RPM. There are 12-inch records that turn at 45 RPM, but rare Maxi Singles such as M83\u2019s are completely distinct entities from traditional LPs. Propensity to double up \u2013 Despite their increased length, some artists have more to say than one LP can handle. If there are two vinyls in one sleeve\u2014such as The Cure\u2019s Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\u2014that's likely a double LP you\u2019re holding. Of course, musical rules are made to be broken, and, in this case, Courtney Barnett\u2019s A Sea of Split Peas is perhaps the most famous double-EP culprit.\n\nWhile certainly interesting to note, do all these distinctions between LP vs EP vs album really matter to anyone besides certified music nerds?\n\nYes, indeed, and they\u2019re of particular importance to musicians themselves.\n\nWhy Does the Difference Between EP vs. LP Matter?\n\nTo the listener, the song length or number of tracks on a record may not matter as much on the surface. However, as you learn about different musicians and their creativity, you\u2019ll understand it\u2019s a big difference for them.\n\nFirst, organizing song tracks is an artistic choice. The sequencing is designed to channel a certain mood or vibe and give the listener an optimal experience. Conceptually, it\u2019s similar to what goes into preparing a live music show.\n\nHave you ever noticed how most artists start and end with their most upbeat songs with a slower break in the middle to play any ballads, acoustic versions, or song covers they like to perform? This is one way to optimize the experience. When EPs were reserved for vinyl records only, the limited amount of space also made it crucial to time each song and maximize the effort.\n\nSecond, EPs have been a medium for artists to get their foot in the door with record label prospects and fans. Although today, big name artists often use EPs as a way to give their audiences bonus track songs on their full-length albums. It\u2019s a way to provide deeper cuts or behind-the-scenes looks at the making of an album. Artists may share hidden bonus tracks that may have previously been on the cutting room floor. This gives EPs a special feel as an insight into the artist\u2019s recording process and an encore to the album fans already know and love.\n\nWhen sorting through the records of popular artists or looking for new music to enjoy, consider the difference between EP vs LP and know that if there is a full-length album already released, you may be able to find an EP. Additionally, as a record collector, stumbling across a rare EP of an artist when they were first starting out can be a rare gem to add to your collection. Here are a few examples of EPs and albums from some of the world\u2019s best known artists that we carry at Victrola.\n\nDuran Duran is arguably one of the \u201880\u2019s biggest artists, riding the New Wave era of music. They\u2019ve sold over 100 million records worldwide and have 30 Top 40 singles to their name.\n\nTheir No Ordinary Tour EP has three tracks: \u201cCome Undone: Live,\u201d \u201cNotorious: Live,\u201d and their most popular, \u201cHungry Like the Wolf: Live from Tower Records,\u201d which was recorded in an intimate acoustic show in Hollywood, CA in 1993.\n\nThe only people in attendance for this exclusive performance were those who won tickets from a radio station contest. At the time, the No Ordinary Tour EP was given away as a free cassette to attendees. \u201cHungry Like a Wolf\u201d then went on to be included on the band\u2019s second studio album, Rio.\n\nThis five-track EP is a must-have for fans of the legendary Carlos Santana. The concept of the recording stemmed from the artist\u2019s interaction with the famed Mona Lisa painting in Paris. Following his view, Santana created five songs for In Search of Mona Lisa that were written and produced by Santana and Narada Michael Walden. For listeners, it provided a unique artist insight into the place and memories of one of the world\u2019s most notorious performers.\n\nBefore lead singer Karen O was beloved by screaming audiences, her band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recorded its debut, self-released, five-song EP in 2001. It was the first production of the band, made up of Karen O\u2019s notorious vocals, drums from Brian Chase, and guitar riffs by Nick Zinners. Their distinctive, driving, alternative garage sound was introduced through these early tracks, which eventually led them to the stardom they\u2019ve reached today.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing EP vs LP vs album, Stevie Wonder\u2019s 16th studio album, Innervisions, released in 1973 is considered one of the best records of his career. Though an LP, here is where he transitioned from his earlier, more romantic, pop sound from his earlier Motown days and began to explore societal issues at the time that are still prevalent today.\n\nHe incorporated these themes through his lyrics, instrumentation, and sounds, which are captured beautifully when listening to this album on vinyl. Two of the best-known tracks, \u201cLiving for the City\u201d and \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d come in at 7:23 and 3:40, respectively, lengths familiar to the EP style. Stevie Wonder is an artist who\u2019s adapted to the changing trends in the music industry and has taken parts from each decade and made them his own.\n\nJazz is arguably one of the best genres to listen to on vinyl since that\u2019s where it originated. Charlie Parker is one of the world\u2019s most well-known jazz musicians with several albums to his name.\n\nThe Immortal is a green-colored vinyl with bonus tracks that makes this a collector\u2019s item for any longtime fan or even as a beginning album for those just getting into the genre. The vinyl LP music album was released posthumously and is a compilation of selections from five different recording sessions between 1944 and 1948. It contains previously unreleased alternate takes from these sessions.\n\nBeatlemania lives on with this special three-LP set of The Beatles recording music for a variety of radio shows throughout their career. It features an extensive 40 tracks, as well as live interviews with each member of the band.\n\nThough there are their most recognizable hits on the album, there are also song covers of rock and roll classics, as well as speech tracks of in-studio conversations capturing the banter between The Beatles and Saturday Club\u2019s Brian Matthew. For Beatles fans, there\u2019s no better gift than a rarity like On Air: Live at the BBC 2 to get a more intimate feel of their live performances.\n\nBefore Canadian superstar The Weeknd rose to international prominence, he kicked off his career with what, at that point, was considered a mixtape. Now, House of Balloons is noted as a seminal album in establishing the dark and foreboding tones that defined R&B throughout much of the 2010s.\n\nPressed onto a double LP, this is Abel Tesfaye as you\u2019ve never heard him. Vinyl is the perfect medium to experience the eclectic samples and silky smooth singing that alerted listeners to The Weeknd in the first place. From the new-wave tones of the title track to the dark ethereality of The Party and the Afterparty, House of Balloons is the certified soundtrack of nocturnes and late-night contemplators everywhere.\n\nLegendary singer-songwriter Neil Young may be getting on in years, but this live EP proves his musical talents age like fine wine. Recorded in the sanctity of his own home, The Times was Neil\u2019s attempt to comfort those suffering from loneliness and isolation during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.3\n\nWith live performances of some of his most iconic songs, including Ohio, Alabama, and Southern Man, The Times is the kind of golden era Young to get nostalgic for. The quick collection of songs holds a welcome surprise as well, with a moving cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin sandwiched in the middle of Neil\u2019s hits.\n\nFind your Next EP or LP with Victrola\n\nInterested in exploring the world of EP and LP records? Peruse Victrola\u2019s record store and see which of your favorite artists may have EPs with tracks you\u2019ve never heard of before or special performances that take you back to a different time. The way you hear a song on a studio album will be much different than how it\u2019ll sound as a live performance or recording session.\n\nAnd still, how a song started as an EP recording may evolve into the full-length performance you\u2019re familiar with today. The beauty of the differences between an EP vs. LP vs. album shows how expansive music is and how the same song can sound different when using different mediums and formats.\n\nSources:"}, {"url": "https://output.com/blog/what-is-an-ep", "page_content": "What Is an EP? Why Should I Release One? Output Singles reign supreme, but artists of all levels can benefit from releasing an EP: a mini-album that\u2019s usually between 3-6 songs.\n\nToday\u2019s artists face an industry that\u2019s always evolving, and the best way to present new songs to fans is constantly changing. If you\u2019re an up-and-coming artist, should you focus on releasing consistent singles or on building a longer body of work? It\u2019s true that singles are an effective way to grow a fanbase ahead of a longer project, but artists of all levels can benefit from releasing an EP: a mini-album that\u2019s usually between 3-6 songs.\n\nIn the streaming era, artists and labels use EPs differently than they used to. It\u2019s an effective format for smaller musical projects, released between full-length albums. Released in series, EPs can be an alternative to albums themselves. Frankly, the traditional album cycle of releasing an album every couple of years isn\u2019t as sustainable as it used to be, especially for burgeoning acts. With shorter attention spans and millions of songs instantly available on streaming services, shorter formats like EPs give artists more flexibility and fans more to listen to.\n\nEven big artists like H.E.R., Halsey, and Nine Inch Nails have taken an album\u2019s worth of material and spread it across multiple, shorter releases, which allows them to keep the momentum for a longer period of time with their marketing.\n\nWhile the format of a release isn\u2019t everything, it can have an impact. It\u2019s important to understand if an EP is the right type of release for your artistic development and how it will be presented on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nHere are answers to some of the most common questions about EPs, how artists can best use the format to their advantage, and more.\n\nWhat does \u201cEP\u201d mean?\n\n\u201cEP\u201d stands for \u201cextended play.\u201d An EP is effectively a mini-album. It\u2019s a collection of songs that runs shorter than a traditional album but is longer than a double-sided (2-song) single. They traditionally have a tracklist between 3-6 songs, with a runtime under 30 minutes.\n\nYou\u2019ll see many bands and artists release EPs near the beginning of their careers, ahead of a debut album. Sometimes, songs from these EPs go on to be included on a full album down the line; other times, the EPs exist as standalone releases, like James Blake\u2019s 2020 EP, Before.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between EP and LP?\n\n\u201cLP\u201d stands for \u201clong play.\u201d Today, the term is usually reserved for traditional full-length albums. LPs, or albums, usually have tracklists of 7 or more songs, with runtimes longer than 30 minutes.\n\nThe terms LP and EP originate from a format war between competitor record labels back in the mid-1900s. At the time, multi-track records could only hold about four minutes of audio per side and many labels wanted to be the first to figure out how to make them longer. Columbia Records introduced the Long Playing, 33 1/3 RPM, 12-inch record in 1948, capable of storing around 23 minutes of music on each side of a vinyl record. To compete, RCA Victor introduced the Extended Play, 45 RPM, 10-inch record in 1952. EPs were smaller and held 7.5 minutes per side.\n\nWe all know who won: 10-inch vinyl was largely phased out, and 12-inch vinyl is the predominant format to this day. But the \u201cEP\u201d signifier stuck around.\n\nIt should be noted that EP and LP are used in two different discussion contexts: the industry format and the art form. While today\u2019s music industry is more focused on individual tracks or EPs than full albums, many artists still cherish the album art form. You should take both contexts into consideration when weighing your release options.\n\nWhat are the benefits of releasing an EP vs. an album?\n\nEPs are considered a less expensive and more manageable alternative to the full-length album. In theory, fewer songs mean you can finish a project quicker, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to devote as many resources to it as you would an album. (For starters: Less tracks equates less mixing and mastering costs.) Artists who don\u2019t have enough of a budget to effectively market a full-length album might also turn to EPs for their brevity and faster turnaround time.\n\nBecause EPs are shorter, they can be an effective entry point for new listeners to get to know an artist. Fans are more likely to listen to an EP in its entirety since they know it won\u2019t take as long as a full album. It\u2019s also a great format for artists who want to expand beyond singles but don\u2019t have a big budget and established acts who want to release music outside of their usual album cycle or experiment with different sounds.\n\nEPs are especially beneficial for album-focused artists who are between album cycles but want to stay connected to their fanbase. An EP can also be a stop-gap project to prepare listeners for a bigger body of work to come.\n\nFor example, if an artist has a major stylistic change coming, they might use the EP to hint at that shift and let fans know what\u2019s coming next.\n\nWhen Radiohead released their My Iron Lung EP in 1994, they were riding off the surprise success of \u201cCreep.\u201d Many saw the band as Britain\u2019s answer to the grunge movement, but they had other plans, and My Iron Lung served to prime their fanbase for their breakout LP The Bends, released months later.\n\nAnother great example is Charli XCX\u2019s Vroom Vroom EP. Though it received mixed reviews at the time of its release in 2016, the 4-song release introduced her fans to production, songwriting, and stylistic elements that she\u2019d use in albums and mixtapes in the following half-decade. Today, it\u2019s regarded as a turning point in her career.\n\nWhat are the downsides to releasing an EP vs. an album?\n\nDepending on what streaming service it\u2019s on, your EP might not get as much attention as an album. For example, Spotify will group any release with less than 7 songs and totaling under 30 minutes into the \u201cEPs and Singles\u201d tab on an artist page. This means that putting one more song on your 6-song EP can bump it to the \u201cAlbums\u201d tab and give it greater visibility.\n\nThis Spotify practice is part of the reason why Nine Inch Nails upgraded the final release in their 2018 three-EP series into a full album. \u201cEPs show up with singles in Spotify and other streaming services = they get lost easier,\u201d frontman Trent Reznor explained to users on the NIN forum that year. \u201cEPs feel less important in today\u2019s music-isn\u2019t-as-important-as-it-once-was world. Why make it easier to ignore?\u201d\n\nWhat is a \u201cdynamic EP\u201d?\n\nThe \u201cdynamic EP\u201d is a relatively new development that came about during the streaming era. As Deezer Vice President of Artist Marketing Nigel Harding told Music Ally: \u201cReturning artists tend to gather new tracks together in a loose collection, often prior to the release of a full album. The first track is released as a stand-alone single, then subsequent releases are added one-by-one to form a growing compilation of brand new music.\u201d\n\nThe use of the \u201cdynamic EP\u201d is also known as the \u201cwaterfall\u201d strategy. Each new single cascades into the next as the songs are released over time. If you use Spotify, you\u2019ve probably seen this in action.\n\nFor example, In 2018, the Chainsmokers released a new single every month, continuing to bundle the prior month\u2019s release in subsequent uploads and culminating in a full album at the end of the year. Joel Klaiman, general manager of Columbia Records, compared it to a TV series when speaking to Billboard: \u201cI think the episodic element, or the recurring element, of it [is something] fans are going to like, and appreciate, and look forward to.\u201d\n\nShould you add remixes to an EP?\n\nIf the situation calls for it, yes! Remixes are a great way to highlight other artists and keep your fans engaged with new material. Because they have lower stakes, EPs are a great way to experiment with collaboration in general. Whether it\u2019s assembling a full set of remixes or putting out two of your own tracks with two great reworks, you can use an EP as a proving ground for your full-length projects.\n\nA classic example of an effective collaborative/remix EP would be JAY-Z and Linkin Park\u2019s 2004 Collision Course, in which the rapper and the nu-metal group did mash-ups of each others\u2019 songs. It deftly introduced JAY-Z to Linkin Park fans who might not listen to hip-hop and vice versa.\n\nWhat counts as an EP on streaming services?\n\nWhether or not your body of work is classified as an EP, album, or even a single(!) depends on the qualifications of different streaming services.\n\nOn Spotify, if your release is between 4-6 songs and less than 30 minutes long, it will be classified as an EP and filed under the \u201cEPs and Singles\u201d tab on your artist page. (1-3 song releases are classified as Singles.)\n\nOn Apple Music, if your release is between 4-6 songs and less than 30 minutes long, it will be classified as an EP and have the suffix \u201c- EP\u201d added to the end of the release title if it doesn\u2019t already. (If your release is between 1-3 songs and one or more of the songs are over 10 minutes long and the project is less than 30 minutes long, it will also count as an EP.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to release an EP on Spotify?\n\nIf you\u2019re an unsigned artist, the most effective way to release your music on Spotify is through a distribution company, or \u201cdistro\u201d for short. Distribution companies are responsible for putting your music on digital storefronts (such as streaming services and iTunes) and paying you royalties.\n\nSome distribution companies are affiliated with or co-owned by major labels and can be picky about who they work with. Others operate as independent firms and will distribute anyone\u2019s music.\n\nOne of the most widely-used independent distribution services is DistroKid. As of May 2021, DistroKid estimated that it is responsible for distributing \u201c30 to 40 percent of all new music in the world.\u201d\n\nDistroKid is one of Spotify\u2019s preferred artist distributors, alongside CD Baby, Record Union, and more. (Note: Spotify bought a minority stake in DistroKid in 2018. You can find more information on Spotify\u2019s preferred distribution companies here.)\n\nSo, should you release an EP?\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to your own release and marketing plans but as a release format, EPs are both artistically and financially flexible. They allow artists to engage fans with projects that are more substantial than one-off tracks but not as long as albums. EPs allow you to tactically strategize how to entice new fans and keep die-hard listeners along for the ride.\n\nThinking about recording your first EP?

Conrad)\n\nThe origin of satanic heavy metal, which eventually assumed the title of \u201cblack metal,\u201d is most commonly linked to the British trio, Venom, who bestowed the name upon the subgenre with the title of its second album in 1982. In the decades since, black metal has undergone several periods of evolution, which have often been cultivated in self-contained, stylistic incubation regions in different parts of the world. In retrospect, one unlikely context of this sort was Poland in the early 1980s, which was dominated by pro-communist martial law, and from which the band Kat somehow emerged. Kat\u2019s role in the development of black heavy metal is one that is typically overlooked, but it is one of significance that deserves proper recognition. Kat was formed in 1979 under the direction of guitarist Piotr Luczyk and in conspiracy with Ireneusz Loth on drums. Shortly thereafter, Tomasz Jagu\u015b (bass) and Ryszard Pisarski (guitars) joined the band, and during the first two years of its existence, this quartet exclusively played instrumental songs inspired by the likes of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Accept. Although he was not the first vocalist to try out for Kat, Roman Kostrzewski solidified the band with his enlistment in 1981, enabling Kat to take the necessary next step of performing songs with vocals. Coincidentally, during the year of Kostrzewski\u2019s addition to the band, Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law throughout Poland in an effort to suppress any and all anti-communist sentiment in the country. Thus, Kat\u2019s formative years were set against the backdrop of military rule that sought to censor the very types of expression that Kat intended to propagate. However, as is often the case, the artistic suppression that characterized life behind the Iron Curtain instead led to a greater urgency for rebellion, as evidenced by the darker turn taken by the post punk and new wave genres that were popular at the time. Similarly, Kat\u2019s musical direction became increasingly focused on themes related to satanism, murder, and vampirism, among others of the same ilk. This confluence of events would therefore result in Kat\u2019s role as a pioneer in the development of the black heavy metal subgenre, albeit to a less recognized degree than its British contemporaries in Venom, whose \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d opus was released that very same year. One of the greatest outlets of cultural rebellion in all of Eastern Europe at the time was the annual Jarocin Festival, which took place in the western region of Poland and is regarded by many as the birthplace of punk rock under communist rule. In 1984, following the replacement of Ryszard Pisarski by Wojciech Mrowiec on guitars, and again in 1985, Kat was invited to the band competition at the Jarocin Festival. Kat succeeded in gaining some attention from these performances as a result of its fast and aggressive brand of heavy metal and the dark themes of its music, which contrasted with the more prevalent topics of partying and social issues that dominated the music of other participants. Thanks to the antics of Kat\u2019s compatriots in the already-established Tajne Stowarzyszenie Abstynent\u00f3w (TSA), Polish metal fans had already been exposed to some raucous stage acts. TSA was known for creating a riot-like atmosphere characterized by excessive volume, partial or full on-stage nudity, and the violence of random objects regularly being thrown into the crowd. Kat, however, upped the ante by including fire in its act, early on by fashioning a flag mast into a makeshift launcher of explosives, and later by including a more complete array of pyrotechnics. The result was one in which the band\u2019s unhinged stage presence matched the fury of its audial onslaught. Not long after its early successes in the Jarocin Festivals, Kat entered the studio to record its debut seven-inch single, \u201cOstatni tabor / Noce Szatana\u201d (\u201cThe Last Supply Train / The Nights of Satan\u201d), which was released by the Polish label Tonpress in 1985 and featured a uniquely engraved center label instead of the typical paper variety. Within approximately one year, the band reentered the studio in October and November of 1985 to record what would essentially become two versions of the same album. One of these, simply entitled \u201c666,\u201d was recorded with Polish lyrics, whereas its evil twin, \u201cMetal and Hell,\u201d was recorded in English. Further confounding the situation, there were two versions of \u201c666,\u201d one of which was composed of alternate recordings of the same songs, which were also presented in a different order but never released to the public. The better-known version of \u201c666\u2033 was released on both cassette and twelve-inch vinyl by two different Polish labels. Meanwhile, \u201cMetal and Hell\u201d was released by Ambush Records in Belgium and the Polish label Pronit approximately one year later. Although the \u201c666\u2033 and \u201cMetal and Hell\u201d albums reflect the bands musical influences of standard heavy metal bands like Judas Priest and Accept, they also diverge substantially in the presence of a much darker atmosphere, content, and delivery. The albums\u2019 production is one that seems to recreate the setting of a cavernous medieval torture chamber. This, of course, is appropriate, given the fact that the band\u2019s name translates to \u201cExecutioner\u201d in English. Most tracks flourish in the mid to upper tempos of metal from the era, a characteristic which lends itself well to the effect the band intended to nurture. That said, even the ballad, \u201cCzas Zemsty\u201d (\u201cTime of Revenge\u201d), takes on a much more sinister tone than the most comparable songs from the era (see Accept, for example). The unmistakable truth is that the overall product of \u201c666\u2033 and \u201cMetal and Hell\u201d was extreme according to international standards of the time, and thus it was that much more so for a band establishing itself within the suppressive confines of an Eastern Bloc nation. Since the 1986 release of \u201c666\u2033 and \u201cMetal and Hell,\u201d Kat has gone on to record and release eight full-length albums, as well as several EPs, splits, and live sets. As of the 2022 writing of this biography, the band is still active, after close to forty-five years since its inception. Nonetheless, its twin debut albums are the landmarks by which the band shall always be remembered most. In fact, the track \u201cWyrocznia\u201d is still a staple of a Kat live performance, even after the intervening multiple decades of stylistic transformation that the band has experienced. In short, the culmination of Kat\u2019s formative years as expressed in \u201c666\u2033 and \u201cMetal and Hell\u201d is one that has left an indelible mark on black metal\u2019s historical trajectory, not only in Eastern Europe, but in the world at large.\n\nClick here to order."}, {"url": "https://blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-to-begin-recording-new-album-in-two-weeks", "page_content": "In a new interview with Robert Cavuoto of Metal Rules, ANTHRAX drummer Charlie Benante was asked if his packed 2023 touring schedule with PANTERA will delay the release of ANTHRAX's long-awaited follow-up to 2016's \"For All Kings\" album. He responded (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): \"We're actually going in two weeks to start recording the record. But it probably wouldn't come out till '24 anyway. But the good part about it is we are going in to start recording it. So that's awesome.\"\n\nElaborating on why it has taken so long for ANTHRAX to complete the writing process for a new LP, Charlie said: \"If we didn't get hit with this whole global pandemic thing, it would have been out probably two years ago, three years ago. But we all know what happened. But now, being that some of the songs were [written] before the pandemic hit, they're old to me. So now there's a bunch of new songs that kind of came in the mix. So that's a good thing. You can never have enough\u2026 We're still working on the older ones because we really like a lot of those.\"\n\nThis past January, ANTHRAX guitarist Scott Ian told Metal Edge that he and his bandmates had \"11 musical arrangements\", as well as \"some\" lyrics, that they were working on for their next album. \"Obviously, I'm going to be working on more words and we're getting there,\" he said. \"I'm hoping at some point we'll be able to get into the studio [this year] and record them.\"\n\nBenante also loudly wondered if ANTHRAX could focus on releasing EPs in the foreseeable future as opposed to full-length albums, as has been the case for much of the band's four-plus-decade career.\n\n\"What if it wasn't a full album?\" the drummer asked. \"If we released six songs and then we released another six songs. I know from a record company's point of view that really doesn't work, but in these days\u2026\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's all so different now,\" Ian said, jumping in. \"SLIPKNOT's saying now why even make full albums anymore. I get it. I get all sides of it. I still love a full album, but at the same time I totally understand the idea of what's the point of giving someone 11 songs. Most people don't listen to albums anymore. So, yeah \u2014 why not parse it out? I don't know. All I know is at some point in the next few months we'll probably have 14 or 15 things and then we'll have to decide when we're going to record it and how we're going to release it.\"\n\n\"Think about it,\" Benante continued. \"If ANTHRAX released five songs and you have these five songs, and you absorb it in such a different way nowadays, too. I think that may be the way to go, rather than give everybody 11 songs and it's like, 'Oh \u2014 I only had a chance to listen to the first four or five.' I don't know. I just think maybe the business model is different.\"\n\n\"And even for us, playing songs live it's like, you put out a record with 10 or 11 songs on it with the idea that, 'Oh man, I can't wait to play this one live and I can't wait to play this one live,'\" Ian added. \"On 'For All Kings', we definitely didn't play all of those songs at any point. I think there's maybe six songs on the record that got played \u2013 and that's it. I almost feel like you're wasting them. I understand album tracks, but if you put out just five songs it would be easy to play all five of those on a new tour.\"\n\n\"And easier to digest, too,\" Benante agreed. \"You would appreciate it more if it was just five songs and, 'These five songs are fuckin' killer. I can't wait for the next five songs,' knowing that we will release another five or six.\"\n\nEarlier in January, Benante told Ruben Mosqueda of We Go To 11 that ANTHRAX was planning to enter the studio sometime this spring to begin recording the new LP.\n\n\"Between the PANTERA [tour dates in 2023], we're gonna be working on this record, this ANTHRAX record,\" he said. \"We're hoping to have it finished before PANTERA go to Europe [in late May]. I have a little window after that, before [PANTERA's stadium tour with] METALLICA starts. At least if I get my drum tracks done, then the other guys can continue to work on it. That's the plan. Unless something else happens, but hopefully nothing will happen.\"\n\nLast November, ANTHRAX bassist Frank Bello told SiriusXM that the band is \"not in a rush\" to record the new album. \"We wanna make sure it's the right record,\" he explained. \"We can't just throw out something that's not ready. So we're gonna really make sure it's the right record and live with it for a little bit. We have some brutal stuff and some cool stuff coming up \u2014 very heavy \u2014 we've been working on. Everybody can say that when they're working on a record. But the proof is in the pudding. I'm pretty proud of what we've come up with so far.\"\n\nIn August, Ian praised the production quality on some of the band's recent albums, including 2011's \"Worship Music\" and \"For All Kings\". He said: [On] 'Worship [Music]' and 'For All Kings', for me, we've really kind of found our sound. We've got this base level where we're at right now with [producer] Jay Ruston where we know it's gonna be great, and then we could push it even further. Especially with the songwriting that we have right now, going into what will eventually be a new ANTHRAX album, it just lends itself to even a more aggressive production which I think we will have no problem accomplishing.\"\n\nIn April 2022, Scott confirmed to Metal Injection that ANTHRAX had a few songs already written for the upcoming LP. \"All I can say is we will get in the studio when we're ready,\" he said. \"I think we're getting there. I think we have great songs. I think people will be very happy.\n\n\"Not to make a weird comparison, but it's our third record back together with [singer] Joey [Belladonna]. Actually, it's an odd comparison. I should just say it's our third album since our kind of our reboot in 2010 and our third album back in the day was 'Among The Living'. I'm not saying that this is [like that album], because it's not 'Among The Living II' in any sense, but I just think we have some great songs and there's like a fucking mountain of great riffs. I think people are going to be very happy.\"\n\nIan previously discussed ANTHRAX's upcoming LP during a July 2021 appearance on Full Metal Jackie's nationally syndicated radio show. At the time, he said: \"We've been at it for a little while now. We actually started writing in '19 \u2014 pre-COVID \u2014 and kind of stepped away from things when COVID happened. We were all separate and apart and we would kind of revisit some of the demos, but we weren't actively working on it.\n\n\"Yeah, it's the same as it's always been,\" he said. \"I would have to think by the time we get to the other side of the writing process and we decide we're ready to go record it, I would have to assume it's certainly going to represent this time in our lives. And the world having gone through a pandemic, I would imagine certainly that's in some way, shape or form going to come out through this next record. I can't tell you how yet, but I would have to think it's going to.\"\n\nANTHRAX celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2021 with a number of special activities and events. Formed by Ian and bassist Dan Lilker in Queens, New York on July 18, 1981, ANTHRAX was one of the first thrash metal bands to emerge from the East Coast and quickly became regarded as a leader in the genre alongside METALLICA, SLAYER and MEGADETH.\n\nActive over the past five decades, ANTHRAX has released 11 studio albums, been awarded multiple gold and platinum certifications, received six Grammy nominations, toured the world since 1984 playing thousands of shows, including headlining Madison Square Garden and playing Yankee Stadium with the \"Big Four\".\n\n\"For All Kings\" was called by some critics ANTHRAX's strongest album to date. Its arrival followed a five-year period during which the group experienced a rebirth of sorts, beginning with ANTHRAX's inclusion on the \"Big Four\" tour, and continuing with the release of comeback LP \"Worship Music\".\n\nANTHRAX and BLACK LABEL SOCIETY recently completed a 24-date tour, making stops in all new markets, with both bands playing headline sets. Joining ANTHRAX and BLACK LABEL SOCIETY as special guest on this run was EXODUS."}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Parkway-drive", "page_content": "About Parkway Drive\n\nParkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band from Byron Bay, New South Wales, formed in 2003.

If you submit a review that was published on another website, you are more than welcome to send it to us - as long as it is YOUR review! Stealing other people's writing is unacceptable and we will not stand for any of it. This also includes written content for band information. Do not, we repeat, do NOT, copy and paste a biography or some similar text from another website (such as BNR or Tartarean Desire), nor any text from the official or unofficial site of the band. Plagiarism is evil. We have zero tolerance for this, and these warnings are explicit enough. It doesn't matter if you submitted a review that's not yours even if you gave credit, because the points will go to you and the review will still be listed under your name. Simply put, do not add a review you are not the author of, or you will lose your account and get banned immediately!\n\nAnother insta-bannable offense. You'd think this would go without saying, but just so we're clear: you are not allowed to sabotage band information by entering stupid/false/derogatory information, adding fake albums/links, deleting valid links and so on. Do any of that and we'll simply restore the data and ban your account instantly. It's rather sad that we have to actually write that down, simply because of a few juvenile assholes.\n\nShort version: don't make consecutive, worthless updates just to boost your score. You'll get your points docked at best, banned at worst. For more information about what consists of a \"worthless update\", read the list below. Longer version:\n\nSeems like some of you love your score. You love it so much, that even though you are in the top 5 of the user rankings, and have had Veteran access for months now, you still get off seeing your score increase, and gasp in horror if it should ever decrease. You could lose 2000+ points and still keep your ranking, but it would still be a tragedy. So you decide to be cute, and bloat your score in every possible way with worthless updates. This is called Point Whoring. It includes, but is probably not limited to, the following: Adding guesswork lineups to albums. This is the most common form of point whoring as of version 2 (april 2011); for example, adding the most current band members to an album without verifying who really played on the album. Always, always confirm the lineup via an official source, such as the CD/LP/cassette liner notes, or the band's official site. Simply guessing who played on the album is not acceptable and is a bannable offense.\n\nand is a bannable offense. Adding song lyrics or song lengths one by one. Just don't even think about it. We'll know.\n\nAdding bootleg albums (as parent entries). Mistakes can happen, but the policy against bootlegs is very clear (the ONLY exception is the all-too-infamous Dawn of the Black Hearts for its historical significance), and repeated offenders will be banned. On the other hand, it is allowed to add bootleg re-issues (see the section about adding re-issues and other versions on the help page) of legitimate albums already on the site as a warning to our visitors.\n\nAdding \"varied\" to an empty \"themes\" field. Variants of this include writing \"Satan\", \"death\", \"evil, darkness\" for random black or death metal bands. Also, removing existing \"Varied\" entry. Unless it's clearly erroneous to a specific band, there is no point to seek out every band with \"Varied\" as themes to remove it.\n\nSimilarly to the above, adding meaningless words in the themes field based on song titles. Yes, this happens.\n\nConstantly changing a band picture even though the one before that was perfectly suitable (if not more so).\n\nAdding a bunch of worthless links that have no more (when it's not LESS) information about the band than the actual Encyclopaedia band entry. Also applies to links to CD reviews or interviews as \"fan sites\". Exception : if the band is very very obscure and this link to an interview is one of the only reference to the band on the Web, it might be tolerated.\n\n: if the band is very very obscure and this link to an interview is one of the only reference to the band on the Web, it might be tolerated. Other worthless links: site to a general store, label or merchandise site instead of a direct link to the band's entry (see the rules for the \"Links\" section below).\n\nAdding any invalid albums (see next tab), not just bootlegs. This goes for \"Various Artist\" compilations, re-masters, any variants of the same album. Repeat offenders will be banned. There are probably more examples of worthless updates, but those should give you a general idea of what NOT to do. However, point-whoring is NOT the following: Correcting typos and grammar/spelling mistakes.\n\nCorrecting erroneous factual information (be sure of your source!).\n\nUpdating a truly outdated/irrelevant, or low-quality, band picture or logo, by a better one. For classic bands, pictures of the classic band line-up, especially if rare and/or of good quality, are perfectly suitable. If you want a recent picture, go to Roadrunner's website. For the most part, however, up-to-date pictures are welcome. Use common sense here.\n\nAdding a band's entry on a label website as an \"official\" link. E.g., www.label.com/bandname instead of www.label.com.\n\nAs mentioned above, adding a link to an interview if this interview is one of the only references to this band on the Net. If the band already has a website at all (official or not), forget it.\n\nUpdating lyrics if their paragraph and/or formatting is near-illegible (in fact, since one gets only one point per album for such an update, we must commend one's patience for taking the time and effort to do that!)\n\nAdding re-release, remastering, bonus tracks, etc. information in the \"additional notes\" field of the original album's entry.\n\nAny update that truly makes an improvement and makes the site generally better and/or more complete. So if you're unsure, ask yourself this: will doing this update bring anything good in any way? If the answer is the negative, then just forget about it. There are probably more examples of worthless updates, but those should give you a general idea of what NOT to do. However, point-whoring isthe following: It's simple, really. We catch you at point-whoring (and we will), we drop your score, if you don't get the message, we \"Durst\" (aka ban) you. So, just don't do it.\n\nPlease, try to avoid spelling mistakes. We realize that many people often don't take the time to really type well on the Internet, but this is not a chatroom or even a message board, and you should take what you submit seriously enough to at least write properly. This goes especially for song titles. Try to respect the punctuation and proper capitalization too. If the songs are in a foreign language, make sure the spelling is accurate. Proper capitalisation is important. Do not enter information in ALL CAPS or all lowercase. Respect the capitalisation for band names, album and song titles. Tip: band names and song/album titles generally have the first letter of each word capitalized (except for acronyms obviously), except for small words like \"the\" and \"of\" (unless of course they start the title).\n\nGood: Council of the Fallen, Storm of the Light's Bane\n\nNot so good: Council Of The Fallen, Storm Of The Light's Bane\n\nBad: COUNCIL OF THE FALLEN, storm of the lights bane When in doubt, use the Wikipedia standards for capitalisation. When entering line-up and artist information, always use the real instrument names. It's \"vocals, guitars, bass and drums\", not \"regurgitated vokills\", \"666 shredding strings of doom\", \"baritone cacophony\" and \"pounding rhythms of madness\" or *insert pretentious/dumb metaphore here*.\n\nAnother rule that might appear obvious, but we've had several violators already: you are not allowed to create sock puppets, for example, to rig review scores, the recommendation system, or to spam reports. We have had people try to create multiple accounts to add more votes to the similar artists recommendation system. As stated here, any user caught registering more than one account (and they always, invariably get caught!) for this purpose will be instantly banned, and all their votes will be wiped in one click of a mouse, so don't bother. Similarly, we've had the occasional idiots who created several accounts and submitted seemingly different reviews to boost an album's score. Needless to say, once caught the reviews were deleted and all the accounts were banned. Other uses of sock puppets may include (but are not limited to): sending several reports (or report comments) from different accounts to make the original report seem more important; reporting a pending band claiming the band is legit (while in reality both the band and the report were sent by the same person), and of course, posting on the forum with multiple accounts all pretending to agree with each others to reinforce your viewpoint. To repeat: users caught with sock puppets will be instantly banned.\n\nNeutral information only, written in 3rd person, at all times. (This does not apply to reviews, obviously, but band/album/artist/label data.) This site is meant to be an encyclopedia after all. Do NOT write stuff, in the lineup or additional notes fields or anywhere else, that promotes or bashes the band in question! Do not write a biography in the first person, e.g. \"This is my band we formed last year, we sound like band X and draw influences from Y, etc etc\". Be reasonable for the data you enter in the additional notes (whether it's for bands, albums, labels or artists). It clearly says \"no personal opinions\", yet we still see submissions where it says things like \"Awesome brutal band for all death metal fans!\", or \"their talent has brought them much recognition in their home country\" and the likes. Don't. Guidelines regarding the \"not to be confused\" issue:\n\nThere are three stances where \"not to be confused with\" might be useful: When there is a non-metal band/artist of the same name;\n\nWhen there are two bands/artists from the same name and the same country ;\n\nthe same country ; When the same person has a bunch of ambiguous band names/side projects, like Paul Chain, Devin Townsend... we don't want our contributors to add Paul Di'Anno's full discography under each of his band entries: Paul Di'Anno, Paul Di'Anno's Killers, Di'Anno, Killers (UK), Di'Anno Killers, etc..\n\n>> Band links << Everyone can contribute links to websites related to a band. Do not, however, add a link to the main page of a site such as \"Headbanger's Delight\" to every single band that sells merchandise there. If you do that you could at least link to the page with the actual band merchandise. For example:\n\nAcceptable:: http://www.headbanger.net/bandname/, http://www.sitename.com/band.ext?id=666\n\nUnacceptable: : http://www.headbanger.net, http://www.mydistro.com/home\n\nI.e., a direct link to a band page. Linking to the label or store's main page is useless. Do not add links to album reviews or interviews, unless there is no other source about the band on the Internet. For those with the Veteran rank: you may update URLs or delete broken links. Do not delete valid links! You are allowed to delete broken, false or unrelated links, to keep the integrity of the information. Deleting valid links just for the hell of it, or to spite the owner of the linked site, or whatever stupid reason, will not be tolerated. >> Artist links << You can add the musician/artist's links such as his homepage, his Facebook, Youtube channel, etc. Do NOT add links to interviews, nor to links to the artist's BAND homepage unless you link directly to a detailed section about the artist. For example, for Steve Harris, linking to his page on Ironmaiden.com is acceptable, because that link contains a detailed biography with information not present on the artist page. But linking only to Ironmaiden.com directly on Steve Harris's artist page is useless, since that link is already present on the Iron Maiden page. Similarly, if Steve Harris has a personal homepage, do not add it to Iron Maiden's page; add it to his artist page instead. Exception: if Steve Harris played in a non-metal band, it would be OK to add a link to this band on his artist page, under the link category Unlisted bands. For links to the artist's non-metal/unlisted bands (link category: \"unlisted bands\", only add up to ONE link per non-metal band. For example, Kurt Cobain is on the site because of his link to Earth and Melvins, but he's of course more famous for Nirvana, a band not featured on the site. Adding a link to the Official Nirvana Website is acceptable; adding various Nirvana websites is not. One per unlisted band is enough. In other words, link to pages related to the artist as a PERSON and not his/her bands, unless those bands are not on the site (such as non-metal bands). Keep band links to the band pages. Exception: for solo artists, if the artist's homepage is both about the artist (as a person) and his/her solo band, it's acceptable to add the link to both pages. >> Label links << In the \"website\" text field of a label, you should add the label's main homepage. For any other link, use the \"External links\" section. You can add the label's Youtube channel, Myspace, Facebook, Webstore (if different than the homepage), and so on, in that section.\n\nSince April 2012, you can now add lineups from the artist's page by searching for the band(s) an artist has been part of. You can only add actual members (permanent or live) from this page; guest and session artists must be added from the albums they participated in. This is an important distinction, since you can also add non-featured bands (bands not listed on the site) on the artist page with lineup information (instrument, year range, etc.) just like you would for a featured band, but you can only add bands the artist has been a member of. Do not add every single band the artist has been a guest for! The resulting clutter will be ludicrous. For example: adding Nirvana and Foo Fighters on Dave Grohl's page is acceptable, since he respectively was/is a member of those bands. Adding Tenacious D or Killing Joke is not, since he was simply a guest for those bands. Related to that, there is also a category of external link (mentioned in the External Links section above), \"Unlisted bands\". You can use this section to link to no more than ONE site (official band sites should take priority) per unlisted band on the artist page. For example, it is acceptable to add the official Foo Fighters website to Dave Grohl's page, but if you do that, do not also add the Foo Fighters Facebook, Youtube, etc. Basically, pick one that makes sense as a basic reference only. This site is not meant to be a directory of non-metal links, after all.\n\nThat's a no-brainer, obviously. Don't submit fake bands, don't add false information, and if you want to make updates such as band line-ups, check the validity of your sources. You must provide compelling evidence of the band's existence (see \"must have valid release\" above) and of its \"metalness\".\n\nFor band submissions, particularly lesser-known/obscure ones, keep in mind that it is the submitter's responsibility to provide all the necessary evidence and information (primarily samples to judge \"metalness\" and proof for a valid release), as well as doing so in a readily accessible and apparent fashion. It falls to the submitting user to gather and include all the pertinent information; the moderator should only have to review and verify it, ideally based on nothing more than what is directly linked and detailed in the submission itself. Always assume that the moderator has never heard of the band until that point, and act accordingly in filling out the submission notes. A mod is perfectly within his or her rights to reject a potentially acceptable band with insufficient or no info included \"that could have just been googled\". Some staffers may sometimes choose to do some research on their own in the reviewing process, but this is strictly speaking not their job and should not be taken for granted. Note that merely adding a release to the discography section is not proof in and of itself, a submission can be seemingly complete, but still lack the critical proof. To illustrate this point, here are a few selected examples of what should be avoided; submissions such as the following have a high chance of getting rejected: A nearly empty submission with a short mention of the existence of a physical demo in the submission notes, telling the mod to look up the band online.\n\nAn ostensibly complete submission with a full-length in the discography section, as well as a link to the band's Facebook, but no notes or explanation whatsoever; you may be aware of a relevant photograph buried somewhere in a 100-picture album, but the moderator is not. It's not difficult to directly link to a specific image.\n\nA submission providing us with an email address and telling us to contact the band for more information.\n\nA submission with a link to a blog about old metal bands from Ukraine entirely in Cyrillic, accompanied by a note that the evidence can be found there. Although quite a few moderators do not speak English as a first language, we are not polyglots and this is an English-language site. Moderators don't like having to put lengthy texts from a dozen different pages through Google Translate to unearth the relevant piece of information (not to mention that machine translation is not always reliable). Thus, for proof not in English please always try to provide a quick translation, if needed/applicable/possible.\n\nA submission for a hardcore punk band with allegedly one or more thrash metal releases among their huge discography, but no explanation as to which release(s) might be metal. For such bands, always be specific about which release(s) you think qualify the band for inclusion. We are not going to listen through ten full-lengths and fifteen demos/EPs otherwise. Note that being explicit and clear about the required evidence will save time and effort for both parties (and avoid frustration and misunderstandings). Also note that the exact way staffers handle submissions can vary from mod to mod, so some may be more (or less) forgiving than others. However, taking the aforementioned points to heart will always be appreciated and help speed up the review process.\n\n...Usually. Don't ever keep submitting the same band repeatedly. If your band is rejected, you will receive an email notification (if you didn't receive anything, check in your spam folder). But regardless of your notification settings, you can see the status of your band submissions at all time under My Bands in the top left menu. Rejected bands will be flagged in red. If your submission was rejected, you may apply corrections (based on the reason posted) and resubmit. Use caution when resubmitting! The mods can see the history of all the changes, and they will know if you have resubmitted without responding to the reason(s) that they gave you. If your band is clearly unacceptable (i.e. not metal, fake, not a valid release), repeated submissions will only a) annoy the moderators, b) result in the band being blacklisted (thus preventing any further resubmission), and c) possibly cause your account to get banned. If you want to object to a band rejection, go here, read the first post, and most of all, BE POLITE. If a band is still pending acceptance, it will not disappear out of the queue - so there is no need to keep spamming us with the same band over and over again. Just be patient, we'll get to it eventually. If, for some reason, you believe your band submission did not go through because you got a blank screen or something after your submission, please check if it's present either in your drafts or in the submission queue. If it's not showing up, something went wrong server-side (and we're sorry about that), so do resubmit. So normally there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to submit a band twice. If you do so by accident, that's acceptable, as browsers can be fickle; but it's hard to double-post something two days apart."}, {"url": "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/full-length-album", "page_content": "collocation in English\n\nThese words are often used together.
