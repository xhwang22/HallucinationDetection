Individuals work together for the survival of the community as a whole. Even children are fairly self-sufficient and aren't considered to be inferior to adults. Men and women have slightly different roles but have an equal role in decision making in families. While some of the younger generations now keep track of their age, it was not common to keep track of age in the past, so life expectancy is unknown.\n\nTypically, families are nuclear (though sometimes men take multiple wives), and women often limit the number of children they have using natural forms of birth control. There has generally been a preference for marriage to occur between ambilateral cross-cousins, but in recent years there have been some marriages between Huaorani and Kichwa. At times, disagreements regarding marriage alliances have led to violence.\n\nPeople are also a part of a larger family group--those who live in the same house together. Groups of around 10-35 people (typically an older couple plus their unmarried children and married daughters and their children) live in longhouses where they sleep and eat together. They are so connected that when one person is sick, all others must follow the same diet and food restrictions to help that person get well. A longhouse may also share an alliance with other longhouses (especially that from a cross-sex sibling).\n\nHunting, Gathering, and Horticulture\n\nTraditionally, the Huaorani people sustained themselves on a mix of hunting, gathering, and growing a few crops like manioc, plantains, and sweet potatoes. As a result, their diet consists of the crops they grow, forest fruits they collect, and meat. Foraging has traditionally been more important to them than gardening. In past years they lived more nomadically, creating small settlements for a period of around ten years before moving on to a new area.\n\nWhile the Huaorani prefer foraging and hunting, they do grow some crops such as manioc.\n\nThe Huaorani don't consume dairy products, and thus meat is their primary source of protein. The main tools the Huaorani use to hunt are blowguns and spears. Their spears have sharp points on both ends and are sometimes dipped in a paralyzing poison. They have taboos against hunting certain animals and primarily hunt and eat monkey, wild boar, birds, and fish. Consistent with their egalitarian structure, hunting is something everyone can do, including women and children (though older individuals may provide children with some instruction)."}, {"url": "https://minorityrights.org/minorities/huaorani/", "page_content": "Help us improve our Directory.

Numbering approximately 1,300, the Huaorani are a relatively isolated indigenous group inhabiting the eastern Amazonian region of Ecuador. From their tragic encounter with North American missionaries in 1956 to the present day, they have been problematically represented in journalistic and popular imagination as \u2018Ecuador\u2019s last savages\u2019. Despite the efforts of missionaries to proselytize and culturally assimilate the Huaorani, the latter have largely retained their distinctive way of apprehending the world and continue to be known as skilled warriors.\n\nHistorical context\n\nThe successful claim made in 1990 by the lowland Huaorani to 600,000 hectares of territory was subject to the condition that they would not interfere with oil companies drilling there. As part of the government\u2019s strategy for developing resources even in restricted areas, the Maxus Energy Oil Company, whose claim lies within a national park of great biological diversity, was given permission to construct a pipeline and a narrow access road. Oil exploration paired with increases in lumbering activities and tourism has caused some Huaorani to retreat further into the jungle.\n\nIn 1991, in the wake of receiving territorial rights from the government after a protracted international campaign, young schooled men formed the Organization of the Huaorani Nation of Amazonian Ecuador. This organization has operated as a liaison with the oil industry, including Maxus, the company which has exploited petroleum in the Huaorani territory and the Yasun\u00ed National Park. In 2005, despite protests by Huaorani people, the Brazilian oil company, Petrobr\u00e1s, continued to drill for oil in the Yasun\u00ed forest of Ecuador. Although the media reported that the Huaorani broke their agreement with Petrobr\u00e1s, Huaorani leaders argued that the president of the Organization of the Huaorani Nationality signed the contract without consulting the Huaorani community.\n\nCurrent issues\n\nCaught between the conflicting objectives of petroleum development and forest conservation, Huaorani are confronted with pernicious and contradictory economic and political interests. They continue to be threatened by oil extraction and illegal lumbering. Yet, while encouraged by missionaries, some Huaorani have given up their traditional economic activities and turned to the lumber industry for their livelihood. Also, while eco-tourism is on the rise in the region, tourism operators rarely consult the Huaorani before bringing outsiders into their communities.\n\nDespite plans to protect the Yasun\u00ed National Park, the home of many Huaorani, from drilling through a United Nations-managed fund, in August 2013 the government announced that due to insufficient international financial support the restrictions would be lifted. President Rafael Correa decreed the cancellation of the Yasun\u00ed initiative in August 2016, and the National Assembly authorised drilling after a lengthy debate. There were a number of protests against the decision; nevertheless, the government confirmed that drilling was underway by October 2016.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus on Huaorani forms of justice. Various reports assert that over 60 people have died due to reprisals in the past two decades. This was brought to the forefront of national attention in March 2013, when Huaorani raided a Taromenane village after the murder of a Huaorani couple, allegedly by Taromenane. The raid was prolonged and brutal, resulting in numerous deaths. Eight months after these events took place, the government arrested and charged six Huaorani of genocide. The authorities were heavily criticised for not conducting a thorough investigation and being culturally insensitive. The case also gave rise to accusations that Ecuador\u2019s media and government have been responsible for promoting negative stereotypes and reactions to indigenous peoples. Many commentators and indigenous activists pointed out that the risk of violence between communities has increased as pressure from oil workers and loggers has brought them into closer proximity and greater competition over resources with each other."}, {"url": "https://peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Huaorani", "page_content": "The Indigenous Huaorani People\n\nEthnonyms: Auca, Auishiri, Huao, Sabela, Waodani, Waorani Countries inhabited: Ecuador, Peru Language family: Unclassified Language branch: Unclassified\n\nWhat do the Huaorani and crude oil have in common? It might seem like a strange question, but the answer is detailed and contemporary. It sheds light on the Huaorani themselves and also on some of the forces that are familiar to us, but which have yet to play out in many parts of the world and threaten indigenous human populations in the way they have threatened the Huaorani \u2014 and continue to do so. First, the Huaorani and crude oil were \"discovered\" around the same time in the Amazon Basin. Second, in both cases, upon learning of their discovery many in the western world were interested. Of course, there was very little overlap between the groups interested in each of these discoveries. Third, like the oil, there will come a time when the Huaorani are also not counted among the rainforest's \"natural\" resources.\n\nThe Huaorani first came into contact with non-Huaorani (or cowode as they refer to outsiders) in the late 1940s. The oil company, Shell, had begun the first exploratory drilling on traditional Huaorani lands. They very quickly abandoned the effort due to the overwhelming fierceness they experienced from their \"hosts.\" (The term Auca is actually the name the Quichua give to them, which translates roughly into English as \"savage.\") Further contacts took place in the mid-1950s. This time it was Christian linguist missionaries who, according to their later published claims, were motivated at least in part by the threat of extinction the Huaorani faced due to fierce intertribal conflict and the certainty of eventual further oil exploration. This contact was not initially successful either. In 1956 five missionaries were killed by Huaorani, since they viewed them as invaders. Around that time one of the murdered missionary's sisters, Rachel Saint, achieved what would become, for the most part, a peaceful contact with them for the rest of her life. (Saint's story is well documented; see Citation and References at the bottom of this page.)\n\nA lot of her life was spent learning, and contributing to our linguistic understanding of, the Huaorani language. (As you can see above, their language to this day has defied classification by linguists.) Her informant in learning the language was a young Huaorani woman named Dayuma. Between them they began missionary work, reaching many of the Huaorani around Dayuma's home. They are still today more responsible than any other two people for missionizing the Huaorani.\n\nIn the late-1960s the oil company, Texaco, approached the Ecuadorian government hoping for permission to drill for oil on Huaorani land. Saint and Dayuma became a key part of the following massive displacement of hundreds of Huaorani. Before then, most had remained on their ancestral lands, uncontacted, and living the same hunting/gathering lifestyle that hadn't changed in millennia. What is known about this lifestyle is that the Huaorani cultivated almost no crops or plants and relied on hunting for their meat and fish. They were experts in, and had a symbiotic relationship with, the rainforest. That relationship transcended into the spiritual. Shamanism was practiced, which included the use of naturally occurring-hallucinogens. Animistic ritual and polygamy also characterized traditional Huaorani beliefs. They believed in a symbolic relationship between their environment and themselves. The forest would always provide enough that they didn't have to grow food or keep animals. Leaves were like their children. They believed strongly in their history of and desire for independence. In fact, at the age when our children enter second grade, Huaorani children became to a large extent independent of their parents \u2014 even hunting and gathering their own food.\n\nThe missionaries and the Ecuadorian government agreed to relocate as many Huaorani as possible away from the drilling areas to the missions that had been established in the previous ten years. Hundreds were relocated, while others fled to even more remote parts of the jungle. Accounts of the relocated Huaoranis' experiences differ. At one extreme, some have written of this event as \"ethnocide.\" Others have claimed that it saved the Huaorani from genocide at the hands of the oil companies. An unquestionable outcome is that many had their life and culture changed forever, while others chose (and in some cases were never presented a choice) to stay deep in the forest and live the way they'd only ever known.\n\nThe visitor can see this polarization today in Ecuador. Eventually, many missionized Huaorani moved to so-called oil frontier towns, particularly Coca. Spanish is now their first language; drug abuse rates are high. On the other end of the spectrum, two groups remain virtually uncontacted to this day. The Tagaeri and Taromenane clans (who are believed to live together these days) still live the way they always have \u2014 entirely off the land. The Tagaeri are known for killing, by spears, trespassers on their land in 1987, 2000 and 2001. Although they have been successful in avoiding contact, with their number undoubtedly low one has to wonder whether their gene pool can be viable for much longer. (The best population number available is 37, as reported by a Tagaeri woman who was kidnapped in 1993 by other Huaorani.)\n\nViability of the gene pool is not only a concern for uncontacted Huaorani. Before I visited communities around Tiguino, I was informed of cases of physical deformity due to incestuous reproduction \u2014 although I didn't witness that myself. Living on the edge of Huaorani territory, these communities live next door to colonists comprising many ethnic groups, who moved in following the construction of the \"Via Auca\" by Texaco in the past forty years. There has been, however, little intermarriage with these other groups.\n\nThe contacted Huaorani today differ widely in the dealings they wish to have with outsiders. Some embrace tourism and work with tour companies they trust. The visitor can witness in their villages rainforest survival little changed by time. Others see tourism as a threat similar to the encroachment of the oil companies. To the extent that the contacted Huaorani have a unified voice regarding the threats to their livelihood, it is through the Organization of the Huaorani Nation of the Ecuadorian Amazon (ONHAE). Founded in 1990, ONHAE represents Huaorani communities in issues such as land rights and education.\n\nThe Huaorani differ widely in their experience of education also. It is remarkable that only two generations after their \"discovery\" some today are educated to university level. While a few Huaorani children are still self-sufficient hunter/gatherers, over half attend school. Still, as shown in the picture, above left, facilities are extremely basic. Children are usually taught in Spanish, since their teachers don't speak their language. Not surprisingly, many never progress beyond the first few grades.\n\nAs isolated indigenous groups the world over continue to be assimilated into surrounding cultures, governments, non-governmental organizations and aid agencies alike can learn, and hopefully avoid repeating, many lessons from the experiences of the Huaorani.\n\nPhotography copyright \u00a9 1999 - 2023, Ray Waddington.

They consider themselves the bravest tribe in the Amazon. Until 1956, they had never had any contact with the outside world.\n\nA tribe with strong beliefs\n\nThe Huaorani are remarkable hunters and feared warriors. Threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices, their lives as hunter-gatherers have changed to live mainly in camps. They have a vast knowledge of animals, plants and trees that comes from a total dependence on nature.\n\nThe Huaorani have an animistic belief, i.e. they believe in the spiritual as well as physical existence of an animal. They believe that a person who dies then walks a path of life after death, which is guarded by a large anaconda. Those among the dead who cannot escape the snake do not manage to enter the realm of dead spirits and cannot return to Earth as animals (often termites). Spirits are present all over the world, which for the Huaorani only includes the forest.\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani identify deeply with the jaguar, an important and majestic predator. According to the myth, they are the descendants of a mating between a jaguar and an eagle. Therefore, they will never hunt the jaguar. And they will also not kill snakes because they are considered an evil force and a bad omen, the anaconda in particular.\n\nTraditions and customs\n\nHunting and fishing provide much of the Huaorani diet, as well as being of cultural importance. Traditionally, hunted creatures were limited to monkeys, birds and peccaries (wild boars). Neither land predators nor raptors are hunted. Bananas, cassava, peanuts, sweet potatoes, berries (berries) and fruits are on the menu. Fermented cassava is the main ingredient of their beer, which is poured in abundance during the festivities.\n\nThe Huaorani have many taboos concerning the tradition with hunting and food. They don't eat deer because their eyes look like human eyes. Although hunting is a joyful activity, it implies a minimum of ethics. The Huaorani have to kill animals to live, but believing that they have a spirit and a soul, they must be appeased or else they will take revenge. Therefore, a shaman shows respect during the ritual preparation of the poison (curare) deposited on the darts. Hunting with these darts is not considered killing but rather gathering.\n\n\n\nOne of the most important things for the Huaorani is family life. Extended families are very close. Everyone contributes to the community: men, women and children. The men cut down trees to create fields for the women to cultivate. The food they plant includes bananas, peanuts, sweet potatoes and cassava. Once they have used the full potential of the soil, they leave the area to find another place.\n\nA perfect knowledge of their environment\n\nIn addition to plants and trees, the Huaorani have a great knowledge of poisons, medicines, hallucinogens, building materials and many others. The Huaorani marry each other, with the resulting tradition becoming an important social activity. They take great care in organizing the ceremonies. Many of their festivities and ceremonies lead to weddings.\n\n\n\nUsually, men feed their families by hunting. Their main hunting weapon is the blowgun. It's usually three to four meters long. They make their own weapons. Huaorani spears are most often made from pejibaye (small fruit palm) wood and have sharp spikes on both ends. As for the darts, they are soaked with poison from the curare plant that paralyzes its victims. This type of weapon allows the tribe to hunt prey such as birds or monkeys from a distance. Their precision is relentless.\n\n\n\nThe Huaorani usually wear their hair long. Face and body paintings are made for religious ceremonies, to frighten evil spirits, or simply for aesthetic reasons. The paintings come from trees and plants growing in the area. Traditional dance is an important part of life. Children are included in the dances to ensure that the dances are passed on to the next generation. In many situations, these dances involve the whole village. The Waodani (or Waodari, Huaorani) is polygamous and is traditionally married within the tribe through cousin marriages.\n\nToday\n\nLife changes for the Huaorani. Over the last few decades, they have, against their will, gone from a hunter-gatherer society to a life of permanent forest camps (beginning of sedentarisation). However, in remote villages, hunting is still the preferred way of life and the key to their survival. They possess an intimate and profound knowledge of the animals, which stems from a total dependence on nature. The Huaorani homelands are threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices. In 2012, the Huaorani have about 6,800 km\u00b2 of land, about a third of their original territory."}, {"url": "https://www.wildimages-phototours.com/photography-tours/waorani-amazon-tribe-ecuador/", "page_content": "Friday 14th July \u2013 Monday 24th July 2023 Leaders: Julie-Anne Davies and and local cultural guides 11 Days Group Size Limit 6 Sunday 14th July \u2013 Wednesday 24th July 2024 Leaders: Julie-Anne Davies and and local cultural guides 11 Days Group Size Limit 6\n\nECUADOR\u2019S WAORANI: THE LAST HUNTER GATHERERS OF THE AMAZON PHOTO TOUR WITH WILD IMAGES\n\nJoin Wild Images on a truly unique journey through the pristine rainforests of Shiripuno and the Yasunis to live and learn alongside four remote family communities of the Waorani, the last tribe of hunter gatherer people in the Amazon. The first fully comprehensive photo tour of its kind, we will take you on walks through the rainforest to learn about medicinal plant use and the Waorani\u2019s sophisticated use of bio-toxins. You will meet at least one traditional Shaman and join head men on hunting trips using gigantic blow darts and spears. We will travel by canoe along some of the wildest tributaries of the Amazon searching for monkeys, cayman, turtles and a myriad of birds including toucans, macaws and hoatzins. Joining a group of Waorani women and children we will walk deep into the rainforest to watch and photograph the capture of tiny fish from rainforest pools using a bio-toxic sap from the roots of a Barbasco plant that literally makes small fish jump out of the water into nets! Under a blanket of millions of stars we will travel silently by canoe to search for cayman and we will learn how to harvest fruits and vegetables like platano, lulo fruit and yukka from the forest. For meals we will sample some wild food that has been caught or harvested that day and cooked over an open fire.\n\nFinally we will stay overnight with a traditional Waorani elder who has spent his life living on the back doorstep of the Intangible Zone where Taromenanes and Taegeri, two completely isolated tribal groups live in voluntary isolation in the forest. Around a campfire we will sit and listen to his stories of life alongside some of the last un-contacted people on earth.\n\nSpending time with the Waorani is truly a once in a lifetime experience. These gentle people exist softly in one of the last pristine corners of biodiversity in the Amazon yet their lives and territories are under threat from oil drilling, colonisation and land clearing. Visiting Waorani clans in remote communities that see so few tourists, you will learn first hand about their reverence for the forest, their sophisticated understanding of natural toxins/medicines and how they conserve the wildlife in their forest homes, all while surrounded by the magic of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nA Life in the Wild\n\nNo one knows the rivers of Shiripuno and Cononaco more intimately than the Waorani. Just over a hundred years ago, communities of Waorani used to live high in the canopy of gargantuan Kapok trees, on platforms that acted as safe havens from any invaders below. The impetus behind why they moved to live on the ground is not known but when they decided to live on the forest floor, they did so with very little impact, building traditional Peto Baco houses from saplings and palm fronds harvested gently from their surrounding rainforests. Inside these tiny community clans, lived multi-generational households in a similar way as they do today.\n\nUntil the 1950s the Waorani lived untouched by the outside world in these small communities. It wasn\u2019t until groups of missionaries flew over in light planes seeking people to convert that anyone really even knew about them. After they arrived the world of the Waorani changed.\n\nThey were forced to wear clothes, convert, go to school and attend church. Yet despite all of these changes, many Waorani still live a relatively wild existence, where days of the week and hours of the day are an irrelevance. Many Waorani still live their lives with the rhythms of nature; choosing to cure ills, hunt for food, fish, gather and cultivate crops in tune with the sunrise and sunset, the onset of rains or periods of dry.\n\nTo spend time with them doing photography and exploring their rainforest homes is more than just an act of taking pictures, it is an unending learning experience of survival in some of the world\u2019s last great wilderness areas.\n\nNatural Worship\n\nYour first encounter with the gentle way in which Waorani relate to nature comes from your arrival at a community where the family matriarch is charged with looking after all of the community\u2019s young creatures including children, grandchildren and the family\u2019s pets. The Waorani religiously keep wild animals as pets in their homes. An animal might be found in the forest, or end up as the unintended victim of a hunt and it is gently taken home where it is cared for until it decides to leave of its own volition. Visiting Waorani families you might find them living alongside a collection of parrots, toucans, monkeys, kinkajou and even Caracaras, who they use as house alarms to warn them about visitors. These animals are all kept alongside cats, dogs and chickens in a harmonious menagerie that is a wonderland for Waorani children and nature loving guests.\n\nThis relatively harmless practice underpins the way in which Waorani relate to their world.\n\nMoving with them through the forest on a hunt, it is almost impossible to hear them walk and even more impossible to keep up with them on foot! Just occasionally, a hunting party may pass by a large Kapok tree. These forest giants can grow up to 80 metres in height and their buttress roots spread out like giant fingers clinging to the forest floor. Arriving at a Kapok will usually stop a Waorani person in their tracks. Watching them look upwards towards the canopy of the tree overhead is a little like watching a religious person enter a place of worship for the very first time. The Waorani will gently touch and stroke the buttress roots of the Kapok in an act of worship. They may also hide behind these roots while hunting wild food like peccaries and also use their hands to bang on the roots of the tree to communicate to others in their party.\n\nFor the Waorani, it is shameful to raise a young boy who is afraid of the forest. Each time an animal is killed for food, it is taken back to the community and laid on the ground. The vines that were used to tie the animal so it could be carried, are unraveled and then used to gently \u2018whip\u2019 young boys in order to pass the spirit of that wild animal on to them.\n\nElders will also come and see a newly hunted animal and as they visit, they stroke the body of the animal while it is still warm before stroking their own arms, bodies and legs, an act that allows them to gain life from the deceased and carry its spirit onwards.\n\nHunter Gatherer Ways of Life\n\nContrary to what many might believe, Waorani people are extremely selective about which animals they might hunt and they only ever take what they need. Using a combination of traditional spears and poison darts, the Waorani will hunt every day looking for their mainstays of peccary and monkeys. The Waorani selectively leave some animals alone in the knowledge that unusual creatures are rare and shouldn\u2019t be hunted in case this disrupts the balance of nature that surrounds them.\n\nIf a hunting trip fails, the people in the hunting party will collect palm fronds from the forest to fix the roofs of houses on their rests between hunts.\n\nWhile some foods are harvested wild from the rainforest it is surprising to learn that the Waorani keep \u2018garden plots\u2019 of plants they need in the direct vicinity of their houses. Community shared plots that grow Yukka, platano, papaya and lulo fruits are created from very small forest clearings and are visited by Waorani women on a daily basis. Once harvested the food is shared in the entire community.\n\nHallucinogens, Toxins and Sophisticated Medicines\n\nThe Waorani\u2019s most spectacular method of hunting comes in the form of blow darts and blow dart pipes, some of which are up to four meters long! Fine blow darts made from forest hardwoods are prepared prior to each hunt. A popular myth of this style of hunting is that the poison used comes from frogs yet very few Amazonian people harvest poison from tiny frogs and the Waorani have never utilised this toxin. Instead, the bark of native Curare vines is collected and mixed with water then boiled down to a thick syrup which is then used to coat the end of the dart. The darts are then carefully loaded into a cylindrical carrier worn around the neck of the hunter alongside a spherical calabash which holds Kapok wool that is wrapped around each dart to help ease its passage. When loaded and shot, a dart holds enough toxin to kill a small mammal but it is harmless to humans.\n\nAnother sophisticated use of bio-toxins involves collecting the roots of the barbasco bush and bashing them to procure a sap which is used to catch fish. Parties of women and children will collect barbasco roots before venturing out on foot into the rainforest. Arriving at a small rainforest stream, the root is then pounded against a piece of found wood in the forest to release a milky sap. This sap slowly flows downstream stunning small fish and making them jump out of the water where eager Waorani children wait with nets to catch the jumping fish. Their catch is then transported back to the community using a freshly made basket of Oma palm fronds called a Lintaye. Although tiny, these fish are then salt dried and kept to use as fish stock for freshly caught fish dishes from the river. Again, the barbasco bio-toxin is lethal for fish but harmless for human consumption.\n\nPerhaps the most well known use of rainforest toxins by the Waorani is the practice of consuming Ayahuasco, a hallucinogen that is used by community shamans in rituals to purge people of their worries and sins. During our tour we will witness an Ayahuasco ceremony held by a local shaman where actual participation is entirely voluntary!\n\nA walk with Waorani people in their rainforests is more than just a hike. It is like going on a shopping spree to your local mall where pharmacy, supermarket and building supplies stores are gathered all in one trip. Their knowledge of the forests that surrounds them is astounding. They know intimately which vines and leaves cure stomach and intestinal upsets. Need an insect repellant? The Waorani use the mud from lazy ants nests. Strings from vines are used to make strong hammocks, ropes, fishing nets and baskets. Nothing artificial is used to collect what they harvest. The Waorani will either use calabashes or natural fibre baskets to carry food and other goods from the forest. As a guest of the Waorani, you will find yourself immersed in an endless learning experience with the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest as your classroom.\n\nA Complex People with Simple Celebrations\n\nDespite the Waorani\u2019s sophisticated understanding of the world around them, they celebrate significant events in a rather spartan way. Instead of festivals and long days of merriment, a simple \u2018anniversary celebration\u2019 is held once a year where young Waorani will choose their husbands and wives. Once chosen the actual ceremony is only around ten to fifteen minutes long and the couple\u2019s commitment will be confirmed by the elders of their respective communities.\n\nFor these ceremonies they dress in the beautiful elegance of bush string harnesses with crowns made from macaw feathers. Their most famous \u2018mark\u2019 is that of red mask made of face paint from the Achiote tree, or lipstick bush, which grows near their forest homes. This is gently applied by women to the wearer for special occasions. During our stay with different Waorani communities we will witness the application of Achiote and also photograph people wearing their simple and beautiful finery as they would if they were preparing for a special occasion.\n\nA Culture and Environment Under Threat\n\nIn Ecuador the territory of the Waorani spans almost seven million hectares, however the Ecuador government has never formally recognised their territory by official title. Instead, corrupt government officials have worked with oil and gas companies to section off their territory into blocks. At first the Waorani fought hard to keep a region named Pastaza protected from exploitation. Their battle was successful and in 2019 the Waorani secured over half a million acres of rainforest as a permanent reserve because they were able to prove that their community wasn\u2019t consulted before the land was offered up for sale.\n\nThe next battle front is the Yasuni National Park where a significant number of Waorani reside alongside some of the world\u2019s last un -contacted tribes like the Taegare. The elders of the Yasuni Waoranis are now trapped in what may turn out to be a multi-generational fight to protect their forested territories and stop the government from mining their land.\n\nTheir struggle to sustainably live in one of the last great hotspots of biodiversity in the Amazon, is being fought by Waorani elders block by block. At stake is their way of life which they need to secure for future generations. On our tour we will learn from Waorani elders first-hand about the battle they face to save their rainforest home.\n\nSpending time with the Waorani is a once in a lifetime opportunity to enhance your visual storytelling skills while living alongside the Waorani who are some of the most humble, strong and intelligent people of the Americas \u2013 the last true hunter gatherers of the Amazon.\n\nHighly Experienced Local Guides\n\nWild Images has engaged highly experienced guides and translators in the Amazon to work alongside our photography leader of your tour. Chatting directly with Waorani communities through our expert translator guide on forest walks and canoe trips you will gain a first-hand insight into the Waorani way of life. When he isn\u2019t helping you to translate, our guide is able to spot incredible wildlife, show you how to fish, hunt or collect materials from the forest. With over three decades of experience guiding guests into these forests, his knowledge of nature, medicinal plants, Waorani way of life and culture is unparalleled in the region. Working alongside our expert photography leaders, our tour will fully immerse you in the beautiful world of the Waorani, the last true hunter gatherers of the Amazon, in Ecuador.\n\nWalking\n\nThe walking trails in the Amazon are mostly on level ground and are easy. Some tracks and track entrances can be slippery and muddy but assistance will be provided to guests to disembark from canoes and walk up and down riverbanks.\n\nAccommodation\n\nAccommodation is in comfortable, insect proof tents that are erected either in wooden houses or in traditional Peto Baco homes. Shared bathroom facilities are available at our camps in the family homes of the Waorani.\n\nPhotography\n\nThis is a tour that will involve a large variety of subjects from wildlife that you will see on rivers to portrait photography in the forest and in people\u2019s homes. A zoom or fixed length wildlife lens will be helpful, as will a wide angle lens and a travel lens similar to 24-105mm.\n\nPhones and bridge cameras are also easy to use in the Waorani area.\n\nDrone photography in the Amazon is permitted and can add an extra dimension to your portfolio of images from the tour. The Waorani are usually happy for drones to be flown in their area if asked. Pilots must adhere to the drone rules of Ecuador that apply at the time of travel.\n\nThis tour is a fascinating way to learn the finer aspects of low light photography, portraiture, wildlife and creative aspects including double exposures, slow shutter and to learn ways of visual storytelling."}, {"url": "https://www.yoair.com/blog/huaorani-tribe-of-ecuador-introduction-to-an-indigenous-tribe/", "page_content": "Today, we\u2019ll be embarking on a journey to find out a little bit about the Waorani or Huaorani tribe of Ecuador, living near the Peruvian border in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Traveling to a place is not successfully complete if you are unaware of the people of the place. Though holidays are escapes for most people where the less human interaction is the better, there are a few adventurous and zealous travelers who are curious about the traditional culture of the spot, which can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nWhile there are architecture, art, and the history of a place to learn from, when we engage with people from a place, we learn about ourselves from an entirely different perspective. Therefore, I\u2019m going to talk about the indigenous tribes who are living among us yet are so very distinctive that we\u2019re bound to be left humbled.\n\nThe traditional lifestyle of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador consists of living in a jungle that is a resource for medicine, shelter, and food. Waodani, Waorani, or Huaorani, also referred to as the Waos, are the Amerindians of Amazonian Ecuador. They are profoundly distinctive from the other ethnic groups in Ecuador. So, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s delve into it!\n\nOrigin of the Huaorani Tribe of Ecuador\n\nThe Huaorani tribe of Ecuador are semi-nomadic horticulturists, hunters, and gatherers situated between the Napo and Curaray rivers, approximately fifty miles south of El Coca. These ancestral lands are around one hundred and twenty miles in width and are intimidated by illegal logging, executions and oil exploration. Previously, the Huaorani tribe had protected their lands and culture from intruders and enemies, but nowadays they have transformed from a hunting and foraging society to existing in forest settlements.\n\nHowever, not all communities of the Huaorani tribe have settled and are connected with the modern world. Like the Onamenane, the Tagaeri, the two groups of the Taromenane and the Huinatare have continued to move and live in more isolated regions. As a consequence of the oil companies and rubber boom transferring their land, the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador are now living in the designated territory that was given to them, a little over six hundred square km in the Western Amazon, instead of occupying the fluid space close to the Tiputini River like in the past.\n\nAccording to researchers, the population of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador is about a few thousand. Though several attempts to contact the tribe ended in death, in the middle of the twentieth century the connection with the outside world began to form peacefully. Still, the isolated groups of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador react violently to any outside attempt at contact. The inconsistent nature of the research as there are various communities in this ethnic group leads us to them more current facts about their culture and history. For example, the Huaorani people are physically muscular and short framed mostly.\n\nHistory of the Huaorani Tribe of Ecuador\n\nThe phrase Waodani refers to \u201cmen\u201d or \u201chuman\u201d in Wao Tiriro. Prior to the middle of the twentieth century, the tribe involved only the people who were speakers of the Huaorani language that is commonly known as Sabela. The recent history dictates that at the end of 1940, the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador had come into contact with the Cowode or the non-Huaorani outsiders.\n\nThe first attempt was the unwelcome exploratory drilling in the traditional lands of the Huaorani people by Shell, the oil company that promptly left the place due to the fierce protectiveness of the tribe. The Huaorani tribe is referred to as another derogatory term, Auca, which was given by the Quichua, meaning, in English, as savage!\n\nFurther contacts by the missionary linguists weren\u2019t successful either, which occurred in the mid-1950s. Due to intertribal disputes and the intrusion of the oil companies, it was feared that the Huaorani people would face extinction. That\u2019s why the missionary people were partially interested in intervening, which resulted in five dead missionaries in 1956 as they were perceived as invaders by the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador.\n\nThe most peaceful contact was established by Rachel Saint, who was the sister of one of the dead missionaries. She religiously learned the culture and language of the Huaorani people and became a contributor to the understanding of the Huaorani language. Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman, helped her with learning the Huaorani language and they were responsible for missionizing the tribe, which was started from the neighboring areas of Dayuma\u2019s house.\n\nTexaco, another oil company, approached the government of Ecuador to get a permit for oil exploration at the end of the 1960s. Dayuma and Rachel Saint played a major role in relocating hundreds of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador from their lifestyle and native lands which they were accustomed to for millennia.\n\nThe opinions differ regarding the relocation. While some of the Huaorani tribe think of it as \u201cethnocide\u201d as their lifestyle changed vastly, others find it a way of saving themselves from the oil companies. And for some, it was never a choice they had to make, they were compelled to move deeper in the forest and exist in a way they never knew how.\n\nThe Social Structure of the Huaorani Community\n\nThough modern culture has made some recent impact on the social structure of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador, generally, the Huaorani people have egalitarian relationships instead of hierarchical ones. They work together to survive as a whole community. The adults don\u2019t consider children inferior to them, so they have become pretty self-sufficient on their own as well. Men and women have slightly different yet equal roles while making any decisions in their families. Though the younger generation is aware of their ages, the past members weren\u2019t found to do so. Therefore, their life expectancy is unknown.\n\nFamily Structure and Marriage in the Huaorani Tribe\n\nQuintessentially, the families in the Huaorani tribe are nuclear. Even though oftentimes men are known to be in polygamous marriages, women have control over the number of children they are going to have by utilizing natural birth control. Normally, marriages happen between ambilateral cross-cousins but recent years have seen marriages between Kichwa and Huaorani. Disagreements tend to lead to violence regarding marriage sometimes.\n\nSeveral people are part of a larger group of a family that cohabits under the same roof. There are groups of ten to thirty-five people including an elderly couple with thor married daughters, unmarried children, their grandchildren all eat and sleep together in longhouses. Huaorani families are intricately close to each other. For example, when a family member becomes ill, then other members also have to follow the same food restrictions and diet for the betterment of the sick person. They also share alliances with other longhouses, especially when they are from a cross-sex sibling.\n\nTraditional Culture of the Huaorani People\n\nThe World-Perception Of Huaorani People\n\nThere is no distinction between the spiritual world and the physical world as the Huaorani tribe believes that there are spirits all over the world. Once, the Waodani also thought that the whole world was a forest. The cultural and physical traditions survive based on the rainforest of Oriente, which is their home and the disconnected outside world is an unsafe space. If I want to put it briefly, I would have to repeat what one Huaorani said, \u201cThe rivers and trees are our life.\u201d (Kane 1995, p. 1999) The Waodani life and their idea of the world are intertwined with the forest and they are very aware of their ecology and geography.\n\nHunting in Huaorani Tribe\n\nHunting symbolizes a vital part of the cultural significance and the diet of the Huaorani people. Often, the Shaman of the community would pray for a day to ensure success before a fishing or hunting party were to ensue, as they have diverse taboos regarding hunting and eating. Conventionally, they hunt only wild peccaries, monkeys, and birds. They have some ethical ramifications even regarding a joyous activity like hunting. For instance, they don\u2019t hunt deer because their eyes look like the eyes of a human. They also don\u2019t hunt predators on their land.\n\nThey believe that they have to kill to live, but they also have to placate the spirits of the dead animal that continue to exist. Otherwise, they will have to face enormous retribution. The Shaman shows respect by poisoning the blow darts, utilizing curare, which will counterbalance the offense of killing animals, as then it\u2019ll be regarded as retrieving rather than hunting.\n\nTo know more about the Huaorani religion and its various aspects, visit this post that has detailed information.\n\nKnowledge of Botany in the Huaorani Community\n\nFor the Waodani, plants and trees have a place of severe interest among them. Their botanical competence ranges from medicine to poisons to hallucinogens. The Huaorani tribe of Ecuador relate to the growth of plants and some are even auspicious to them. The colorful leaves of younger Canopy trees along with their strikingly towering stature as mature trees, are admired by the Huaorani people as they entangle with others, yet they are solitary in nature.\n\nAnother pioneer tree for the Huaorani people is the palm tree, which is used for blowguns, spears as well as fruits. The trees are analogous to the predecessors who used to live there and past settlements. Shamanic ethnomedicine also utilizes the beverage called ayahuasca alongside a newly recognized mushroom known as Dictyonema Huaorani and the substance of the Psilocybe genus.\n\nWeapons Used By the Huaorani People\n\nThe blowgun is the primary weapon of the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador and is three to four meters long. The arrows are dipped in curate poison that paralyzes the animal when hit and stops its breathing. To make a very tight seal, they utilize Kapok fluff and twist the fiber at the end of the arrow or dart. Nowadays, though, several Huaorani people utilize Westernized weapons like rifles.\n\nModernism in the Huaorani Tribe of Ecuador\n\nThe Huaorani people that have made contact with the outside world are profoundly different in their way of dealing with the outsiders or Cowodi. Some of the Huaorani people have embraced tourism and work with the organizations they trust. While some perceive tourism as a little change in the spectrum of time, others view it as one of the threats, like the invasion of oil companies.\n\nSo much so that they have found a unified voice called ONHAE or Organization of the Huaorani Nation of the Ecuadorian Amazon. It was established in 1990 and represents the Huaorani community with respect to their education and land rights. Though the education system is basic and the discovery of the tribe has just been made, some are educated to the university level.\n\nHow to Reach the Huaorani Tribe\n\nTo reach Bohanamo in the territory of the tribe, you will have to be at Shella airport to board a flight to Bohanamo. The flight takes around one hour to reach your destination. You will be welcomed by the tribe and thus will begin your journey to the Huaorani, where you will learn their way of living and can participate in many other activities.\n\nActivities to take part in the Huaorani Territory\n\nThe local Huaorani people and the tourism agencies take care of the three \u201cjungle-lodges\u201d in the area. The tourists who want luxury and a way to know the people of Ecuador along with good service choose these lodges. For you, there are several attractions which include various cultural activities, kayaking, fishing and bird watching, etc.\n\nA large number of tourists who are looking for adventure in the Huaorani find these establishments fascinating. The concept of lodges began some time ago when other Amazonians were interested in the same. Huaorani started to explore the probability.\n\nDuring my research, I came across this extensive article that will fulfill much of the curiosity you feel towards this tribe.\n\nMy journey to enlighten you about the Huaorani tribe of Ecuador ends here! These are indigenous tribal people who demand our respect and companionship. I hope you understand the severity of this extinguished traditional culture of the Huaorani tribe, which will push you to take a trip to get to know them in person and spread awareness along the way. Until then, travel well, be well!\n\nReference\n\nKane, Joe (1995), Savages, Alfred A.

Saint is a little out of date (1998), but suggests unfinished business. Saint says that there were many conversions among the older generation, who appreciated the arrival of a force that ended the constant rounds of killing, and appreciated things such as medical help. However only a handful of the younger generation is interested in Christianity. Saint says that the arrival of Christianity has led to a culture of dependence, with most churches relying on outside leadership, although this may be changing slowly.\n\nThe view of anthropologist James Boster on the impact of Christian missionaries is at variance with that of Saint, because he suggests that \"the 'pacification' of the Huaorani was a result of 'active effort' by the Huaorani themselves, not the result of missionary imposition. He argues that Christianity served as a way for the Huaorani to escape the cycle of violence in their community, since it provided a motivation to abstain from killing.\" This view means that the impact of Christianity has been far less positive that the missionaries would like to believe, and may be a better explanation why Christianity has failed to set down deep roots among the young.\n\nIt seems that Christianity is not so much a way of life but, for many, a poorly understood faith system. Saint says that when he was a teenager living among the Huaorani, a friend that he was baptised with led some other young boys in killing a shaman's son. So, several young Christian converts believed that killing the son of a leader of the old religion was good Christian conduct. Some of the older Christians decided that the murderer should be punished, and they prayed for God to carry out this purpose. He died shortly after.\n\nLaura M. Rival (The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers (published 1999), page 103) says that most Huaorani today say they are evangelical Christians, but that \"the way in which Huaoroni people talk about God, select stories from the Bible or preach shows that they have certainly embraced Christianity on their own terms.\""}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hunter-gatherer-culture/", "page_content": "Hunter-gatherer culture is a type of subsistence lifestyle that relies on hunting and fishing animals and foraging for wild vegetation and other nutrients like honey, for food. Until approximately 12,000 years ago, all humans practiced hunting-gathering.\n\nAnthropologists have discovered evidence for the practice of hunter-gatherer culture by modern humans (Homo sapiens) and their distant ancestors dating as far back as two million years. Before the emergence of hunter-gatherer cultures , earlier groups relied on the practice of scavenging animal remains that predators left behind.\n\nBecause hunter-gatherers did not rely on agri culture , they used mobility as a survival strategy. Indeed, the hunter-gatherer lifestyle required access to large areas of land, between seven and 500 square miles, to find the food they needed to survive. This made establishing long-term settlements impractical, and most hunter-gatherers were nomadic. Hunter-gatherer groups tended to range in size from an extended family to a larger band of no more than about 100 people.\n\nWith the beginnings of the Neolithic Revolution about 12,000 years ago, when agricultural practices were first developed, some groups abandoned hunter-gatherer practices to establish permanent settlements that could provide for much larger populations. However, many hunter-gatherer behaviors persisted until modern times. As recently as 1500 C.E., there were still hunter-gatherers in parts of Europe and throughout the Americas. Over the last 500 years, the population of hunter-gatherers has declined dramatically. Today very few exist, with the Hadza people of Tanzania being one of the last groups to live in this tradition."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/waorani", "page_content": "Waorani\n\nETHNONYMS: Auca (pejorative in English and Spanish), Huaorani, Huaugrani, Schiripuno, Ssabela, Tihuakuna, Tipituni, Wagrani, Wao, Waodani, Waog, Waograni, Warani\n\nOrientation\n\nIdentification. \"Waorani\" literally means \"they are true people\" and must not be confused with warani, \"they are other Waorani.\" \"Wao\" is used to distinguish members of the tribe from other peoples or cowode, \"nonhumans, barbarians.\" The noun may be inflected like a verb: waobo, \"I am Wao,\" waomoni, \"we are Wao,\" and so on.\n\nLocation. The traditional homeland of the Waorani encompassed over 20,000 square kilometers of tropical-moist and tropical-wet forest in the eastern foothills of the Ecuadoran Andes. It embraced the first parallel south and was bound on the north by the R\u00edo Napo and on the south by the Manderoyacu and Curaray rivers. From west to east it extended approximately between 76\u00b0 and 77\u00b030\u2032 W. The elevation of the territory ranges from 245 meters to over 600 meters.\n\nDemography. At the time of the first sustained peaceful contact in 1958, approximately 500 Waorani lived scattered over 20,000 square kilometers (.025 persons per square kilometer). By 1988 the population had grown to more than 950 and the land base had been reduced to 2,200 square kilometers (.43 persons per square kilometer). In 1983 the Ecuadoran government deeded to the tribe a \"protectorate\" one-tenth the size of the original Wao lands, and all but 90 of the tribe moved there. Those who remain outside the protectorate live on the lower Cononaco and upper Yasun\u00ed rivers.\n\nLinguistic Affiliation. The Waorani call their language wao tededo. To date no known linguistic congeners have been found, leaving the language an unclassified isolate. Although at least four subdialects can be identified, Waorani from the various areas have no difficulty communicating with those from other areas.\n\nHistory and Cultural Relations\n\nWao oral history says simply that the Waorani originated \"downriver\" and migrated into their present homeland \"long ago.\" The lack of linguistic affiliation, archaeological data, and adequate historical references to them makes any precise statement of origins and movements impossible. Serologically, they have the same blood type and genetic markers as most indigenous groups in Amazonia. Their oral traditions make it clear that they have maintained extremely hostile relationships with all outside groups for many generations. The earliest reference to them, in the late 1600s, indicates that a peaceful contact with Europeans ended in violence seven years later. When European traders began plying the major Ecuadoran rivers in the 1700s, the Waorani developed only sporadic and tenuous trading relationships, often raiding the traders rather than trading peacefully. Rubber gatherers captured Wao slaves in the late nineteenth century, and Europeans and surrounding indigenous groups like the Lowland Quichua and Zaparoans conducted punitive raids on Wao settlements in reaction to the hostilities the Waorani directed toward outsiders.\n\nSince the early 1940s petroleum exploration companies have conducted systematic activities in Wao territory, often punctuated by Wao spearing raids against company workers and retaliations against the Waorani. Until 1958 the Waorani did not enter into continuous relationships with any other peoples. In that year two missionary women succeeded in establishing peaceful contact with one small settlement on the R\u00edo Tewaeno, and in the ensuing two decades all the Waorani except for a roving band of a dozen were contacted. The hostilities waned, and the Waorani began to establish trading and marriage relationships with other peoples, the Lowland Quichua from Arajuno and Tena in particular. As a result of the end of hostilities, the traditional lands were entered by oil and timber companies and taken over by Ecuadoran colonists in the early 1980s. Yasun\u00ed National Park was established in the eastern end of the territory, and Waorani are permitted to remain there if they live a \"traditional\" lifestyle. Others must live in the small protectorate.\n\nSettlements\n\nWaorani traditionally settled on hilltops above small feeder streams in the hinterland, consciously avoiding the flood-plains of the major rivers where Zaparoans lived and traders traveled. A settlement typically included one or two thatched longhouses occupied by an older married man, his wives, their unmarried sons, and their married daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren. At times a brother of the senior male would live in the house, along with his wives and children. When the household became too large, usually over thirty people, one brother would build his house nearby, typically within an hour's walk. These neighborhood clusters of closely related kin provided mutual assistance and defense. Two or three days' walk from one neighborhood cluster were other neighborhood clusters of Waorani who were more distantly related and hostile. In 1958 there were four major groups of Waorani, each hostile to the other, living in small neighborhood clusters dispersed over 20,000 square kilometers. With the disappearance of the Zaparoans from the floodplains, the cessation of hostilities with the outside world (around 1900) and of internal revenge killings, and the influence of new ideas from surrounding cultures, Waorani began settling along the floodplains in the late 1970s and switched from extended-family longhouses to nuclear-family dwellings, although the smaller dwellings still tend to be built in tight clusters of extended families.\n\nEconomy\n\nSubsistence and Commercial Activities. Tropical-forest horticulturists, the Waorani spend much of their energy clearing the forest and growing manioc, plantains, peach palms, maize, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and a number of minor cultigens. Once a garden matures, the women harvest the products on a daily basis, according to need. As they harvest, they take stalks and racemes from the freshly harvested plants and replant them in a nearby garden site that the men have just cleared, ensuring that as a garden is consumed, a new one is simultaneously prepared. Typically, a garden will be consumed in a few months, and the family then moves off to another settlement up to a day away where they have previously planted another garden that is now mature. They harvest and replant at that site and then move on to a third location. By the time they have harvested and planted at the third site, the first garden site is mature for consumption. This keeps the families moving every few months in a cycle of semipermanent sedentarism, which reduces their impact on a given area and facilitates defense from enemies. It also provides alternate sites where refuge can be taken following spearing raids. This slashand-mulch horticulture provides most of the carbohydrates; most of the protein is supplied through hunting and fishing. Monkeys and numerous species of birds are hunted or blowguns with poison darts, peccaries with spears. In addition to horticulture and hunting, the Waorani also continuously collect wild foods from the forest as they travel through it. Prior to intensive contact with Europeans, the Waorani were extremely healthy and well nourished.\n\nIndustrial Arts. Traditionally, the Waorani made whatever they needed from forest products. Pottery, wooden weapons and tools, baskets, hammocks, string bags, and nets were crafted for daily use. They did not manufacture their own stone tools, relying instead upon those they could find in the forest, left behind by past cultures. Canoes were not made until the 1950s.\n\nTrade. Because there is almost no specialization in Wao culture, when people need something, they make it themselves. Some internal trading does occur, but until the spread of European influence, this was simply generalized reciprocity. Goods and services were not evaluated, and no form of currency existed. The important feature was the act of the exchange itself, which cemented social relationships. Until 1958 Waorani maintained no trading relationships with other peoples. Since then, however, they have entered into the market system of the external world, working for money as oil-company employees and purchasing many manufactured goods and some processed foods. Sale of artisanry for the tourist market has become important. Generalized reciprocity has begun to give way to the profit motive.\n\nDivision of Labor. Men are responsible for chopping the huge forest trees to clear garden sites, for providing meat, for protecting the family, and for engaging in warfare. Women perform most of the agricultural tasks (planting, weeding, and harvesting), prepare meals, and care for the children. Neither sex's role is given higher status than that of the other, they are considered equally valuable. Children begin limited participation in adult activities as soon as they are physically capable, and at marriage they are expected to carry out full adult responsibilities.\n\nLand Tenure. The concept of land ownership by individuals or groups was unknown until the late twentieth century. Every individual had right of usufruct to any land that was not already under cultivation. When the protectorate was created in 1983, the tribe, as an entity, was given the land. Individuals may not own or sell any part of it, but all may use it. Once a garden is consumed it is abandoned and becomes available for anyone, although in most cases the land is allowed to fallow for at least eight years\u2014until the softwoods mature\u2014before it is cultivated again.\n\nKinship\n\nA very loosely defined, Ego-based kindred exists, but its significance and role have been weak. The kindred is an opportunistic system manipulated by Ego. Fluidity characterizes the individual's choice of which kin relationships he or she may stress at a given point in life. Kinship is traced bilaterally, and the terminological system is Dravidian.\n\nMarriage. Bilateral cross-cousin marriage is prescribed, and marriages are arranged, often secretly. Polygyny was common prior to contact, and in a few cases, polyandry was practiced. Today monogamy has become dominant, and since the 1970s a few intermarriages with Lowland Quichua have occurred. Although divorce was rare, particularly in the face of a scarcity of eligible mates, it was an unceremonious matter; one of the spouses simply left to live elsewhere.\n\nDomestic Unit. The extended household traditionally included several generations and tended toward uxorilocality. Within the household, every nuclear family maintained its own fire and hung its hammocks in one section of the dwelling. Women married to the same man also maintained their own fires and cooked separately. Since contact there has been a drift toward nuclear households.\n\nInheritance. Because Wao possessions were traditionally few and land was never owned, inheritance rules were never strictly defined.\n\nSocialization. Children remain physically very near their mothers until they are 7 or 8 years old, at which time they begin to make forays into the forest with peers. Infants are carried continuously in a sling at the mother's breast and fed at the first sign of fussing. An older sibling often cares for younger siblings and always defers to them. Intersibling rivalry or conflict is almost unknown. Instruction is informal and usually mild. Parents are extremely permissive, punishing only when the child is in danger or endangers another. Even then, punishment is mild, with stinging netties being brushed lightly over the legs or body; traditionally, a child would never be struck.\n\nSociopolitical Organization\n\nSocial Organization. Within the concept of \"Waorani\" are several subclassifications. Warani, \"others,\" are Waorani for whom no common ancestors can be traced, although common descent is thought possible. \"Gerinani\" are Waorani for whom there is a kin term and with whom marriages may not take place. \"Arorani\" are Waorani among whom marriages are arranged. The Waorani tend to be highly egalitarian; like men and women, the various age groups have nearly equal status. This egalitarianism is not extended to Warani.\n\nPolitical Organization. Waorani are fiercely independent and individualistic. Communities are acephalous, and leadership is situationally defined. Until the Waorani needed to interact with the Ecuadoran government, no community-level organization existed. Now some individuals, women in particular, are acting as representatives of their communities. This aspect of the culture is in the process of dramatic change.\n\nSocial Control. Traditionally, peer pressure has been almost the only mechanism of social control. The threat of death by spearing might ultimately act as a deterrent, but that measure is so extreme as to have limited utility as a daily mechanism for minor problems. Today the threat of calling in the Ecuadoran military to apprehend offenders has replaced the threat of revenge spearing.\n\nConflict. A long history of revenge spearing raids has given the Waorani the highest documented rate of death by violence of any population on earth. At the time of contact four groups of Waorani were dispersed over their territory, each hostile to the other. The vendetta that motivated them permeated all aspects of Wao life and culture. Paradoxically, life on a daily level within the settlement was peaceful, almost to the point of being idyllic. Violence within the family and household was almost unheard of; even arguments were rare.\n\nReligion and Expressive Culture\n\nReligious Beliefs. Traditional Wao beliefs are like most of Wao culture\u2014flexible, diffuse, and pragmatic. They explain some of the intangibles of life but with no great concern for consistency or harmony. Waengongi was the original creator of everything; he was not revered or feared until he became identified with the Christian God. Two types of terrestrial spirits exist: those manipulated by practitioners and animal embodiments of deceased Waorani. There was little expression of concern with religious matters on a daily basis, and religious beliefs had no connection with moral behavior until the introduction of Christianity in the 1960s.\n\nReligious Practitioners. The menye waempo, \"jaguar father,\" and his wife menye baada, \"jaguar mother,\" can, under the influence of ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi ), send their \"children\" spirit jaguars to discover the location of herds of peccaries, report on the welfare of relatives living in other parts of the forest, predict impending spearing raids, and identify culprits responsible for disease or death. The spirit \"fathers\" and \"mothers\" of other animals (e.g., pumas, snakes, anacondas) can likewise send their \"children\" on missions. The ido, on the other hand, drinks ayahuasca to communicate with Wenae (Evil), a spirit that can be sent on missions of destruction and death. To the extent that any spirit \"mother\" or \"father\" is believable, he or she could receive some food gifts. Even to be accused of being an ido, however, means almost certain death to the accused.\n\nCeremonies. Except for the anahuasca ceremonies conducted in secret by practitioners, Wao life is devoid of any religious ceremonies. Community ceremonies were nonexistent until the introduction of Christianity.\n\nArts. Chanting and dancing were central foci of entertainment and socializing in precontact days. Nightly, the longhouse was filled with songs and yodels into the early morning hours as men sang to induce visions of successful hunting, women sang of the tasks of the day, or both sang of forest fruits and animals. During the palm season people traveled to distant parts of the forest several times a week to dance and celebrate. At this time, they all decorated themselves with bright featherwork and painted their bodies with dyes. Since contact, however, much of this has diminished or disappeared.\n\nMedicine. Illness is caused either by a known agent (e.g., a fungus caused by walking in mud too long) or by the ido's spirit, or is ononki (\"just happens\"). If it is ido illness, the only one who can treat it is the one who caused it. If it is caused by one of the other two ways, anyone with herbal knowledge can treat it. The principle of association underlies all Wao assumptions and thinking: people become what they associate with. Thus, treatments are selected for their properties. A long vine is used to treat snakebite, aromatic plants will drive nausea away, and plants that fold up upon being touched will cause fever to fold and wilt away. Most Wao taboos can be explained by this principle of association. With the introduction of viral diseases carried by Europeans, much of the indigenous ethnopharmacology has proven ineffective and is being abandoned.\n\nDeath and Afterlife. At death the spirit that resides in the brain ascends to the heavens, the spirit that resides in the heart becomes a jaguar, and the body either rots or transforms into a bagai, a spirit animal that haunts the forest. The afterlife is patterned after life on this earth. Burial is accompanied by very little ritual.\n\nBibliography\n\nPeeke, Catherine (1973). Preliminary Grammar of Auca.

Although hunting and gathering societies largely died out with the onset of the Neolithic Revolution, hunter-gatherer communities still endure in a few parts of the world.\n\nHunter-gatherers were prehistoric nomadic groups that harnessed the use of fire, developed intricate knowledge of plant life and refined technology for hunting and domestic purposes as they spread from Africa to Asia, Europe and beyond.\n\nWho Were the Hunter-Gatherers?\n\nHunter-gatherer culture developed among the early hominins of Africa, with evidence of their activities dating as far back as 2 million years ago. Among their distinguishing characteristics, the hunter-gatherers actively killed animals for food instead of scavenging meat left behind by other predators and devised ways of setting aside vegetation for consumption at a later date.\n\nThe culture accelerated with the appearance of Homo erectus (1.9 million years ago), whose larger brain and shorter digestive system reflected the increased consumption of meat. Additionally, these were the first hominins built for long-distance walking, pushing nomadic tribes into Asia and Europe.\n\nHunting and gathering remained a way of life for Homo heidelbergensis (700,000 to 200,000 years ago), the first humans to adapt to colder climates and routinely hunt large animals, through the Neanderthals (400,000 to 40,000 years ago), who developed more sophisticated technology.\n\nIt also spanned most of the existence of Homo sapiens, dating from the first anatomically modern humans 200,000 years ago, to the transition to permanent agricultural communities around 10,000 B.C.\n\nHunter-Gatherer Tools and Technology\n\nThe early hunter-gatherers used simple tools. During the Stone Age, sharpened stones were used for cutting before hand-axes were developed, marking the onset of Acheulean technology about 1.6 million years ago.\n\nControlled use of fire for cooking and warding off predators marked a crucial turning point in the early history of these groups, though debate remains as to when this was accomplished. Use of hearths dates back almost 800,000 years ago, and other findings point to controlled heating as far back as 1 million years ago.\n\nEvidence of fire exists at early Homo erectus sites, including 1.5 million-year-old Koobi Fora in Kenya, though these may be the remains of wildfires. Fire enabled hunter-gatherers to stay warm in colder temperatures, cook their food (preventing some diseases caused by consumption of raw foods like meat) and scare wild animals that might otherwise take their food or attack their camps.\n\nAfter Homo heidelbergensis, who developed wooden and then stone-tipped spears for hunting, Neanderthals introduced refined stone technology and the first bone tools. Early Homo sapiens continued to develop more specialized hunting techniques by inventing fishhooks, the bow and arrow, harpoons and more domestic tools like bone and ivory needles. These more specialized tools enabled them to widen their diet and create more effective clothing and shelter as they moved about in search of food.\n\nRead more: 6 Major Breakthroughs in Hunter-Gatherer Tools\n\nThe early Stone Age saw the development of the first stone tools by Homo habilis, one of the earliest members of the human family. These were basically stone cores with flakes removed from them to create a sharpened edge that could be used for cutting, chopping or scraping. The next leap forward in tool technology occurred when early humans began striking flakes off longer rock cores to shape them into thinner, less rounded implements, including a new kind of tool called a handaxe. Both Neanderthals and the first modern humans developed a type of toolmaking that involved detaching long rectangular flakes from a stone core to form blades, which proved more effective at cutting. The Magdalenian culture advanced stone tool development by generating small tools known as geometric microliths, or stone blades or flakes that have been shaped into triangles, crescents and other geometric forms. When attached to handles made of bone or antler (shown here), these could easily be used as projectile weapons, as well as for woodworking and food preparation purposes. Starting around 10,000 B.C., during the Neolithic Period, humans made the transition from small, nomadic groups of hunter-gatherers to larger agricultural settlements. In terms of tools, this period saw the emergence of stone tools that were produced not by flaking but by grinding and polishing stones. 1 / 5 : Didier Descouens/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nHunter-Gatherer Diet\n\nFrom their earliest days, the hunter-gatherer diet included various grasses, tubers, fruits, seeds and nuts. Lacking the means to kill larger animals, they procured meat from smaller game or through scavenging.\n\nAs their brains evolved, hominids developed more intricate knowledge of edible plant life and growth cycles. Examination of the Gesher Benot Ya\u2018aqov site in Israel, which housed a thriving community almost 800,000 years ago, revealed the remains of 55 different food plants, along with evidence of fish consumption.\n\nWith the introduction of spears at least 500,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers became capable of tracking larger prey to feed their groups. Modern humans were cooking shellfish by 160,000 years ago, and by 90,000 years ago they were developing the specialized fishing tools that enabled them to haul in larger aquatic life.\n\nHunting and Gathering Society\n\nStudies of modern-day hunter-gatherers offer a glimpse into the lifestyle of small, nomadic tribes dating back almost 2 million years ago.\n\nWith limited resources, these groups were egalitarian by nature, scraping up enough food to survive and fashioning basic shelter for all. Division of labor by gender became more pronounced with the advancement of hunting techniques, particularly for larger game.\n\nAlong with cooking, controlled use of fire fostered societal growth through communal time around the hearth. Physiological evolution also led to changes, with the bigger brains of more recent ancestors leading to longer periods of childhood and adolescence.\n\nBy the time of the Neanderthals, hunter-gatherers were displaying such \u201chuman\u201d characteristics as burying their dead and creating ornamental objects. Homo sapiens continued fostering more complex societies. By 130,000 years ago, they were interacting with other groups based nearly 200 miles away.\n\nWhere Did The Hunter-Gatherers Live?\n\nEarly hunter-gatherers moved as nature dictated, adjusting to proliferation of vegetation, the presence of predators or deadly storms. Basic, impermanent shelters were established in caves and other areas with protective rock formations, as well as in open-air settlements where possible.\n\nHand-built shelters likely date back to the time of Homo erectus, though one of the earliest known constructed settlements, from 400,000 years ago in Terra Amata, France, is attributed to Homo heidelbergensis.\n\nBy 50,000 years ago, huts made from wood, rock and bone were becoming more common, fueling a shift to semi-permanent residencies in areas with abundant resources. The remains of man\u2019s first known year-round shelters, discovered at the Ohalo II site in Israel, date back at least 23,000 years.\n\nNeolithic Revolution to Modern Day\n\nWith favorable conditions supporting permanent communities in areas such as the Middle East\u2019s Fertile Crescent and the domestication of animals and plants, the agriculture-based Neolithic Revolution began approximately 12,000 years ago.\n\nThe full-time transition from hunting and gathering wasn\u2019t immediate, as humans needed time to develop proper agricultural methods and the means for combating diseases encountered through close proximity to livestock. Success in that area fueled the growth of early civilizations in Mesopotamia, China and India and by 1500 A.D., most populations were relying on domesticated food sources.\n\nModern-day hunter-gatherers endure in various pockets around the globe. Among the more famous groups are the San, a.k.a. the Bushmen, of southern Africa and the Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, known to fiercely resist all contact with the outside world.\n\nSources\n\nThe First Hunter-gatherers.
