Casting feature film based on 1983 cricket World Cup. Players to represent West Indies, England, Australia and Zimbabwe teams.\u201d Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t hide away my whites just yet, I think.\n\nI send the talent agency a headshot and a brief summary of my playing ability, and a week later I\u2019m asked to Lord\u2019s to audition for the part of Chris Tavar\u00e9. To prepare I\u2019m asked to \u201chave a look at some online footage of how he bowls, bats, catches, celebrates, etc, so you have an idea of his personality traits and style\u201d.\n\nSkilled Cricket Players needed.\n\nCasting Feature Film based on 1983 Cricket World Cup.\n\nPlayers to represent West Indies, England, Australia & Zimbabwe teams.\n\nEmail headshot, experience, contact number, location & height to casting@sportspromotions.co.uk#castingcall #cricketers pic.twitter.com/DrszWAqWLo \u2014 Sports Promotions UK (@SPromotionsUK) October 16, 2018\n\nI was three years old when the 1983 World Cup took place and I remember Tavar\u00e9\u2019s contemporaries Mike Gatting, David Gower and Allan Lamb better than him. But we have a similar height and build. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cstyle of play was characterised by long periods at the crease and a relatively slow rate of run-scoring\u201d, Wikipedia says, and I can do that. Mostly I grind it out when I play for Pacific CC in the North East London League.\n\nAmong Tavar\u00e9\u2019s most tedious innings was a score of 35 runs in six and a half hours at Madras. \u201cAs [Ian] Botham brought the crowd to its feet, Tavar\u00e9 did his utmost to make them sit down again,\u201d wrote Marcus Berkmann in Rain Men. \u201cHere was dullness personified, a walking, twitching anaesthetic.\u201d\n\nIn one of the first YouTube videos to appear when I type Chris Tavar\u00e9 the Kent captain is interviewed alongside his opposite number, Botham, at Lord\u2019s after Somerset have just won the 1983 NatWest final, which followed the World Cup. He says getting \u201cTav\u201d out for 39 off 80 balls was a big moment as it opened up an end for Somerset to bowl at. Tavar\u00e9 is gracious in defeat.\n\nA poster for the film 83.\n\nThe Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including that of his friend Tavar\u00e9. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. Botham and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d\n\nTavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d\n\nToby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019 Photograph: portraitcollective.com/Sam Bowle\n\nAnother YouTube video shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32.\n\nWhen I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981.\n\nWhen I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing.\n\nNext it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square.\n\nChris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup. Photograph: Jim Hutchison/Daily Mail/Shutterstock\n\nThe second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them.\n\n\u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali.\n\nIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it Cyrus Patel\n\n\u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League.\n\nWhen I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started.\n\nRanveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie.\n\n\u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d\n\nHe spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d\n\nIt was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could.\n\nKapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final. Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d.\n\nGoing into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says.\n\nIn the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory.\n\nKapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 the first spectacularly so.\n\nRanveer Singh as Kapil Dev lifting the World Cup trophy.\n\n\u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.\u201d\n\nThe film, to be called simply 83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show."}, {"url": "https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2425666/featured", "page_content": "On 25 June 1983, India, for the very first time, lifted the World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev at Lord's. Here's a peek into history, of cricket's greatest underdog story.\n\nTo say that nobody gave India a chance to even be at Lord's on the day of the final, never mind actually lifting the trophy on the famous balcony, would be a serious understatement.\n\nIn fact, some of the Indian players had looked at the World Cup in England as an opportunity for sightseeing. \"India were nowhere in contention,\" wrote Sandeep Patil, part of that triumphant side, in 2015. \"The team had hardly performed well in the previous two editions. So as we left India, virtually all of us were in a holiday mood. Cricket was not the first thing on our minds.\n\n\"More than thinking about facing Malcolm Marshall, Bob Willis and Jeff Thomson, we were engrossed in planning our sightseeing activities. After getting to London, we were excited to see Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square.\"\n\nTheir record coming into the third edition of the Cricket World Cup was far from envious \u2013 India had won just one match, against East Africa, out of six in the first two editions.\n\nTheir record that year before the commencement of the World Cup wasn't great either, with a solitary win in four games against Pakistan and West Indies.\n\nKapil Dev and the story of the 1983 World Cup\n\nDespite the numbers being against them, India made a brilliant start to the tournament with a win over favourites West Indies in their first game. Yashpal Sharma's 89 helped India to 262 in 60 overs. In response, West Indies were bundled out for 228, with Ravi Shastri and Roger Binny picking three wickets each.\n\nThat was not the only upset on the day; at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, Zimbabwe, playing their first-ever World Cup match, defeated Australia, thus giving India a little more hope of going past the group stage.\n\nIndia made it two wins out of two by defeating Zimbabwe in their next game. Led by Madan Lal's 3/27 and Syed Kirmani's brilliant work with the gloves where he took five catches, India restricted Zimbabwe to 155 before a 79-run partnership between Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil guided them to victory.\n\nFor a team that was not expected to make it to the semi-finals, India suddenly found themselves at the top of their group. That, perhaps, brought in some complacency and it showed in the two subsequent matches where they were humbled by Australia and West Indies.\n\nAustralia posted a daunting target of 321 for India to chase down, thanks to a sensational century from Trevor Chappell, who was well supported by half-centurions Kim Hughes and Graham Yallop. India crumbled under the pressure of the total as they were skittled out for just 158.\n\nIndia then ran into a West Indies side that had started to build up steam after their loss in their tournament opener.\n\nPlaying their second round-robin match against India, West Indies posted 282/9 on the back of Viv Richards' 119. India never recovered from the early strikes and only managed to get to 216, with only four players getting to double figures. Mohinder Amarnath fought a lone battle with an innings of 80 but found little support at the other end.\n\nWatch South Africa v India on ICC.tv Get access to every game in the series as South Africa host India SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nA team that was at the top of the table on 11 June were now staring at a World Cup exit four days later.\n\nIndia faced Zimbabwe in a virtual knock-out in Tunbridge Wells, in a match that went down in cricketing folklore (and trivia) for several reasons.\n\nAfter opting to bat first, India were reduced to 9/4 when captain Kapil Dev walked into bat, with their hopes of making it to the World Cup semi-finals as bleak as they could be.\n\nWhat followed was what is still regarded as one of the greatest ODI knocks in history. With the team staring a third consecutive defeat, Kapil Dev bailed India out with a stunning 175* that came off just 138 balls, a knock studded with 16 fours and six sixes.\n\nIt was then the highest individual score in ODI cricket and with Syed Kirmani, Kapil stiched the then highest partnership for the ninth wicket in ODIs with a stand of 126. Teetering at 17/5 at one stage, India posted 266/8 at the end of the innings.\n\nCWC Greatest Moments: Kapil Dev's 175* rescues India from 17/5 v Zimbabwe in 1983\n\nThe biggest travesty was that only the people in attendance at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells got an opportunity to witness history before their eyes as the match was not televised at the time.\n\nKevin Curran's 73 did threaten to take the game away from India but Kapil's men managed to hold their nerve, living to fight another day with a 31-run win.\n\nHis innings rubbed off on the rest of his teammates and breathed a new lease of life into India's campaign. The effects were evident in their next game against Australia, which again was a virtual knockout.\n\nThere were no standout players with the bat, but all the batters chipped in with valuable contributions en-route India's 247. The pace trio Madan Lal, Roger Binny and Balwinder Sandhu were too hot to handle for Australia, who were all out for 129. India, against all odds, booked a berth in the semi-finals against England.\n\nThe home side, having cruised to the semi-finals having lost just one of their six matches, were difficult opponents. England were cruising along after opting to bat before Amarnath was called upon by his skipper to put the brakes on. He stifled the batters with his medium pace and even got the invaluable scalps of David Gower, the highest run-scorer in the 1983 World Cup, and Mike Gatting.\n\nHis spell derailed all the momentum and England, who were 141/3 at one point, were bowled out for 213. The Indian openers Sunil Gavaskar and Kris Srikkanth then provided the team with a solid foundation, putting on 46 for the opening wicket.\n\nAmarnath, having already worked his magic with the ball, made a difference with a bat as well with an innings of 46. Half-centuries from Yashpal Sharma and Sandeep Patil got India across the line with more than five overs to spare as India booked a date with West Indies for the third time in the tournament \u2013 this time in the finals.\n\nWest Indies were the odds-on favourite to win the trophy for the third time in a row. What stood in their way was an Indian team that was scripting history with every step they took in the tournament.\n\nOn a green track, having been put to bat first against the bowling line-up comprising Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Michael Holding and Malcolm Marshall, there weren't many ways India's innings could have gone. They were bundled out for a meagre 183, with Srikkanth top-scoring with 38.\n\nKapil, however, refused to give up. During the innings break, he said: \"Team, if this is not a winning total, then it\u2019s definitely a fighting total.\u201d\n\nIndia wins the ICC Cricket World 1983, beating favorites, West Indies ICC CWC 1983; India (183) v West Indies (140). India won by 43 runs\n\nIndia needed early wickets to stay in the game and Sandhu answered his captain's call, dismissing Gordon Greenidge for 1. The wicket brought the dangerous Viv Richards to the crease, and it didn't take him too long to stamp his authority on the game.\n\nIndia looked all at sea as Richards took the game away from them as he smashed seven boundaries, including three in an over off Madan Lal. India's faint World Cup hopes started to dwindle.\n\nDespite being taken to the cleaners by Richard, Madan Lal snatched the ball from his skipper for one more over, as Kapil later narrated. \"The best part about that dismissal was Madan Lal's urge to bowl that particular over,\" Kapil later recounted. \"Madan Lal literally snatched the ball from my hands and went on to bowl that over. When someone has so much confidence, you give in.\"\n\nIt took a moment of sheer individual brilliance on the field to dismiss Richards, and the way he was batting, it definitely needed something spectacular from India to see his back.\n\nRichards mistimed a pull shot and Kapil, who was at mid-wicket, ran backwards to take a stunning catch at deep square to dismiss the West Indies talisman.\n\nCWC Greatest Moments: Kapil Dev's running catch in the 1983 final\n\nLady Luck soon shone for India as skipper Clive Lloyd injured his hamstring off the very first ball of his innings. His struggle too came to an end as he was dismissed in tame fashion for 8.\n\nWest Indies found themselves in unfamiliar territory at 66/5 and the one person who had shown how to bounce back from such a situation was captaining the opposition side.\n\nJeff Dujon's 43-run stand with Marshall only delayed the inevitable as Amarnath cleaned up the tail \u2013 India beat the mighty West Indies by 43 runs to script history at Lord's.\n\nAmarnath, who was the Player of the Match in the semi-final, was awarded the Player of the Match in the finals, and still remains the only player to achieve that feat apart from Sri Lanka's Aravinda De Silva in 1996.\n\nThe trophy was much more than just silverware for India. The visuals of Kapil Dev hoisting the World Cup trophy in the Lord's balcony inspired the next generation of cricketers, like Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, and dared them to dream.\n\nAfter the final, West Indies captain Clive Lloyd said, \"Indian cricket has arrived. And it's here to stay.\"\n\nThose words have proven to be prophetic."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/world-cup-1983-roger-binny-s-5-best-spells-tournament", "page_content": "Roger Binny was one of India's unsung heroes at the 1983 World Cup.(Courtesy:News18)\n\nRoger Michael Humphrey Binny, usually known only as Roger Binny, is a former all-rounder who played for India in both Tests and limited-overs cricket.

The eventual winners suffered consecutive losses and had to find their form rather quickly once more.\n\nIn a disappointing outing against the West Indies in their fourth game, India were handed a comprehensive 66-run loss. Roger Binny's spell of 12.0-0-71-3, including the wickets of Faoud Bacchus and Jeff Dujon, was the only shining light for a complacent Indian side.\n\nWhile India were thumped by two dominant sides, Binny reckoned the two losses were a good thing for the side.

While India were tottering a 17-5 at one stage, the captain's 175* off 138 stole the show as Kapil Dev dug his side out of a hole.\n\nRoger Binny played a crucial role that day with his supportive knock of 22 runs to stop the procession of wickets.

The odds were stacked against India once more when they came up against the hosts in the semi-finals.\n\nBatting first, England were cruising as Graeme Fowler and Chris Tavare stitched together a 69-run partnership in the first sixteen overs. The hosts were threatening to post a big total on the board at that stage, before Roger Binny worked his magic once more.\n\nThe flamboyant fast-bowling all-rounder dismissed Tavare first with a peach of a delivery that got the outside edge and was pouched by Syed Kirmani. Binny followed that up with another beauty that nipped back into Fowler, going through his bat and pad to rattle the middle peg.\n\nThe two wickets gave India the opening they required at the top and allowed them to dictate the tempo from them on, dismissing England for a measly 213. India chased down the target in a canter to book their spot in the final.\n\n1) Roger Binny's Man of the Match performance against Australia\n\nIn a virtual knockout game against Australia, India had to defend a target of 248 after a disappointing outing with the bat. India bagged the early wicket of Trevor Chappell, but Graeme Wood and Graham Yallop steadied the ship to steer Australia to 46.\n\nOnce again, Kapil Dev turned to Roger Binny to try and make things happen for his side. The Karnataka all-rounder delivered with a sharp burst to dismiss the two set batters and drag India back into the contest.\n\nHe also bagged the wicket of Australia captain David Hookes, before making Tom Hogan his final victim in a match-winning 4-29 from his 8 overs.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.lords.org/lords/news-stories/lord-s-legends-xi", "page_content": "Keith Miller\n\nThe \u201cGolden Nugget\u201d as he was known could easily claim a place in the all-rounder bracket; 170 wickets at 22.97 in 55 Tests for Australia combined with 2,958 runs at 36.97 give a clear indication of Miller\u2019s capacity with bat and ball.\n\nHe formed a lethal new-ball combination with Ray Lindwall which terrorized England\u2019s batsmen in the years following the Second World War, a war in which he had served courageously as a Mosquito pilot. He brought a slice of RAF verve and glamour into the dreary post-war years and played cricket as he lived, with flair, athleticism and elegance. He had played a little Sheffield Shield cricket before the war, but really arrived on the world stage during the Victory \u201cTests\u201d between England and Australian Services teams in the summer of 1945. Three of the five matches took place at Lord\u2019s: he scored a century in the opening game, took six wickets in the second and scored another century in the third. He ended the summer by smashing 185 in under three hours for the Dominions against England, also at the Home of Cricket.\n\nThe post-war years brought him three Tests at Lord\u2019s: in 1948 he scored 74 in a comfortable Australian victory, in 1953 he scored 109 then in 1956 his bowling came to the fore and he took 5-72 and 5-80 in true fast bowler style \u2013 nine of his wickets either clean bowled or caught behind. 11 wickets and 20.94 and 270 runs at 45.00; few visiting cricketers have been as quite so at home at the Home of Cricket as Keith Miller.\n\nFred Trueman\n\nThe perfect fast-bowler\u2019s combination of aggression and skill characterised Fred Trueman. Genuinely fast in his youth, as his career progressed he learned to rely on movement off the pitch and in the air, becoming the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets in 1964.\n\n\u201cFiery Fred\u201d played 12 of his 67 Test Matches at Lord\u2019s taking 63 wickets at 22.12. He claimed five wickets in an innings five times, including one 10-wicket match haul. That performance came in 1963 during a thrilling drawn game against West Indies: Trueman took 6-100 and 5-52 as the game ended with England just six runs short of victory with the last pair at the crease. His other outstanding performances came against Australia in 1956 (5-90) and 1964 (5-48) and against Pakistan in 1962 (6-31). His five wickets against Australia in 1964 made him the first bowler to claim a \u201cfive-for\u201d on three consecutive Test appearances at Lord\u2019s.\n\nBob Massie\n\nPerhaps cricket\u2019s greatest \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d, Perth-born Bob Massie hadn\u2019t yet played a Test Match for Australia when he was picked for the 1972 tour of England. He made his Test debut at Lord\u2019s on what Richie Benaud described as \u201ca beautiful batting track\u201d, but Massie took advantage of cloudy conditions to swing and seam the ball both ways at a little above medium pace and take 8-84 in the first innings and 8-53 in the second. He became the first \u2013 and so far only - Australian to take 15 wickets in a Test Match and his match figures of 16-137 were a record for a Test debutant until India\u2019s Narendra Hirwani bettered them by one run in 1988. They remain a record for a Test at Lord\u2019s.\n\nMassie played only five more Tests and never took another five-wicket haul. On tour in the West Indies the following spring he struggled with illness and tried to modify his action. His career fell away completely and by 1974 he had lost his place in the Western Australia side. Nevertheless, for \u201cMassie\u2019s Match\u201d he will always be a legend at Lord\u2019s.\n\nSir Richard Hadlee\n\nPerhaps New Zealand\u2019s greatest ever cricketer, Sir Richard Hadlee was one of the great all-rounders in an age of great all-rounders and arguably the greatest bowler of them all, renowned for nagging accuracy on the off-stump at a sometimes genuinely fast pace. No-one who saw it could forget his smooth, rhythmical approach to the wicket or his classically side-on action.\n\nHe never failed to produce something in a Test Match at Lord\u2019s: in 1978 he took 5-84, in 1983 5-93, in 1986 he produced his Lord\u2019s best of 6-80, becoming the first overseas bowler to claim a \u201cfive-for\u201d on three consecutive Test appearances at Lord\u2019s and then in 1990, in his penultimate Test appearance, he took four wickets in the match and hit 86 from 84 balls.\n\nGlenn McGrath\n\nGlenn McGrath followed Sir Richard Hadlee in becoming the second visiting bowler to take a \u201cfive-for\u201d on three consecutive Test appearances at Lord\u2019s. When you consider that he only played three Test Matches at the Home of Cricket, the achievement becomes even more impressive.\n\nHe got off to a flyer in 1997, ripping out England\u2019s first three batsmen to leave them tottering at 13-3 and destroying the momentum the hosts had built up with a shock victory at Edgbaston. England were bowled out for just 77, McGrath claiming 8-38. In 2001 he claimed 5-54 in the first innings and 3-60 in the second and then in 2005 it was 1997 all over again only this time it was the top four he tore through as England struggled to 19-4. They recovered to make 155 with McGrath taking 5-53. 4-29 followed in the second innings to seal England\u2019s fate.\n\n26 Test wickets at Lord\u2019s (more than any other visiting bowler) at an average of 11.50, 8 ODI wickets at 22.62, World Cup triumph in 1999, McGrath destroyed English hopes every time he played at Lord\u2019s. It would be nice to have him in the home dressing room for a change.\n\nJames Anderson\n\nIn 23 Test Matches at Lord\u2019s James Anderson has bowled 5,439 balls and taken 103 wickets at 23.89, making him the leading Test wicket-taker at the Home of Cricket. He is only the second bowler in history, after Muttiah Muralitharan, to take a hundred wickets at a single venue.\n\nOne of those cricketers who just seems to get better and better, some of his most recent Tests at Lord\u2019s have brought his finest performances at the Ground: bags of 5-20 and 4-23 against India in 2018 and a match-winning spell of 7-42 (four clean-bowled, three caught behind) against West Indies in 2017. He made his Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord\u2019s in 2003 and took 5-73. More five-wicket hauls followed: two against India 5-42 in 2007 and 5-65 in 2011, and 5-47 against New Zealand (2013). Few fast bowlers in recent years have shown Anderson\u2019s level of skill with the moving ball.\n\nBrett Lee\n\nA genuinely hostile fast bowler guaranteed to be running in as hard for the last over of the day as the first, Brett Lee may only have played two Tests at the Home of Cricket, taking seven wickets at 27.42, but his ODI record on the ground is especially impressive.\n\nIn seven outings in the shorter format the Australian speedster racked up 18 wickets at 16.22. He took two five-wicket hauls: 5-41 in 2005 and 5-49 in 2009, four of the latter wickets clean bowled. No other bowler has claimed more than one \u201dfive-for\u201d in ODIs at Lord\u2019s. He played a key role in Australia\u2019s 2005 Test win, catching Andrew Strauss off his own bowling to break England\u2019s second innings opening stand of 80, then 10 overs later removing skipper Michael Vaughan to reduce the hosts to 112-4.\n\nStuart Broad\n\nSecond only to Anderson in the list of Test wicket-takers at Lord\u2019s, Stuart Broad\u2019s 23 Test Matches at the Home of Cricket have brought him 94 wickets at 27.06. His first appearance on the Honours Boards came after his fifth Test on the Ground and unexpectedly resulted from his performance with the bat: an innings of 169 and an eighth wicket partnership of 322 with Jonathan Trott the backbone of a convincing England victory over Pakistan in 2010.\n\nHis best performances with the ball came against West Indies in 2012, when he twice ran through the visitors\u2019 middle and lower order to record match figures of 11-165, and against New Zealand in 2013 when in one of his periodic spells of irresistible bowling he demolished the Kiwi top-order before finishing their innings off for just 68. His figures of 7-44 were almost as good as the 7-43 he had claimed in the first innings against West Indies the year before.\n\nChris Woakes\n\nNo one-Test wonder, but Chris Woakes seems to raise his game at Lord\u2019s in an almost Bob Massie-like way.\n\nHis overall Test bowling average is 30.88; at Lord\u2019s it\u2019s 11.33. His Test batting average at Lord\u2019s is 61.20 compared to an overall 26.75. He has taken three five-wicket hauls (including one 10-wicket match haul) at Lord\u2019s but has never managed this on any other Test ground. With the bat, his only Test century has come at Lord\u2019s, 137 not out against India in 2018, together with one of his three fifties. Pakistan were on the wrong end of his bowling expertise in 2016; Woakes claiming match figures of 11-102. Then in 2019 he produced a remarkable return of 6-17 as Ireland were dismissed for just 38 on their first Test appearance at Lord\u2019s.\n\nAlready Woakes has bagged 27 wickets in just five Tests at Lord\u2019s and his 3-37 in the 2019 ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup Final has earned him a place in history.\n\nResults"}, {"url": "https://www.wionews.com/sports/syed-kirmani-recalls-kapil-devs-majestic-175-in-must-win-wc-game-vs-zimbabwe-before-83-hits-screens-439332", "page_content": "Kapil Dev-led Team India created history when they went onto win the country's maiden World Cup during the 1983 edition in England. Back then, not many had given India any chance to proceed further into the tournament after their flop performances in the first two editions, in 1975 and 1979.\n\nWhile Kapil & Co. started their campaign with two wins in a row, they soon fell flat with equal number of defeats as they faced Zimbabwe, for the second time, on June 18, 1983. It was a must-win game for India, who had convincingly lost their last two encounters. Opting to bat first, at Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells, India were off to a nightmarish start as they were reduced to 17-5 in no time.\n\nLosing hopes of survival, Kapil formed handy partnership with Roger Binny before his unbeaten 126-run ninth-wicket stand with wicketkeeper-batsman Syed Kirmani took India to 266/8. Kapil and Kirmani remained unbeaten as the skipper's 175 took India to a competitive score.\n\nRecalling his partnership with Kapil and how the Indian captain led the side's recovery, Kirmani was quoted as saying by the Indian Express, \"I walked up to Kapil, who was standing there, his head down. It was a 60-over game and we still had 35 overs left in our innings. I told Kapil, \u2018listen Kaps, we are in a do-or-die situation. We just cannot sit and die\u2019. \u2018Maar ke marne ka hai (we will go down hitting)\u2019, he said.\n\n\"I tried to inspire him saying, \u2018you are the best hitter in the Indian team. I will take singles and will give you strike. You will try to hit every delivery\u2019. He said, \u2018Kiri bhai, humko aur 35 overs khelna hai (we still have to play 35 overs). I will try my best\u2019.\"\n\nFor the unversed, Kapil's innings comprised 16 fours and 6 gigantic sixes. In reply, Zimbabwe were dismissed for 235 as Kapil, Madan Lal and Binny led the charge with the ball.\n\nFrom thereon, India gained momentum and reached the final, setting up a clash versus the two-time winners Clive Lloyd-led West Indies.\n\nIn the summit clash, Windies bundled out India for 183 after inviting them to bat first. Kirmani recalled Kapil's words during the mid-innings and said, \"Even when India could only score 183 runs in the final against West Indies, Kapil had not lost hope. \u201cEven after we were all out for 183 in the final, we weren\u2019t looking back. We had nothing to lose. Kapil said, \u2018let\u2019s go and give our best\u2019. We had already overachieved. We decided to put our best foot forward.\"\n\nAs a result, India managed to pull off an upset and beat West Indies by 43 runs, dismissing them for 140 courtesy Madan and vice-captain Mohinder Amarnath's three-fers."}, {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1983-world-cup-win-anniversary-lets-fight-it-out-balwinder-sandhu-and-madan-lal-recall-kapil-devs-golden-words/articleshow/92449228.cms", "page_content": "Image credit: Twitter\n\nImage credit: Twitter\n\nMADDI PAA AND THE PLAN vs THE LEGENDARY\n\nImage credit: Twitter\n\nNEW DELHI: 'Let's fight it out, guys', India captain Kapil Dev said loudly while entering the dressing room after India posted 183 runs on the board in the epic 1983 World Cup final against the mighty West Indies. And, the rest as they say is history.Defending 183, the Indian bowlers wrapped up the West Indies innings for 140, claiming a 43-run win and the title for the country.Balwinder Sandhu , who claimed the first wicket in the summit clash against the West Indies in the form of Gordon Greenidge for just 1, spoke to TimesofIndia.com taking us down memory lane.\"Kapil was very confident and positive. The score was really low (183). The West Indies could achieve it. We were all waiting to take the field. Kapil came into the dressing room and there was hope in his eyes. He shouted 'let's fight it out, guys. They will have to make 184 to win. So, let's do it'. We were all pumped up,\" Balwinder told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview on the 39th anniversary of India's unforgettable 1983 ODI World Cup win.\"I can't believe it has been 39 years. That was an epic tournament and so was the final match. No one believed we could win. We were not tagged as favourites but all credit to Kapil and the way he took the team forward. Kapil will always remain our captain. He will always be my captain. We still meet and discuss a lot of things. We all laugh and reminisce. We have a lot of memories and we will cherish those forever,\" the former pacer further told TimesofIndia.com.\"Kapil was an instinctive captain and he led from the front. His hunger for wins never died. We were ready to die for him on the ground. That was the kind of commitment I had for him. Such love and affection I have for him. Even now, I say I can do anything for him,\" Balwinder further said.For Balwinder, Kapil's epic 175 run knock vs Zimbabwe and lifting the trophy in the final are the two most unforgettable moments from the 1983 World Cup.\"Kapil Dev lifting the Cup - It was a magical moment for me. I can still feel that moment. I still get goosebumps when I recall that moment. No one believed in us but we believed in ourselves. My favourite match was the Zimbabwe game and I will never forget that match. It was the toughest game for us. We were down and out. But Kapil Dev ensured we kept our heads held high. He brought us back into the game,\" the 65 year old Sandhu further shared.The match vs Zimbabwe was a crucial clash for India. They found themselves in a precarious position, tottering at 17-5. Kapil Dev's innings of 175* helped India romp home in style. The 175* vs Zimbabwe in fact remained Kapil Dev's highest ODI score throughout his career. Unfortunately there is no footage of that match because the BBC was on strike that day.\"It was a different Kapil that day (vs Zimbabwe). He single-handedly won that match for us. We were 5 down, but it was Kapil who gave us big hope. We couldn't stop clapping and cheering from the dressing room,\" Balwinder recalled.Madan Lal , who claimed three wickets in the final - Desmond Haynes (13), Viv Richards (33) and Larry Gomes (5), also recalled how he and Kapil together planned to dismiss the dangerous Viv Richards in the final.Madan Lal was getting hammered by Richards. Things weren't working out. Kapil decided to bring someone else into the attack.Madan wanted to do the job for his team and he decided to rush to Kapil and asked for one more over. He managed to convince Kapil. And he managed to send the dangerous Richards back to the pavilion for 33. Interestingly, Kapil took Viv's catch while running backwards off Madan Lal's bowling.\"I didn't like the fact that I was being hit. It was the final and I wanted to get rid of him (Viv Richards). Thanks to Kapil for giving me one more over. He believed in me. I didn't want to disappoint him. The monkey was off my back. The pressure was gone,\" Madan Lal told TimesofIndia.com.\"Lifting the World Cup trophy at Lord's, in front of a huge gathering of fans who were clapping and shouting, was surreal. I still get goosebumps when I recall that moment. The cheers still reverberate in my ears. Kapil said one thing after we posted 183 in the final - 'Let's fight it out'. And we are happy that we did that and created history. No one believed in us but we believed in ourselves,\" Madan Lal further told TimesofIndia.com.\"The best thing is that people recognise us. When I go out, people say 'He is Madan Lal, the World Cup winner'.

West Indies were not meant to struggle in a run-chase of just 183 to make it a hat-trick of titles. Madan Lal was not supposed to be bowling another over after being hit for three boundaries by Viv Richards. Captain Kapil Dev was not used to fielding at mid-wicket (or close to square leg) for India.\n\nAnd yet, as destiny would have it, at Lord\u2019s on June 25, 1983, Kapil Dev did indeed field at a position that was unusual for him. Madan Lal did get another over from his captain, against the run of play. Richards did mishit a ball, after looking primed to take West Indies over the finish line with ease.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, from when the ball went up in the air and back down into Kapil\u2019s hands near the boundary line, Indian cricket\u2019s destiny was rewritten. From 66 to 1 underdogs before the tournament, India became world champions and it hinged on this moment of brilliance from one of the greatest athletes produced by the country.\n\nAlso read: What Kapil Dev and Co\u2019s historic 1983 World Cup win means to various generations of Indian fans\n\nRelive India's stunning win over the mighty West Indies in the 1983 men's @cricketworldcup final, including Kapil Dev's spectacular running catch to dismiss Viv Richards \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\n\nWATCH \ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/KWzrDNZ4o3 \u2014 ICC (@ICC) June 25, 2020\n\n\u201cI want to talk about that Kapil Dev catch,\u201d Madan Lal had said at a reunion of the world champions in 2017. \u201cWhen Viv Richards hit the ball in the air, Kapil Dev was running from midwicket in one direction and from the other direction, Yash was going for it too. I started yelling, \u201cYash, rukh, rukh! [wait] You don\u2019t go for the catch.\u201d\n\n\u201cKapil was getting under the ball and I knew Kapil being such a good fielder, he will catch it. But seeing Yashpal also running for it, I prayed that he doesn\u2019t go collide with Kapil. And then you know what happened. That was the best moment of the World Cup. That win was not about one man or the players, it was about the entire nation\u2019s prayers, otherwise there was no way we would have defended 183,\u201d he added.\n\nThe legend actually goes that fans in India who were glued to their television sets actually missed out on the magical, match-turning moment live. That was, perhaps, fitting in the Kapil Dev narrative of the World Cup because his epic 175* was only seen by a select few and has since gained mythical proportions.\n\n\n\nWorld Cup '83 stories. The Viv Richards catch is probably the source of the biggest collective delusion in Indian cricket. Millions of fans remember the exact moment when he took the catch. But not a single person in India would have seen it, as Doordarshan had lost the signal. pic.twitter.com/bTEWUaWYFy \u2014 Joy Bhattacharjya (@joybhattacharj) June 25, 2020\n\nBut, unlike the 175* at Tunbridge Wells against Zimbabwe, the catch to dismiss Richards at Lord\u2019s in the final has been preserved on tape. And replayed over and over, millions of times by Indian fans. So much so that, it would be a safe bet that if you ask someone to narrate the catch, they would do so by adding every possible detail: including Kapil being mobbed by fans stationed at the boundary and trying to evade them before joining his teammates in celebration. Every frame of that sequence is etched in the minds of millions of cricket fans.\n\nWest Indies soon started to collapse. Richards\u2019 wicket reduced the two-time defending champions to 57/3 and when Kapil took another catch (one more significant, according to him) at cover to dismiss Clive Lloyd, India began to sense victory. The score was 66/5 at that point, and after some late hiccups, the West Indies were dismissed for 140. The unthinkable had happened, and it was all triggered by that one moment of brilliance by Kapil.\n\n\u201cSo this is what happened in the lead-up to that Richards catch,\u201d Kapil Dev said.\n\n\u201cThe previous over he bowled, Madan Lal had conceded two-three boundaries. I said to him, \u2018Mandi pa, you take a break, I\u2019ll bring you back after a few overs.\u2019 He said, \u2018Kapil, give me the ball. I have dismissed Viv Richards once before, I will do it again. One more over, please.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe had immense self-belief and I could see he really wanted it. My heart was telling me, no, don\u2019t listen to him. We only have 183 to defend. But I decided to go with his instinct and he got the wicket in that over.

He reached the landmark in 88 matches, the second fastest behind Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan who took his 450th wicket in his 80th Test.\n\nAustralia were poor in their 24 overs with the ball, allowing India to serenely progress to 76-0 before KL Rahul chipped a return catch back to debutant off-spinner Todd Murphy in the penultimate over."}, {"url": "https://starsunfolded.com/kapil-dev/", "page_content": "Full Name Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj\n\nNickname(s) Haryana Hurricane, KD\n\nProfession(s) Cricketer, Businessman\n\nPhysical Stats & More\n\nHeight (approx.) in centimeters- 183 cm\n\nin meters- 1.83 m\n\nin feet inches- 6\u2019\n\nWeight (approx.) in kilograms- 80 kg\n\nin pounds- 176 lbs\n\nEye Colour Dark Brown\n\nHair Colour Salt & Pepper\n\nCricket\n\nInternational Debut ODI- 1 October 1978 against Pakistan at Quetta\n\nTest- 16-21 October 1978 against Pakistan at Faisalabad\n\nInternational Retirement ODI- 17 October 1994 against West Indies at Faridabad\n\nTest- 19-23 March 1994 against New Zealand at Hamilton\n\nJersey Number N/A (during his time, the culture of Jersey Number was not there)\n\nDomestic/State Team(s) \u2022 Haryana\n\n\u2022 Northamptonshire\n\n\u2022 Worcestershire\n\nCoach/Mentor Desh Prem Azad\n\nBatting Style Right-handed\n\nBowling Style Right-arm fast-medium\n\nFavourite Shot Hook & Drive\n\nFavourite Ball Out-swing & In-swing Yorker\n\nRecords (main ones) Test Cricket\n\n\u2022 In 1994, Kapil Dev broke Richard Hadlee's record of the highest Test wicket-taker in the world, which was later broken by Courtney Walsh in 1999\n\n\u2022 Only player to have more than 5000 test runs (5248) and 400 wickets (434).\n\n\u2022 Most innings in a career (184) without being run out\n\n\u2022 Youngest test cricketer to take 100 (21 years, 25 days), 200 (24 years) and 300 wickets (27 years, 2 days)\n\n\u2022 Only test captain to take a 9 wicket haul in a test innings\n\n\n\nODI Cricket\n\n\u2022 Highest wicket-taker till his retriement in 1994 (253 wickets)\n\n\u2022 Highets ever Peak rating (631; on 22 March 1985\n\n\u2022 Highest ODI score when batting at number 6 position or lower; as well in World Cup history(175*)\n\n\u2022 Most number of balls in an ODI innings when batting at number six position in ODI history (138, tied with Neil McCallum)\n\nAwards, Honours, Achievements 1979-80: Arjuna Award\n\n\n\n1982: Padma Shri\n\n1983: Wisden Cricketer of the Year\n\n1991: Padma Bhushan\n\n2002: Wisden Indian Cricketer of the Century\n\n2008: Honoured as Lieutenant Colonel by the Indian Territorial Army\n\n\n\n2010: ICC Cricket Hall of Fame\n\n2013: CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement award\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDate of Birth 6 January 1959\n\nAge (as in 2019) 60 Years\n\nBirthplace Chandigarh, India\n\nZodiac sign/Sun sign Capricorn\n\nSignature\n\nNationality Indian\n\nHometown Chandigarh, India\n\nSchool DAV Senior Secondary School, Sector 8-C, Chandigarh\n\nCollege/University Did Not Attend\n\nEducational Qualification Not Known\n\nReligion Hinduism\n\nCaste Jat\n\nFood Habit Non-vegetarian\n\nPolitical Inclination Not Known\n\nAddress A sprawling house at Sundar Nagar, Delhi\n\nHobbies Playing Golf, Table Tennis, and Squash, Watching Films\n\nControversies \u2022 In 1999, at the height of the match-fixing allegation, former BCCI president I S Bindra alleged that Kapil Dev had offered money to Manoj Prabhakar to under-perform during the 1994 India tour of Sri Lanka.

If he had played at any other time - not when Imran Khan, Ian Botham and Richard Hadlee were contemporaries - he would surely have been recognised as the best allrounder in the world. In any case he did enough to be voted India's Cricketer of the Century during 2002, ahead of Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. His greatest feats were to lead India almost jauntily, and by his all-round example, to the 1983 World Cup, and to take the world-record aggregate of Test wickets from Hadlee. It was the stamina of the marathon runner that took him finally to 431 wickets and only a yard beyond. He might not have been quite the bowling equal of Imran, Hadlee or Botham at his best, and his strike rate was less than four wickets per Test, but he was still outstanding in his accuracy and ability to swing the ball, usually away from right-handers. And he could hit a ball even more brilliantly than he bowled it, with uncomplicated flair.\n\nKapil had a rather ordinary stint as India's coach for 10 months between October 1999 and August 2000. Att the height of the match-fixing allegation by Manoj Prabhakar - a charge that was subsequently dismissed - Kapil resigned as coach. Hurt by the betting controversy, he announced that he was leaving the game. However, he returned from a significantly quiet period when Wisden named him their Indian Cricketer of the Century. He won, and then returned to cricket as a bowling consultant and served as chairman of National Cricket Academy for two years. In May 2007, Kapil joined the breakaway Indian Cricket League, which led to his removal from the NCA.\n\nScyld Berry June 2008"}]}
