{"Stuart Cable was a member of Stereophonics from 1992 until his departure in 2003.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/07/stuart-cable-obituary", "page_content": "The rock drummer turned broadcaster Stuart Cable, who has been found dead aged 40 at his home in Llwydcoed, south Wales, was a larger-than-life character whose powerhouse drumming propelled the Welsh band Stereophonics towards international rock stardom in the 1990s.\n\nCable drummed on hits such as Have a Nice Day, Local Boy in the Photograph and Just Looking and helped the band sell 6m albums and support the Rolling Stones and U2, before he was ousted in 2003 over \"commitment issues\". In Cable's autobiography, Demons and Cocktails (2009), he revealed how alcohol and cocaine had turned him into a \"crazed zombie\". And yet, in the Welsh village where he spent his final years, he was known as the antithesis of a rock star \u2013 a warm-hearted, genial, down-to-earth, fun-loving father who would often be found chatting to locals or helping up-and-coming bands.\n\nThe singer Cerys Matthews remembers his \"generous company\". Manic Street Preachers have referred to his \"gigantic personality, reflected in his drumming\". Darren Broome, who produced Cable's show on Radio Wales, described him as a man who \"lived and breathed rock music\".\n\nCable grew up in the south Wales mining village of Cwmaman. His father died when Stuart was 10 and he and his elder brother Paul were brought up by their mother, Mabel. By the time he was 16, Stuart's musical horizons had been broadened by listening to Paul's AC/DC records, which ignited a desire to play the drums. He lived doors away from the singer Kelly Jones and bassist Richard Jones (no relation), and when the schoolmates realised they could hear each other separately rehearsing AC/DC songs, they decided to form a band.\n\nThe name they chose, Tragic Love Company, gave way to Stereophonics \u2013 after the brand name of the Cable family's gramophone. The reward for labouring their way around working men's clubs was a deal with Richard Branson's V2 label in 1996 at the height of Britpop. Although their classic rock-influenced swaggering bluster was perennially unfashionable, Stereophonics won a huge audience through touring and (along with bands such as Manic Street Preachers) made Welsh pride cool. They received a Brit for best new band in 1998.\n\nHowever, Cable \u2013 a drummer able to lay down a song in two takes \u2013 increasingly felt frustrated with the numbing perfectionism of modern rock recording and soon tired of the band. Shortly after marrying his girlfriend Nicola in 1999 and fathering a son, Cian, he was often heard publicly yearning to return to Cwmaman, his child and his dogs. In fact, the rock'n'roll life had thrown up another complication \u2013 Cable was having an affair with the television presenter Lisa Rogers.\n\nBy 2002, he had also been given his own chat show, Cable TV, by BBC Wales, but he was quarrelling increasingly often with his former best friend Kelly Jones over both lifestyle and musical direction. The band accused him of prioritising his media career instead of the music, and of spending too much time partying, and in 2003 they fired him. Cable was also going through a divorce, and described the period that followed as \"the darkest of my entire life\" and himself as \"the loneliest person in the world\". He plunged even harder into drink and drugs.\n\nIn recent years, Cable seemed to have turned his life around, and the former bandmates had settled their differences. He was working as a presenter for the BBC, he played a variety of rock music on his shows on Kerrang! Radio and XFM, and got to interview many of his rock idols, including Slash, the former Guns N' Roses guitarist. He also fronted campaigns for child transport safety and to raise awareness of testicular cancer.\n\nHaving briefly lost his passion for drumming after leaving Stereophonics, he had recovered the urge to rock, playing with the Stone Gods (ex-members of the Darkness) and forming a band, Killing for Company, which supported the Who in 2007 at Liberty stadium, Swansea. His more recent retreat to Llwydcoed (only a few miles from his native Cwmaman) was an attempt to escape the unhealthy aspects of the rock lifestyle rather than \"end up dead or round the bend\", he said.\n\nHe had been scheduled to play, and to interview AC/DC, at the Download festival at Donington Park, Leicestershire, this weekend. He is survived by his son, brother and mother."}, {"url": "https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/cable-reveals-left-phonics-2270357", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest stories with our WalesOnline newsletter\n\nFormer Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable has finally lifted the lid on his split from the band.\n\nThe Cwmaman rocker was sensationally sacked in 2003.\n\nFour years on, he is back on the music scene with his new band, Killing For Company.\n\nThey made their eagerly awaited live debut at the Burberry Workers Concert in Ystrad, Rhondda, last weekend.\n\n'The band has been almost two years in development - we've written about 15 songs,' he said.\n\n'We wrote them together, just like we did in the early days of the Stereophonics.\n\n'I wanted to make music with a bit of bite, music with guts, because if you look at Dakota - the 'Phonics last N? 1 - it is just a pop song.\n\n'When Stereophonics started out we appealed to the cool kids and an older audience of rock fans as well as the young girls who thought Kelly was cute.\n\n'But you see much less of that mix at 'Phonics gigs these days, it seems to be less rock fans and more young girls,' he said.\n\n'Personally, I think Stereophonics has shot its bolt.\n\n'If you look at their albums now they are nowhere near as popular as they were six or seven years ago.'\n\nCable finally spoke to lead singer Kelly Jones over a few pints at a gig in London last year.\n\nStuart said: 'All I asked was that he didn't slag me off in the press any more, which he said he wouldn't.\n\n'And for a while it was fine, we exchanged texts and had a drink in Cwmaman over Christmas.\n\n'Kelly is the friendliest shark in the sea - he's only nice to you when he wants something.\n\n'I've kept my mouth shut for three years - you are walking on eggshells around him and, deep down, I think people are sick of it.\n\n'We all wrote together up until the second album but then JEEP (2001) was pretty much Kelly's album and I felt I was just a drummer in someone else's band.\n\n'I didn't want to be a puppet on a string so my view was that I would finish that tour and then get out, but obviously I was sacked,' he said.\n\n'Kelly has said since that the band is better than it's ever been but I will leave that to other people to judge.'"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2010/06/stuart-cable-1970-2010.shtml", "page_content": "It is with great sadness that we report that Stuart Cable, former Stereophonics drummer and Radio Wales presenter, has died aged 40.\n\nEmergency services attended Mr Cable's house at Llwydcoed near Aberdare, Cynon Valley, at 0500 BST on Monday 7 June. Police say there are no suspicious circumstances. Read the latest on the BBC News website.\n\nCable performed with Stereophonics from their formation as Tragic Love Company until 2003.

Seats were on the half way line in the sun. We made the opening of the game and he arrived a little later after getting another ticket. I'll always remember having a good time with him at The Carpenters when I lived in Aberdare. A True gent.R.I.P.\" - Richard Proctor, They Walk Among Us\n\n\"Stuart will go down as the best Welsh Drummer of all time! He complemented the Phonics to their best work and was a great character in his own right. He will be sorely missed. RIP Butt.\" - Mike Jones\n\n\"I am absolutely devastated at the death of Stuart Cable. I saw his new band twice this year: once at the gathering (for another welsh band, The Alarm), and also saw them supporting The Alarm at the Citrus Club in Edinburgh. Having spoken to him both at the gathering, and in Edinburgh, he was a really, genuine, down to earth, and thoroughly decent bloke - and his new band were, I think, destined to really make their mark. My thoughts go out to all of his friends and family: it's a very sad day for Welsh Music.\" - Luke Campbell\n\n\"I met Stuart with my son (a keen drummer at the time) after watching Scarlets at Stradey a few years ago. Despite him being with friends, Stuart took the time to chat to my son about his drumming and what he should do to improve. This is a tragic event for Wales.\" - Ian Gravell\n\n\"Got to know Stuart through doing security at many an event over the years. Made a long day seem so much better. What a man. Will be missed.\" - Michael Davies\n\n\"It's a very sad day for Wales - RIP Stuart, he was one of the brightest stars in Wales! The marmite man he was know in his circle of mates! You will be sadly missed RIP - Stuart.\" - Mikey\n\n\"Never had the pleasure of seeing Stuart perform live but I have plenty of videos and DVDs of him drumming with Stereophonics and he was a truly talented and gifted performer. Stuart you will be missed. Rest in Peace x\" - Sharan\n\n\"It's so unbelievably sad to hear the news about Stuart Cable this morning. For thousands of twenty somethings throughout Wales, Stuart was the face of welsh music as we grew up. He was larger than life and will be missed by millions.\" - Gareth Bate\n\n\"Can't believe he is gone. Never to hear those dulcet tones again is a tragedy.\" - Sue Pritchard-Jones\n\n\"There are very few musicians worth following. Stuart Cable was one of the few who were. Nice guy, funny and talented. The world needs more of his type, not less.\" - Ed Parnell\n\n\"Devastated Down Under in Wodonga, Victoria on this sad news of a Welsh Legend. From one Welsh Drummer to another. RIP my friend! X\" - Steve Stone\n\n\"Very sad to hear a great fellow drummer has died. I met Stuart when playing with my band Haven at the Cardiff Barfly back in 2002. He was the nicest guy you could meet and we had a great laugh together. Another life taken far too young. R.I.P.\" - Jack Mitchell\n\n\"Stuart was quite simply the coolest man in Welsh rock, despite being part of one of Wales' finest exports there was no rockstar attitude, never anything but one of the boys. He championed young bands from the area offering them spots on his radio show and support slots with his band, he always had time for everyone. The Welsh music scene is a poorer place without him. R.I.P. Stuart.\" - Jarrad Owens, Amped\n\n\"A light has gone out in the valleys.\" - Sean, Rhondda\n\n\"Totally gutted to hear about Stu, He was the personality behind the Phonics and they've not been the same since he left. A true legend!! - Mike Smith\n\n\"I am so sad to hear about ex Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable has died, I have been a huge fan of Stereophonics since the beginning and was really sad when he was sacked back in 2003. The band has never been the same since he left the band he was such a talented guy and what an amazing drummer he was. My heart goes out to his family especially his wee boy. He will be sadly missed.\" - Kimberley Barrack\n\n\"Our thoughts go out to all Stuart's family. He was a kind, considerate lovely, bubbly person. This news is just so sad and so shocking. Everybody loved Stuart. He will be sorely missed.\" - Elaine Davies, Ellis Davies and families.\n\n\"Seeing the Stereophonics live back in 1996 was something of a formative experience for me. They were the first band I ever saw live and it was a revelation to see ordinary guys from the same area as me doing so well, making such fantastic music and especially in the case of Stuart Cable having such a laugh doing it! Very sad he's gone.\" - Alun\n\n\"One of the reasons I became interested in Radio. He will be missed.\" - Steph\n\n\"Such tragic news. I remember seeing the Stereophonics at the Newcastle Telewest Arena back in 1999, and our section of the front row were having lots of banter with Stuart before and during the gig. He then came over to us at the end and gave me one of his drumsticks, accompanied by a wink and a smile. The band lost a lot of character and never really had the same personality after he left.\" - Jamie Tucker\n\n\"I wasn't a friend of Stuart's, but had the pleasure of touring with them when they supported The Alarm on a UK tour last month. He was such a lovely warm bloke; you couldn't fail to like him. Took this photo of him on the last night of the tour in Liverpool with his band Killing For Company showing support for the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a clich\u00e9, but he will be sadly missed but fondly remembered. It was a pleasure to meet you mate!\" - Andy Labrow\n\n\"What tragic news, just want his family and friends that my thoughts are with them, super sad news for a Monday morning.\" - Catrin Hayward\n\n\"I am shocked beyond belief and utterly saddened to hear that Stuart has died. A few years ago I was in Queen Street in Cardiff with my husband and daughter when Stuart walked right past me. I was in my wheelchair and he was looking straight ahead so he wouldn't have seen me. He had his hands in his pockets and a smile on his face. I wanted to say 'Hello' but I felt stupid. I wish I had now. Seeing him made my day. Seeing or hearing him always made my day. I can't believe he's gone.\" - Eleanor Dent\n\n\"Gutted, heart wrenching, goose pimples, completely shocked & saddened! To say Stuart Cable will be sadly missed is but an understatement! RIP Stuart! xxxxx\" - Tracey Russell\n\n\"Gutted, superb drummer and Killing For Company were clearly destined for greatness.\" - Andrew Allport\n\n\"Rest In Peace Stuart. A very sad day in South Wales. Condolences to his family.\" - All the volunteers from Rhondda Radio, Treherbert\n\n\"What a legend; you are going to be sadly missed! Stereophonics were not the same after you left, you added a spark that could never be replaced. R.I.P\" - Phillip Kennery\n\n\"I've just read the tragic news about Stuart Cable on the BBC news website and frankly I'm stunned. Although not a fan of the Stereophonics I was a big fan of Stuart's show on Kerrang radio and always considered him to be the rightful successor to the legend that was Tommy Vance in terms of his appreciation and endorsement of all rock and metal music. His dulcet tones will be very sadly missed.\" - Nick\n\n\"I heard the sad news of one of the greats of Wales passing away; I was only enjoying the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff on Saturday night. Rest well Stuart, keep playing and being the guy you always shown to be. A pure inspiration a sad loss.\" - Darren Page\n\n\"Stuart was such entertainer and always made gigs interesting! Will always remember - and appreciate - all the time he made to chat and have a laugh with fans and interviewing him for our fanzine (I though we talked a lot but he gave us a run for our money!) so easy-going and friendly. A lovely, genuine bloke, who'll be sadly missed - RIP Stuart xx\" - Susanna Ettridge\n\n\"My heartfelt condolences to Stuart's family at this sad time. I will always remember him as the man who helped me get through Sunday mornings working in a dire pub kitchen with his amazing choice of music peppered with banter and unbelievable stories. The world has lost a truly unique character.\" - Gary Anderson\n\n\"A welsh musical legend. You will be sincerely missed. RIP Stuart.\" - Andrew. Cardiff\n\n\"Legend ;gone but not forgotten. The Welsh community in Dubai are talking about such a sad occasion. RIP always will be remembered. True legend...\" - Andrew\n\n\"So, so sorry to hear about the sudden tragedy of good man Stuart Cable. Sincere thoughts and prayers go to his wife, son and family at this very very sad time. Love Shadow, Bev and family\" - Abercwmboi RFC\n\n\"My name's Anfa and I live in Paris... I'm a big Phonics fan since the beginning. I've seen Stuart many times performing in France, Wales and England. I had the chance to meet the full band for an exclusive interview for my website Samesizefeet.net, the French Stereophonics site. I can remember one thing clearly: Stuart told me that he has all this energy onstage because of the fans, he was really proud to play for the kids and really entertained the audience by himself. Thanks Stuart, you'll always be in our hearts...\" - Anfa Singsavanh\n\n\"RIP Stuart Cable! Seriously gutted to hear about this, the guy was a gent. Had the pleasure of drinking a few ales with him and the boys from the Phonics when they were last in Edinburgh together before his departure. Cracking guy, so full of life. I have last of the big time drinkers blazing in my ipod in his honour! Seriously saddened.\" - Sean Roseburgh, Edinburgh\n\n\"Really saddened to hear of the death of Stuart Cable. I met him at services on the M4 on my way back to Swansea, the day after watching the Stereophonics headline at the Reading Festival. He was next to me in the queue to get a fry-up and we chatted about how great it was that Tom Jones joined them on stage the night before. I couldn't believe how down-to-earth he was, and the fact that I was chatting to him in the fry-up queue after watching him on stage with tens of thousands of other people! Great memory for me - genuinely nice guy, he will be sorely missed.\" - Ben Kidd\n\n\"I worked on the first Stereophonics album (Word Gets Around) and spent quite a bit of time with the band. Stuart was a funny, warm and talented guy, and completely down to earth, very genuine. I am stunned by the news, such a tragic loss. My thoughts go to his family at the difficult time.\" - Emma Doughty (nee Jones)\n\n\"I've just heard the tragic news - I still can't really believe it. Stuart was a smashing bloke and I really thought that he was 'going places' with Killing For Company. I'm just glad I had the chance to see him perform one last time in April.\" - Dave Summers\n\n\"Rest in peace dude, you were a top bloke! Long time since we toured but will never forget getting hammered with you and the guys on the Subcircus tour when it was my birthday in Aberdeen!\" - Rampton - Sound Engineer\n\n\"I'm a 30 year old from Cardiff who remembers the Stereophonics 'explosion' very well. In my late teens and early twenties, Stereophonics ignited a love and passion for music that I didn't know I had. Being Welsh and watching the early Stereophonics years instilled a sense of pride in all young Welsh people. Not only was the music amazing, but the boys were 'loveable rogues' who embraced their roots from the South Wales Valleys. Stuart, in particular, was such a likeable, happy and energetic person. Being the drummer, he could have so easily faded into the background. However, he was an integral part of the band and so outwardly talented, yet not arrogant in any way. The whole of Wales I'm sure, is stunned, just as I am. RIP Stuart Cable. You have shaped the music of Wales for years to come.\" - Gemma Dowers\n\n\"I have just heard the news about Stuart Cable. It is so sad. Whenever I met Stuart he always had time to talk and always was interested in what you were doing. Always happy. Always larger than life. Just Saturday I was at a photo exhibition in Llandaff, one exhibit of which was featuring a photo shoot of him and the band Killing For Company by Michael Morgan. We were saying what a character he was and how we admire how he's gone about things since leaving the Stereophonics. Also how we were looking forward to seeing him on the forthcoming tour. He will be sadly missed.\" - Glyn Mills\n\n\"I am absolutely devastated to hear this sad news. He was such a fun and larger than life character who was so entertaining in his performances back in the 'Old Phonics' era. I will never forget his energy during the Morfa Stadium gig back in July 1999 - it was one of my favourite ever days. He was an integral part of a band whose music has brought me such joy over the years. His music has given me and my friends so many good memories - so many early Phonics songs remind me of so many good times. He will be greatly missed. RIP Stuart.\" - Craig Price\n\n\"Having been a massive fan of early Stereophonics, I loved watching him drum, if not for his technically complicated style, but for his character behind the drums and his visible enjoyment. That is his legacy to my mind - and I will hold that influence with me throughout my own bands progress.\" - Daniel Holdsworth\n\n\"A true Welsh rock legend. You will be missed.\" - David Harris, Cardiff\n\n\"Very sad news about Stuart; condolences to his family. Saw and spoke to him only a few weeks ago. He was supporting the Alarm with his excellent new band, which he was very exited about .A true gentleman and a huge loss.\" - John Williams\n\n\"God Bless you Stuart! You will be an angel in Heaven now. Rock on! Sadly missed RIP.\" - Peter Paton\n\n\"Tragic loss for music in general I am a huge fan of the Stereophonics but must admit since Stuart Cable left I seemed to not be able to associate with the new band set up and watching them live as I did on many occasions he was as big a man in person as he was a vital part of Stereophonics distinctive sound. The most memorable occasion was the v festival in 2002 which he played the drums with no shoes on.\" - Justin Tarrant\n\n\"I only had the pleasure of meeting Stuart Cable once but it is one of my fondest memories. He took time to chat with me and tell me and my friend a couple of stories despite the fact it was about 1am and he was heading for the tour bus. He was a gentleman and a legend and his band inspired me to to what I do today. Such a sad day but I'm sure he's still causing a riot wherever he is!\" - Glyn Jones\n\n\"I just wanted to say what a great drummer Stuart Cable was. He is the sole reason I became a drummer and he was the driving force behind the Stereophonics, something they have severely lacked since his departure. He will never be forgotten.\" - Andy Snape\n\n\"Sad day - great drummer, great man, he will be sorely missed by all.\" - Chris Jack\n\n\"R.I.P Stuart, you never changed and always had time for everyone. From giving my mam a lift in your catering van to just been good company when out. You will be missed by so many and a Sunday will never be the same to most who knew you. Take care and make sure you rock with best of them up there.\" - Sian Hobson\n\n\"Sad news I met Stuart at Scott Young's testimonial dinner. What a true gent, he will be greatly missed by myself and all fellow bluebirds R.I.P.\" - Craig\n\n\"I was lucky enough to meet Stuart soon after I moved to Wales seven years ago at the Michael Sobell centre in Aberdare. He was the most friendly and down to earth man you could ever meet. Somewhere my mum has a photo of me with him, so I was shocked and saddened to hear of his death. My thoughts, love and prayers go out to his family, friends and ex/new bandmates. He will be missed.\" - Kerry Shanks\n\n\"Well, what can I say? I'm absolutely gutted! Part of my teenage years has died. Back in the late 90s when the Stereophonics first appeared in the mainstream, they were something to be trifled with within the indie genre and at 14, I thought that was brilliant! Nowadays I've grown up and moved on from listening to the band but will never forget how much Stuart made me laugh, his warmness and utter love and passion for music. God bless ya Stu! Wherever you are, keep the neighbours up with your drumming!\" - Joanna Edwards\n\n\n\n\"My first gig was seeing the boys at Newcastle Arena in 1999. My one lasting memory from that gig was Stuart giving 110% to the end of Too Many Sandwiches. I think it was from that point that I realised what rock n roll really was. RIP fella.\" - Chris Robson\n\n\n\n\"To me Stuart was the essence of the stereophonics in their prime. My favourite albums of all time were Word Gets Around and Performance And Cocktails. He seemed like such a friendly guy and I'd definitely rate him as a very talented drummer. When asked what bands were you brought up on I would always class the Phonics as one of the first to get mentioned in the list of bands. I am truly gutted that Wales has lost such a personality but no doubts he will live on forever through his family, friends and adoring fans. Much love to the Cable!\" - Rachael Hawkins\n\n\"A very sad day my heart goes out to all his family and friends r.i.p Stuart.\" - Darren Mundy\n\n\n\n\"I am very shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden death of Stuart Cable. I saw him perform with his band Killing For Company (supporting The Alarm) just a few weeks ago in Reading, and thought he and his band were absolutely superb. He will be sorely missed. My condolences go out to his family and friends.\" - Robbie Grieve\n\n\n\n\"I remember meeting Stuart backstage. I recently recounted the experience to friends while we were at a phonics gig. My memory is still that he was instantly one of the funniest men I had ever met and still think so to this day. Great man will be sadly missed.\" - Wes Douglas\n\n\n\n\"Just heard the tragic news - cannot believe this. Stuart had so much to live for! Never met him but loved his radio persona, what he stood for, and just listening to him. He`ll be missed greatly, and his talents were a gift to us all.\" - Pete and Gez, Blackstorm\n\n\n\n\"My friend Nicola Williams had been messaging Stuart last week and the last message was sent to Stuart on Friday. Stuart had kindly said that he would donate signed drumsticks to auction at a charity event called Holly's Ball 2011 in the Millennium Stadium to raise autism awareness in Wales. Although we won't have the drumsticks, I just wanted you to know how wonderful and kind he was right to the end and we will always remember him as being special. We will also read out the message that he sent Nicola at the ball in April 2011.\" - Jo Salmon\n\n\n\n\"I only met Stuart once, in the Golden Harp in Aberdare. He treated me as someone he had known for years and was happy to enjoy a pint with me or anyone. A true Gent! He will be missed by all. RIP!\" - Kyle Probert\n\n\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by this tragic news. Stuart was a hugely popular figure in the local community and throughout Wales as a whole and people are understandably devastated by his untimely death. I met with Stuart at a number of events in Cynon Valley over the years and was also pleased to welcome him to the Assembly some years back. Obviously my heart goes out to his family and my thoughts are with them at this very sad time.\" - Chris Chapman AM, Cynon Valley\n\n\n\n\"I have never met a bigger advocate for new and live music in Wales than Stuart Cable. His enthusiasm for Welsh bands was second to none. He was a true gentlemen, always keen to share his experiences and never shied away from any questions. I can positively say that he's had a huge effect on anyone that had the pleasure of meeting him. A very sad day for Wales, losing a huge multi-talented personality. Our thoughts are with his closest friends and family.\" - Martin Goddard, Sierra Alpha\n\n\n\n\"Working with Stuart was some of the best times of my life. I still relay the ridiculous stories he used to tell and I am so sorry to hear he won't be able to grace the World with any more. I always walked away from a show he was on with a smile.\" - Elin Davies\n\n\n\n\"A true inspiration to myself in the way in which he rose from the small village life with his two best mates and became the biggest rock band in the world. Helped to make Stereophonics the band I love and he will be sorely missed. A truly great drummer and an amazing entertainer. Rest In Peace.\" - Mic Houghton\n\n\n\n\"When I heard the news I was stunned. He was so full of life, and on the verge of something major with his new band. Always smiling and laughing, and for me as a drummer, he was someone I admired. Having a laugh was just as important as playing the music. I love listening to early Stereophonics records, and they always looked as though they were having fun making the videos. Wales has lost another inspirational drummer. I'm off to DJ in Sardinia tomorrow, and I will play a song in his memory.\" - Mark Fellowes\n\n\n\n\"Deeply saddened by the sad news of Stuarts death. A sad loss to Welsh music and entertainment biz - quality drummer and all round good bloke - RIP.\" - Peter Williams\n\n\n\n\"Part of the phonics died when Cable left. A larger than life part has now sadly passed. Awesome drummer. Rip Cabes.\" - Stephen Thompson\n\n\n\n\"There are no words for me to express the sudden shock of Stuart's passing, I am literally gobsmacked. I grew up with Stuart in Aberdare and spent many a time in the Carpenters Arms with him, the Monsters Of Rock festivals we went on will go down in memory for many years to come. Spoke with him briefly in May when I was home, and he was the most down to earth, honest and warm hearted person you would find; he kept his feet on the ground and was always a pleasure to be around. Rest in Peace mate, your beat will always go on in my heart and soul. A legend.\" - Steve Thomas\n\n\n\n\"Condolences to the cable family, Stu will be missed by many! RIP dude.\" - Sean Harrison\n\n\n\n\"Just wanted to add my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Stuart Cable at this dreadful time. Stuart was a genuinely nice bloke, and a true inspiration to his generation. He never lost touch with reality, and managed to avoid the seductive bright lights that have claimed the souls of so many.\" - Ioan Edwards\n\n\n\n\"I would just like to send my condolences to all of Stuarts friends and family, I had the honour of meeting Stuart in Aberdare at the bbc wales roadshow\n\nhe was such a lovely person and very kind my daughter had her photo taken with Stuart, and he did not mind one bit when people were going up to him\n\nfor this reason. He will be sadly missed by all.\" - Arianne Blease\n\n\n\n\"I was Stuart's PE teacher in my very first teaching job at Blaengwawr Comprehensive School in Aberdare in the early 80's. I remember him as a real character and great fun to teach - also a useful hooker in the school team! I got to know him again in recent years through my work at the BBC - you could not wish to meet a more generous and friendly person. He always seemed to have time for everyone and would always leave you smiling. I heard someone remark today that Stuart was the Ray Gravell of Welsh Music - I can't think of a finer tribute.\" - Phil Steele, BBC Wales Sport\n\n\n\n\"Stuart was my next door neighbour in Cwmaman for a few years in the early 90's when the 'Phonics were just making it big. Always fun to talk to and one of the nicest people you would wish to meet. He remained a normal local guy and didn't allow fame and fortune to change his approach to life one bit. He will be sadly missed and my sincere condolences go to his family and close friends\" - Geoff Davies\n\n\n\n\"RIP Stuart. Didn't see you much lately however always had a laugh when we grew up, especially when I saw you in that in that yellow van! Always heard you before we saw you!\" - Paul\n\n\n\n\"First my deepest thoughts to the family and friends of Stuart. I've been travelling for the past nine years but the weekend before I left Cardiff in 2002 I witnessed what I still think is the best concert I've seen in live company and believe me I've seen the best over the years. Stuart's input and performance on J.E.E.P. couldn't have been replicated by anyone else at the time and brought something else to the stage as a drummer too. I take that DVD wherever I go around the west side of the world and expose the music of a great set of chaps with world stage talent - always on occasions my friends have something positive to say about the 'drummer'. He has already been missed by the band the past few years, that concert will always live in my memory and can only thank for such great memories and bringing joy and giving vitality to folk like me around the world!\" You'll never be forgotten, R.I.P.\" - Tim Green\n\n\n\n\"Stuart's passing was a tragic, and Stereophonics haven't been the same since he left. He is a legend and inspiration to music. Rest In Peace Stuart, you'll be missed.\" - Rob Fettah\n\n\n\n\"I toured with Stuart for two years whilst working with The Sterephonics. He was a lovely bloke and ever eager to amuse. I would have to spend the show trying not to catch his eye, otherwise he would start an endless attempt to make me laugh. He could walk into a room of strangers, anywhere in the world, and within 30 minutes people would be laughing and joking along to the sound of his deep welsh voice. A gentleman and an all round good bloke. I will miss him.\" - Jon Burton\n\n\"It is thanks to Stuart Cable playing up to the camera from behind his kit that I became a fan of the 'phonics as a 14 year old. 12 years later, that music has been the soundtrack to much of my life. What a truely great man, his influence and personality will be missed.\" - Ben Jackson\n\n\n\n\"Very few drummers are able to become a personality in their own right but to any Stereophonics fan, Stuart was just that, he played the drums with such energy that you knew this was what he had always dreamt of. I have seen Stereophonics many times but my favourite was at a gig in Bristol, Stuart was the only one of the band members to come out to greet the queuing fans and sign autographs and talk to fans, he was the band's brightest personality. His presence has been missed in the Sterephonics for a long time but now his presence will be missed from the lives of everyone he ever met or inspired through his music. A very sad day.\" - Katie Ward\n\n\n\n\"Shocked and saddened to hear that such a wonderful musician has passed away. My thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time. Wales has lost a true legend. R.I.P. Stuart\" - Sian Kedward-Jones\n\n\n\n\"My dad met Stuart a few years ago when he was at the local television studios. My dad and him got talking and kindly Stuart did some jingles for our local hospital radio. We have lost a Welsh musical legend and he will sadly missed by so many. Such a tragic event. Rest in peace.\" - Gareth Hurford\n\n\n\n\"Just wanted to leave my condolences, to a top drummer. I saw the 'Phonics in Wolverhampton in 1997 and 1999 in Swansea at the Morfa Stadium. As a drummer myself I admired the fact that he looked like he was having fun and loving the fact he himself was in a rock band. Bartender and the Thief I think was his finest performance, though many will have their favourite track that he played on. I listened to a few of his shows on Kerrang and liked his style as a presenter. All in all he sounded like he came across, as a thoroughly nice bloke. Music has lost a character and I for one will be raising a pint in his honour. My condolences once again to those who knew him.\" - Sterling Burke\n\n\n\n\"I was lucky enough to work with Stuart both behind the scenes and with him performing as a one off with The Watchmen and when I sang on his Show Cable TV with Damon Hill and the ConRods. Cable never failed to make me smile. He was a man who made people happy just by being happy himself. If he was in the room, everybody knew about it just by the way he made the ground shake with his amazing voice let alone his drumming. Performing with Stu at the HardRock was one of the proudest moments of my life - I will never forget his sense of humour, love of life and unceasing generosity with his time. I know that he will be performing top of the bill in heaven tonight with Bon Scott - there will be thunder in the sky tonight, but this planet has lost a 'real' performer in every sense of the word. Stu, the memory of you hitting the drums harder than anyone I have ever worked with will stay with me forever. It will take us all a long time to come to terms with you not being around any more. For those about to rock. We salute you/\" - Aubrey Parsons, The Watchmen / Ex-Conrods\n\n\n\n\"Stuart Cable. Always had a smile, and was always laughing, a great guy, who will be so missed in the valley. Regularly seen riding his motorbike through the town, or popping into the local pubs, and always had time for a chat. Thoughts go out to his family. Gonna miss you Stu, what a legend.\" - Brodie Jaye\n\n\"Just read the very sad news about Stuart. I brought a few acts for Stuart to interview for his show, in fact he only interviewed Thunder for me last week. When I brought in Sharon Corr last year to BBC Wales, Sharon was so taken by Stuart that she invited him over to Ireland to play on her new album, which he did. What a sad loss to music and radio, Stuart was such a warm and lovely, lovely guy. He will be missed.\" - Neil Cossar, Absolute PR\n\n\n\n\"One word, LEGEND. A very huge loss to the music industry, A massive loss to Wales. R.I.P. Stuart xxx.\" - Caroline Rees\n\n\n\n\"A sad day. Stuart was a solid foundation of the Stereophonics back in the day. He'll be missed but always remembered for simply being rock and roll. Rest in peace big man.\" - Ed Saxby\n\n\n\n\"I was very saddened when I heard about the death of Stuart Cable. The first two albums with the Stereophonics are among my favourite albums ever. Rest in peace, Stuart, and thanks for the music.\" - Ebbe Villadsen\n\n\n\n\"I'm very sad after hearing the news about Stuart. A great performer, the backbone of the 'phonics and the reason I, and i'm sure many others, started drumming. A sad loss, he will never be forgotten.\" - James Lund\n\n\n\n\"I am so sorry to hear about Stuart Cable's death and I feel for his family!\" - Jeremy Anderton\n\n\n\n\"What a loss the music industry has lost today. Stuart was an amazing person, fantastic father and musican. I personally was fortunatue to have met him on several occassions, a sad day that will be remembered by all in Wales. My thoughts go out to Stuart and his loved ones, R.I.P.\" - Beth Lewis\n\n\n\n\"I've been a fan of the Stereophonics since they began and I'll always remember Stuart's smiling face, enthusiasm and energy. I was shocked and saddened to hear the news today. He was and always will be an inspiration to myself as a drummer, as I'm sure he is to many others. Rest in peace Stuart, you will be greatly missed.\" - Debbie Liggins\n\n\n\n\"Stuart's son shared a class with one of my daughters, so we met occasionally at school plays and such. He never seemed aloof or uncomfortable - people from the valley respected his privacy - but was just a mother's son and a father. Gifted, and occasionally appearing troubled, but an amazingly warm and gifted man. Our family are devastated, and our sympathies go out to his family.\" - Dr. Mike Reddy\n\n\n\n\"I'm heartbroken. I shall always remember him driving me on the back of his three wheel motorbike, down to Bath at break-neck speed and roaring with laughter! What a lovely bloke and my condolences to his family. RIP Stuart xx.\" - Sheelagh Jones\n\n\n\n\"The 'Phonics were the first band I followed religiously growing up at secondary school. Stuart Cable was a terrific drummer and seemed a genuinly nice, down to earth bloke. Sad news. RIP Stuart x.\" - Richard Kemp\n\n\n\n\"Goodbye Stuart. Thanks for the music. Because of it you will never be forgotten.\" - Gary Carey\n\n\n\n\"One of the best RIP.\" - Gordon Reid\n\n\n\n\"Stuart Cable was a helluva nice chap. In fact, he once did a tribute show for the 25th anniversary of Bon Scott's passing at my request. Afterwards, he and his very courteous assistant sent me his autograph and some great CD's from The Stereophonics, too. I'm truly saddened to hear of his loss. R.I.P. Stuart.\" - Jon Talisman\n\n\n\n\"One of the first bands that made me love music were Stereophonics, and the best music they made was with Stuart Cable on drums. I only wish I got to see them whilst Stuart was still in the band. RIP Stuart, you are the best drummer of our time.\" - Tamsin Porter\n\n\n\n\"I'm really sorry to hear about Stuart Cable. He was a wonderful man, I saw him perform with The Stereophonics in Toronto and London, Ontario years ago. I live in Michigan. We met him also and he posed both with my young daughter and many fans of the band. The Northern American Stereophonics fans' heart goes out to Stuart Cable and his family.\" - Cindy Gomez\n\n\n\n\"Rest in piece Stuart Cable, what a guy. It was an honour to meet you a couple of years ago in Birmingham, such a kind man. I've had to rattle through the Stereophonics back catalogue in honour today, and wear my t-shirt. All in pride and respect. Condolences go out to family, friends and the band and everyone associated. Such a shame to lose such a talent musician. Your autograph has sat on my bedroom wall since that day in Birmingham. Thank you, and rest in piece.\" - Jack Fowles\n\n\n\n\"I saw the Stereophonics at Leeds Town and Country Bar on their Performance and Cocktails tour. Word Gets Around is still one of my top three albums of all time and shaped me as a teenager. Stuart Cable was the focal point of the band in my eyes. His energy and showmanship were electric and his performance when I saw him has stayed with me as I had never seen a drummer lead a band in such a way. My thoughts and wishes go out to his family and son.\" - Paul Jibson\n\n\n\n\"What can I say that has not already been said? Stuart and I met in 2003 when I was still living in Wales, and what a meeting it was! I was out shopping with my two eldest daughters at the time (who were aged three & four) and I accidently ran into the back of Stuart's ankles. I have never said sorry so much in my life to one person, then it clicked who he was. We had a chat and he was pulling faces at my kids and making them laugh. I met up with him a few times after. He was a bubbly, kind and considerate guy who was constantly happy each time I saw him. He will most definatly be sadly missed, and my condolences go out to his family and friends. R.I.P friend.\" - Miki Gabrielli-Murphy\n\n\n\n\"Rest in Peace Stuart - Wales and music has lost its biggest star. I'm completely heartbroken and life will never be the same again without him.\" - Vicki Newton\n\n\n\n\"I met Stuart through being a involved with Aberaman Motorcycle club and the races at Aberdare Park and Stuart always attended the races at the park when he could. He will be sadly missed by all for being an honest Welshman who loved life, music and motorbikes.\" - Aled Lloyd\n\n\n\n\"What a great drummer, personality/presenter and (previous) member of one of the greatest rock n' roll bands. Sadly missed.\" - Alun Hamer\n\n\n\n\"I only met Stuart through Facebook, but he always took the time to answer any messages I sent him. He was a lovely, kind and down to earth guy. I'm extremely saddened by the news. Such a great loss.\" - Jacquie Wood\n\n\n\n\"I can't believe the news today, oh boy... the voice of Lennon in my head singing those words as I sit down and look at the sad fact that Stuart will no longer be doing what he does best, playing and talking about great rock music. Wales is a colder place to be today. He was an amazing drummer, a great chap and a Welsh Music Legend.\" - JJ Haggar\n\n\n\n\"Shocking; can't belive it, deepest sympathies go to Stuart's family and friends. There's only one Stuart and my eyes one drummer. Morfa Stadium - you were rocking, and you put the rock in Stereophonics.\" - Vincent Chapman\n\n\n\n\"I knew Stuart Cable through my sister Jo Godfrey at kerrang radio.what a lovely guy he was, I'm really gutted by his death,such a tragedy, he was an inspiration!\" - Steve Godfrey\n\n\n\n\"Such an inspiration to me and countless others, you will never be forgotten.

I'm a Stereophonics Fan in Sydney Australia and had the pleasure of meeting him back stage at one of his shows. He was so cheeky and lots of fun that he made everyone around him smile and that's how I have always thought of him and always will!\" - Melanie Derome\n\n\n\n\"Extremely sad day. And night. And many more to come. I'll miss seeing this fella's face and his wit, his skill behind a kit, his humour and his all round good deeds. Stuart Cable was one of the good guys. Rest in peace, fella.

RIP lad.\" - Brenda and Trevor\n\n\n\n\"My sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Mr Cable. He was talented, popular, hugely charismatic and whenever I saw him out in Cardiff, he was always smiling and had others laughing with him. Local Boy in the Photograph will be a hard song to listen to from now on. R.I.P. Stuart x\" - Matthew Davies\n\n\n\n\"RIP Stuart, you were brilliant entertainment on stage x.\" - Clare Johnson\n\n\"I worked with Stuart during his time at Kerrang Radio, I know he'll always be remembered as the drummer for the 'Phonics, but as a guy who could communicate his passion for music on the airwaves, he was second to none. You will see it many times, he was larger than life and one of the genuine good guys. I will miss his loudness and his laughter. Our thoughts are for his family.\" - Gordon Davidson\n\n\n\n\"I met him three times, once with my wife, once with my son and once on my own. He always had time for you, never said I'm too busy. He was an excellent drummer, a huge personality, and a great Welshman. No one can fill the gap he has left behind. I was listening to him on Saturday night. I still can't believe he has gone. He loved rock and rock loved him. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. RIP Stuart, The Local Boy In The Photograph.\" Richard, Steph and Spender Lewis\n\n\n\n\"I got a call from my wife at 10am to say she was shocked but had heard that Stuart had died. We both knew Stuart from the Stereophonics days. I couldn't believe it. Less than two months ago we supported his band Killing For Company in Reading at what was our first proper gig. We had a great time and he was so professional. The soundcheck over-ran, massively. Stuart made no issues of it and offered to share his kit with our drummer. A true gentleman, no ego just total professionalism. It was great for me to catch up finally with him. We'd spoken via email when he started KFC a few years earlier and I was living in the States. When we finally caught up, I hadn't seen him for nine years. We'd first met each other on the UK and European leg of the Performance And Cocktails tour. I was traveling with the support band The Crocketts and had just picked up glandular fever. I would do the Crocketts gig, then crash out in my bunk on the tourbus for the first several nights. When I got my strength back, I went out with the lads, especially on our days off in Strasbourg and Amsterdam. I immediately warmed to Stuart, the life and soul of the party, but also just a genuine fella. It was hilarious hearing the banter between him and his drum tech Swampy who he used to call 'Fatty'. I remember the night Swampy got too close to Stuart while he was playing in Gronnigen. Stuart cracked him on the back with a drum stick like hitting a cymbal. We both played in a band, (formed from many musicians), at the wedding for the Stereophonics' bassist Richard Jones. It is such a shame he's gone as his band was really good and I believe destined for much bigger things. I'll miss him but am very honored to have shared the stage with him. RIP Stu.\" - Boz\n\n\n\n\"I have not seen him play with Stereophonics but having heard him talking on the radio I was entranced by his wonderful voice and mellow well rounded Welsh accent. He would have made a brilliant embassador for Wales on the radio just by his voice alone.\" - Bella\n\n\n\n\"On Monday I had the radio on in the background, then my ears pricked up when I heard the words 'breaking news' - after which the sad news about Stuart was announced. I was in total shock. The news didn't really hit me until I went on to Stereophonics official website last night and saw the lovely picture of Stuart that the boys had put on there as a tribute to him. I can remember the faces he used pull at the camera if it caught him - the big wide eyes and silly grin. It would make me laugh. I am a fan of Stereophonics and was sad when he left, It's good that he got the chance to use his talents as a drummer in other bands. I never got the chance to see him perform live but have video clips of the Stereos when Stuart was with them. He will be missed by all his fans and the people who knew and loved him. All my love to his family and friends.\" - Chloe Wright\n\n\n\n\"It is so sad to hear about the loss of Stuart. His music was the soundtrack to my teens, and in 1999 the Stereophonics were the first band I ever went to see; it will forever be my most memorable gig. I can vividly recall how full of energy he was, and his enthusiasm and personality was infectious. I only had the pleasure of meeting him once when he popped into a sports shop I was working in to buy a golf club. I got to serve him, and although I was probably a star-struck teenage wreck, he remained the perfect gentleman. Friendly, polite and down to earth. He will be sorely missed, RIP Stuart x.\" - Natalie McLaren\n\n\n\n\"Had the pleasure of meeting you a few times Stuart. Rest In peace mate. You will be sadly missed.\" - Rhys Pearce\n\n\n\n\"I was shocked to hear the sad news that Stuart Cable had died in the early hours of yesterday morning. As a Stereophonics fan since 1997 and having met Stuart at several gigs it's extremely sad to hear of his untimely death. He always gave time to meet with fans and have a chat.As I write this I can hear Stereophonics play on the radio and it brings joy to hear them and reminds me of an exciting time in UK rock. Let's raise a glass to Stuart as one of the last big timers and I bet he will be no doubt be trying to arrange a jam session with John Bonham and Keith Moon as we speak.\" - Richard Houghton\n\n\n\n\"I saw Stuart Cable perform at the Eisteddfod in Swansea 2006. He was there as a guest of Dewi 'Pws' Morris and met with a huge cheer of audience approval. This was well before he paired up again with Dewi Pws to do the Big Welsh Challenge. And what a double act they were! That evening was typical of Stuart - to be so giving of his time and blend in without taking the limelight. His warm, sunny personality (and big hair) will sorely be missed. There is a huge gap left in Wales which will be difficult to fill. Broadcasting and music has lost a lively and entertaining person. My thoughts go out to his family and friends and the community of Cwmaman. I am shocked by his untimely death.\" - T Jones\n\n\n\n\"Really cant believe it RIP Stuart what a legend you will be missed x.\" - Louise Jones\n\n\n\n\"I'm so, so very sad to hear of the sad loss of Stuart Cable. Whenever I heared Stuart on Kerrang radio that booming Welsh voice would take me back to the best summers I spent in south Wales. Sleep well Stuart.\" - Anna Mason\n\n\n\n\"The last time I spoke to Stuart was at a Motorhead gig in Cardiff - he always had time to have a chat and was one of the most upbeat characters I've met. As has been said already - a wonderful, larger than life bloke that will be sorely missed. A truly great friend. Our best wishes to his family and friends.\" - Mike Markey and Nick Jones\n\n\n\n\"Shocking news about Stuart's sudden death at far too young an age. I met the 'Phonics backstage a few years ago when they played here in Vancouver and they were just regular Valleys lads made good. Hard to believe you left us so soon Stuart. Thanks for all the memories. RIP.\" - Brian Jones\n\n\n\n\"Just wanted to say how sad a day for Wales this is. Stuart Cable stuck to his roots even though he'd achieved his dreams and probably had the chance to leave us behind as so much of our talent does, so hats off for that. Stereophonics was the first big gig I saw and was an inspiration for me to stick at guitar and form my own band which, years later, Stuart judged as part of a BBC competition in Carmarthen. It's great to meet someone you look up to and even better to find out that they're down to earth. My heart goes out to his family and friends and I hope these messages will show how well respected and loved he was.\" - Gareth Ziggy\n\n\n\n\"I just want to leave a short tribute to Stuart Cable, an amazing drummer and all round nice guy. I was only 12 when I first began listening to the 'Phonics, mainly from the influence of my dad. When I started to get into them, I joined the stereophonics chat room and message board on their website, and met some great friends who I am still in touch with and see to this day. The Stereophonics compelled me to listen to all types of rock and indie music, and become as passionate about it as I am today. I went to my first gig with friends I had met through their chat room, and my second gig ever was seeing the boys. I'll always remember spying them through a window that day at LCCC, running up to them and waving frantically almost like I was participating in Beatles mania! Without the Stereophonics and their music, I wouldn't be the person I am today and they have influenced my life to no end. They were never the same without Stuart, I was devastated when he left the band and I'm devastated to hear this news. R.I.P legend, I wish I could have met you.\" - Faye Cruickshank\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had the good fortune to swing the lantern with Stuart on a few occasions. Wales and the world has lost a genuine character. The light that shines twice as bright burns half as long, and Stuart shone very, very brightly. RIP Stuart, bust some sticks with Bonzo and Mooney in rock'n'roll heaven.\" - Dave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/19/stereophonics-stuart-cable-death-choking", "page_content": "Former Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable choked to death on his own vomit after a three-day drinking session, an inquest has found.\n\nThe coroner in Cable's home town of Aberdare, south Wales, recorded a verdict of accidental death today.\n\nCable, 40, had eaten a Chinese takeaway after a heavy drinking session on 6 June. He continued drinking and was left sleeping on the carpet by his partner and a friend. Coroner Peter Maddox said large amounts of food debris found in Cable's respiratory system were the result of vomiting triggered by acute alcohol poisoning.\n\nThe musician's death was greeted with an outpouring of grief in the community where he grew up. Up to 5,000 fans brought Aberdare to a standstill this summer at a public funeral service for the drummer.\n\nTearful fans thronged the streets and applauded as his coffin was taken to church by horse-drawn carriage. They were then treated to the raucous sounds of a live heavy metal band relayed into the street as they played inside the church.\n\nCable was a fan of the rock and roll lifestyle and once predicted he would never live to see the age of 40. However, when he died on 7 June, having celebrated his 40th birthday, he was thought to have put his wild years behind him.\n\nHe formed Stereophonics in the Welsh village of Cwmaman in 1992 with friends Kelly Jones and Richard Jones. A much-publicised falling out with other band members saw him sacked in 2003.\n\nCable described himself as turning into a \"coke-taking zombie\" during his time with the band.\n\nStereophonics, who had a string of hit singles and albums before his departure, continued their success afterwards.\n\nFamily members were largely absent at the brief inquest into his death, with only his brother Paul Cable attending. A family friend read out a short statement afterwards saying they \"could never put into words how much Stuart meant to them\".\n\nIt concluded with an appeal for the media to respect the family's wish to mourn in private."}, {"url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/stereophonics-open-death-late-drummer-stuart-cable-2149031", "page_content": "Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones has opened up about the death of late drummer, Stuart Cable \u2013 revealing that there\u2019s a song about him on their upcoming new album.\n\nThe band are set to release their new album \u2018Scream Above The Sounds\u2018 on November 3, featuring the track \u2018Before Anyone Knew Our Name\u2019 which deals with the loss of Cable, who died in 2010 at the age of 40.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a reflection of losing Stuart Cable,\u201d Jones told Radio X. \u201cI think, you know, Stuart left the band and we were still friends for seven years. And then he passed away tragically, and of course people have opinions about what happened and all this sort of stuff. We kept it very private because we were like brothers and we didn\u2019t want to dish any dirt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I guess a lot of the point of the song also is, you know, Stuart and I lived seven doors apart all our lives, and from the age of 12 I was in a band with him. So we were trying to be the people we became for a long time, before anybody knew who we were. So there\u2019s a lot of history there before we even had a record deal. People forget that sometimes. There\u2019s a lot of history there and sometimes people make judgements or calls on what happened when they don\u2019t really know the backstory.\u201d\n\nCable played with Stereophonics between 1992 and 2003. The drummer and broadcaster died on June 7 in 2010 after choking on his vomit in his sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big sounding record, as in it\u2019s pretty anthemic,\u201d frontman Kelly Jones told NME about thenew album. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of different sounds, it\u2019s a very contemporary-sounding record. It sounds like us doing whatever it is we do in our 20th year. I dunno, there are ten songs on the album and they all sound different from each other, it\u2019s just exciting to bring out some new music and play some new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the album\u2019s lyrics, he added: \u201cThe climate of the world is very upside down right now, it\u2019s all a bit bonkers, [so] I try to write through my own experiences of it. I\u2019m a very observational kind of writer. I write from the people\u2019s point of view: the working classes.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s politics involved in my songs, then it\u2019s usually written through the perspective of a person, often myself, as opposed to literally talking about the powers that be.

However, sources close to the investigation revealed that empty bottles of alcohol were found at the scene.\n\nCable was a founder member of the band but was sacked in 2003 after arguments about his alleged lack of focus.

I texted him back and I said: 'You will live to be 100 mate.' I think that was quite strange really.\n\n\"I'm in total shock. It was about 8.30am and I was getting ready to go to my uncle's funeral when Stuart's brother Paul rang. I was going to see Stuart today for a pint and wish him happy birthday as well.\"\n\nJones said he had patched up his differences with Cable. He said: \"We have been speaking to each other for the past five years. When people break up in bands no one really knows what it's all about. But, between me and Stuart, all our disagreements were solved within one year. There were no regrets.\"Tributes flooded in for Cable today. Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles said he was \"very shocked\". \"He was always lovely when we met. Love to his family and friends. RIP,\" Moyles said.\n\nMike Peters, the lead singer with the Welsh bandThe Alarm, said: \"I will remember him as someone who was so alive. He was always smiling and laughing and great to be around. He had lots of energy and couldn't wait for the next day to come around.\"\n\nThe Welsh comedian and television presenter Rob Brydon, who saw Stereophonics at the weekend, said: \"Terribly sad news about Stuart Cable, such a lovely, warm, funny, talented man.\"\n\nCable had become a hugely popular presenter with BBC Wales, and made guest appearances on comedy and sports programmes. Steve Austins, editor of Radio Wales, said: \"He was an extraordinary man. He was well loved by both colleagues and listeners and he will be deeply missed.\"\n\nPeople who lived close to Cable's Tudor-style home said he had been a lovely and friendly neighbour. Geraint Hill said: \"Stuart was a lovely neighbour and lots of fun. I can't believe he has gone \u2013 it is a terrible tragedy.\"\n\nTerry Davies said: \"Stuart was amiable as a neighbour. He would always stop and have a chat if he saw you in the street. It wasn't just music, he would talk about golf and rugby too. We would sometimes hear him on his drums with his new band. But that was very nice. He used to play with his son on the lawn and he was a very caring father. He was always willing to help.\"\n\nCable's new band, Killing for Company, had been due to play at Donington Park on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement the Welsh band Manic Street Preachers said: \"Whenever you met Stuart, you always walked away with a massive smile on your face. Such a gigantic personality which was reflected in his drumming.\"\n\nThroughout the day fans left floral tributes outside Cable's house and by this evening his black Chrysler car, parked at a local pub, was covered in flowers."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-stereophonics-idUSTRE6561PP20100607", "page_content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Former Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable was found dead at his home in Wales on Monday.\n\nCable was a founding member of the Welsh rock band, which rose to fame in the 1990s, but left in 2003 and pursued a career in media, presenting a weekend rock show on BBC Radio Wales, as well as forming a new band, Killing for Company.\n\n\u201cRest peacefully.

When he was 10, his father died. Thereafter, Cable and his elder[4] brother, Paul, were raised by their mother Mabel (born 1930) on her own.[1] Cable grew up in the close-knit village of Cwmaman near Aberdare,[5] He attended Blaengwawr Comprehensive School (now Aberdare Community School) with his friend, Stereophonics singer-songwriter and guitarist Kelly Jones, who also lived on the same street.[6]\n\nCareer\n\nStereophonics\n\nTogether with Kelly Jones' school friend Richard Jones, the trio began playing covers in working men's clubs from 1992, under the title Tragic Love Company. The band later changed their name to Stereophonics in 1996. He also played a number of notable gigs in his native Wales. Of particular note were the concert of 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle and the concert of 31 July 1999 at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea, the latter shortly before the stadium was demolished. Both concerts were filmed live and released on VHS and DVD.\n\nOther bands\n\nCable also played for other bands, including as a vocalist for Rhondda band NailBombs. During 1992, they recorded the E.P. \"Raw Sex for Breakfast\" at Sound Space Studios in Cardiff, on which Cable sang lead vocals. After Cable fully committed to Stereophonics, he was replaced by ex-Rag Dolls frontman J.J.Cruz.\n\nHe had been the temporary drummer for hard rock band Stone Gods, which was formed by former members of The Darkness, filling in for Ed Graham during 2008 who had left the band for health reasons.\n\nMost recently, Cable had been drumming in his new Welsh band, Killing for Company,[7] who were the first band to play the new Liberty Stadium in Swansea, supporting The Who.[8][9]\n\nMedia career\n\nIn 2002, Cable was given his own TV chat show, Cable TV, by BBC Wales. He was sacked by the rest of the band in September 2003,[10] because it was claimed he was spending too much time on his new media career at the expense of rehearsals.[8][11] After that, he had another television series of his own, Cable Connects (2005) and had his own radio show on BBC Radio Wales: Cable Rock.[12]\n\nIn 2005, Cable co-hosted the Kerrang! Awards,[13] and he also presented two shows on Kerrang! 105.2: the 'Cable and Caroline Show' with Caroline Beavon on Sunday mornings and \"The Rock 'n' Roll Years\" on weekday mornings until 2010.[14] In November 2007, he joined XFM South Wales and hosted weekend shows until the station was sold on 30 May 2008. After leaving Kerrang! Radio, in April 2010 Cable returned to BBC Radio Wales as the presenter of Saturday Night Cable, a show playing both old and new rock music. Cable interviewed Slash from Guns N' Roses as a presenter and was scheduled to interview his favourite band, AC/DC, on the weekend following his death, at the Download Festival (where his new band were also scheduled to play).[15]\n\nPersonal life\n\nCable owned a flat in Cardiff Bay, and partly lived in Abernant, before moving to the neighbouring village of Llwydcoed in a Tudor-style house.[16] In 1999, he married Nicola[4] in Bridgend. Their son, Cian Damen, was born in 2001 in Cardiff.[17] In 2003, he had an affair with Welsh TV presenter Lisa Rogers.[18] Cable claims that it was differences between Rogers and Kelly Jones' partner Becka (Rebecca Walters) at the time which violently came to a head publicly at a restaurant in Paris, eventually leading to his dismissal after he made a sarcastic joke about the incident the following day.[19] Around 2003, Cable and his wife divorced.[4] In April 2009 he had spoken out about being sacked from Stereophonics and describes the moment they played in front of 80,000 people in Cardiff without him as \"the darkest time of my entire life\".[19] He had said, \"Until that point in my life, I had never ever considered something as stupid as suicide, but that night I could really understand why people get depressed enough to do it.\"[19] He patched up his differences with Kelly Jones in 2009 and at the time of his death they were in contact again.[6]\n\nCable released his autobiography in April 2009, entitled Demons and Cocktails \u2013 My Life with the Stereophonics.[20] In his autobiography, he stated that he had been a hard drinker and drug user, particularly whisky and cocaine.[10] Cable professed that fame had \"turned him into a coke taking zombie\" and that the other Stereophonics members strongly disapproved of it.[10] According to Cable, who vowed to quit drink and drugs, \"I moved back to my old village because if I didn't I'd have probably ended up dead or round the bend \u2013 or both\",[10] and claimed his close friend, Dirty Sanchez star Matthew Pritchard, enjoyed wild parties and drugs.[19] Like former Stereophonics bandmate Richard Jones, he was also a motorcycle enthusiast. According to a neighbour, he was planning a motorcycle tour of Spain.[6][21]\n\nCable was outspoken about child safety and backed a campaign named 'Stuart's Campaign', established following the death of Cowbridge schoolboy Stuart Cunningham-Jones, who died aboard a school bus. He had said, \"In this day and age every child should have the right to travel to and from school in absolute safety.\"[22]\n\nDeath\n\nCable was found dead at his home in Llwydcoed at 5:30 am on 7 June 2010, aged 40.[1][2] On the evening of Saturday 5 June, Stereophonics played in Cardiff;[23] Cable was said to have been presenting on the radio at the same time that Stereophonics were performing.[24] The following day, he began drinking at Welsh Harp Inn in Trecynon. Cable walked home with friends,[25] where he continued drinking and choked to death on his own vomit during his sleep.[26] Cable is survived by one child,[10] his brother and mother.[1]\n\nCable's funeral was held at St. Elvan's Church in Aberdare on 21 June 2010,[27] and he was later cremated."}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stuart-cable-drummer-with-stereophonics-cfdq69lqwr6", "page_content": "Stuart Cable was the original drummer of the Stereophonics, once voted \u201cthe biggest rock band in Britain\u201d by Q magazine.

Died 7 June 2010. Role: Drums\n\nStuart Cable was confirmed to have died on Monday 7 June 2010.\n\nAlthough booted from Stereophonics in acrimonious circumstances in September 2003, drummer Stuart Cable will not be easily forgotten. The joker of the band, Cable was the man with the big personality and the hair to match.\n\nLike the other Stereophonics, he was born in the South Wales town Cwmaman, where he grew up on the same street as Kelly. The pair began playing in bands in their early teens, practising popular rock and soul standards to play at the local working men's clubs. It's commonly supposed that Kelly is the creative force behind the band, but Stuart was the one who coined the name Stereophonics, inspired by the marking on his antique radio set.\n\nFew would seriously argue that Cable was the most technically proficient drummer in the world, but his boisterous playing has a special charm of its own. \"On tunes such as Not Up To You his drum patterns breathe life into the song and momentum into the show,\" said The Times. So perhaps is was inevitable that this unabashed extrovert would find other avenues to express himself outside of music.\n\nIn March 2002, he fronted a national billboard campaign, Bllcks, to raise awareness of testicular cancer. And as host of Cable TV, a light-hearted chat show for BBC Wales, he interviewed the likes of Cerys Matthews and Tom Jones from a comfy couch or the back seat of a New York taxi cab. \"I'm not a born interviewer at all,\" he explains. \"I've got a man upstairs talking in my ear that tells me where to go. Really, we're just asking questions that the man down the pub would like to ask.\"\n\nCable's actions had provoked rumours of a split within the band once before, when he failed to show up for a number of shows on the bands 2001 world tour. \"We were supposed to go out to Japan for 10 days to play two shows,\" he told us back in 2002. \"I didn't want to go, and I voiced my grievances at the beginning. But the tour got booked anyway, so I phoned up the boys and said, look, I'm going to stay at home with the family. Owen Hopkins from The Crocketts stepped in, and I hooked up with the rest of the band 10 days later in the States.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for the split was proximity. Stuart never felt the pull of the big smoke, preferring the home comforts of 'Castle Cable' - a small estate in Aberdare, a mile or so outside Cwmaman. \"I can shut my gates and see nobody. I'm in a great spot, I've got excellent neighbours... and you know, if I wanted to strip down naked and run around my garden, I could. Which is good, because I wouldn't want anybody else to see that.\"\n\nBut after the indignity of being sacked by letter, it's clear there was no going back to Stereophonics. His mum, Mabel Cable, said. \"Stuart will probably end up an entrepreneur. There are so many things I know Stuart is capable of - maybe even politics.\"\n\nUnfortunately, that potential was never wholly realised. He made a name for himself presenting Saturday Night Cable in 2010, but in June 2010 he died at his house in Llwydcoed near Aberdare in the Cynon Valley."}]}
