{"Edward Synge was a friend of the philosopher Edmund Burke.": [{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/burke/", "page_content": "First published Mon Feb 23, 2004; substantive revision Sun May 24, 2020\n\nEdmund Burke, author of Reflections on the Revolution in France, is known to a wide public as a classic political thinker: it is less well understood that his intellectual achievement depended upon his understanding of philosophy and use of it in the practical writings and speeches by which he is chiefly known. The present essay explores the character and significance of the use of philosophy in his political thought. That thought is of the very first importance for intellectual history and for the conduct of politics. This essay is the first attempt to examine its philosophical character and to connect the latter with Burke\u2019s political activity. In doing so it shows the importance of the philosophical elements in Burke\u2019s thought and that these contribute important ways to his political thought.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe name of Edmund Burke (1730\u201397) [1] is not one that often figures in the history of philosophy .[2] This is a curious fate for a writer of genius who was also the author of a book entitled A Philosophical Enquiry. Besides the Enquiry, Burke\u2019s writings and some of his speeches contain strongly philosophical elements\u2014philosophical both in our contemporary sense and in the eighteenth century sense, especially \u2018philosophical\u2019 history. These elements play a fundamental role within his work, and help us to understand why Burke is a political classic. His writings and speeches therefore merit attention as examples of attention to both ideas and to history, and of the role of this attention in practical thought. His work is also, as we see shall see at the end of this entry, an achievement that challenges assumptions held by many of our contemporaries. One way or another, then, Burke is a vitally important figure. Yet there is very little academic writing about Burke and philosophy outside of that Enquiry. This is a significant omission from the history of political thought, for at least three reasons. One is that though much has been written about Burke, including work placing him in relation to other political writers, yet how he thought has not been made clear. A second is that the rational content of his thinking has not been made evident, precisely because its philosophical component has not been identified. Thirdly, because the manner and content of his thought have not been identified in the way the case warrants, we read of Burke\u2019s \u2018mystic spirit\u2019 (Spurgeon 1922, p. 100) or the \u2018irrationalism\u2019 of his writing (Butler 1984, p. 35). This matters not only with respect to historical truth, important though that is, but also because Burke is sometimes treated as a symbolic or instructive figure for contemporary political action (cf., e.g., Norman 2013), and in significant ways marks an instructive contrast with some current ways of thinking. This being so, it is especially important to get the historical figure right.\n\n2. Life\n\nBurke was born at Dublin in Ireland, then part of the British Empire, the son of a prosperous attorney, and, after an early education at home, became a boarder at the school run by Abraham Shackleton, a Quaker from Yorkshire, at Ballitore in County Kildare. Burke received his university education at Trinity College, Dublin, a bastion of the Anglican Church of Ireland. Thence he proceeded to the Middle Temple at London, in order to qualify for the Bar, but legal practice was less attractive to him than the broader perspective which had captured his attention at university (or earlier). It was first as a writer, and then as a public figure that he made his career. Burke\u2019s intellectual formation did not suggest that his career would be purely philosophical. Indeed, for those without an independent income or a clerical vocation such a way of life was not very feasible in Britain or Ireland. Only the Scottish universities offered posts that did not require holy orders, but they were not very receptive to non-presbyterians. Burke married in 1756, and had a son by 1758, so that a career of Humean celibacy, in which philosophy was cultivated on a little oatmeal, was not for him.\n\nIndeed, like Hume, Burke found that there was more money in narrative works and in practical affairs than in philosophy. Burke\u2019s earliest writings include A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757), and A Vindication of Natural Society (1756). Thereafter he was co-author of An Account of the European Settlements (1757) and began An Abridgement of English History (c.1757\u201362). From 1758, at least until 1765, he was the principal \u2018conductor\u2019 of the new Annual Register. In 1765, Burke became private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham (who had just become First Lord of the Treasury) and was elected to the British House of Commons in the same year. He remained there, with a brief intermission in the Autumn of 1780, for nearly twenty-nine years, retiring in the Summer of 1794. Burke, who was always a prominent figure there and sometimes an effective persuader, gave a great many parliamentary speeches. He published versions of some of these, notably on American Taxation (1774), Conciliation with America (1775), and Fox\u2019s East India Bill (1783). These printed speeches, though anchored to specific occasions, and certainly intended to have a practical effect in British politics, were also meant to embody Burke\u2019s thought in a durable form. In that respect, they parallel his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770), and Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), amongst other non-oratorical writings.\n\nBurke\u2019s activity as a parliamentarian and political writer embraced a great many concerns. Prominent amongst these were the problems of British rule overseas, in North America, India and Ireland. His name, however, has been linked most strongly by posterity to a critique of the French Revolution. Burke was certainly more notable as a pundit than an executive politician, holding office only twice, for a few months in 1782 and 1783. His political life was punctuated in May 1791 by a break from some of his party colleagues over the significance of the Revolution. Thereafter, assisted not least by the turn it took in 1792\u20133, he became a largely independent commentator on domestic politics and international affairs in An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs (1791), Letters on a Regicide Peace (1795\u20137), and A Letter to a Noble Lord (1796). Burke in his last years, especially from 1792, turned his attention to his native Ireland. He failed to found a political dynasty, and he left no lasting school in parliamentary politics: the last politician who can be regarded plausibly as a disciple, the addressee of A Letter to William Elliot (1795), died in 1818. As Sidgwick observed, \u2018though Burke lives, we meet with no Burkites\u2019 (Sidgwick 1877 [2000, 195]). Nor did Burke bequeath a straightforward legacy to any political party or to any ideological brand of thought, though plenty have tried to appropriate him wholly or partly. The difficulties that they might find in colonising his thought are apparent from an account of it that emphasizes its philosophical aspects.\n\n3. Intellectual orientation\n\nBurke\u2019s mind, by the time he left Trinity, had two features of especial interest: one was an orientation towards religion, improvement and politics, the other a philosophical method. The latter derived from his university education, the former from reflection on the Irish situation. Burke was born into an Ireland where reflective intellect had its social setting in a small educational elite, much of it connected with the Church of Ireland. This elite contemplated a political class which owned much of the land, and consisted primarily of a gentry and peerage, headed by the King\u2019s representative, the Lord-Lieutenant; but it saw too a tiny professional class, and a huge, illiterate, impoverished peasantry. The aim of the educational elite, which it shared with some of the political class, was improvement in the broadest sense, that is to say it connected self-improvement through the influence of the arts & sciences, and through the development of intellectual skills, with moral culture and with economic development. The ability of the educated, the politicians and the rich to take constructive initiatives contrasted starkly with the inability of the peasantry to help itself: peasants relieved their misery principally through spasms of \u2018savagery\u2019 against their landlords\u2019 representatives, but such violence was repressed sternly and helped nobody. (For Burke, \u2018savagery\u2019 refers to any conduct that falls below certain standards.) The Irish situation suggested a general rationale of practice to those who wished to improve themselves and others: improvement, if it was to spread outside the educational elite, must spring from the guidance and good will of the possessing classes: from the landlord who developed his property, from the priest who instructed and consoled the poor, and from the lord lieutenant who used his power benevolently. The only obvious alternative was the use of force\u2014and that was both destructive and fruitless. Burke retained all his life a sense of the responsibility of the educated, rich and powerful to improve the lot of those whom they directed; a sense that existing arrangements were valuable insofar as they were the necessary preconditions for improvement; and a strong sense of the importance of educated people as agents for constructive change, change which he often contrasted with the use of force, whether as method or as result.\n\nThis experiental orientation of Burke\u2019s mind was turned from attitude into articulate thought through the educational medium of the Irish Enlightenment. For example, some points that may seem distinctively Burkean belonged first to Berkeley. Berkeley saw no advantages in improper abstraction or in a mythical golden age. Burke\u2019s unwillingness to judge institutions and practices without first connecting them with other things, his disinclination \u2018to give praise or blame to any thing which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a simple view of the object in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction\u2019 (RRF, W & S 1981\u20132015, viii.58), is a practical judgement that implies a conceptual counterpart like Berkeley\u2019s view that \u2018when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities, and consider them by themselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run into great extravagancies\u2019 (Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge [1948\u201357, vol. ii, 84].) In both cases, philosophical wariness matched a distaste for considering aspects of objects in permanent isolation from the other aspects with which they were essentially connected. This suspicion of abstract ideas accompanied a suspicion of schemes for considering people in abstraction from their present situation, and accompanied too doubts about a golden past: Berkeley rejected \u2018the rude original of society\u2019 (Berkeley, The Querist [1948\u201357, vol. vi, 141]) and had no time for \u2018declaimers against prejudice\u2019 who \u2018have wrought themselves into a sort of esteem for savages, as a virtuous and unprejudiced people\u2019 (Berkeley, Discourse addressed to Magistrates [1948\u201357, vol. vi, 206]), and it need not be emphasized that Burke shared such views. Both belonged to an elite which considered improvement to be necessary, and sought to make it through the agencies in church, state and education that were really available at the time. Above all, they shared an intellectual temper: they sought to see things how they are, with an eye to bettering the condition of society. But Burke was not Berkeley, and though their similarities indicate a shared philosophical orientation, Burke had his own way of developing it. To individuate him, we must turn to what he acquired from the Trinity syllabus, and how he used his acquisitions.\n\nThis syllabus, by the time Burke became an undergraduate student at the age of fifteen (1744), not only gave attention to Aristotelian manuals but also to \u2018the way of ideas\u2019 enshrined in Locke\u2019s Essay concerning Human Understanding. Such a syllabus, in its Aristotelian aspect, indicated the unity of all departments of literature\u2014or learning as we now call it \u2014 which was congenial to one with Burke\u2019s passion for knowledge \u2014 he wrote of his furor mathematicus, furor logicus, furor historicus, and furor poeticus. [3] It also indicated the range of achievements, and the range of needs, that people had generated. The extent and variety of human activity impressed itself upon Burke. If his practical situation in Ireland suggested that not reason alone but also Christianity and persuasion were necessary to improvement, Burke could now understand these needs in terms of a scheme of learning, and indeed had the opportunity to develop the corresponding skills. At Trinity he founded a debating society, where he developed his oratorical technique on theological, moral and political topics, as well as commenting on the economic and literary life of Ireland in a periodical run by himself and his friends. This acquisition of skills was complemented by an opportunity for philosophical development. This applied in particular to Burke\u2019s antecedent bent towards the imaginative branches of literature, especially romances of chivalry, such as the Faerie Queen by Edmund Spenser (the collateral ancestor from whom he derived his Christian name). Creations of alternative worlds by the mind now received a philosophical warrant from another part of the Trinity syllabus. Locke had recognized that the mind devised complex ideas. The mind had a power to receive simple ideas from the senses and from its own reflection on them, and to make out of this material further ideas that had no referent in the world of sensation. Burke\u2019s interest did not extend to the centaurs that Locke had mentioned, but the ability to make complex ideas and to assemble them in new ways was central to Burke\u2019s way of proceeding. His philosophical method involved thinking in terms of complex ideas about a connected range of matters, matters connected by their place in a programme of human improvement. Reason was fundamental to this method\u2014but not reason alone, as we see in Burke\u2019s sole work devoted wholly to philosophy, which made use of Locke on the way to an original destination.\n\n4. Philosophical and Historical Writings\n\nLocke\u2019s Essay concerning Human Understanding of 1690 was the first attempt to give a survey of the mind\u2019s workings that was both comprehensive and post-aristotelian. It soon fostered intense interest in epistemology, psychology and ethics. Burke seems to have worked on the imagination\u2014the faculty of devising and combining ideas \u2014 as an undergraduate, and continued to do so into the 1750s. The result, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) emphasized, unsurprisingly, the activity of mind in making ideas and the influence of these upon conduct. It was in the first place an exercise in clarifying ideas, with an eye to refining the ways in which the arts affect the passions: in other words, a refinement of complex ideas was taken to be the precondition of a refinement of practice.\n\nThe roots of human activity, Burke thought, were the passions of curiosity, pleasure and pain. Curiosity stimulated the activity of mind on all matters. Ideas of pain and of pleasure corresponded respectively to self-preservation and society, and society involved the passions of sympathy, imitation and ambition. Imitation tended to establish habit, and ambition to produce change. Sympathy did neither, but it did establish an interest in other people\u2019s welfare that extended to mental identification with them. The scope of sympathy could embrace anyone, unlike compassion, which applied only to those in a worse situation than oneself. Such width of concern had an obvious reference to the social order (and may express also Burke\u2019s thinking about the theatre). The passions, understood in Burke\u2019s way, suggested at once that society as such answered to natural instincts, and that it comprised elements of continuity and improvement alike. Burke then proceeded to show that self-preservation and its cognates suggested the complex idea of the sublime, and not least the idea of a God who was both active and terrible. Beauty, on the other hand, comprised a very different set of simple ideas, which originated in pleasure. Sublime and beautiful therefore sprang from very different origins.\n\nThe diverse views rejected by A Philosophical Enquiry were united by the pervasive assumption that human nature in an unschooled condition, as it came from the hand of nature, and understood without direct reference to God, was in some sense adequate to the human condition. Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality was at odds with Burke\u2019s view of the naturalness of society, and with his view that solitude, because unnatural, was a source of pain, as well as with Burke\u2019s position that sympathy, rather than merely compassion, was a key emotion. Burke\u2019s view that the mind formed ideas of beauty from the ideas of pleasure it received contradicted the view of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson that beauty (like goodness) was a perception presented by a sixth or moral sense. Burke\u2019s further view that our simple ideas of pain went towards a complex idea of a God who inspired terror, was very distant from the deists\u2019 view that He could be understood by our natural faculty of reason alone and that as such He was known to be benevolent and not much besides. These three positions alike presumed that human faculties, unimproved by human effort and considered with little relation to God, were sufficient to inspire conduct. It is not surprising that Burke rejected them.\n\nBurke not only thought that nature needed improvement, but also recognized its ambiguity. Ambition, for instance, was the source of enterprise and of improvement: but Burke did not suppose that the enterprise produced by this characteristic was in all its manifestations a benefit to its exponent, and indeed once called it \u2018the cause of the greatest disappointments, miseries and misfortunes, and sometimes of dangerous immoralities\u2019 [4]. If Burke had a forward-looking mind, and believed that human nature both required and led to development, he did not think that progress was necessarily an unqualified gain: for instance, in discussing the civilizing of American \u2018savages,\u2019 he saw a diminution of their courage as well as an increase in their moral goodness. (For Burke, \u2018savagery\u2019 contrasts with civilisation, and unlike some other figures, did not suppose that savagery was equivalent to all behaviour of indigenous peoples).\n\nA Philosophical Enquiry suggests that Burke was developing the loyalties of his youth through the medium of philosophical psychology. A God who presents Himself through nature in a way that is often found in the Bible, and who devises and sustains nature in a way that leads man to society and facilitates the improvement of that society, has set Himself to support Christianity, power and improvement, and probably education too. At the same time, however, other aspects of the book suggest that this support was delivered to them, not on their own terms, but on the terms of a philosophy which recognizes the ability of the imagination to transform people\u2019s understandings of themselves and society.\n\nAnyone who thinks in terms of complex ideas can see that these can be framed easily in different ways, none of which need correspond to anything found in the external world: combine the ideas of a man and a horse, as Locke had suggested, and you have the idea of a centaur. No one who reads romances would find difficulty in imagining a society differing beyond recognition from its current arrangements. A classic instance of political imagination, indeed, is Burke\u2019s own Vindication of Natural Society, which presents as an alternative model of society an organization\u2014if that is the word\u2014devoid of civil government, church and significant private property.\n\nBurke, in other words, could think through not only his own grouping of claims but also their opposites. This reflects, no doubt, other features of his mind apart from his understanding of complex ideas, such as the skill in seeing the strong side and the obverse of any argument, which Burke had acquired in his undergraduate study of rhetoric; and it reflects, too, a habit of versatility begun in his debating society, for there speakers were called upon to play roles; and no doubt it is reminiscent, again, of Burke\u2019s undergraduate interest in the theatre. Yet beyond all of these, it suggests that in the large topics which experience had put before Burke\u2014religion, morals, arts and sciences\u2014argument had not produced an overwhelmingly decisive case. For A Vindication also seems to make a case against everything he had espoused.\n\nIf argument did not deliver incontestable conclusions, where was one to go? Burke\u2019s answer, in his notes, was that where this was so, people should prefer the conclusions that accorded with their natural feelings. The complement to this emphasis upon feeling was to look to the results of affective preference\u2014that is to say, a criterion for conduct in such a case was what tended to make people better and happier.\n\nThis was a judgement in the first place about personal conduct, and the manner of applying it to matters on the larger scale of civil society was less obvious. Here the judgement of benefit, whether ethical or pleasurable, might be harder to discern. In order to make it plain in A Vindication, Burke applied a reductio ad absurdum to principles in theology that he had rejected by showing their consequences for politics.\n\nFor that is what A Vindication provided. This short work was written in the persona of the recently deceased Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke (1678\u20131751). Bolingbroke had been a Tory pillar of the state, and therefore of the church too; but the posthumous publication of his philosophical works revealed that far from being an Anglican, he had not been a Christian\u2014but rather a deist. A Vindication suggested the ills that Bolingbroke had attributed to the artifice of revealed religion could be paralleled by those generated by civil society. One logic, indeed, was attributable on these terms to both Christianity and civil society: that just as the latter distributed the means of power unequally, so too did Christianity distribute those of salvation unequally (for not everyone had heard, and fewer believed, the Gospel). The deism of Bolingbroke implied the principle that God treated everyone impartially, and that the means to salvation were therefore to be found in a medium available to all, and thus available from the earliest point of human history, namely reason. It was easy to add, as Burke did, that if the principle that such an original nature was the mature expression of God\u2019s ordinances were to be applied to civil society, the normative result would be a regression from complex and therefore civilised forms to a simple society, even to animal-like primitiveness\u2014some of the matter of A Vindication paraphrases Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality (Sewell 1938, 97\u2013114). So Bolingbroke the deist and Bolingbroke the politician could be made to look very much at odds with each other. This gap offered Burke an opening. A Vindication satirized Bolingbroke\u2019s schizophrenic position, employing a good deal of transparent exaggeration to make \u2018his\u2019 criticisms of civil (\u2018artificial\u2019) society seem very absurd: and Burke added a preface to the second edition which made the disjunctive alternatives clear so that even he who ran might read.\n\nYet it is hard not to recognize that Burke himself was telling the reader, in a way that entered the consciousness all the more forcibly because it accompanied entertainment, that civil society really did involve some evils, just as he identified losses as well as gains from progress in other connexions. Burke\u2019s Vindication, speaking in the voice of pseudo-Bolingbroke, lamented the situation of miners: and \u2018the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly, unmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations\u2019 of \u2018so many wretches\u2019 was lamented by Burke without any such persona, thirty-four years later in Reflections on the Revolution in France. Such criticism, taken in itself, is undoubtedly telling. Burke never dissembled the existence of the real misery that he observed in civil society. Instead, he pointed out that wretched practices could not be detached from the larger pattern of habits and institution in which they were implicated, and that this pattern had a beneficial effect overall. Burke recognized misery, did not deny it, and therefore had a lively sense of the imperfection of arrangements, however civilized they might be. His sense of duality in nature and society resembles Adam Smith\u2019s.\n\nBurke\u2019s position, therefore, was poised. But it was not merely a matter of pointing out what made for good and what for ill in civil society: it was a matter of responsibility\u2014of choosing morally appropriate words. This was so for a philosophical reason, because of the very nature of the words involved. Burke\u2019s Philosophical Enquiry divided words into three categories. First, there were aggregate words, which signified groups of simple ideas united by nature, e.g. man, horse, or tree. Second, there were simple abstract words, each of which stood for one simple idea involved in such unities, as red, blue, round or square. Thirdly, and most importantly for our purpose, came abstract compound words. These united aggregate words and simple abstract words. As such, they did not have a referent that existed in nature. A Philosophical Enquiry argued that no compound abstract nouns suggested ideas to the mind at all readily, and that in many cases they did not correspond to any idea at all, but instead produced in the mind only images of past experience connected with these words. This category included virtue, vice, justice, honour, and liberty, besides magistrate, docility and persuasion (Wecter 1940, 167\u201381). The centrality of such terms to a discussion of civil society requires no emphasis. The obvious inference from Burke\u2019s philosophy of language was that to use abstract compound words was less to discuss ideas than to raise images which touched the affections of the listener or reader. To do this could scarcely to be thought part of a speculative activity: the effect would not be cognitive, but practical: not to develop ideas, but to influence conduct. The question was, with what arrangements were these words, and therefore pleasurable images, to be connected.\n\nThis understanding of the mind gave speakers and writers an unusually powerful role. It was in their hands to connect words which suggested pro-attitudes with arrangements of their choosing: for these words had did not imply only one set of conceptual contents, because they implied none. If one recollects the propensity to imitation that Burke found in mankind, this choosing was likely also to be leading. So Burke was exceptionally sensitive to the role of men of letters and public speakers in moulding opinion. By the same measure, he had an unusually lively sense of their responsibilities. It was they who had the power to guide people to the proper ends, or elsewhere. Guidance need not be directly didactic\u2014indeed, it could not be, because there could be no definitions to expound \u2014 but would be a matter of providing a linguistic context which guided listeners and readers to goals that were ethically and politically beneficial.\n\nOne crucial approach that Burke himself developed was historiographical. In works of history or in oratory, discussion involving a compound abstract noun\u2014such as \u2018civilization\u2019 or \u2018liberty\u2019\u2014 could take place in connexion with aggregate words like \u2018Indians\u2019 or \u2018the English\u2019, and, therefore, being discussed in relation to these, connected that noun with definite ideas rather than with further ideas that had no easily identifiable content\u2014or no content at all. Almost all of Burke\u2019s writings and his more important speeches have a strong historical element. That element is cast as a narrative in a way that connects compound abstract words with specific persons and specific transactions. Burke also wrote avowedly historical works in the years immediately after publishing A Philosophical Enquiry The content of these histories developed the preferences of his youth for improvement by embodying these in a way that made them integral to the origins and continuing character of modern arrangements in the Americas and in England.\n\nBurke, like Smith again, wrote \u2018philosophical\u2019 history, that is to say gave a view of the key agencies that had shaped human destiny over the long run of human society. Indeed, he casually implied a four-stage theory of socio-economic history at a time when Scottish stadial history, except that in Dalrymple\u2019s Feudal Property (1757), was either unwritten or unpublished. But his attention, primarily, lay elsewhere, as appears in An Account of the European Settlements. This work arose from the initiative of \u2018booksellers\u2019 alive to the reading public\u2019s interest in North America, where Britain was then at war with France, and the work was co-written with Burke\u2019s \u2018cousin\u2019 and friend William Burke. Edmund\u2019s pen is evident in the passages which contrast \u2018savagery\u2019 with civilization. The book emphasized that the coming of Europeans to the New World brought with it a civilizing of \u2018savages,\u2019 who were far from noble, through the agency of institutionalised Christianity. This implicit distance from the cult of \u2018the noble savage,\u2019 and from primitivism in general, provided an identifiable complement to the implied rejections of A Philosophical Enquiry and the satire about \u2018natural society\u2019 in A Vindication.\n\nA stage of human history rather later than that of \u2018savages\u2019 was delineated within An Abridgement of English History, which Burke wrote after 1757, but did not finish. So far as it goes, this provided a continuous account that ran from the Roman landings to Magna Carta. Christianity figured again in this narrative as a source of civilization, but the significance of the tale was more complex. This time the story was primarily political, and showed how one of the values most prized by Burke\u2019s contemporaries, civil liberty, came to belong to England. The Norman Conquest of England established a powerful executive government and brought with it a uniform system of law; if these two were necessary conditions for the matching grace of civil liberty for all, however, they were not sufficient: the required addition came from an aristocracy, which had been taught the value of liberty by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and which had come to understand that its own power was insufficient to extract the requisite concessions from the crown unless popular support could be won. Burke\u2019s sense of the double-edged character of civilization thus developed into a sense that the political regime required by an advanced society\u2014the combination of strong institutions with civil liberty\u2014came from sources that were contrary to each other, and not always beneficial in isolation (aristocracy as a form of government was an \u2018austere and insolent domination\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015, ii. 268)): and as both a strong executive and civil liberty were needed, by the same token the forces making for each needed to be counterbalanced from the other side on a continuing basis. This balance of forces characterised a situation in which \u2018liberty\u2019 had an identifiable content, namely the specific civil liberties secured through political struggle and written into Magna Carta.\n\nBurke\u2019s narratives suggested that agencies antipathetic to each other, if properly connected to one another, might produce results that were both intelligible and valuable. One effect amongst several of this conception of cooperative conflict was a rehabilitation of the Roman Catholicism that was the historic heritage of Burke\u2019s family. An Account and An Abridgement alike suggested that in its historical time and place Roman Catholicism, and, indeed, clericalism, whether embodied in Jesuit missionaries or in an English archbishop, had been a constituent needed to produce social and political benefits of a fundamental kind. As an historiographical exemplar, An Abridgement therefore showed an exceptional appreciation of the Middle Ages, which was to cause raptures to Lord Acton. It anticipated both Richard Hurd\u2019s Letters on Chivalry and Romance (1762), and, still more, a great work that set the bearings for Anglo-American medievalists for many years, William Stubbs\u2019 Constitutional History of England (1875\u20138). Burke, however, could not think in terms of an academic historiography, still less one that would be the exclusive intellectual preoccupation of its exponents: neither of these existed in his time. He could think, however, of subtly defusing anti-Roman prejudice in Georgian Britain.\n\nBurke himself was not a Roman Catholic, and viewed enquiry into his personal background with alarm and suspicion. This was sensible enough in a Britain which still subliminally linked civil liberty with Protestantism, and therefore regarded Irishness as a likely pointer to popish subversion of its political values. Burke\u2019s argumentative stance always benefited Roman Catholics, but he never found a kind word for the Pope: his was a position which emphasized the priority of civil interests over denominational claims in civil society. Indeed Burke considered that \u2018the truth of our common Christianity, is not so clear as this proposition: that all men, at least the majority of men in the society, ought to enjoy the common advantages of it.\u2019 (TPL, W & S 1981\u20132015, ix.464). This was a political development of the centrality he gave to the claims of improvement, and of the obvious necessity of its free development for the bettering of the human condition. It also silently defused any papal claim to civil dominance on theological grounds and, more audibly, suggested that the penalisation of Roman Catholic beliefs was wrong if these did not cause Catholics to interfere with others\u2018 civil interests. Burke\u2019s presumptions about the priority of civil interests and a sense of the possible irrelevance of denominational opinion to civil society suggest a reading of Locke\u2019s Letter concerning Toleration and Two Treatises of Government, the latter of which was common, though not prescribed reading at Trinity. It also implies that the proper terms in which to conceive civil interests are those of natural jurisprudence, because there people are considered without reference to any specific allegiances, religious or otherwise. Burke referred to natural law and natural rights directly when such reference advanced his own arguments, though he made no theoretical contribution to natural jurisprudence until quite late in life. His creative energies were mostly applied elsewhere.\n\nBurke developed his thoughts about civil interests in a work that his executors entitled Tracts on the Popery Laws, which he drafted when he was employed as private secretary to the Chief Secretary for Ireland in the early seventeen-sixties. After this, Burke became involved more immediately in political practice, and, by one means or another, contributed to it until his death and (through the activities of his executors in publishing or reprinting his writings) from beyond the grave. This was one obvious route for practical development, even besides the amenities of status that it brought to Burke. For his view of the compound abstract words involved in civil discussion did not suggest that purely speculative study had unlimited potential either for the mind or for personal satisfaction, because a strictly speculative discussion was likely to be inconclusive at best: such words became more readily intelligible in connexion with the concrete, and therefore the practical. Hence, perhaps, Burke concluded that \u2018man is made for Speculation and action; and when he pursues his nature he succeeds best in both.\u2019 (Somerset 1957, 87). There was, on this understanding, intellectual benefit in political participation, and, equally, political practice might benefit from the speculative mind. This is likely to seem an implausible position nowadays, when political activity is frenetic, and learning is a matter of speciality; but in the eighteenth century, when an agile mind could manage at least the basics of several branches of learning, and the British legislature was often in session for less than six months each year, it was more plausible. Political participation, on Burke\u2019s understanding, besides its intellectual possibilities, had an ethical potential. To the extent that thinking about politics was necessarily uncertain, the proper conduct of affairs depended upon an honest as well as a capacious mind, and on a well-disposed management of words.\n\nIt remains to show what Burke learnt from political activity, and what he conferred upon it. The picture is one in which the claims of practice enriched Burke\u2019s mind and brought intellectual benefits to practice itself.\n\n5. Political style: some parliamentary applications\n\nBurke\u2019s life was spent in parliamentary affairs from the mid-1760s, and this made a difference to his style of intellectual activity. This did not lie primarily in developing the cast of his mind, and if in 1771 Burke stated that \u2018I have endeavoured all my life to train my understanding and my temper in the studies and habits of Philosophy\u2019, at the same time he concluded that \u2018my Principles are all settled and arranged\u2019 .[5] This did not preclude intellectual innovation. The difference made by participation lay not least in his reasons for applying his mind, and consequently in how he did so. The reasons were to influence opinion, both in Parliament and from his position as a member of the legislative, and to determine votes in the House of Commons itself. The matter common to both of these was Burke\u2019s view that words were central to political understanding.\n\nAn obvious inference from Burke\u2019s account of compound abstract words is that to use these is to touch the experience of reader or listener, and that persuasion was unavoidably central to discussing politics: this befitted a practical rather than a speculative subject. Indeed, these terms implied that the point of discussing politics must be to influence action, and nothing much else. Burke developed great skill in managing words, begun in debating at Trinity and carried forward at other venues, including the House of Commons. As such language was persuasive, its objective was to establish pro-attitudes and con-attitudes in mind of listener or reader.\n\nThis was not the only philosophical aspect in Burke\u2019s political practice. A major conceptual tool in discussing politics was relation. Relation is one of those terms which was common to both the scholastics and Locke. It denotes both comparison and connexion. Comparison was an invaluable procedure because it enabled events, institutions and persons to be placed in any number of lights which would raise or lower their significance and standing. Connexion was scarcely less valuable, because the place that someone or something occupied could be used to sustain or criticise their role, as well as to demonstrate the value of co-operative contraries. Best of all, relation in either sense lent itself to a myriad of uses, for as LeClerc had remarked in his Logic (which Burke had read at Trinity) relations were beyond counting\u2014sunt autem innumerae relationes (Le Clerc 1692, pt. 1, ch. 4, s. 1, p. 19).\n\nBurke\u2019s conception of philosophical history was also fundamental to his political practice. \u2018Every age has its own manners and its politicks dependent upon them\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015, ii 258.) The manners Burke saw around him in England were continuous with those he had seen in the middle ages, or projected backwards thither, in which a powerful executive government was balanced by other agencies with the effect of securing civil liberty. Those agencies most obvious in Burke\u2019s time had established the sovereignty of Parliament at the Glorious Revolution (1688\u20139), implied it in the Bill of Rights (1689), exercised it in the Act of Settlement (1701), and confirmed it by suppressing the attempts made from 1708 to 1746 to reassert the sovereignty of kings alone. Burke understood law in this arrangement as the guarantor of interests of the governed because it was law passed and secured by Parliament. It was secured in Parliament by the mutual dependence of Commons, Lords and King. That sovereignty had this public character made the British state a beneficiary of a very high degree of financial credit, and this increased the power of Parliament. The long, slow movement of British history from a conception of the realm understood as royal property to the state conceived as the expression of public will had in Burke\u2019s time reached a stage at which this will was expressed through the decisions of Parliament in a manner heavily influenced by the monarch. Burke\u2019s political activities therefore assumed parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nIf Burke\u2019s view of words and relations gave him practical tools, and if parliamentary sovereignty provided him with a practical postulate, what did he assume was the proper end of sovereignty? We have seen that the relation between sovereign and the governed had for a primary purpose the protection of the latter\u2019s civil interests. This much suggests continuity between Burke the philosopher/historian and Burke the political participant. But the former might also see that there were complications for the latter. One who sees the multiplicity of civil interests, and the variety of relations in which they can be considered, and the variety of contraries at work, will see that to put society at ease with itself may well imply conflict and see that such conflict is hard to avoid; he or she will see, too, that Parliament forms an arena for conducting it in a stylised and moderated way through the representation of interests, appropriate to a civilized state of society; and, even while participating in such a conflict, s/he might recognizes the necessity of both sides to the result. Here, opponents may be not only enemies but also co-workers, sharing at least some common assumptions about the system within which their lot was cast, although separated from others by the role required of them. In that situation, the question becomes, where do you take your place? The answer may depend on your own connexions, and on how you conceive them.\n\n6. Burke\u2019s practical reasoning\n\nLet us turn to how Burke\u2019s thinking was informed by his philosophical thinking, especially to his use of relation. Burke\u2019s method for written composition often combined (i) identification of relations, with (ii) relevant history, and (iii) treatment in language that would attach pro-attitudes to one side or the other in a difference of opinion. This method is seen, for instance, in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770). Its central statement for our purpose is about (i) relation in the form of connexion: that the British constitution had been constructed in a manner that required the connexion (in this case the interdependence) of the parts of the sovereign in order to achieve mutual control. This statement contrasted with (ii) the historical statement that there was a new system of court politics which involved disconnecting those parts in order to make the monarch independent of the other parts of the political sovereign. Burke\u2019s history showed the emergence of this new system, and illustrated its pernicious results in both domestic and foreign affairs. The contrast (iii) between the older system \u2014 which was represented as having benign results\u2014was clear, and the disposition of pro-language obvious enough. Burke\u2019s appeal lay to the standards which his contemporaries would take for granted, namely those implied in their beliefs about parliamentary sovereignty. As if it were not enough, the picture of the older order was reinforced by a sense of connexion in the Aristotelian sense that Burke\u2019s society recognized and approved\u2014that man was sociable, rather than being a solitary beast, and above all by the annexation of the key term of connexion to the side of the dispute that Burke favoured. All of these considerations suggested the appropriateness of \u2018the good\u2019 combining to counterbalance the efforts of court politicians, and so to sustain parliamentary sovereignty and its benefits.\n\nThis illustrates Burke\u2019s remarkable ability to combine philosophical method and philosophical history, as well as the practical purpose to which he put them\u2014forming an understanding of politics which was practical in the very particular sense of calling for activity in one direction to counterbalance forces coming from another. It was also practical in relation to advancing very specific interests. These considerations were used to situate quite another sense of connexion, namely political party, and especially the party of Lord Rockingham to which and to whom Burke had attached himself. Indeed Present Discontents was read in draft by his party\u2019s leading lights before publication. On publication, the pamphlet was widely understood as a manifesto for this party. After publication Present Discontents became a manual from which fledging politicians learnt the rationale of their party, and, indeed, a source book for cat calls from the party colleagues from whom Burke separated in 1791. The philosophical and historical element in Burke\u2019s positions is evident only to those who retrace all of his steps; an activity which his contemporaries lacked the will, and (as not all of his major works had been published) some of the means to do.\n\nThe educative effect of Burke\u2019s writing is not to be underestimated in a civil society, which boasted many highly literate members but had very few with any formal education in political science (except, sometimes, at Scottish universities). Indeed, it is likely that Burke wrote in order to educate. Yet at the same time that the strength of his conceptual and historical arguments, and the skill with which he developed these, excites the reader\u2019s admiration, they create unease. This is not merely because in Present Discontents the philosophical sense of connexion is used to adumbrate the claims of a party connexion: it is a more generalized disquiet. A politician inspires confidence, in part, because s/he is honest: and a good way to be thought honest is to convey the impression that you are not clever enough to deceive. As a philosopher commands interest when s/he is intellectually powerful, this impression is one that is naturally hard to achieve: but it can be done. C.D. Broad suggested that \u2018Locke, we feel, is not so much cleverer than ourselves as to be capable of playing tricks with us even if he wanted to do so. He is the Mr Baldwin [6] of philosophy, and he derives from his literary style some of the advantages which that statesman owed to his pipe and his pigs.\u2019 (Broad 1952, 39). This judgement does not apply to Burke, even though he did keep pigs. The reader carries away from Burke a sense of great creative power, dialectical skill, and verbal ingenuity: in short, a sense of being overborne by intellectual force. The listener probably received other and unwelcome sensations when these were seconded by personal raucousness. Such feelings generate unease, and unease is increased by Burke\u2019s prose.\n\nHis literary style is to argue clearly, but in doing so to include a manifest carefulness of qualification that will permit subsequent shifts of position\u2014for instance his self-description as a \u2018true but severe friend to monarchy\u2019 is consistent with his occupying any point within the generous spectrum of parliamentary sovereignty\u2014and, indeed, the sense of historical change which pervades Present Discontents suggests that movement is a common experience. Unease, perhaps, is increased even further: for against one equipped with this intellectual repertoire, the accusation of inconsistency is irresistibly tempting and utterly useless. Again, Burke\u2019s is a very sensible way for a statesman to think, but it is not how the public wishes politicians to appear on most occasions. Still less is it reassuring about Burke\u2019s intellectual bona fides: for this is not how people innocent of political experience, who are the majority, conceive the role of political principles. Coleridge put his finger on an important point when he suggested that from \u2018principles exactly the same\u2019 Burke could draw \u2018practical inferences almost opposite\u2019 in different situations (Coleridge, Biographica Literaria, vol. i, 191). Burke\u2019s philosophical and historical positions are clear, but they do not translate, and were not meant to translate, into a set of specific practical conclusions of permanent validity.\n\nThere was the contrast, too, between the breadth of view and of learning in the matured statements that Burke published, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ways of the parliamentary pugilist who was audible to fellow M.P.s and legible to others in the speeches reported by the daily newspapers. Burke\u2019s manner was anything but \u2018philosophical\u2019 as the public understands the word. Partly this was, doubtless, because Burke was like that as a person, and not least because he had a weak voice that had to be raised if it was to be heard in the bear garden that was the House of Commons, but partly, too, because his Philosophical Enquiry had suggested that the best way to impart a mood to an audience was to display it oneself. So, for instance, if Burke needed to plead for moderation, he did so immoderately. Above all, perhaps, it was because this philosopher- turned-participant was not exempt from the need to win to his side enough minds to ensure that his side was not beaten (or, at any rate, demonstrated enough strength to remain in contention), and had at hand an exceptionally powerful range of persuasive tools. It is an evident fact, too, that the resources of Western civilization were sometimes invoked by Burke in order to produce votes in the House of Commons\u2014votes, which, whatever else they were, were in the interests of his party. But, manifestly, these resources do not supply a rationale for only one policy, still less for only one party. The roles of thinker and party spokesman consort ill: and there were bound to be doubts about one\n\nWho born for the Universe, narrow\u2019d his mind,\n\nAnd to party gave up, what was meant for mankind.\n\nTho\u2019 fraught with all learning, kept straining his throat,\n\nTo persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.\n\n(Goldsmith, lines 31\u201334).\n\nAn apparent disruption of this sort was always likely to suggest that Burke had profoundly personal motives for narrowing his mind, and when he was not being caricatured as an Irish Jesuit he was being satirized as a corrupt hack [7]. Yet some sort of procedure of the type pursued by Burke was implied in his sense of practical reasoning. The \u2018philosopher in action\u2019 had the function of finding \u2018proper means\u2019 to \u2018the proper ends of Government\u2019 marked out by \u2018the speculative philosopher\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015, ii. 45\u201351). Parliamentary votes, in the situation that Burke found himself, were amongst the proper means.\n\n7. Burke and the American Revolution\n\nPolitical participation generated scepticism about Burke as a person, some of which was unjust, though all of it was to be expected. What was perhaps less predictable, and is certainly more interesting philosophically, is that this participation was a precondition of the practical thought which made Burke famous in his own time and has given him a leading place in the canon of Western political thought. One very important example of this is his treatment of the American Revolution. This was informed, no doubt, by where Burke happened to find himself on the spectrum of practical politics in the years that followed 1766. But his conclusions for practice were informed also by his understanding of ideas \u2013 meaning ideas in a philosophical, precisely in a Lockean sense \u2013 and how these could be combined. In other words, the content of his political thought was informed importantly not only by where he was practically but also who he was philosophically.\n\nBurke\u2019s practical thinking about the dispute between the British parliament and its North American colonies began with a situation not of his making, that is to say the rejection of the Stamp Act by the colonists, and its withdrawal by the ministry headed by Lord Rockingham in 1765\u20136. The Rockingham ministry followed up this concession by way of letting the colonists alone with the explicit assertion of Parliament\u2019s right to legislate for the colonies in the Declaratory Act of 1766. Burke\u2019s task was to demonstrate to the House of Commons the plausibility of this package. He did so by combining two complex ideas\u2014or at least two abstract compound nouns\u2014in a new way. One idea was empire, which involved command. The other was liberty. These, Burke thought, were ideas difficult to combine\u2014a sound reflection as they are diametrically opposed\u2014but that they were combinable in the further idea of a British empire\u2014one which combined legislative command with civil liberty. This idea implied letting alone certain matters of concern to the colonists, and so allowing them in some respects civil liberty on a de facto basis (SDR, W & S 1981\u20132015, ii. 317\u201318). This idea is considerably more ingenious than the average British position that \u2018all the dominions of Great Britain are bound by Acts of Parliament\u2019 .[8] Burke\u2019s view was explanatory, because it conceptualised the situation before Parliament in a way that made intelligible the points involved and established a connexion amongst them. It was also accommodating, because it made the British executive\u2019s policy intellectually and therefore practically respectable at the same time that it made room for colonial preferences. In short, it was a small masterpiece of thinking about policy.\n\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was followed by the passing of the Declaratory Act. Burke was practically successful in 1766 with the House of Commons because he was speaking for the executive, and a majority amongst Members of Parliament, ceteris paribus, tended to vote for the king\u2019s ministers. In 1774 and 1775 he was practically unsuccessful, because he was now in opposition, but his conceptual achievement in dealing with the American question became much greater. By 1774, the issues dividing some American colonists from Parliament had changed. The former now resented the attempts of the latter to levy taxation on them directly, rather than by the authority of their own colonial legislatures, and they resented still more the project of backing the attempt, if need be, with coercion. Burke\u2019s speech of 1774 on American Taxation did not delete the idea of imperial command, but rather elaborated his complex idea of the British empire in a new way in order to deal with the new situation.\n\nBurke elaborated the complex idea in a way to which complex ideas lend themselves, that is to say, by adding a qualification. The sovereignty of the British parliament was an idea that certainly included a right to tax: but a right to tax could be understood to be consistent on principle with inaction as well as action. The right, in plainer language, need not be applied. Burke could accommodate, therefore, both the claims of Westminster and those of the colonists. To this point, of course, one might reply that Burke was merely making concessions. But observe: this situation provided a cue for conceptual innovation\u2014Burke inserted a distinction into the idea of sovereignty. He distinguished \u2018my idea of the constitution of the British Empire\u2019 from \u2018the constitution of Britain\u2019 unconnected with overseas rule. It could be inferred that\n\nThe Parliament of Great Britain sits at the head of her extensive empire in two capacities: one of the local legislature of this island, providing for all things at home\u2026The other\u2026is what I call her imperial character, in which\u2026she superintends all the several inferior legislatures, and guides, and controls them all without annihilating any. As all these provincial legislatures are only co-ordinate to each other, they ought all to be subordinate to her\u2026.It is necessary to coerce the negligent, to restrain the violent, and to aid the weak and deficient, by the over-ruling plenitude of her power. She is never to intrude into the place of the others, whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable parliament to answer all these ends of provident and beneficent superintendence, her powers must be boundless\n\nso that Burke\u2019s elaboration of the complex idea of the British empire suggests complementary roles for the British parliament and the colonial legislatures, an elaboration which would make the question of taxation irrelevant at a stroke, whilst simultaneously emphasizing the authority of Westminster.\n\nConceptual refinement provided a practical avenue that other, less gifted politicians had not devised. Burke\u2019s position was altogether subtler than the implied tautology of a minister\u2019s claim that \u2018to say we have a right to tax America and are never to exercise that right is ridiculous\u2019 (Sir Edward Thurlow, quoted in Gore-Brown 1953, 85), and of another politician\u2019s despairing sense that \u2018we must either insist upon their submission to the authority of the Legislature or give them up entirely to their own discretion.\u2019 .[9] These pundits, by failing to conceive a sufficiently complex idea of sovereignty and the sovereign\u2019s right to tax, failed also to see that sovereignty did not imply an unpleasant choice between abrogating this right by disuse or applying it by force.\n\nEvents soon required a further elaboration of Burke\u2019s idea of the British empire. The continued use of coercion made the colonists more, not less recalcitrant. The practical need seemed to be for terms on which they would stay, in some sense or senses, under British rule. Their crucial claim was now that their right to tax themselves by their own legislatures rested on charters from the Crown, and that they were subordinate to the Crown alone, and not to Parliament. Burke gave still closer attention to the idea of sovereignty. It would be tactless to emphasize the sovereignty of Parliament, but it would be self-defeating to withdraw it explicitly and concede a sovereign right over taxation to the colonial legislatures. So now, in Burke\u2019s speech on Conciliation with America (1775), he focussed upon only one aspect of the complex idea of a parliamentary sovereign. The latter comprised in the British instance not only Lords and Commons, but also the king. Hence, by judicious emphasis, the item acquiesced in by the colonists could do some conceptual work: \u2018my idea of an Empire\u2026is\u2026that an Empire is the aggregate of many States, under one common head; whether this head be a monarch or a presiding republick\u2019; and it was emphasized that the rights of the colonists depended on this superior, for \u2018the claim of a privilege seems rather, ex vi termini, to imply a superior power.\u2019 As to a right to tax, Burke added on a later occasion, that though it \u2018was inherent in the supreme power of society, taken as an aggregate, it did not follow that it must reside in any particular power in that society\u2019, and therefore Parliament could delegate it to local legislatures. In short, \u2018sovereignty was not in its nature an idea of abstract unity; but was capable of great complexity and infinite modifications.\u2019 (SSC, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii. 193).\n\nWhether Burke\u2019s \u2018infinite modifications\u2019 would have assisted in keeping the thirteen colonies within the fold of the British empire is unknowable, for nothing like his proposals were tried until 1778, which was too late. It is clear, however, that Burke\u2019s ability to make conceptual changes depended on his philosophical thinking. To think in terms of complex ideas is to recognize that they can be elaborated by adding further ideas; to distinguish between the roles of Parliament is to make that addition; and to analyse the powers of a parliamentary sovereign as a preface to relocating one of them is to use philosophy as a tool in practical reasoning. It is noteworthy, also, that these philosophical exercises were the means of coping, as Burke hoped, with practical changes. Neither was his work here primarily ideological, for though Burke had a practical goal in view, and at that one consistent with the Rockingham achievements of 1766, he worked philosophically to modify the conceptions in terms of which his contemporaries viewed their situation, rather than using his conceptual tools as ways of defending those conceptions without modifying them. Thus he added ideas to the stock of his day. It is fitting, though Burke\u2019s proposals were not implemented in time, and though his goal was not attained, that his American speeches figured prominently in the schools and universities of both the U.K. and the U.S.A. well into the twentieth century. Burke, after all, was suspicious of poor ideas: he concluded that \u2018one of the main causes of our present troubles\u2019 was \u2018general discourses, and vague sentiments\u2019, and urged instead study of \u2018an exact detail of particulars\u2019 (SSC, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii. 185).\n\n8. Philosophical Character of Political Disposition\n\nBurke\u2019s thinking about America also suggests a political disposition that owed something to his philosophical conceptions. Burke\u2019s complaint in American Taxation against ministers was that \u2018they have taken things\u2026without any regard to their relations or dependencies\u2019, and had \u2018no one connected view.\u2019 This was in part a straightforwardly cognitive position on which Burke laid an emphasis with prudential point: the world with which politicians dealt was complex, and to use ideas which were insufficiently complex to capture its contents and their relations was a short way to meet the rough side of reality. It was also, implicitly an ethical position: governments ought not to apply force to existing relations, at least those that were legitimate. This is, in one way, an obvious point from natural jurisprudence, and one that Burke had made transparently with respect to inroads by the government of Ireland against Catholic property. In another, and more interesting way, it reflected his view that abstract compound nouns and complex ideas evoke specific past experiences. To interfere forcibly with someone\u2019s experientially-based expectations would be to break their mental association between experience and idea or word: and so the idea or the word would become meaningless and cease to influence action. If, therefore, \u2018my hold of the Colonies, is in the close affection which grows from common names\u2019, amongst other sources that were \u2018though light as air\u2026as strong as links of iron\u2019, then \u2018let the Colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your Government;\u2014they will cling and grapple to you\u2026But let it be once understood, that your Government may be one thing, and their Privileges another; that these two things may exist without any mutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and every thing hastens to decay and dissolution.\u2019 (CWA, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii. 164). To break such mental associations was to break communities.\n\nThis point suggested that a genuinely prudent conduct of affairs would proceed without assaulting the mental associations of the governed, and, as change was omnipresent, would conduct its share under accepted names\u2014in other words, by gradual and by moderate reform of institutions and practices rather than by immediate and total replacement, which Burke stigmatised as \u2018innovation\u2019. This, indeed, was what Burke claimed to be doing in his contributions of 1780\u201382 to the recasting of the royal household. The intellectual counterpart of this prudent conduct, namely the refinement of our existing ideas, rather than replacing them, is what he had done in his revisions of the idea of sovereignty.\n\nThis style of thinking gave Burke a very lively sense of the corrosive power of new ideas. Even new questions could have unpleasant results. When the innovations of the British government unsettled the colonists, \u2018then\u2026they questioned all the parts of your legislative power; and by the battery of such questions have shaken the solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations.\u2019 The proper way to avoid such shakes to civil society was to \u2018consult and follow your experience\u2019 (ATX, W & S 1981\u20132015, ii.411, 457), for \u2018experience\u2019 according to Burke\u2019s philosophy of language was a condition of continuity of mind, and, on the basis of mind, of a sustainable practice. His was therefore a philosophically conditioned attitude to practice, and one that was very sensitive to the hiatus that speculation could cause in the latter. Burke\u2019s sensitivity can produce apodictic language in order to persuade people to make use of the ideas they have inherited, by urging \u2018a total renunciation of every speculation of my own; and\u2026 [by recommending] a profound reverence for the wisdom of our ancestors\u2019 (CWA, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii.139). Indeed, Burke can be found, sometimes, on such rational grounds, deprecating all explicit appeal to speculation of whatever hue, if it had a disturbing effect: \u2018reason not at all\u2014oppose the ancient policy and practice of the empire, as a rampart against the speculations of innovators on both sides of the question\u2019 (italics added) (ATX, W & S 1981\u20132015, ii.166). His deprecation of speculation was logically anterior to taking sides in politics.\n\nIt was also, in effect, an appeal for ideas adequate to governing. This is evident in Burke\u2019s criticism of \u2018vulgar and mechanical politicians\u2019,\n\na sort of people who think that nothing exists but what is gross and material; and who therefore, far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly taught,\u2026ruling and master principles, which, in the opinion of such men as I have mentioned, have no substantial existence, are in truth every thing, and all in all,\n\nso that \u2018little minds\u2019 could not govern \u2018a great empire\u2019 (CWA, W & S 1981\u20132015, iii.139), or, evidently, any empire at all, whereas better results might be expected from \u2018men truly initiated and rightly taught.\u2019\n\nBurke himself, however much he might try to set the logic of his thought in a rich foliage of words generated by his literary skill with words\u2014he is perhaps the only classic of political thought in the English language who is also a literary classic\u2014was a philosophical thinker. As such, his practical conclusions could change, and did, as we have seen. Practical conclusions changed because they were meant to be serviceable in a world that itself was changing. Burke\u2019s philosophical equipment, however, served him in the face of all external changes. The most dramatic of such changes came during the last eight years of his life with the French Revolution.\n\n9. The Revolution in France\n\nBurke\u2019s name is indissolubly connected to his Reflections on the Revolution in France, though a more perceptive account of the causes of the Revolution of 1789 can be found in A Letter to William Elliot (1795), and the Letters on a Regicide Peace (1795\u20137) investigate the character and consequences of the Revolution from 1791 in a more thoroughgoing way. In an important sense, however, the judgement of posterity is right for our purposes, because Reflections illustrates very clearly the central importance of philosophy and \u2018philosophical\u2019 history for Burke\u2019s writing about one of the greatest changes of his day.\n\nThis is true, in the first place, in terms of insight. Reflections was published on 1 November 1790, less than eighteen months after the storming of the Bastille. The intervening period had been characterised by a mixture of popular violence and peaceable, if feverish political activity in France, as its absolute monarchy gave way to a constitutional monarchy. A detached observer would be unsure of the future\u2014whether destruction and violence would predominate or whether an enduring constitutional order would emerge was a question which events had not answered. In the event, of course, the Revolution would be characterised by violence and constitutional development alike at different times, but this was as unknowable in 1790 as it is obvious in the twenty-first century.\n\nBurke\u2019s Reflections may be divided (for the author did not provide any formal divisions) into two portions of unequal length. Both of these are concerned with relations. The first portion, about two-thirds of the text, suggests that the French, in their enthusiasm for the idea of liberty, had failed to understand that liberty was only one amongst a range of benefits, all of which were required in mutual connexion for a life under civil government that was civilized in the proper sense. The results which flowed from this deficiency of understanding included constitutional arrangements which, because they did not reflect an understanding of liberty that was subtle enough to grasp that the liberty of the many was power, did not qualify popular sovereignty in a way that would restrain the demos effectively. As if an unrestrained populace was not bad enough, an understanding of life only in terms of liberty swept away preceding elaborations of our ideas. This mattered, because the refinement of ideas had been a precondition of refinement of conduct and therefore of the progress of society in many respects. One key instance of these was the respectful treatment of women encouraged since the middle ages by Christian learning and by chivalry. But there was a newer philosophy: \u2018on this scheme of things, a king is but a man; a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal; and an animal not of the highest order\u2019. The retrogression of humanity itself to animality was not far in the future with \u2018a swinish multitude\u2019. The result, as people would no longer be moved by opinion, which had embodied refined ideas, would be that they would need to be governed by force. Force, too, was the ultimate destination of the second portion of Reflections. This suggested that the idea of equality had been connected only too pervasively with the institutional arrangements of the judiciary, the legislative and the executive power\u2014and therefore had produced not the authority of command from a s strong government but institutionalised feebleness. At the same time, the perverse results of equality in fiscal arrangements had caused popular discontent and financial instability. The result was a situation which could be controlled only by the force of the military\u2014if, indeed, military order was sustainable when soldiers had absorbed the idea of equality. France, it seemed, tended towards either disintegration or the rule of force.\n\nBurke\u2019s philosophical repertoire and historical understanding thus provided the structure of Reflections, and, perhaps more importantly, suggested insights into the character of the Revolution. The inattention of the revolutionaries to the relations that needed to be comprised in a modern government, especially in connexion with liberty, was matched by the inappropriateness to a sovereign regime of structuring its institutions around equality rather than around effective command. These insights suggested that a mis-structuring of the new constitution proceeded from an inadequate philosophical grasp. Such misunderstanding was matched by a failure to understand the historical development which had produced the elaboration of ideas about conduct that had underwritten government by opinion, and this failure suggested that the Revolution would cause retrogression from this civilized condition towards a less gentle way of proceeding, as well as a less effective one. In other words, Burke\u2019s understanding of philosophy, and of the history of Europe, conceived \u2018philosophically\u2019, provided grounds for making fundamental claims about the Revolution.\n\nWhether Burke was right in these claims about the Revolution, of course, is another question, and one that can never be answered: French readers of Reflections could take its lessons to heart, and, anyhow, events have a way of modifying tendencies independently of intention and interpretation. Indeed, none of this is to say that Reflections was intended as an academic work, or even an accurate factual statement, about the Revolution. It was calculated to produce a practical result, which was to dissuade the British from admiring the Revolution and so to dampen any propensity they might feel to imitate it: and thus to protect civilization in Britain. In the course of pursuing this goal, Burke was willing to satirize the Revolution and its British sympathizers unmercifully in order to make them as unattractive as possible to any sane reader, and he matched the satire with a panegyric on British social and political arrangements. There is, indeed, much in Reflections besides the elements that have been emphasized here (and indeed much in Burke\u2019s later views on the Revolution which is not in Reflections): but without those elements neither the book nor Burke\u2019s understanding of the Revolution would have been possible.\n\n10. Problems of Interpretation\n\nIt is clear by now that neither \u2018mystic spirit\u2019 nor \u2018irrationalism\u2019 characterise Burke helpfully. These examples might be taken as extreme. At the same time they witness interpretative difficulties. Whilst Burke\u2019s thought has never lacked interpreters from his own day to ours, on the whole they have not brought to bear the combined persistence of historical insight and strength of conceptual grasp required to do justice to him. Hence he has suffered an ironic fate for one who urged breadth and precision of thought. That is to say, he has figured as the spokesman for a very limited number of points or as one preoccupied with a limited number of themes. This type of treatment began in the nineteenth century, when Burke was invoked as an antidote to the confidence of the French Revolution by liberal thinkers who prized its principles, saw their narrowness, and required a sense of historical development to situate them properly in a viable civil society. It was continued when Matthew Arnold tried to treat Burke as a (pre-Home Rule) Gladstonian spokesman about Ireland. It went further still in the twentieth century, when Burke was pressed into service as a counter-revolutionary agent in the anti-Communist cause, and when the twenty-first dawned some were treating Burke as proponent of postmodernism. He himself could hardly have complained that his work has been put to practical use, but it remains true that academic justice has yet to be done to him. Chapters and essays on individual themes in his writings have been more plausible on the whole than attempts at general interpretation, which usually concentrate on a theme or themes of choice, or subordinate Burke\u2019s thought to it or them, and so give the impression (deliberately or otherwise) that this is the whole of Burke, or at any rate that this is what matters about him. One response to this situation is to concentrate primarily on telling the story, and it is interesting that a number of recent works have taken this path.\n\nIn attacking the Revolution in France, Burke constructed a rogues\u2019 gallery for French politicians, and stocked it also with quite a number of French thinkers. The figures who appeared to be rogues, however, were most of them only straw men, stuffed according to the prejudices of a British audience. More significantly for our purposes, Burke\u2019s censure of the philosophes attributed to them complicity with the style of thought that had set up a limited range of simple principles as the norm for politics, and which was wholly inadequate to satisfy the connected and various needs of human nature under modern conditions. Burke preferred to emphasize that numerous principles, and practical thinking to combine them, were necessary to meet these needs, and so to sustain improvement, and emphasize, too, that such accommodation involved much more practical activity than speculative design. Correspondingly his own writings develop, not a political philosophy but rather a political style that had at its core philosophical elements\u2014a style which, indeed, implicitly suggested that political philosophy was not feasible as a sort of knowledge, and, if it was, certainly not one sufficient to the task of \u2018the philosopher in action\u2019. The latter, at least as embodied by Burke himself, when he mentioned political philosophy, assumed that it was highly practical. It for its goal regulating opinion in order to produce good political results and to prevent bad ones. \u201cIt has ever been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal philosophy to regulate opinion\u201d, he wrote. \u201cIt is the great object of political philosophy to promote that which is sound, and to extirpate what is mischievous, and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community, and mischievous neighbours out of it\u201d (RP2, W & S ix.295).\n\nSuch a style of thought emphasises the importance of combining a wide range of principles, and of remembering that principles, however numerous, are only one element in a satisfactory conduct of practice. There can be no doubt that analysis was involved in Burke\u2019s proceedings: \u201clet this position be analysed,\u201d he instructed the House of Commons critically in 1794, \u201cfor analysis is the deadly enemy of all declamation.\u201d [10] Though Burke could certainly conduct effective analyses of ideas and words even after more than twenty years at Westminster, as his Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792) demonstrates, his accent lay more decidedly upon the necessity of connecting ideas with each other, and the inclusion of non-conceptual elements in any treatment of politics that aspired to intellectual and practical validity. There is nothing in a style of doing philosophy that centres upon analysis that is logically inconsistent with these procedures. One temper of mind, however, which sometimes accompanies this manner of philosophising is antipathetic to Burke, whilst there is much in contemporary opinions about politics, including those held by at least some analytical philosophers, that he would have found dangerously naive. Amongst these a belief in a continuing popular sovereignty (the modern term of art for this is \u2018democracy\u2019)\u2014rather than parliamentary sovereignty is only the most obvious example. If Burke is unlikely at present to be the darling of some philosophers and of some pundits; still less will he be of those who suppose that in discussing a small number of principles they provide a prescriptive and sufficient guidance for the conduct of policy; and even less of anyone who supposes it logically adequate to claim that \u2018one very simple principle\u2019 is \u2018entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control\u2019 or any other matter (Mill 1859, \u2018Introductory\u2019). The complex character of ideas, their connexions with each other, the need to understand practice in terms of such relations, and to conduct it with attention to habitual linkages amongst people\u2019s ideas and activities, suggest a different sort of thinking. So it is not surprising that Burke has been quietly ignored by many recent thinkers, or summarily dismissed from consideration by being labelled as a \u2018conservative\u2019\u2014but it is of great interest that he has found many admirers amongst those who succeed in the conduct of practical politics. Whilst Burke would have been the first to point out that his specific conclusions belong to a time and a place, his intellectual style, is one with which any serious thinking about politics, whether reflective or practical, needs to engage.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nBurke\u2019s thought is philosophical in at least two senses. One is that it is constituted in part by thinking in terms of philosophical conceptions, especially complex ideas, particularly those of relation, as well as involving significant positions in philosophical psychology and the philosophy of language. The other sense is that it develops an account of the American, British and European past which is philosophical history, as the eighteenth-century understood the term. These senses, once put together, inform a style of practical thinking about politics which emphasizes the importance of synthetic as well as analytical thinking for practice, and suggests that a progressive practice requires not only the yields of past effort but also the intelligent application of mind to their further development if progress, rather than regress, is to result. Burke is perhaps the least studied of political classics, but he is certainly amongst the small number with whom anyone who aspires to have an adequate political education must engage."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edmund-Burke-British-philosopher-and-statesman", "page_content": "Burke, the son of a solicitor, entered Trinity College , Dublin, in 1744 and moved to London in 1750 to begin his studies at the Middle Temple. There follows an obscure period in which Burke lost interest in his legal studies, was estranged from his father, and spent some time wandering about England and France. In 1756 he published anonymously A Vindication of Natural Society\u2026, a satirical imitation of the style of Viscount Bolingbroke that was aimed at both the destructive criticism of revealed religion and the contemporary vogue for a \u201creturn to Nature.\u201d A contribution to aesthetic theory, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful , which appeared in 1757, gave him some reputation in England and was noticed abroad, among others by Denis Diderot , Immanuel Kant , and G.E. Lessing. In agreement with the publisher Robert Dodsley , Burke initiated The Annual Register as a yearly survey of world affairs; the first volume appeared in 1758 under his (unacknowledged) editorship, and he retained this connection for about 30 years.\n\nPolitical life\n\nAfter an unsuccessful first venture into politics, Burke was appointed secretary in 1765 to the Marquess of Rockingham, leader of one of the Whig groups, the largely liberal faction in Parliament, and he entered the House of Commons that year. Burke remained Rockingham\u2019s secretary until the latter\u2019s death in 1782. Burke worked to unify the group of Whigs that had formed around Rockingham; this faction was to be the vehicle of Burke\u2019s parliamentary career.\n\nBritannica Quiz Philosophy 101\n\nBurke soon took an active part in the domestic constitutional controversy of George III\u2019s reign. The main problem during the 18th century was whether king or Parliament controlled the executive. The king was seeking to reassert a more active role for the crown\u2014which had lost some influence in the reigns of the first two Georges\u2014without infringing on the limitations of the royal prerogative set by the revolution settlement of 1689. Burke\u2019s chief comment on this issue is his pamphlet \u201cThoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents\u201d (1770). He argued that George\u2019s actions were against not the letter but the spirit of the constitution. The choice of ministers purely on personal grounds was favouritism; public approbation by the people through Parliament should determine their selection. This pamphlet includes Burke\u2019s famous, and new, justification of party, defined as a body of men united on public principle, which could act as a constitutional link between king and Parliament, providing consistency and strength in administration, or principled criticism in opposition.\n\nIn 1774 Burke was elected a member of Parliament for Bristol, then the second city of the kingdom and an open constituency requiring a genuine election contest. He held this seat for six years but failed to retain the confidence of his constituents. For the rest of his parliamentary career he was member for Malton, a pocket borough of Lord Rockingham\u2019s. It was at Bristol that Burke made the well-known statement on the role of the member of Parliament. The elected member should be a representative, not a mere delegate pledged to obey undeviatingly the wishes of his constituents. The electors are capable of judging his integrity, and he should attend to their local interests; but, more importantly, he must address himself to the general good of the entire nation, acting according to his own judgment and conscience, unfettered by mandates or prior instructions from those he represents.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nBurke gave only qualified support to movements for parliamentary reform; though he accepted the possibility of widening political participation, he rejected any doctrine of mere rule of numbers. Burke\u2019s main concern, rather, was the curtailment of the crown\u2019s powers. He made a practical attempt to reduce this influence as one of the leaders of the movement that pressed for parliamentary control of royal patronage and expenditure. When the Rockingham Whigs took office in 1782, bills were passed reducing pensions and emoluments of offices. Burke was specifically connected with an act regulating the civil list, the amount voted by Parliament for the personal and household expenses of the sovereign.\n\nA second great issue that confronted Burke in 1765 was the quarrel with the American colonies. Britain\u2019s imposition of the Stamp Act there in 1765, along with other measures, provoked unrest and opposition, which soon swelled into disobedience, conflict, and secession. British policy was vacillating; determination to maintain imperial control ended in coercion, repression, and unsuccessful war. Opposed to the tactics of coercion, the Rockingham group in their short administration of 1765\u201366 repealed the Stamp Act but asserted the imperial right to impose taxation by the Declaratory Act.\n\nBurke\u2019s best-known statements on this issue are two parliamentary speeches, \u201cOn American Taxation\u201d (1774) and \u201cOn Moving His Resolutions for Conciliation with the Colonies\u201d (1775), and \u201cA Letter to\u2026the Sheriffs of Bristol, on the Affairs of America\u201d (1777). British policy, he argued, had been both imprudent and inconsistent, but above all legalistic and intransigent, in the assertion of imperial rights. Authority must be exercised with respect for the temper of those subject to it, if there was not to be collision of power and opinion. This truth was being ignored in the imperial quarrel; it was absurd to treat universal disobedience as criminal: the revolt of a whole people argued serious misgovernment. Burke made a wide historical survey of the growth of the colonies and of their present economic problems. In the place of narrow legalism he called for a more pragmatic policy on Britain\u2019s part that would admit the claims of circumstance, utility, and moral principle in addition to those of precedent. Burke suggested that a conciliatory attitude be shown by Britain\u2019s Parliament, along with a readiness to meet American complaints and to undertake measures that would restore the colonies\u2019 confidence in imperial authority.\n\nIn view of the magnitude of the problem, the adequacy of Burke\u2019s specific remedies is questionable, but the principles on which he was basing his argument were the same as those underlying his \u201cPresent Discontents\u201d: government should ideally be a cooperative, mutually restraining relation of rulers and subjects; there must be attachment to tradition and the ways of the past, wherever possible, but, equally, recognition of the fact of change and the need to respond to it, reaffirming the values embodied in tradition under new circumstances.\n\nIreland was a special problem in imperial regulation. It was in strict political dependency on England and internally subject to the ascendancy of an Anglo-Irish Protestant minority that owned the bulk of the agricultural land. Roman Catholics were excluded by a penal code from political participation and public office. To these oppressions were added widespread rural poverty and a backward economic life aggravated by commercial restrictions resulting from English commercial jealousy. Burke was always concerned to ease the burdens of his native country. He consistently advocated relaxation of the economic and penal regulations, and steps toward legislative independence, at the cost of alienating his Bristol constituents and of incurring suspicions of Roman Catholicism and charges of partiality.\n\nThe remaining imperial issue, to which he devoted many years, and which he ranked as the most worthy of his labours, was that of India. The commercial activities of a chartered trading concern, the British East India Company, had created an extensive empire there. Burke in the 1760s and \u201970s opposed interference by the English government in the company\u2019s affairs as a violation of chartered rights. However, he learned a great deal about the state of the company\u2019s government as the most active member of a select committee that was appointed in 1781 to investigate the administration of justice in India but which soon widened its field to that of a general inquiry. Burke concluded that the corrupt state of Indian government could be remedied only if the vast patronage it was bound to dispose of was in the hands neither of a company nor of the crown. He drafted the East India Bill of 1783 (of which the Whig statesman Charles James Fox was the nominal author), which proposed that India be governed by a board of independent commissioners in London. After the defeat of the bill, Burke\u2019s indignation came to centre on Warren Hastings, governor-general of Bengal from 1772 to 1785. It was at Burke\u2019s instigation that Hastings was impeached in 1787, and he challenged Hastings\u2019 claim that it was impossible to apply Western standards of authority and legality to government in the East. He appealed to the concept of the Law of Nature, the moral principles rooted in the universal order of things, to which all conditions and races of men were subject.\n\nThe impeachment, which is now generally regarded as an injustice to Hastings (who was ultimately acquitted), is the most conspicuous illustration of the failings to which Burke was liable throughout his public life, including his brief periods in office as paymaster general of the forces in 1782 and 1783. His political positions were sometimes marred by gross distortions and errors of judgment. His Indian speeches fell at times into violent emotion and abuse, lacking restraint and proportion, and his parliamentary activities were at times irresponsible or factious.\n\nThe outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 was initially greeted in England with much enthusiasm. Burke, after a brief suspension of judgment, was both hostile to it and alarmed by this favourable English reaction. He was provoked into writing his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) by a sermon of the Protestant dissenter Richard Price welcoming the Revolution. Burke\u2019s deeply felt antagonism to the new movement propelled him to the plane of general political thought; it provoked a host of English replies, of which the best known is Thomas Paine\u2019s The Rights of Man (1791\u201392).\n\nIn the first instance Burke discussed the actual course of the Revolution, examining the personalities, motives, and policies of its leaders. More profoundly, he attempted to analyze the fundamental ideas animating the movement and, fastening on the Revolutionary concepts of \u201cthe rights of man\u201d and popular sovereignty, emphasized the dangers of democracy in the abstract and the mere rule of numbers when unrestrained and unguided by the responsible leadership of a hereditary aristocracy. Further, he challenged the whole rationalist and idealist temper of the movement. It was not merely that the old social order was being pulled down. He argued, further, that the moral fervour of the Revolution, and its vast speculative schemes of political reconstruction, were causing a devaluation of tradition and inherited values and a thoughtless destruction of the painfully acquired material and spiritual resources of society. Against all this, he appealed to the example and the virtues of the English constitution: its concern for continuity and unorganized growth; its respect for traditional wisdom and usage rather than speculative innovation, for prescriptive, rather than abstract, rights; its acceptance of a hierarchy of rank and property; its religious consecration of secular authority and recognition of the radical imperfection of all human contrivances.\n\nAs an analysis and prediction of the course of the Revolution, Burke\u2019s French writings, though frequently intemperate and uncontrolled, were in some ways strikingly acute; but his lack of sympathy with its positive ideals concealed from him its more fruitful and permanent potentialities. It is for the criticism and affirmation of fundamental political attitudes that the Reflections and An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs (1791) retain their freshness, relevance, and force.\n\nBurke opposed the French Revolution to the end of his life, demanding war against the new state and gaining a European reputation and influence. But his hostility to the Revolution went beyond that of most of his party and in particular was challenged by Fox. Burke\u2019s long friendship with Fox came to a dramatic end in a parliamentary debate (May 1791). Ultimately the majority of the party passed with Burke into support of William Pitt\u2019s government. In 1794, at the conclusion of Hastings\u2019 impeachment, Burke retired from Parliament. His last years were clouded by the death of his only son, on whom his political ambitions had come to centre. He continued to write, defending himself from his critics, deploring the condition of Ireland, and opposing any recognition of the French government (notably in \u201cThree Letters Addressed to a Member of the Present Parliament on the Proposals for Peace, with the Regicide Directory of France\u201d [1796\u201397])."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml", "page_content": "Burke was a hugely influential Anglo-Irish politician, orator and political thinker, notable for his strong support for the American Revolution and his fierce opposition to the French Revolution.\n\nEdmund Burke was born in Dublin on 12 January 1729, the son of a solicitor. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and then went to London to study law. He quickly gave this up and after a visit to Europe settled in London, concentrating on a literary and political career. He became a member of parliament in 1765. He was closely involved in debates over limits to the power of the king, pressing for parliamentary control of royal patronage and expenditure.\n\nBritain's imposition on America of measures including the Stamp Act in 1765 provoked violent colonial opposition. Burke argued that British policy had been inflexible and called for more pragmatism. He believed that government should be a cooperative relationship between rulers and subjects and that, while the past was important, a willingness to adapt to the inevitability of change could, hopefully, reaffirm traditional values under new circumstances.\n\nHe also maintained a keen interest in India. He concluded that Indian governmental corruption had to be resolved by removing patronage from interested parties. He proposed that India be governed by independent commissioners in London, but a bill to this end was defeated, prompting impeachment proceedings against Warren Hastings, the governor-general of Bengal.\n\nThe outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 gave Burke his greatest target. He expressed his hostility in 'Reflections on the Revolution in France' (1790). The book provoked a huge response, including Thomas Paine's 'The Rights of Man'.

Cork, second son of Edward Synge (qv), later bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and his wife Barbara Latham. Edward's elder brother was Samuel Synge (d. 1708), who became dean of Kildare. Synge was educated at the diocesan school, Cork, and in 1674 he went to Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he met William Wake, later archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout his life. He graduated BA in 1677.\n\nSynge's first incumbency was as rector of Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136). In 1686 he became vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork, which he held until 1706. He was also (1691\u20131714) rector of Rathclarin, Co. Cork, and held other parishes in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1695 William King (qv), then bishop of Dublin, put Synge's name forward for the diocese of Limerick. Synge expressed surprise that he had been considered, but he did not get Limerick, and when he was offered the deanery of Derry in 1699 he refused it on the grounds that his elderly mother could not accompany him. About four years later, the lord lieutenant, the 2nd duke of Ormond (qv) offered him the deanery of St Patrick's on behalf of the crown. However, a dispute between the crown and the chapter as to the right of presentation was only resolved when John Stearne (qv) was appointed dean and Edward Synge became chancellor of St Patrick's and vicar of St Werburgh's, where he was installed in April 1705. In 1714 King recommended Synge for the diocese of Raphoe, and he was consecrated in November that year. He remained at Raphoe for only eighteen months, and in June 1716 he was appointed archbishop of Tuam.\n\nInitially, Synge had resisted his removal from Raphoe, where he was engaged in disputes about presbyterian marriages and a campaign of conversion through education. He saw that there was a great deal of work and expense in Tuam, and there was nowhere to live, as the archbishop's palace had been burnt during the civil war. Tuam had other drawbacks: there were few resident clergy and many parishes were impropriate. Further, there was a long-running problem about the quarta pars episcopalis, that part of the tithes that had augmented the income of the archbishop, and not the parish clergy. It had been proposed to abolish this custom in Tuam, but before the necessary legislation was enacted the documents were lost in the 1641 rebellion. Synge was advised to encourage the Tuam clergy to petition for the abolition of the quarta pars, to supplement the incomes of clergy who were prepared to resign from pluralities, and to provide for parishes that had not been served since the reformation.\n\nOn the growing constitutional crisis arising from the Annesley v. Sherlock case (over the appellate jurisdictions of the Irish house of lords and its British counterpart) Synge told Wake that Ireland was \u2018a kingdom (not a county Palatine) exactly formd [sic] according to the model of England . . . \u2019 (Synge to Wake, 1 Nov. 1717 (Dublin City Library, Gilbert MS 28, f. 100)). With Archbishop King, he opposed actively but unsuccessfully the enactment by the Irish parliament of a toleration act for protestant dissenters. Here again Synge was said to have conducted himself \u2018with the greatest warmth and zeal for the nation's honour\u2019 (William Nicholson to Wake, 11 July 1719 (ibid., f. 236). In his speech on the bill, Synge observed that although he had always believed in limited toleration for dissenters, he saw that religion was a continuing cause of strife, wars, and rebellions. Citing the existence of 180 sects in England which had flourished during the civil war, he warned that it should be not thought that these \u2018wild sects and parties\u2019 had gone. If the bill were passed, he said, not only the Church of Ireland, but the civil state and even Christianity itself would be put at risk (Edward Synge speech on toleration, MS in private possession). Both Synge and King were out of favour as a result of their opposition to the bill.\n\nSynge acknowledged the difficulty that catholics had in taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, excluding them from full rights in a civil society. He believed that catholics and dissenters should be prosecuted only if they posed a real danger to the state, and proposed an oath of allegiance to meet the objections of both Roman Catholics and quakers. During his life, Synge published nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts, and he is now seen as one of the most influential religious commentators of his time. The Appendix to his Gentleman's religion (1698) is thought by Berman to have been written in answer to John Toland's (qv) Christianity not mysterious (1696). To some extent Synge shared Toland's rationalism and deism, but he rebutted Toland's case that religion possessed no mysteries. With William King, George Berkeley (qv), and Francis Hutcheson (qv), Synge discussed the problem of innate perception, using the analogy of a blind man's understanding of shape and form. In October 1714 he preached a sermon at St Werburgh's which was attacked for advocating deism and which resulted in a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Synge died in Tuam on 24 July 1741, where he was buried.\n\nHe married (1690) Anne, daughter of Nicholas Proude, dean of Clonfert. They had five children, two of whom became bishops. The eldest, Edward Synge (d. 1762), was given (1719) the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's cathedral. Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticised on the grounds that they encouraged a \u2018furious and blind zeal for religion\u2019 which could disturb the civil state, and in 1725 he preached on religious toleration to members of both houses of parliament. Made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was translated to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin, where he remained until his death. He was a close friend of Francis Hutcheson the philosopher, who acknowledged his debt to Synge's critique of the text of his An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue (1726). In 1749 Synge organised a census of the diocese of Elphin, which covers most of Co. Roscommon, and parts of south-east Co. Sligo and north-east Co. Galway. It was a remarkable undertaking: forms were specially designed and printed and clergy and churchwardens were persuaded to act as enumerators. The census is housed in the NAI (NAI, MS 2466). Synge married (1725) Jane Curtis and it is through his letters to their daughter Alicia that he is best known."}, {"url": "https://daily.jstor.org/edmund-burke-and-the-birth-of-traditional-conservatism/", "page_content": "Edmund Burke (1729-1797) is the philosophical fountainhead of modern conservatism. But he didn\u2019t start out that way. The Irish-born politician started as a fiery Whig, a voice for American independence and for Dissenters and radicals at home in Great Britain. He stood against slavery and prosecuted the head of the British East India Company for corruption. Then he met the French Revolution, and his views seemed to change abruptly.\n\nHis famous pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) manifested what Thomas Jefferson called a \u201crevolution in Mr. Burke.\u201d Friends who were dumbstruck by the Reflections\u2019s diatribe against Unitarians and Jews, not to mention the French, and his allusions to lunatics, criminals, and cannibals, even thought Burke might be temporarily deranged.\n\nBut was it, indeed, the French Revolution that caused \u201can abrupt political tack from advocating parliamentary reform, religious toleration, and American liberty\u201c? Or was Burke\u2019s critique of the French Revolution, as Burke himself sometimes argued, \u201cfirst and foremost a parable for the English of his day\u201d? Historian McCalman argues that understanding Burke\u2019s domestic experience is key to explaining his transformation.\n\nLong before the French Revolution, Burke was well on his way to being what one scholar calls \u201ca prophet of counterrevolution.\u201d\n\nAccording to McCalman, Burke\u2019s radical transformation was greatly fanned, if not sparked, by the Gordon Riots of 1780. Named after Lord George Gordon, the firebrand head of the Protestant Association (and onetime friend of Burke), this chaotic political uprising essentially scared the reformer out of Burke.\n\nCentered in London but manifesting throughout Britain, the uprising was eventually suppressed by the military, but not before hundreds died. All this was a response to a parliamentary law that had attempted reduce official discrimination against Catholics by lifting some of the eighty-year old anti-Catholic laws. These laws were little enforced by 1780, but their formal weakening by Parliament aroused old prejudices and were eagerly exploited by rabble-rousers like Gordon.\n\nGordon\u2019s uprising wasn\u2019t just about religion, however. It had populist economic strands, appealing to artisan and middling classes against the Crown and aristocracy. Yet it manifested itself as an apocalyptic, millenarian, neo-Puritanism that turned reform into a burning cross led by a howling mob.\n\nGordon and Burke had started as friends and collaborators, working in Parliament as its two poorest members. They were both, McCalman argues, types of extremists, but separated by the \u201cancient allegiance and discourse of Protestant antipopery.\u201d So by the time of the pogrom-like insurrection that bears his name, Gordon was calling Burke the chief enemy of the \u201cProtestant Cause.\u201d During the Riot, Burke had to defend his London home and himself from what he later called \u201cthe swinish multitude.\u201d The experience, unsurprisingly, put the fear of \u201cKing Mob,\u201d a word born in the Riots, into him.\n\nWeekly Newsletter\n\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\n\nPrivacy Policy Contact Us\n\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message. \u0394\n\nCondemning the demagogues and pamphleteers who stirred up that mob, Burke wrote that they \u201cfill them with nothing but a violent hatred of the religion of other people, and of course, with a hatred of their persons; and so, by a very natural progression they led men to a destruction of their goods and houses, and attempts on their lives.\u201d Only the military power of the Crown could help, decided Burke, a perspective that would have once been anathema to a Whig.\n\nLong before the French Revolution descended with the guillotine into the Reign of Terror of 1793-94, Burke was well on his way to being what McCalman calls \u201ca prophet of counterrevolution.\u201d Opposed to Gordon-esque, \u201cthreatening new romantic-revolutionary\u201d figures arising on the Continent and in England, Burke moved right before the French even divided politics into a left and a right. Radicals and visionaries who unleashed the mob, intentionally or not, were more than just threats to public safety; according to Burke, they were threats to the order of civilization itself."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-edmund-burke/DA344D31186023A8FCA0FB4C670ADD66", "page_content": "To save content items to your account, please confirm that you agree to abide by our usage policies.

His political acumen was applauded by both the conservatives and liberals, and he is ranked among the most influential politicians in the 19th century. Burke is acclaimed for being the first politician to address the grievances of the American colonies under British rule through his writings and speeches, and he served the British government on several prestigious administrative positions.\n\nEdmund was born into an affluent family in Dublin, Ireland on January 12, 1729. His father, Richard Burke, was a prosperous lawyer and, under his father\u2019s guidance, Edmund grew up as a follower of the Anglican faith. Burke received his basic education at Quaker School, in Ballitore, and in 1744, he was accepted at the Trinity College in Dublin. In 1747, he established a debating club which became popular as the \u2018Edmund Burke\u2019s Club\u2019, and years later in 1770, this club was merged with the Historical Club and made the College Historical Society, which remains to this day, a prominent and influential undergraduate society. In 1748, Edmund received his bachelor\u2019s degree, and upon his father\u2019s insistence, he moved to London in 1750, to pursue an education in Law. In London, he was accepted at the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, however, Burke was not keen on studying law, and he gave up his legal education to travel around Europe. Burke\u2019s intentions were to pursue a career in writing instead of law.\n\nIn 1756, Burke published his first discourse, entitled \u2018A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind\u2019, which was inspired by the works of Lord Bolingbroke on argumentations against religion and its impact on social and civil institutions. Burke began garnering overwhelming applause and positive reviews for his book, his fame as a gifted writer began to spread. In 1757, he released his study of aesthetics, entitled \u2018A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\u2019.\n\nIn 1757, Burke was commissioned by Robert Dodsley to compose a \u201chistory of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne\u201d, Burke produced a composition that covered the history till 1216, but he was unable to finish it. The book was published in 1812.\n\nBurke\u2019s entry to the British Parliament was triggered by his encounter with William Gerard in the 1750s, who upon securing the position of Chief Secretary of Ireland, appointed Burke as his private secretary. Burke served him for the next three years, and in 1765, he accepted the position of a private secretary to liberal Whig statesman, the Marquess of Rockingham. The same year, he entered the British Parliament by becoming a member of the House of Commons for Wendover, Burke\u2019s first speech in the parliament made an extremely positive impression. In 1769, he published his much discussed pamphlet, entitled \u201cObservations on a Late State of the Nation\u201d.\n\nBurke\u2019s rise in parliament is marked by his influential debates on the constitutional limits to the supreme authority of the Monarch, and his questioning against the irrevocable monarchical abuses of authority. He encouraged all political parties to unite and raise their voice against the irrefutable royal power in Britain. In 1770, he published \u201cThoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents\u201d. Burke was an active participant in the debates held in the Parliament, and in 1770, he made one of his many iconic speeches that advocated a free market in corn during a debate held to discuss the merits of a prohibition on the export of grains. Due to Burke\u2019s tireless efforts, the \u2018Repeal of Certain Law Act\u2019 was passed in 1772, that put away with all the existing laws directed against forestallers and dealers in corn. Burke was also a significant commentator against the partition of Poland, his writings opposing the partition are included in the Annual Register. In 1774, Burke was elected as the member of Bristol, and in 1778, he was among the principal opponents to the restrictions imposed on Irish trade, he also took part in a Parliamentary motion that advocated a revision of the restrictions. In 1780, Burke lost his seat in the Parliament due to his constant support of unconventional laws such as free trade.\n\nEdmund Burke had a profound sympathy for the grievances of the deprived and impoverished American colonies under the rule of King George III. On March 22, 1775, he addressed the plight of the Americans in a speech inside the House of Commons, he warned England of the dire retributions from America if the situation was not improved.\n\nThe Gordon Riots of 1780 brought Burke in the centre of unrest and turmoil, as the rioters began targeting him and his house had to be placed under military protection. In 1782, Edmund was appointed as the Paymaster of the Forces and a Privy Councillor, however, he was not given a cabinet seat. He abolished 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration, and passed two acts, \u201cThe Paymaster General Act 1782\u201d and \u201cThe Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782\u201d.\n\nBurke is the principal accuser in the impeachment of Warren Hastings, upon conducting an in depth analysis of the East India Company\u2019s activities in India, Burke made his memorable speech on \u2018The Nabob of Arcot\u2019s Debts\u2019, where he officially accused Hastings for the damage done by EIC in India. In 1786, he presented his \u201cArticle of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanours\u201d against Hastings which led to the trial in 1788.\n\nBurke was extremely critical of the French revolution, and hostile towards the English approval of the events taking place in France. He discussed the demerits of the French Revolutions in his book \u2018Reflections on the Revolution in France\u2019, published in 1790. Burke\u2019s writing has aided governments in making counter-revolutionary strategies in France and Germany.\n\nBurke died on July 9, 1797, after a prolonged suffering with a stomach ailment.\n\nBuy books by Edmund Burke"}, {"url": "https://www.adamsmithworks.org/speakings/the-professor-and-the-statesman-the-friendship-of-adam-smith-and-edmund-burke", "page_content": "\n\nIt is easy to forget that great thinkers of the past were first and foremost people. They fell in and out of love, won and lost friendships, and sometimes probably partook too much of the bottle and awoke the next morning to suffer the consequences. One of the most enduring aspects of Smith\u2019s personal biography was his affectionate friendship with fellow Scottish philosopher It is easy to forget that great thinkers of the past were first and foremost people. They fell in and out of love, won and lost friendships, and sometimes probably partook too much of the bottle and awoke the next morning to suffer the consequences. One of the most enduring aspects of Smith\u2019s personal biography was his affectionate friendship with fellow Scottish philosopher David Hume\n\n\n\nThe The Smith-Hume friendship is one of the most well-known between Enlightenment thinkers. It is so well-known that it often overshadows Smith\u2019s other friendships. One such friend was the great philosopher-statesman, Edmund Burke . Fittingly enough, their friendship started thanks to Hume. On April 12, 1759 Hume sent a letter to Smith thanking him for \u201cthe agreeable Present of your Theory,\u201d Smith\u2019s recently published Theory of Moral Sentiments. Hume \u201cmade presents\u201d of multiple copies Smith sent him, giving them to people he \u201cthought good judges\u201d to further \u201cspread the Reputation of the Book\u201d (we could all benefit from a Hume in our lives). One person who received a copy was \u201cBurke, an Irish Gentlemen, who wrote lately a very pretty Treatise on the Sublime.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn September 10, 1759, six months after receiving his copy of TMS, Burke wrote Smith for the first time. One immediately sees the beginnings of a friendship. \u201cI am quite ashamed that the first letter I have the honour of writing to you should be an apology for my conduct,\u201d began Burke. He assured Smith that when he \u201creceived the Theory of Moral of Sentiments from Mr. Hume,\u201d he \u201cran through it with great eagerness,\u201d but \u201cwas immediately after hurried out of Town, and involved ever since in a Variety of troublesome affairs.\u201d Hence the delay of six months before his response. Known as a reactionary, not a charmer, Burke nonetheless displayed a keen understanding of an author\u2019s ego, telling Smith \u201cMy resolution was to defer my acknowledgments until I had read your book with proper care and attention; to do otherwise with so well studied a piece would be to treat it with great injustice.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the fascinating aspects of the Smith-Burke relationship is the fact that \u201cThere is little scholarly agreement about how to understand\u201d it, as Michael L. Frazer One of the fascinating aspects of the Smith-Burke relationship is the fact that \u201cThere is little scholarly agreement about how to understand\u201d it, as Michael L. Frazer writes . Frazer notes \u201cPhilosophical commentators often see the two in fundamental opposition\u2026. Yet historians point out that Smith and Burke were personal friends who not only shared a sentimental attachment, but also considered themselves to be in fundamental agreement on most philosophical and political issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis \u201cfundamental agreement\u201d can be seen in Burke\u2019s first letter to Smith. Burke wrote \u201cI am not only pleased with the ingenuity of your Theory; I am convinced of its solidity and Truth; and I do not know that it ever cost me less trouble to admit so many things to which I had been a stranger before.\u201d Always skeptical of abstract theories, Burke praised Smith for rooting his theory \u201con the Nature of man, which is always the same, will last, when those that are founded on his opinions, which are always changing, will and must be forgotten.\u201d Such pleasantries may be expected in private correspondence, but Burke also praised Smith\u2019s writings publicly.\n\n\n\nIn 1758 Burke became the editor of In 1758 Burke became the editor of The Annual Register , an annual publication that recorded important world events, especially those involving British politics, along with collected articles on a diversity of topics. Book reviews made up an important part of the Register, with a short review serving as an introduction to lengthy excerpts from the actual book under review. Burke included brief reviews of and lengthy excerpts from both TMS and TWN in the 1759 and 1776 editions of the Register.\n\n\n\nNeither of Burke\u2019s two reviews of Smith were absent of light criticism, but overall they were quite positive. \u201cThere will, in a work of this kind, always be great deficiencies\u201d Burke wrote of TMS. Yet he went on to praise Smith\u2019s effort and regretted only providing excerpts from the text. Burke admitted \u201cIt is very difficult, if not impossible, consistently with the brevity of our design, to give the reader a proper idea of this excellent work.\u201d He noted there had been \u201cmany books written on our moral duties,\u201d and \u201cOne would have thought the matter had been exhausted,\u201d but Smith had \u201cstruck out a new.\u201d Burke argued similarly about TWN. While others had written about economics, \u201cno one work has appeared amongst them\u2026. anything to be compared to the present performance.\u201d Smith\u2019s greatest compliment as a writer may have come from Burke saying of TMS, \u201cHis language is easy and spirited, and puts things before you in the fullest light; it is rather painting than writing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe political and philosophical differences in the Smith-Burke relationship are worth exploring, but they should not overshadow their personal relationship. For example, on July 1, 1782 Smith read Burke had resigned as Paymaster General. He sent a quick note to his \u201cdear friend,\u201d telling him \u201cI cannot avoid writing you a few lines to tell you how deeply I feel your affliction.\u201d Smith told Burke when he first heard of his resignation, \u201cmy first movement was to run to your house,\u201d but had \u201crestrained\u201d himself for \u201cfear of disturbing your sorrow.\u201d Eight months later Burke was again Paymaster General, and on April 15, 1783 Smith sent him a congratulatory letter declaring, \u201cNothing ever gave me more pleasure.\u201d Burke responded on June 20, 1783 telling Smith \u201cThat such a friend, and such a man as you are, should take any concern in my fortunes is a Circumstance very flattering to me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurke\u2019s first letter, his positive reviews of Smith\u2019s work, and Smith\u2019s support of Burke in political loss and triumph, reveals just the surface of their friendship. From their correspondence we also learn Smith wrote a letter of recommendation for Burke\u2019s cousin Will, and Burke thanked Smith for his \u201cconstant kindness\u201d to his son Richard during the latter\u2019s visit to Scotland in 1786. Sadly, we only have a small selection of their correspondence. Burke was no doubt saddened by Smith\u2019s death in 1790, seven years before his own death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe friendship between the great Scotsman and great Irishman displays the humanity of each. Their friendship also reminds us that those engaged in the world of ideas need companionship like everyone else. Life is inevitably complicated, disappointing, and lonely. Everyone needs a support network and friends for encouragement. In the Smith-Burke relationship we see that their writings about moral philosophy, politics, and economics are important, but so are the often-overlooked smaller, personal communications between friends. At their best, ideas help us truly live, but friendships are what make life worth living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to think Smith and Burke would toast a glass of scotch or pint of Guinness (better still, both) in agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: You can find Adam Smith\u2019s Correspondence for purchase\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: You can find Adam Smith\u2019s Correspondence for purchase here\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.hoover.org/research/burke-between-liberty-and-tradition", "page_content": "Feuding among american conservatives for the title True Conservative is nothing new. Ever since conservatism in America crystallized as a recognizable school in the 1950s, more than a few limited-government conservatives, or libertarians as they have come to be called, and more than a few social conservatives \u2014 and their forebears, traditionalist conservatives \u2014 have wanted to flee from or banish the other. To be sure, the passion for purity in politics is perennial. But the tension between liberty and tradition inscribed in modern conservatism has exacerbated the stress and strain in the contending conservative camps. Fortunately, a lesson of political moderation is also inscribed in the modern conservative tradition, and nowhere more durably or compellingly than at its beginning.\n\nModerating the tension between liberty, or doing as you please, and tradition, or doing as has been done in the past, is a hallmark of the speeches and writings of 18th-century British statesman Edmund Burke. While the conservative spirit is enduring and while some have always been more amply endowed with the inclination to preserve inherited ways and others more moved by the impulse to improve or supersede them, the distinctively modern form of conservatism emerged with Burke\u2019s 1790 polemic, Reflections on the Revolution in France. Writing as a friend of liberty and enlightenment, Burke eloquently exposed the brutality of the revolutionaries\u2019 determination, inspired by a perverse understanding of liberty and enlightenment, to transform political life by upending and sweeping away tradition, custom, and the inherited moral order. Burke\u2019s conservatism operates within the broad contours of the larger liberal tradition and embraces much of the spirit of the 18th-century Enlightenment. It is distinguished by its determination to moderate the tendencies toward excess that mark both liberty and reason.\n\nBurke\u2019s devotion to \u201ca spirit of rational liberty\u201d1 drives the great reform efforts of his political career: conciliation with America, toleration for Ireland\u2019s Catholics, and protection of the interests and rights of the people of India. But even if we had only the Reflections, he would still deserve to be counted among our preeminent teachers concerning the balance of principles that favors liberty.\n\nThe causes to which Burke dedicated himself, and the well-wrought arguments he summoned in their behalf, teach that the paramount political task is to defend liberty. They also illustrate that while the purpose of politics is not to perfect man, securing the rights shared equally by all depends on tradition, religion, and community cultivating the virtues that fit citizens for freedom. And they clarify how the rival interests, multiplicity of groups and associations, and competing conceptions of happiness that characterize free societies make accommodation, balance, and calibration indispensable to the conservative mission. Burke\u2019s storied career demonstrates that political moderation is not only consistent with but essential to vindicating the principles of liberty.\n\nLiberty and the French Revolution\n\nBurke\u2019s Reflections on the Revolution in France is the work of a Whig who cherished freedom and, in the name of individual liberty, sought throughout his long parliamentary career, in battles with the Tories as well as with fellow Whigs, to limit the political power of throne and altar. But to limit is not to abolish, and can be consistent with cherishing, as it was in Burke\u2019s case. He saw that within proper boundaries, religious faith disciplined and elevated hearts and minds, and monarchy upheld the continuity of tradition, reflected the benefits of hierarchy and order, and provided energy and agility in government. Both institutions, in his assessment, encouraged virtues crucial to liberty\u2019s preservation.\n\nLiberty well understood, Burke argued, recognizes the power of self-interest but emphasizes self-restraint.\n\nWhereas for the sake of liberty Burke sought to limit the political power of the monarchy in Great Britain, he defended the throne of Louis XVI in France against what he regarded as the revolutionaries\u2019 radical conception of freedom. Burke warned that the French Revolution presented \u201ca great crisis, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe.\u201d Indeed, he contended that \u201call circumstances taken together, the French Revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world.\u201d The crux of the matter was that the revolutionaries\u2019 novel doctrine demanded more than a change of government; it required \u201ca total revolution,\u201d one that would break from and cast aside established beliefs, practices, and institutions.\n\nIn contrast, Burke championed \u201ca manly, moral, regulated liberty.\u201d Liberty well understood, he argued, recognizes the power of self-interest but emphasizes self-restraint. It values calculation, planning, and ambitious state undertakings but attaches great significance to the steady development over centuries of sentiments, manners, and morals. Such liberty depends on a science of government \u2014 of constructing, conserving, and reforming the state \u2014 that involves \u201ca deep knowledge of human nature and human necessities, and of the things which facilitate or obstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions.\u201d It recognizes that \u201cthe little platoon we belong to in society\u201d \u2014 family, religious community, village or town \u2014 is the original source of \u201cpublic affections\u201d and furnishes the schools in which we develop \u201ca love to our country and to mankind.\u201d It rejects theoreticians\u2019 and intellectuals\u2019 definition of \u201cthe rights of men,\u201d which legitimate license without limits. Instead, liberty well understood affirms \u201cthe real rights of men,\u201d grounded in the advantages for which civil society was formed, including the right to live under the rule of law; to own and acquire property and to pass it on to one\u2019s children; and generally to live with one\u2019s family as one sees fit provided one does not trespass on the rights of others. The primary aim of government, which Burke characterized as \u201ca contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants,\u201d is to secure these rights. Just where the exercise of freedom passes over into a violation of another\u2019s rights and how best to use one\u2019s freedom to live well could only be determined by prudent reflection on tradition and custom, because they embodied the nation\u2019s accumulated wisdom concerning the organization and conduct of human affairs.\n\nPrudence, Burke famously observed, is \u201cthe god of this lower world.\u201d2 It carefully considers circumstances, which \u201cgive in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect,\u201d and which \u201crender every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind.\u201d3 Prudence serves political moderation by mediating between principle and practice. It guides the reconciliation of liberty with the requirements of tradition, order, and virtue by taking the measure of all and, to the extent possible in the fluid and murky world of politics, issuing in judgments and actions that give each its due.\n\nAccording to Burke, the French revolutionaries were immoderate in the extreme. By overthrowing monarchy and religion, they aimed to achieve emancipation from not merely a specific tradition or custom but the very authority of tradition and custom. Their goal, unreasonable in the extreme, was to establish an empire built on abstract reason alone. Prudent application of principle to circumstance would be unnecessary. Instead, they would mold circumstances to comply with pure reason\u2019s demands. Marching under the banner of \u201cthe rights of man,\u201d they set out to deduce the structure of a society of free and equal citizens without regard to the beliefs and practices, the passions and interests, the attachments and associations that fashion character and form conduct. Rather than counting on education grounded in history, literature, and the sciences to discipline and elevate a recalcitrant human nature, the revolutionaries sought to remake human nature and society to fit reason\u2019s supposed revelations about citizens\u2019 true wants and needs, rights, and obligations. The realization of the revolutionaries\u2019 ambitions, Burke immediately discerned, would depend on the ruthless resort to violence. Anticipating not only Robespierre and the Reign of Terror but 20th-century totalitarianism, Burke presciently argued that the determination to use the power of the state to create a new humanity would bring about the dehumanization of man.\n\nThe quarrel between Burke and the French revolutionaries comes down not to whether liberty is good or is even the leading purpose of politics \u2014 Burke thought it was both \u2014 but to the material and moral conditions and the political institutions most conducive to securing, preserving, and extending it. The French revolutionaries put their faith in government\u2019s ability to set the people free by developing institutions that satisfy citizens\u2019 sensibilities by aggressively transforming them. In contrast, Burke emphasized the moral and political benefits that flow to liberty from the time-tested beliefs, practices, and institutions beyond government\u2019s immediate purview that structure social life and cultivate manners and morals. The progressive side of the liberal tradition, the roots of which extend back to the French Revolution, tends to view traditional understandings of order and virtue as obstacles to freedom. In contrast, the conservative side of the liberal tradition, in the spirit of Burke, sees in them pillars of freedom and seeks to conserve the nongovernmental institutions \u2014 the family, religious faith, the voluntary associations of civil society \u2014 that sustain them.\n\nNotwithstanding the veneration of the past and the excoriation of revolutionary innovation to which he gave expression in the Reflections, Burke was no reactionary, dogmatically clinging to the old and rejecting the new. He observed in the Reflections that because circumstances are constantly changing, \u201ca state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation.\u201d Of course, the change in question must be prudent, wisely adapting enduring principles to the ordinary vicissitudes of politics. In extraordinary times, states must adjust to substantial shifts in circumstances, sentiment, and practice.\n\nPrudent change depends on combining and reconciling \u201cthe two principles of conservation and correction.\u201d The balancing of a conserving that is mindful of the need to correct and a correcting that proceeds with an eye to what deserves to be conserved is, in a free society, not an unwelcome political necessity. Such prudence is inseparable from respect for tradition and custom, because tradition and custom typically present not a clear-cut path but a \u201cchoice of inheritance.\u201d Since the right choice about tradition must be freely and reasonably made, and since the reasonable use of freedom depends on the virtues nourished by tradition, liberty and tradition are mutually dependent.\n\nThis mutual dependence provides an opening to moderate the claims of liberty and tradition which, in a free society, frequently pull in opposing directions. To justly moderate, or harmonize, the competing claims of liberty and tradition, one must respect necessity without thoughtlessly acquiescing to what only appears necessary, and compromise in behalf of principle rather than compromise principle. Political moderation should not be confused with the absence of strong passion. It requires restraining the desire to vindicate immediately and completely a single principle and instead working to vindicate the whole family of rival and worthy principles on which the conservation and correction of liberty depends. As Burke\u2019s career as a reformer vividly demonstrates, political moderation is propelled by a passion to strike the most reasonable balance among worthy but incomplete ends for the sake of liberty. Political moderation is a crucial part of the government of the self on which self-government in a free society depends.\n\nLiberty and reform\n\nThe need for prudent reform to meet the changing requirements of liberty was the dominant theme of Burke\u2019s nearly 30-year political career in Great Britain\u2019s Parliament in the late 1700s. Britain then governed the largest empire the world had ever seen. The empire was distinguished not only by its reach but by the principle of liberty in which it was rooted. Burke believed that to conserve the empire, Britain had to recognize the convergence between its obligation to respect liberty and its interest in doing so \u2014 a convergence that held not only at home but in all its far-flung possessions and undertakings. Even when it meant differing from his constituents \u2014 and in his greatest moments Burke championed causes that many of his constituents strongly opposed \u2014 he ardently defended liberty\u2019s imperatives.\n\nIn The Great Melody, a magisterial study of Burke\u2019s life and ideas, Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien adopted as his epigraph lines from Yeats\u2019s \u201cThe Seven Sages\u201d:\n\nAmerican Colonies, Ireland, France, and India\n\nHarried, and Burke\u2019s great melody against it.4\n\nYeats\u2019s lines, O\u2019Brien showed, capture the unifying spirit of Burke\u2019s political labors, which involved steady opposition to that abuse of power that consisted in the disregard by government of the fundamental requirements of liberty. As a member of Parliament, Burke supported American self-government, toleration for Ireland\u2019s Catholics, and ending Warren Hastings\u2019s corrupt and cruel administration of India. These reforms may seem at odds with Burke\u2019s ferocious criticism of the French revolutionaries. But both reflect the balance of principles, interests, and goods that underwrite liberty\u2019s conservation and direct its correction.\n\nBurke\u2019s reform efforts rested on the conviction that what a legislator particularly owed his constituents was sound judgment. In November 1774, in a speech to his supporters upon his election to Parliament from Bristol, then England\u2019s second largest city, Burke sought to dispel the popular misconception that representatives must obey their constituents\u2019 explicit instructions and mandates.5 Representatives are obliged to vigorously advance their constituents\u2019 interests, he readily acknowledged, but they are not obliged to accept their constituents\u2019 understanding of those interests or their constituents\u2019 opinions about the policies that would best advance them. Speaking with a high sense of purpose and uncommon frankness to those returning him to London, Burke explained that\n\nit ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinions high respect; their business unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasure, his satisfactions, to theirs \u2014 and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But, his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure \u2014 no, nor from the law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment, and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.\n\nThe representative\u2019s responsibility to provide sound judgment stems not only from moral and religious duty but also from the division of labor in which modern representative self-government is grounded. It is the representative who is immersed in the issues of the day. It is the representative who has the opportunity to debate the fine points of legislation and to deliberate. And it is the representative who, from the perspective of the capital city, can look out beyond local purposes and prejudices to consider the long-term consequences of policy and the general good of the whole nation.\n\nThe sound judgment that Burke champions differs greatly from the \u201cpublic reason\u201d from which today\u2019s professors of political theory and law purport to derive law and public policy. \u201cPublic reason\u201d and its operation in \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d describe not the reason that citizens and public officials actually exercise, but rather a system of assumptions about human beings and a hierarchy of moral values that they ideally should accept. When applied to the issues of the day, the professors\u2019 theories invariably yield results that correspond to progressive policy preferences.6 In contrast, Burke argued that sound judgment grows out of practice, is rooted in the rich soil of moral and political life, and balances conservation and correction.\n\nKeenly appreciative of the interests, institutions, and powers that representatives must reconcile, Burke urged his Bristol constituents to keep in mind that their bustling port city\n\nis but a part of a rich commercial nation, the interests of which are various, multiform, and intricate. We are members for that great nation, which, however, is itself but part of a great empire, extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthest limits of the East and of the West. All these wide-spread interests must be considered \u2014 must be compared \u2014 must be reconciled, if possible. We are members for a free country; and surely we all know that the machine of a free constitution is no simple thing, but as intricate and as delicate as it is valuable. We are members in a great and ancient monarchy; and we must preserve religiously the true, legal rights of the sovereign, which form the keystone that binds together the noble and well-constructed arch of our empire and our Constitution. A constitution made up of balanced powers must ever be a critical thing.\n\nWith the controversial positions he advocated for America, Ireland, and India, Burke sought to honor the representative\u2019s duty to preserve the balance under Britain\u2019s constitutional government crucial to liberty.\n\nBurke delivered his \u201cSpeech on Conciliation with the Colonies\u201d in the House of Commons on March 22, 1775.7 This was ten years to the day after Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which increased taxes on the American colonists while rejecting their demands for representation. And it was less than a month before the battles of Lexington and Concord would ignite the Revolutionary War, a dire outcome against which Burke had warned of for many years. With tensions mounting, Burke insisted on the need to formulate policy with a view to actual circumstances at home and in the colonies. He urged that deliberations should proceed on the basis of an appreciation of common interests and \u201cnot according to our own imaginations, not according to abstract ideas of right, by no means according to mere general theories of government, the resort to which appears to me, in our present situation, no better than arrant trifling.\u201d The most important circumstance was the deeply rooted devotion to freedom Britain shared with America.\n\nThis shared interest in freedom was crucially connected to their shared interest in prosperity. Over the previous 70 years, England\u2019s trade with the colonies had increased \u201cno less than twelve-fold,\u201d and commerce with America had come to constitute more than one-third of England\u2019s total worldwide trade. America\u2019s rise and the resulting benefits to Britain were due in considerable part to London\u2019s hands-off policy: \u201cthrough a wise and salutary neglect, a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection.\u201d Burke argued for maintaining this hands-off policy. He viewed American exuberance, even American obstreperousness, with generosity: \u201cI pardon something to the spirit of liberty.\u201d\n\nTo preserve the colonies\u2019 vital place in the empire given the violence breaking out across the Atlantic would require \u201cprudent management.\u201d Force was to be avoided since it weakened \u2014 when it did not ruin \u2014 the object it subdued. It would be particularly counterproductive in dealing with America because liberty was the colonists\u2019 lifeblood and the decisive factor in their vital contribution to the empire. Indeed, Burke asserted, \u201ca love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes\u201d the American character.\n\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cfierce spirit of liberty,\u201d which only increased as the colonies grew and prospered, arose from several sources.\n\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cfierce spirit of liberty,\u201d which only increased with the growth in the colonies\u2019 size and prosperity, arose from several sources. As descendants of Englishmen, Americans inherited the English notion that liberty depended on the right, exercised through representatives, to have a say in the taxes imposed upon them. The high degree of participation in the popular governments they established throughout the colonies further heightened Americans\u2019 passion for liberty. Their Protestantism, which had \u201csprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world,\u201d inclined Americans to make strong claims on behalf of \u201cnatural liberty.\u201d In the south, the institution of slavery paradoxically amplified slave owners\u2019 attachment to freedom by reinforcing their identification of it with nobility and high station. Throughout the land, avid reading and study, especially of law, increased Americans\u2019 sensitivity to abuses of power and honed their arguments on liberty\u2019s behalf. And finally, the 3,000 miles of ocean separating America from Parliament thwarted responsible oversight by London and weakened the colonists\u2019 willingness to submit to the central government\u2019s authority.\n\nThese powerful and diverse sources nourishing the spirit of freedom in America, according to Burke, made it all but inevitable that arguments marshaled in London against colonists\u2019 demands for greater representation \u2014 including those arguments with respectable grounds in traditional British understandings and practice \u2014 were bound to fall on deaf ears in America. Consequently, Britain had three choices: to remove the immediate cause of the dispute; to prosecute defiant Americans as criminals; or to recognize American demands for representation as unavoidable and reasonable in the circumstances and devise ways to satisfy them.\n\nTo attempt to remove the immediate cause, which was rooted in the colonists\u2019 love of liberty, would be worse than useless, contended Burke, since it would enrage the colonists and deprive England of America\u2019s bounty.\n\nProsecuting the colonists for acts of resistance was no more advisable. Taking a hard line was inconsistent with administering an empire which, grounded as it was in liberty, must allow for challenges to government policy. Crushing the colonists\u2019 resistance to authority would \u201cteach them that the government against which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a government to which submission is equivalent to slavery.\u201d\n\nThe prudent option was for Britain to accommodate American demands for greater self-government. Thus Burke favored granting the colonists limited representation in Parliament on questions of taxation, though not as a matter of right. With the question of right, he wished \u201cto have nothing at all to do.\u201d The legal question, for Burke, counted as \u201cless than nothing.\u201d Rather, \u201cthe question with me is, not whether you have a right to render your people miserable; but whether it is not your interest to make them happy.\u201d Statesmanship went well beyond questions of strict legality, and it took into account much more than crude calculations of utility. \u201cI am not determining a point of law,\u201d Burke declared. \u201cI am restoring tranquility: and the general character and situation of a people must determine what sort of government is fitted for them.\u201d Appreciation of the spirit of liberty common to America and Britain prescribed granting the colonists a measure of representation. And a measure of representation advanced a surpassing British interest, which was \u201cto admit the people of our colonies into an interest in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSuch a policy involved a substantial concession. But it was a concession rooted, Burke asserted, in principles favoring the fortification of liberty and representative government that had consistently informed British government policy. Conciliation itself was \u201cthe ancient constitutional policy of this kingdom.\u201d It reflected the very nature of politics:\n\nAll government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter. We balance inconveniences; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens than subtle disputants.\n\nIn Burke\u2019s estimation, the balance of inconveniences involved in conciliation with America amounted to a particularly good deal for Britain. By allowing English liberties to flourish in the colonies, Britain would encourage the spirit of liberty that made both Britain and America prosperous, reinforce the spirit of liberty at home, and conserve English dominion on a long-term basis since liberty was also a dictate of justice.\n\nFive years later, in his 1780 speech at the Bristol Guildhall which marked the close of his career representing Bristol, Burke offered a trenchant defense of a bill intended to ease the significant disabilities England\u2019s Penal Laws had imposed on Irish Catholics.8 This was a delicate matter for Burke. His father, Richard Burke, was a Protestant who, a few years before Edmund was born in 1729, almost certainly had converted from Catholicism so he could practice law. Burke\u2019s mother Mary Nagle was a Catholic, as was Burke\u2019s wife of 40 years, Jane. Throughout his career, Burke was highly circumspect about his Catholic connections even as his political enemies regularly attacked him as a Catholic sympathizer, a damaging charge in 18th-century British politics. Along with his support for free trade with Ireland and for easing penalties for debtors, Burke\u2019s vigorous advocacy of toleration of Catholics in Ireland caused the loss of his Bristol seat (he went on to represent Malton, a less powerful position). As O\u2019Brien observed in The Great Melody, Burke\u2019s defense of the rights of Catholics is all the more poignant for the personal interests it implicated and all the more impressive for the political costs it exacted.\n\nAccording to Burke, his critics believed that tolerance in Ireland recklessly pushed the demand for justice beyond what his constituents and Britain more generally could bear. In reply, he argued that the reforms he sought reflected the imperatives of liberty in light of the realities of British politics.\n\nThe long view, Burke held, was relevant to the determination of the proper public policy concerning the freedom of those who belonged to the minority faith. Appealing to his constituents\u2019 majority Protestant faith, Burke pointed out that the principle of toleration has roots in the Reformation, \u201cone of the greatest periods of human improvement.\u201d Nevertheless, pockets of intolerance in violation of Protestant principles of liberty persisted in Ireland long after the Reformation, not least in the form of the harsh restrictions imposed upon Catholics. In 1699, the Penal Laws made it a crime punishable by imprisonment to say Catholic Mass or to teach Catholicism. The Penal Laws also required Catholics to renounce their faith or forfeit their land, and set severe limits on professional advancement \u2014 such as those faced by Burke\u2019s father.\n\nOne did not have to rely only on distinctively Protestant principles, however, to condemn the wrongs inflicted on Catholics by the Penal Laws. Universal principles, Burke asserted, also condemned them. The Penal Laws attacked human nature, crippling in their targets \u201cthe rights and feelings of humanity.\u201d They had a \u201ctendency to degrade and abase mankind, and to deprive them of that assured and liberal state of mind which alone can make us what we ought to be.\u201d So terrible was the indignity that Burke would have rather\n\nput a man to immediate death for opinions I disliked, and so to get rid of the man and his opinions at once, than to fret him with a feverish being, tainted with the jail-distemper of a contagious servitude, to keep him above ground an animated mass of putrefaction, corrupted himself, and corrupting all about him.\n\nThe repeal of the Penal Laws was necessitated both by the religious principles held by the vast majority of Britons and by the common humanity all men shared.\n\nOther considerations, grounded in the events of the day, also counseled reform. With toleration gaining ground throughout Europe \u2014 in Holland, Germany, Sweden, and France \u2014 British toleration of Catholics would lend support abroad to Protestant claims to toleration in Catholic countries. And as Catholics were Britain\u2019s best manufacturers, toleration advanced British commercial interests.\n\nBut if toleration was so important, other critics asked, why did Burke support a bill that provided only partial relief from the Penal Laws rather than their outright repeal? Because, answered Burke, prudence so counseled. While outright repeal was not politically attainable, partial relief would provide a \u201cprogressive experience.\u201d By means of incremental steps, \u201cthe people would grow reconciled to toleration, when they should find, by the effects, that justice was not so irreconcilable an enemy to convenience as they had imagined.\u201d\n\nStill others objected that Parliament was acting with undue haste. Burke retorted that Parliament was proceeding too slowly, taking 80 years to undertake the repair of laws that never should have been implemented. And to those who insisted monarchs posed the true threat to freedom, Burke responded that freedom was threatened from many quarters. It could be imperiled just as much by the \u201cstrongest faction,\u201d the tyranny of the majority, and indeed by the rage to rule over others that sometimes wears the mask of freedom:\n\nIt is but too true, that the love, and even the very idea, of genuine liberty is extremely rare. It is but too true that there are many whose whole scheme of freedom is made up of pride, perverseness, and insolence. They feel themselves in a state of thraldom, they imagine that their souls are cooped and cabined in, unless they have some man or some body of men dependent on their mercy.\n\nBecause liberty is subject to abuse in many ways and the true love of liberty is rare, the people\u2019s will must be \u201cconfined within the limits of justice,\u201d which impose toleration as a defining feature of a free society.\n\nIn his 1783 speech on Fox\u2019s East India Bill, Burke once again pressed for reforms based on the conviction that honoring the claims of liberty abroad made liberty at home more secure.9 Attacking what he believed to be Britain\u2019s gross malfeasance in India, the speech was a high point of the cause to which he devoted the greater part of the final decade of his parliamentary career. To his many critics, it seemed that he was consumed with the issue. In fact, Burke went to great lengths to bring to justice Warren Hastings, the first governor-general of Bengal, who effectively ruled India from 1773 until 1775. Burke led the 1787 impeachment of Hastings in the House of Commons and the eight-year prosecution of Hastings at the Bar of the House of Lords, which ended in acquittal in 1795. Even still, Burke\u2019s early entry into the controversy in his speech in support of Charles James Fox\u2019s East India Bill \u2014 Fox was leader of the Whigs but Burke conceived and drafted the bill \u2014 is a model of reasoned political analysis and advocacy. It is notable, as was Burke\u2019s call for conciliation with America and his insistence on tolerance for Ireland\u2019s Catholics, for arguing that Britain\u2019s interest in liberty and the morality of liberty converged, and therefore that reform was simultaneously demanded \u201cby humanity, by justice, and by every principle of true policy.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s interest in robust commerce with India, Burke argued, was inseparable from \u201cthe interest and well-being of the people of India.\u201d But the English East India Company \u2014 established in 1600 by Queen Elizabeth I to promote trade \u2014 had gravely abused its power and ruthlessly exploited its prerogatives. It trampled on native-born Indians\u2019 rights and enervated the country. And in the process, the East India Company eroded British morals and undermined Britain\u2019s national interest. Consequently, Burke believed that restoring Indians\u2019 liberty was a requirement of British self-government: \u201cevery means effectual to preserve India from oppression is a guard to preserve the British Constitution from its worst corruption.\u201d\n\nThe bill Burke championed aimed to alter the charter that established the East India Company\u2019s status as a private company governing India. It would give Parliament responsibility for overseeing the company. Burke\u2019s refutation of the charge that the reform represented an \u201cattack on the chartered rights of men\u201d is of special interest because of its account of the political significance of natural rights and because of the analysis it leads to on the circumstances that justify fundamental alteration of an established institution of government.\n\nBurke contended that by invoking the East India Company\u2019s chartered rights to prevent government intervention, opponents of reform confused the rights created by government with the universal rights governments are established to secure:\n\nThe rights of men \u2014 that is to say, the natural rights of mankind \u2014 are indeed sacred things; and if any public measure is proved mischievously to affect them, the objection ought to be fatal to that measure, even if no charter at all could be set up against it. If these natural rights are further affirmed and declared by express covenants, if they are clearly defined and secured against chicane, against power and authority, by written instruments and positive engagements, they are in a still better condition: they partake not only of the sanctity of the object so secured, but of that solemn public faith itself which secures an object of such importance. Indeed, this formal recognition, by the sovereign power, of an original right in the subject, can never be subverted, but by rooting up the holding radical principles of government, and even of society itself.\n\nVery much in keeping with the larger liberal tradition, Burke held that to be most politically effective, natural rights, which preexist and set standards for political life, require translation through legal codes into concrete guarantees.\n\nWhat are properly called \u201cthe chartered rights of men\u201d are those natural rights that are explicitly affirmed in fundamental legal documents. The Magna Carta, \u201ca charter to restrain power, and to destroy monopoly,\u201d was for Burke an outstanding example. In contrast, \u201cThe East India charter is a charter to establish monopoly and to create power.\u201d It worked to \u201csuspend the natural rights of mankind at large,\u201d allowing the company to administer, as if it were a state power, an enormous territory vital to the commercial interests of Britain as well as to manage \u201cthe lives and fortunes of thirty millions of their fellow-creatures.\u201d However, the political power to rule over another is not a natural right. To the contrary, it is \u201cwholly artificial, and for so much a derogation from the natural equality of mankind at large, ought to be some way or other exercised ultimately for their benefit.\u201d\n\nThe East India Company had enjoyed a trust. By betraying the lawful purposes that brought it into being, the company had nullified the trust. In view of the company\u2019s \u201cplenitude of despotism, tyranny, and corruption,\u201d Burke argued that Parliament was obliged to reassert its responsibility for the equitable and efficient administration of India, to provide \u201ca real chartered security for the rights of men\u201d that the company had \u201ccruelly violated.\u201d\n\nBurke recognized that the revision of the East India Company\u2019s charter he sought was drastic. He justified the drastic reform on the grounds that the East India Company had long persisted in drastic abuses. But the reform, he emphasized, was in no way based on an \u201ca priori\u201d argument against endowing a private company with the political power to administer a vast nation:\n\nWith my particular ideas and sentiments, I cannot go that way to work. I feel an insuperable reluctance in giving my hand to destroy any established institution of government, upon a theory, however plausible it may be.\n\nFurthermore, no established institution of government should be repudiated for the mere existence of abuses in the exercise of its powers, because \u201cthere are, and must be, abuses in all governments.\u201d\n\nBecause of the wisdom embodied in established institutions, Burke held that sweeping change should be contemplated only as a last resort to protect the most basic individual rights and vital national interests.10 Accordingly, fundamental alteration of any established institution of government would have to meet exacting criteria:\n\n1st, The object affected by the abuse should be great and important. 2nd, The abuse affecting this great object ought to be a great abuse. 3d, It ought to be habitual, and not accidental. 4th, It ought to be utterly incurable in the body as it now stands constituted.\n\nAnd the evidence concerning the object, greatness, regularity, and implacableness of the abuse must be as clear as \u201cthe light of the sun.\u201d The bulk of Burke\u2019s speech on Fox\u2019s East India Bill delves into the nitty-gritty of the British administration of India, supplying ample evidence demonstrating that the conduct of the East India Company under the direction of Governor-General Hastings represented an extreme abuse of power that obliged Parliament to implement far-reaching reforms.\n\nBurke\u2019s arguments in behalf of reform of British policy toward India are of a piece with those he puts forward in behalf of reform of British policy toward America and Ireland. They reflect the exacting standard of statesmanship devoted to liberty he espoused in the Reflections:\n\nA disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman. Everything else is vulgar in the conception, perilous in the execution.\n\nAnd by this exacting standard, Burke\u2019s arguments in the name of liberty in favor of reform are of a piece with his arguments in the name of liberty against the revolution in France.\n\nLiberty and political moderation\n\nThe need in free societies to combine and reconcile the principles of conservation and correction imposes formidable demands on the people and on office holders. To be sure, under government of all sorts, policy and law must constantly be adjusted, balanced, and calibrated in light of changing circumstances. But liberty guarantees that circumstances will always be changing, and in fact liberty tends to accelerate the pace of change. One manifestation of the larger challenge is the famous tension between conservatism and capitalism: Capitalism\u2019s constant quest for newer and better products and techniques of production to achieve ever greater profits, and the affluence and luxury that free markets bring, demote tradition, disrupt order, and weaken the virtues of mind and character \u2014 such as self-restraint, industriousness, and thrift \u2014 that support free markets and free political institutions.\n\nThe larger challenge is rooted in the passions. Liberty excites the human love of novelty \u2014 for how can I be free if I must submit to the same old routines? And it goads the human love of dominion \u2014 for how can I be free if others defy my will? By simultaneously encouraging an aversion to authority and a desire for mastery, freedom also tends to provoke a backlash against freedom. The result in free societies is the generation of extreme and conflicting types: radicals who seek to extend government\u2019s rule over others in the name of equality while freeing themselves from rules, and reactionaries who strive to reinstate traditional forms of authority, not only on themselves but on the rest of society. Liberty unrestrained and undisciplined fosters immoderation. Consequently, a government devoted to conserving and correcting freedom will require particular prudence in the art of balancing, or political moderation.11\n\nThe virtue of political moderation is often mistaken for a compromise with virtue, a softening of belief, a diluting of passion, a weakening of will, even an outright vice. But those are examples not of political moderation but of the failure to achieve it. Moderation in politics is not a retreat from the fullness of life but an embrace of it. Political moderation is called into action by the awareness of the variety of enduring moral and political principles; the substantial limits on what we can know and how effectively and justly we can act; the range of legitimate individual interests; the multiplicity of valuable human undertakings and ends; and the quest to discern a common good in light of which we can make moral distinctions and establish political priorities.12 Political moderation underlies self-government understood as the individual\u2019s mastery of his own conduct and understood as a free people\u2019s rule over itself.\n\nNevertheless, the virtue of political moderation will always serve as an inviting target for demagogues who seek to exploit the passion for purity in politics. In the Reflections, Burke warned that one who supports \u201ca scheme of liberty soberly limited\u201d is likely to be accused of lacking \u201cfidelity to his cause.\u201d The purists\u2019 attack on the appeal to reason and the exercise of restraint in behalf of freedom will not end there:\n\nModeration will be stigmatized as the virtue of cowards, and compromise as the prudence of traitors, \u2014 until, in hopes of preserving the credit which may enable him to temper and moderate on some occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose at which he ultimately might have aimed.\n\nBecause of the perennial need to stand firmly against the common slander that political moderation is a feeble disguise for weak-kneed betrayal of principle, political moderation is inseparable from political courage.\n\nSince Burke\u2019s devotion to political moderation was hardly evident to all observers in his time and would have been disputed by many, he was compelled to clarify his beliefs about it. In the final paragraph of the Reflections, written 25 years after he was first elected to Parliament and four years before his retirement, Burke declared that he had been one \u201calmost the whole of whose public exertion has been a struggle for the liberty of others.\u201d Aware that his attack on the French Revolution gave rise to the appearance of inconsistency, he made sense of the seeming contradictions by explaining the underlying reality. Invoking a classical image, he characterized his words and actions as those of a statesman\n\nwho would preserve consistency by varying his means to secure the unity of his end \u2014 and, when the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails may be endangered by overloading it upon one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight of his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise.\n\nTo conserve liberty at a time when the French revolutionaries made extravagant claims on its behalf, Burke fervently championed the claims of tradition, order, and virtue. And when his countrymen failed to grasp its imperatives in their affairs abroad in America, Ireland, and India, he passionately urged reforms that enlarged liberty\u2019s sphere.\n\nThe conservative side of the larger liberal tradition displays variations on the political moderation contained in Burke\u2019s insistence on the importance of combining and reconciling the principles of conservation and correction. In 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, Burke\u2019s contemporary Adam Smith examined the mutual dependence of economic life and virtue. Smith saw that the market economy, which brought prosperity and nourished political liberty, both rewarded moral virtues \u2014 rationality, industry, ingenuity, and self-discipline \u2014 and corrupted workers\u2019 character by condemning them to monotonous labor. He therefore insisted on the need for government to take action by, for example, providing education for workers and limiting the workplace demands imposed on them by manufacturers. In Democracy in America, the first volume of which appeared in 1835 and the second in 1840, Alexis de Tocqueville argued that in the modern era democracy had become necessary and just and that while it fostered a certain simplicity and straightforwardness in manners it also encouraged selfishness, envy, immediate gratification, and lazy acceptance of state authority. To secure liberty, which he believed essential for a well-lived life, it would be necessary to preserve within democracy those nongovernmental institutions \u2014 family, religious faith, and civic associations of many sorts \u2014 that counteracted democracy\u2019s deleterious tendencies. Family, faith, and civic associations taught moral virtue, connected individuals to higher purposes, and broadened their appreciation of their self-interest to include their debts to forebears, bonds to fellow citizens, and obligations to future generations. John Stuart Mill, an admirer of Tocqueville whose voluminous writings feature conspicuously conservative and progressive dimensions, made the case in 1859 in On Liberty that liberty served \u201cthe permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\u201d At the same time, he distinguished between the use and abuse of freedom; defended a rigorous education continuing through university and combining science and humanities to equip individuals for freedom\u2019s opportunities and demands; and favored political institutions that, while grounded in the consent of the governed, were designed to improve the likelihood that elections would bring individuals of outstanding moral and intellectual virtue to public office.\n\nIf a liberal in the large sense is one who believes that the aim of politics is to secure liberty, then Smith, Tocqueville, and Mill are, like Burke, exemplary members of the liberal tradition. Because of their common appreciation that free societies expose individuals to influences that corrode moral and political order and enervate the virtues on which liberty depends, they belong on the conservative side of the liberal tradition. Because of their shared understanding that limits must be imposed on government to protect individual liberty, but that those limits must not sap the energy or impair the authority government needs to secure liberty, their account of self-government emphasizes striking a balance between competing and essential principles. Their political moderation is a reflection of their passion for freedom and their reasoned understanding of the complex conditions that sustain it. The Federalist, the masterpiece of American political thought, embraces the conservative brand of liberal self-government they epitomize and constitutionalizes it."}, {"url": "https://oll.libertyfund.org/person/edmund-burke", "page_content": "1729\u20131797\n\nNationality: English\n\nHistorical Period: The 18th Century\n\nEdmund Burke (1729-1797) was an English political philosopher who is often seen as laying the foundations of modern conservatism.

The original family name was Millington; it was apparently changed due to the singing abilities of the family. Synge came to Ireland at the suggestion of his elder brother George, Church of Ireland dean of Dromore and later bishop of Cloyne (1638\u201341), and was educated in Drogheda and at TCD , where he graduated MA .\n\nOrdained into the Church of Ireland, he was appointed rector of Killary in Meath (1638\u201360) and Drumully in Clogher (1640\u201360), and prebendary of Aghadowny, Co. Londonderry (1640\u201361). At some point he married Barbara Latham (d. 22 December 1677) of New Place, Co. Londonderry; they had at least three sons and five daughters. Noted as a preacher, Synge was chaplain general to the royalist forces in Leinster during the 1640s, and in July 1647 was one of a number of Dublin clergymen to sign a declaration stating their adherence to the Book of Common Prayer. Synge was appointed as a minor canon of St Patrick's cathedral (1647\u201360), and as vicar of Lusk, Co. Dublin (1648\u201361), and Inishannon, Co. Cork (1648\u201361), dean of Elphin (1648\u201360), and archdeacon of Cloyne (1648\u201361). Soon after, he may have been appointed chancellor of Christ Church cathedral by James Butler (qv), marquess of Ormond, but this remains uncertain. However, the potential privileges of these positions were offset by the parlous condition of the Church of Ireland at this time. After 1647 Synge had removed himself to his benefice in Donegal and spent most of the 1650s there. However, he occasionally ministered to Richard Boyle (qv), 2nd earl of Cork. He remained an episcopalian, continuing to use the Book of Common Prayer in the north-west throughout the 1650s. This prompted numerous complaints, but an association with Robert Gorges (qv), clerk of the Irish council, ensured that these were disregarded.\n\nSynge enjoyed good relations with many figures in the ruling elites of Ireland during the interregnum and after the restoration, a fact testified to by his plethora of appointments. His eldest son, Samuel, married a daughter of Archbishop Michael Boyle (qv). In 1660 Edward Synge was nominated to serve on the presidency council of Munster, and on 6 August 1660 was nominated as bishop of Limerick, being consecrated on 27 January 1661; he held the see in tandem with that of Ardfert and Aghadoe. In 1661 he also graduated DD from TCD. Of the ten bishops and two archbishops appointed in 1660, Synge was one of only three who had served in Ireland during the 1650s. In his new position, he was involved in a dispute with Ormond over the ownership of church lands in Limerick. On 21 December 1663 Synge was made bishop of Cork. As with his previous post, he held the sees in tandem. Synge's elder brother, George, who held Cloyne prior to 1641, had been ordered by the then viceroy, Thomas Wentworth (qv), earl of Strafford, to regain diocesan lands lost to figures such as Richard Boyle (qv), 1st earl of Cork, since the sixteenth century. The see was divided in two to facilitate this, but little progress was made prior to 1641; consequently more lands were lost during the interregnum, and the sees were reunited after the restoration. Throughout the 1660s Synge embarked on what became an acrimonious campaign via the acts of settlement and explanation, and the exchequer court, to regain these lands. A good relationship with the Boyle interest ensured that Roger Boyle (qv), earl of Orrery, acted as arbitrator in a number of the ensuing disputes. Synge's exertions were strongly opposed by Murrough O'Brien (qv), earl of Inchiquin, who now occupied some of the holdings; indeed, at one point Inchiquin's men assaulted Synge's son George. However, he succeeded in obtaining much of the outstanding diocesan land; by 1668 his income was calculated at \u00a31,400, and in 1677 he was still receiving leases under the terms of the act of explanation.\n\nIn October 1675 Synge was appointed to a commission dealing with the outstanding arrears of the \u201949 officers. He died 22 December 1678, and after his death the sees were divided. In 1679 Synge's eldest son Samuel attempted to transfer diocesan lands into the possession of the family, but in 1697 this was contested and reversed by the then bishop of Cloyne, Edward Jones. Two of Synge's sons entered the Church of Ireland: Samuel became dean of Kildare, and Edward (qv) enjoyed a distinguished career as archbishop of Tuam."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/30/archives/the-synge-thing.html", "page_content": "If any aspect of Synge's work was given short shrift during this week of intense discussion and dissection, it was his poetry. He didn't write many poems \u2014 or, better to say, he didn't finish many poems but the dozen or so that we accept as fin ished place him in the roster of Irish poets second only to Yeats and Pat rick Kavanagh. Indeed, Robin Skel ton made the point that Synge's po etry had an influence on Yeats, add ed a certain fire and toughness to the great man's armory. As Synge once said, \u201cBefore verse can be hu man it must be brutal.\u201d\n\nIf, as mentioned earlier, the pa pers were the meat of the celebra tion, the receptions were the drink. The scholars were feted by the pro vost at Trinity and by the president at University College; the Minister of Foreign Affairs gave a do at Dublin Castle. Garech de Brun, a member of the Guinness \u201cbeeristocracy,\u201d had the group to his magnificent house in the\u2010Wicklow Hills for tea; and, fol lowing that, this reporter and a earful of Canadians got embarrasing ly lost in those hills en route to an other reception at the Canadian Am bassador's residence.\n\nThe closing ceremonies to the \u201cSynge thing,\u201d as it got to be called, consisted of the unveiling of a plaque at his birthplace, now a busy suburb of semidetached villas. His was a large Georgian house, still stand ing, with a view of his beloved Dub lin mountains. The unveiling was per formed by John Garvin, who is both the Dublin City Commissioner and a noted Joyce scholar \u2014 very Irish, that. A group of a dozen then made a separate pilgrimage to Synge's grave in Mount Jerome Cemetery. It is a quite unmemorable grave for such a great man; his billing on the gravestone is subservient to that of three other Synges; simply \u201cJohn Millington Synge: Born April 16, 1871 Died March 24, 1909.\u201d Standing be fore the grave reminded me of a fa vorite \u2014 and typical \u2014 Synge poem, Glencree\u201d:\n\nMy arms around you, and I lean Against you, while the lark Sings over us, and golden lights and green Shadows are on your bark. There'll come a season when you'll stretch Black boards to cover me: Then in Mount Jerome I will lie, poor wretch, With worms eternally.\n\nBeing in Dublin for the Synge thing afforded an opportunity to find out what else is going on in this city that has, in the past, bred (and exported) more great writers than any city of comparable size in the world. The answer, I'm sorry to say, is not much. As is well known, there is in Dublin a great deal of talk about writing and a certain amount of writing about writing, but writing itself? Not much. Many of the best Irish writers are off in the States or contemplating going off or just back. The problem is economics: the cost of living in Dublin is almost as high as in America; and salaries are only about half, if that. So the writer, who is usually a teacher by profession, is beckoned by the bills of America, where he can put in a year (with a comparatively light teaching load), and return with something in his pockets \u2014 even, perhaps, a contract with an Amer ican publisher.\n\nSeamus Heaney and Benedict Kiely are the poet and the novelist whose works are most eagerly anticipated in Ireland. Both are from Northern Ireland; but in literature, thanks be, nobody pays the slightest attention to that distinction. Neither has a new book in immediate prospect. Heaney (who is currently doing a stretch at Berkeley) had two collections of po etry published in recent years by the Oxford University Press in New York and Kiely (who did his time at Hollins College) has had a half\u2010dozen novels and a book of stories brought out in the States by various publish ers. Sadly enough, his latest novel, and a fine romp it is, \u201cDogs Enjoy the Morning,\u201d never found an Amer ican roosting place. \u201cToo Irish,\u201d they all said.\n\nThe novel that is looked forward to most is \u201cBalcony of Europe\u201d by Alden Higgins, whose \u201cLangrishe, Go Down\u201d got fine reviews in the States a few years back. But Higgins, who has been living on the Continent re cently, keeps fiddling with this all but\u2010completed novel; the public and his publisher wait. The most prolif ic writer of quality is the literary editor of The Irish Times, Terence de Vere White, whose novel \u201cThe Lam bert Revels\u201d was well\u2010received in America not long back and who will have a new one, \u201cThe Minister for Justice,\u201d coming out from Gambit this September. Altogether Mr. de Vere White has had eight novels and eight books of history, travel and au tobiography published in England, and is currently at work on a his tory of the Anglo\u2010Irish.\n\nThere is, as always in Ireland, a lot of activity in the publishing of poetry; and some of it finds its way to America. The ebullient Trinity Col lege professor, Brendan Kennelly, who will be at Swarthmore all next year, will soon have his first Amer ican book, a volume of selected po ems, done by Dutton's. John Monta gue, a Northern poet who spends a lot of his time in France and the United States, has just had a collec tion, \u201cLedges,\u201d published by The Swallow Press and is putting the finishing touches on what promises to be his most important work to date, \u201cThe Rough Field.\u201d And Austin Clarke, who is the Grandest Old Man of Irish Letters resident in Ireland (Padraic Colum is in the States) will have a \u201cSelected Poems\u201d (selected by a younger Irish poet, Richard Weber) brought out soon by the Uni versity of Massachusetts Press."}, {"url": "https://www.irishphilosophy.com/2014/01/27/synge-friend-and-father/", "page_content": "Edward Synge was born around 1690 and died in Dublin on the 27th January, 1762. He was the son of the elder Edward Synge, who was himself involved in the philosophical debates of the time.\n\nHe was educated in Trinity College Dublin (M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728) and after being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s (1726), was successively bishop of Clonfert (1730), Cloyne (1731), Ferns (1733), and finally Elphin (1740 until his death).\n\nSynge was close to Francis Hutcheson and appears to have been a member of the Molesworth Circle. He assisted Hutcheson in developing revising his work and Hutcheson himself acknowledged that Synge had devised the general scheme of \u201cInquiry into Beauty and Virtue\u201d before Hutcheson. The connection seems to have continued after Hutcheson\u2019s departure for Glasgow and until his death, since his son dedicated the posthumous collection of his father\u2019s works to Synge . Letters from the 1760s from Edward Synge giving advice to the younger Hutcheson still exist.\n\n\n\nSynge was also friendly with George Berkeley who, like Hutcheson, was living in Dublin at the same time.\n\nDespite his connections, Synge\u2019s work in philosophy is minor, and is centred in the areas of moral and political philosophy. He argued for limited toleration (as his father before him had done), most notably in the sermon of 23rd October 1725 which he preached to the members of the House of Commons while prebendary of St Patricks. The sermon drew acclaim and was printed. It also drew vehement disagreement from the Church of Ireland vicar of Naas, Stephen Radcliffe, who wrote a 45 page pamphlet opposing the arguments of the sermon. Edward Synge wrote a vindication of his sermon in reply, along with a detailed outline of a possible oath that might be acceptable to Catholics\n\nStephen Radcliffe advocated using force against those who were unorthodox in their religious opinions. Synge argued that force ought not be used by magistrates against the religiously unorthodox \u201cif the publick civil interests are in no way affected\u201d, aligning himself with Locke (and Francis Hutcheson). Like Locke, however, while he says everyone has a right to worship according to his conscience, atheists are beyond the pale since their beliefs are destructive of society. But otherwise \u201call persons in a society, whose principles of religion have no tendency to hurt the public, have a right to a toleration.\u201d\n\nIn his reply to Radcliffe and following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Synge put forward his own version of an oath that might be acceptable to Catholics, and a proposal that the country accommodate 500 secular priests to serve the Catholic community. He made no other proposals regarding the Penal Laws, but noted that the limitations put on Catholic ownership of land meant they turned to trade, and held their wealth in money. Money was not as good a guarantor of their peaceful behaviour as money, and money could be used in revolt more readily\n\nSynge had six children, only one of whom, Alicia (1733-1807) survived into adulthood. Synge was widowed in 1737 and when he was promoted to Bishop of Elphin Alicia stayed in the family home in Kevin Street. Synge lived in Roscommon in the summer, and with her in Dublin for the parliamentary winter term. While separated he wrote her a series of letters, collected as The Synge Letters. Bishop Edward Synge to His Daughter Alicia, Roscommon to Dublin 1746-1752. Extracts have also been printed in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (extracts on google). These letters give insight into the paternal relationship to daughters, and education and care of girls in the 18th century. They have been described as his most enduring legacy.\n\nSynge died in office on 27 January 1762, aged 71.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDavid Berman (2004) \u201cSynge, Edward, the younger (c. 1690-1762)\u201d in Thomas Duddy (ed) Dictionary of Irish Philosophers, pp. 322-323\n\nRobert Dunlop, \u201cSynge Edward\u201d in <Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 55\n\nPatrick Fagan (1991) Dublin\u2019s Turbulent Priest: Cornelius Nary 1658-1738, Dublin:Royal Irish Academy \u2013 on the Radcliffe controversy.\n\nThe Synge Letters.

In an astonishing paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy ( ... 1950) he was able, for the first time, to penetrate and explore in detail the region inside the Schwarzschild radius ( what we now call a black hole ) . At a time when many relativists thought that it did not even make sense to talk about this region, this work is very remarkable indeed.\n\n1972\n\n12\n\n1992\n\nEvery one of the other 88 % has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression.\n\n200\n\n11\n\nEvery single book and every single paper is a remarkable work of art.\n\n1956\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that hardly a single space-time diagram is to be found in the standard texts on relativity before Synge's own presentation in 1956 . To many, the 1956 book came as a revelation. Here was a royal road to relativity which did not involve precarious juggling with factors of 1 \u2212 v 2 c 2 \\sqrt{1 - \\Large\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} 1 \u2212 c 2 v 2 \u200b \u200b . The pervasive influence of the book can be traced in much of the best research in the last fifteen years [ this written in 1971] , with its new emphasis on invariant geometrical characterisation.\n\n1956\n\nSplitting hairs in an ivory tower is not to everyone's liking and no doubt many a relativist looks forward to the day when governments will ask his advice on important questions.\n\nThose who have attended J. L.'s lectures well remember the effectiveness with which they were delivered. J. L. was by no means inattentive to achieving such effectiveness. Once, upon opening a public lecture he posed the question, if I recall correctly, as to whether a scientific lecture is to be compared with a theatrical performance, a religious sermon or a circus.\n\n1943\n\n1961\n\n1964\n\n... a kind and generous man.

The origin of the name \"Synge\" is described in the introduction to General relativity : papers in honour of J L Synge :-John Synge's mother, Ellen Price, was of Scottish origin, being descended from the Scottish Stuarts, in particular a Sir William Stuart who went to Ireland in the early seventeenth century.After being educated at St Andrews College in Dublin, Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin in. There his achievements were quite remarkable, winning a Foundation Scholarship at the end of his first year. This scholarship was normally won by students in their third year of study. He was awarded his B.A. inin Mathematics and Experimental Physics. He received the Large Gold Medal for his outstanding work.After graduating, Synge was appointed to a lectureship in mathematics at Trinity College, but he only held the post for a short time, leaving for Canada in. fromtoSynge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. Then inhe returned to Trinity College, Dublin where he was elected to a fellowship and also appointed to the chair of Natural Philosophythe older name for PhysicsInSynge headed back to North America and again was appointed to the University of Toronto, this time as Professor of Applied Mathematics.

InSynge was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University, then, three years later, as Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburg. He also spent a short time as ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force duringInhe returned to Ireland to take up the post of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This School, which had been set up when the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies had been founded in, had several outstanding members including Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger who was also a Senior Professor.P S Floridesdescribes the range of topics that Synge worked on:-Synge's most important contributions to theoretical physics were, in many respects, the product of his great skill and insight as a geometer:-Synge retired inand during his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies about% of all workers in relativity theory studied there. Professor Hermann Bondi , who gave the first J L Synge Public Lecture in, remarked:-During his long scientific career, Synge published overpapers andbooks. Three of his books were aimed at providing an understanding of science to a wider audience and, with such a fine expository style, he was well suited to write such works. As Florides says in:-Synge's classic, written in, had a large influence:-The preface to thework contains the delightful thought:-Synge's skill at communication was not only a gift that he had for writing, but also a gift in lecturing. His son-in-law Douglas Dryer wrote:-Those who were fortunate enough to have attended Synge lectures say that he combined all three.Synge received many honours for his work. The greatest of these was probably his election as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was president of the Royal Irish Academy fromtoHe is described inas:-As to hobbies, Synge was a keen cyclist, was passionately interested in sailing and painted some very fine compositions. In particular he painted a picture representing Schr\u00f6dinger held in the hand of God contemplating unified field theory.Synge was a member of a highly talented family. We mention three other members of the family. First John Millington Synge, John Lighton Synge's uncle, who was a playwright and a powerful poetic dramatist who portrayed the primitive life of the Aran Islands and the western Irish coast. Secondly there was Richard Laurence Millington Synge, Nobel laureate for Chemistry in, who shared the Prize for Chemistry with A J P Martin for their development of partition chromatography, a method used to separate mixtures of closely related chemicals such as amino acids for identification.

Two days ago I received the book 'Hutchie \u2013 The Life and Works of Edward Hutchinson Synge (1890-1957)'. I learned a lot very quickly, and I'm delighted that we are having this symposium today devoted to the genius of Edward Hutchinson Synge, and to launch a book in his memory.\n\nAs most of you here will know, 'Hutchie' was the nephew of playwright John Millington Synge, and was the older brother of John Lighton Synge, the outstanding mathematician and theoretical physicist. It is my great privilege to welcome the members of the Synge family here today. I would like to extend a special welcome on behalf of the College to Professor Cathleen Synge Morawetz, niece of Edward Hutchinson, who is herself an eminent mathematician.\n\nYou will hear today of the life of this remarkable man, and I won't even attempt to sketch it here, except to say that EH Synge was a Foundation Scholar in mathematics at Trinity in 1910. However, he didn't graduate and he did his work as a recluse at his home in Dundrum.\n\nToday's symposium, almost a century after Edward Hutchinson Synge left Trinity, will shed some light on his remarkable scientific achievements and relatively unknown life in all its tragic complexity. I would like to welcome the guest speakers who are with us today to contribute to this process, particularly those who have travelled from the UK.\n\nI would like to thank the School of Physics for organising today's symposium. A huge thanks to Professors John Donegan, Denis Weaire and Petros Florides for organising the special commemorative publication. This book republishes the papers of EH Synge together with a short biographical memoir which for the first time provides some insight into his life. It is my pleasure to officially launch this book this morning.\n\nDuring a week when we remember those from past generations whose legacies have advanced Trinity's reputation in the world, it is very appropriate that we pay tribute to this unique person \u2013 this man whose headstone reads \u2018Scientist-Inventor\u2019. Indeed I think it says something about the immutability of Trinity's values that we still do things like this, and I feel everyone here is proud that we can raise EH Synge there alongside his brother, John Lighton Synge, and his hero William Rowan Hamilton whose life work he had been instrumental in having published.\n\nI now declare the symposium open and hope that you all enjoy this special programme of events to commemorate Edward Hutchinson Synge.\n\nSee addresses mainpage"}, {"url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/25/12/36/pdf", "page_content": "We apologize for the inconvenience...\n\nTo ensure we keep this website safe, please can you confirm you are a human by ticking the box below.\n\nIf you are unable to complete the above request please contact us using the below link, providing a screenshot of your experience.\n\nhttps://ioppublishing.org/contacts/"}, {"url": "https://www.irishphilosophy.com/2013/06/24/middle-edward-synge/", "page_content": "Writing about Bishop Edward Synge requires some care. There were three of them, all related. The Edward Synge who is the subject of this post was the son of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. He was also the nephew of George Synge (1594\u20131653), bishop of Cloyne; and the father of Bishops Edward Synge (1691\u20131762) and Nicholas Synge (1693\u20131771).\n\nEdward Synge the Elder, as we will distinguish him from his father and son, was born in Inishannon, Cork on 6 April 1659. After his education in Cork, Oxford and Dublin he was rector in Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136) and then vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork (1686-1706). In that period he wrote his first major work A Gentleman\u2019s Religion (1693), originally published anonymously.\n\nAfter the challenge of John Toland\u2019s Christianity Not Mysterious (1696), Edward Synge added an appendix to later editions of Gentleman\u2019s Religion (David Berman suggests as a direct response.) Toland had argued that religious mysterious such as the Holy Trinity could not be properly part of Christianity since they could not be believed, since they were contrary to or above reason.\n\n\n\nWhile Synge shares Toland\u2019s rationalism, he disagrees that there can be no mysteries in religion. Synge says that, though mysteries cannot be contrary to reason, they can be \u201cabove reason\u201d when the \u201cproposition is in itself true, but we are unable to clearly to apprehend or form a Notion or Conception of the things contained under the Terms of it.\u201d Such things a person may have sufficient reason to give assent to. Synge cites a conversation with a blind man, who had no memory of sight whatsoever. Synge asked him if he had any idea of colour or light at all; the blind man replied that he had often tried to gain such an idea, but had failed. He had theorised, says Synge, that others were attempting to fool him by speaking of colours and sight, but their ability to do things that the blind man could not eventually convinced him that they could indeed see. So, concludes Synge, in the same way Scripture can indicate truths that human reason cannot grasp itself.\n\nIn making a defence along these lines, Synge joined others such as Peter Browne. After recommendations from William King Archbishop of Dublin, Synge was promoted, becoming Chancellor of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Dublin (1705\u20131714) and then Bishop of Raphoe (1714\u20131716).\n\nHe wrote his second major work in 1715 A Plain and Easy Method whereby a Man of Moderate Capacity may arrive at Full Satisfaction in all Things that concern his Everlasting Salvation. This book aimed to present the Christian faith in an accessible and rational manner \u2013 so rational in fact that Browne attacked it as too close to Toland, since it left no room for faith. This suggestion that Synge had deistic leanings was sharply replied to by Synge. It didn\u2019t affect his career, since he was then elevated to Archbishop of Tuam (1716\u20131741).\n\nSynge argued for toleration in religion, despite joining Archbishop King in resisting the Toleration Act (1719) which gave rights to protestant dissenters. Synge believed that Catholics and Dissenters should not be prosecuted unless they were a real danger to the state and put forward an oath of allegiance that he hoped Catholics would be able to take, allowing them rights in civil society. This was supported with reservations by Cornelius Nary, a Catholic priest who replied to Synge\u2019s A Charitable Address to the Catholics of Ireland resulting in a series of printed tracts back and forth. In the introduction to Synge\u2019s last pamphlet in the debate, he put forward the following theory: \u201cThat men may live virtuously and holily in this life, and be eternally happy in the next, and that God may thereby be glorified in their salvation, is the only end and design of religion\u201d .\n\nLecky says that Synge had great influence with the gentry of Ireland, even more than Archbishop King. Modern commentators would agree he was one of the most influential religious commentators of his time, publishing nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts in his lifetime. Edward Synge bishop of Tuam died on 24th July, 1741.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theatre-research-international/article/abs/synge-scholarship-nothing-to-do-with-nationalism/E49F1C1A62AF51F0EECF65EE7B01A8D4", "page_content": "John Millington Synge (1871\u20131909) is the fulcrum upon which Irish drama and theatre studies is balanced. Synge's nodal position is predicated upon the dramatist's rock \u2018n\u2019 roll recalcitrance towards the dramaturgical praxis of his contemporaries; his subject matter was as shocking as the Anglo-Irish idiom in which it was articulated. After Synge's premature death in 1909, W. B. Yeats's fundamental concern was that Synge scholars would attempt \u2018to mould . . . some simple image of the man\u2019.Footnote 1 However, W. J. McCormack's concentric biography of Synge, The Fool of the Family: A Life of J. M. Synge,Footnote 2 and Ann Saddlemyer's The Collected Letters of John Millington Synge,Footnote 3 have demonstrated that Synge's life was complex, multifaceted and in deep dialogue with Irish culture. But with respect to Synge's drama a simple image has surrounded critical discourse: the politics of Irish nationalism.\n\nIn Synge's playlet National Drama: A Farce, the dramatist debunked Irish theatre's impetus to \u2018hold up a mirror to the Irish Nation\u2019, maintaining that \u2018an Irish drama that is written in Ireland about Irish people, and not on a foreign model will and must be national in so far as it exists at all\u2019.Footnote 4 But what keeps scholars coming back to a negotiation of Irish nationalism in Synge's plays is his curious relationship with Anglo-Irish Ascendancy. Synge held a familial allegiance with the class formation known as the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy, which had a traditional monopoly on all forms of Irish capital (economic, social, symbolic). Accordingly, Synge's drama has been considered as an articulation of Anglo-Irish nationalism as advocated by Daniel Corkery, who, in Synge and Anglo-Irish Literature,Footnote 5 propagated Irish nationalism apropos of Synge's plays to the extent that they have become irretrievably concomitant with the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy's battle for political hegemony. Nicholas Grene's Synge: A Critical Study of the Plays did much to reconcile this reductive logic by pointing out that Synge simply did not care for national identity politics, least of all Anglo-Irish national identity politics.Footnote 6 Therefore the postulation that Synge's drama is indexical of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy's battle for hegemony is speculative because, as Grene points out, with respect to the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy, Synge saw \u2018nothing but repressiveness, hatred and decadence\u2019.Footnote 7 Much of the scholarship that followed in Grene's wake \u2013 such as Declan Kiberd's Synge and the Irish Language,Footnote 8 and Mary C. King's The Drama of J. M. Synge Footnote 9 \u2013 continued to model Synge as the exception to Ascendancy rule \u2013 as the Anglo-Irish renegade who developed a deep understanding of Irish culture. Kiberd, for example, adroitly demonstrated Synge's knowledge of the Irish language to advocate that the dramatist staunchly believed \u2018in a fusion of the two Irelands, Gaelic and Anglo-Irish, so that neither should shed its pride\u2019.Footnote 10\n\nWhat was at stake for these scholars was an alternative reading of Synge's plays that tried to distance the dramatist from the sterile formalism of Anglo-Irish nationalism. Synge was acutely concerned with the cultural cost of Irish nationalism and his dramaturgy privileges those cultural formations that did not harmonize within Irish nationalism. Sin\u00e9ad Garrigan Mattar's Primitivism, Science, and the Irish Revival is a concentric analysis of Synge's \u2018intense engagement with scientific compartivism\u2019, which allowed the dramatist to account for the cultural cost of nationalism.Footnote 11 Garrigan Mattar points out how Synge used evolutionary and anthropological discourses to intervene in the colonial stereotype, which the dramatist feared would haunt Irish culture after independence from British rule. This is why Kiberd's essay \u2018J. M. Synge \u2013 Remembering the Future\u2019 in his Inventing Ireland: The Literature of the Modern Nation is particularly apposite.Footnote 12\n\nHowever, the ethics that predicated Synge's articulation of those cultural logics that lurked between architectural fissures of Irish nationalism was brought into critical discourse by Paul Murphy's essay entitled \u2018J. M. Synge and the Pitfalls of National Consciousness\u2019, which first appeared in Theatre Research International and was expanded upon in his seminal work Hegemony and Fantasy in Irish Drama 1899\u20131949.Footnote 13 Murphy's intervention in Synge scholarship gave credence to the supposition that Irish nationalism apropos of Synge's plays was redundant, but he complicated this by pointing out that Synge's plays were driven by Anglo-Irish anxieties as well as by issues of gender and class disparity. Murphy turned Irish nationalism apropos of Synge's drama on its head by interrogating those classed and gendered formations that had little or no access to political hegemony. The blame for this inequity was, according to Murphy, due to Synge's Anglo-Irish allegiance and to the fact that Synge's dramaturgical praxis was driven by \u2018the Ascendancy trait of constructing the peasantry as fantasy objects which function as the key component in an ideological assault on [Catholic] bourgeois economics and a defence of aristocratic virtues\u2019.Footnote 14 Murphy's paradigmatic shift re-established the question of Synge's Anglo-Irish heritage within critical discourse and it has called for a concentric consideration of Synge's ethics when staging those disenfranchised and, at times, subaltern formations.\n\nMany scholars choose to ignore the question of Synge as Anglo-Irish peasant fetishizer and this, in turn, has produced some extremely rewarding scholarship \u2013 mostly emanating from the annual Synge Summer School in Ireland's County Wicklow. Nicholas Grene's Interpreting Synge: Essays from the Synge Summer School: 1991\u20132000 renegotiates Synge's life and work to foreground just how much of a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll kid Synge was in the Ireland of his time.Footnote 15 R. F. Foster's essay in that collection, \u2018Good Behaviour: Yeats, Synge and Anglo-Irish Etiquette\u2019, demonstrates how Synge struggled to conform to the received conventions of Anglo-Irish propriety. This is substantiated by Angela Bourke's essay in the same collection, \u2018Keening as Theatre: J. M. Synge and the Irish Lament Tradition\u2019, where Synge's religious iconoclasm is foregrounded through his staging of a prepolitical and pre-Christian ritual (the keen) on a stage of national\u2013popular, even Catholic, sovereignty.\n\nPatrick Lonergan, the current director of the Synge Summer School, has succeeded in bringing Synge scholarship (traditionally a literary terrain) into a dialogue with performance studies and discourses on globalization. Lonergan's Synge and His Influences: Centenary Essays from the Synge Summer School is a valuable collection of scholarship that articulates what Synge was influenced by and whom he has succeeded in influencing.Footnote 16 Melissa Sihra's essay in the collection, \u2018Re-Location and Re-Locution: Adapting Synge\u2019, reveals how Synge's dramaturgical praxis has been successfully adapted across the globe; Synge scholarship is a truly globalized discourse. But as Anthony Roche reminds us, Synge will always haunt the pages and the stages of Irish theatre.Footnote 17 Samuel Beckett could only think of one playwright who had a deep resonance on his praxis,Footnote 18 and one of Ireland's most popular contemporary playwrights, Marina Carr, continually returns to Synge's plays for aesthetic inspiration.Footnote 19 Synge would have understood why. Like all rock stars, he felt that no one else could please the crowd in the same way he could: \u2018it just happens that I know Irish life the best, so I made my methods Irish\u2019.Footnote 20"}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Synge,_Edward", "page_content": "\u200bSYNGE, EDWARD (1659\u20131741), archbishop of Tuam, second and younger son of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, was born on 6 April 1659 at Inishannon in co. Cork, of which parish his father was at the time vicar.\n\nThe family belonged to Bridgnorth in Shropshire, where the name appears originally to have been Millington. According to tradition, they acquired the name of Sing or Synge from the sweetness of voice of one of the family.\n\nGeorge Synge (1594\u20131653), uncle of the younger Edward, born at Bridgnorth in 1594. was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 16 Feb. 1610, graduated B.A. on 21 Oct. 1613, and M.A. on 12 June 1616. Subsequently he went to Ireland, where he found a warm patron in Christopher Hampton [q. v.], archbishop of Armagh, who constituted him vicar-general of his diocese and dean of Dromore; in which capacity his \u2018so eloquent, so godly, so very leaud, railing, cursing censure\u2019 of James Croxton\u2019s attempts at auricular \u200bconfession had, but for the generally disturbed state of the kingdom in 1638, drawn down upon him the vengeance of Archbishop Laud (see Prynne, Canterburies Doom, p. 195; Strafford, Letters, ii. 185, 212, 249). On 11 Nov. 1638 he was consecrated bishop of Cloyne at Drogheda; but on the breaking out of the rebellion in October 1641 he fled for safety to Dublin. In February 1644 he was sworn of the Irish privy council, and on the death of Dr. John Maxwell (1590?\u20131647) [q. v.] in February 1646\u20137 was nominated to the archbishopric of Tuam; but, failing to obtain possession on account of the war, he returned in the following year to Bridgnorth, where he died in 1653, and was buried on 31 Aug. in the church of St. Mary Magdalene. He was the author of a learned reply to the Jesuit Malone\u2019s answer to Archbishop Ussher, entitled \u2018A Rejoinder to the Reply, published by the Jesuits under the name of William Malone,\u2019 Dublin, 1632.\n\nIt was at his suggestion that his younger brother, Edward Synge (d. 1678), then a mere boy, but destined for the church, likewise repaired to Ireland. Having received a sound education at the school at Drogheda and Trinity College, Dublin, he was, after taking orders, preferred to the rectory of Killary in the barony of Lower Slane, co. Meath. In 1647 he was appointed a minor canon of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, and shortly afterwards vicar of Inishannon in co. Cork, and dean of Elphin. During the rule of the Commonwealth he persisted in using the English liturgy in all the public offices of his ministry, being secured from prosecution by his interest with Dr. Gorge, the then auditor-general. He was consecrated bishop of Limerick on 27 Jan. 1661, and on 21 Dec. 1663 translated to the united sees of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. He died on 22 Dec. 1678, having acquired a reputation as a singularly able preacher. Of his two sons, Samuel the elder, having graduated B.A. from Christ Church College, Oxford, on 26 Nov. 1674, proceeding M.A. on 3 July 1677, became dean of Kildare on 17 April 1679, and, dying on 30 Nov., was buried in the family vault in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard, near Archbishop Marsh\u2019s library, on 2 Dec. 1708.\n\nEdward, the younger son, after being educated at the grammar school at Cork, was admitted a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1674, and graduated B.A. in 1677, but on his father\u2019s death returned to Ireland, finishing his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was admitted ad eundem, and took the degree of M.A. Having been ordained priest and deacon, he was preferred to the two small parishes of Laracor and Augher in the diocese of Meath, being both together of about the yearly value of 100l. These he afterwards exchanged for the vicarage of Christ Church, Cork, of the same value, but one of the heaviest cures in Ireland. Here he remained for more than twenty years, his income having been in the meantime increased to about 400l. a year by the gift of certain small benefices tenable with his cure. In 1699 he was offered the deanery of Derry, but declined it out of regard for his mother, who was unwilling to leave Cork. He was chosen proctor for the chapter in the convocation summoned in 1703, and was shortly afterwards nominated by the lord-lieutenant, the Duke of Ormonde, to the deanery of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin. But the right of election being claimed by the chapter, a compromise was effected through the mediation of Archbishop William King [q. v.]; John Sterne [q. v.] (afterwards bishop of Clogher) succeeding to the deanery and Synge to the chancellorship, with the parish of St. Werburgh annexed. He was installed on 2 April 1705, and during the next eight years that he resided in Dublin he established a reputation for himself as one of the most industrious clergymen and popular preachers in the city. At the same time he took his degree of D.D., and on Sterne\u2019s promotion to the see of Dromore, having been appointed by Archbishop King his vicar-general, he was chosen to represent the chapter of St. Patrick\u2019s in the convocation that met in 1713. On 7 Nov. 1714 he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe in the church of Dunboyne, co. Meath, by the archbishop of Cashel, and on 8 June 1716 was translated to the archbishopric of Tuam, including the ancient sees of Enaghdune and Kilfenora, together with the wardenship of Galway. He was enthroned at Kilfenora on 7 Nov., and one of his earliest actions, and that which gained him the goodwill of his clergy, was the resignation, in pursuance of an old scheme of the Earl of Strafford for improving the livings in his diocese, of the \u2018quarta pars episcopalis\u2019 or fourth part of the tithes, which his immediate predecessors had nevertheless enjoyed [see Vesey, John, archbishop of Tuam, and for a full discussion of the subject Ware\u2019s Works, ed. Harris, i. 619]. To this end he procured an act of parliament in 1717 settling it permanently on such rectors, vicars, and curates as personally discharged their cures. In 1716 he was admitted a privy councillor, and in that and the two following years was one of the keepers of the great seal in the absence of the lord high chancellor. Like King himself, he \u200bfell into disfavour with the government owing to his opposition to the Toleration Bill in 1719, which he thought calculated to promote the growth of popery (Report of his speech, Addit. MS. 6117, ff. 107\u201321), and, in consequence of having in the following spring alluded to the act as a reason for greater zeal in preaching against popery, he was charged with stirring up disaffection against the state. But from this charge he \u2018acquitted himself so well that it dropped of itself,\u2019 and in 1721 he was again included in the commission for administering the great seal. He died at Tuam on 24 July 1741, and was buried in the churchyard of his cathedral at the east end of the church. He desired that no monument should be erected to his memory; but the capital of the ancient cross of Tuam placed over his grave testifies to the universal respect in which he was held.\n\nSynge was a man of considerable learning, but his writings, consisting of short tracts and sermons, of which there is a full if not complete list in Nichols\u2019s \u2018Literary Anecdotes\u2019 (i. 378), were chiefly devoted to the promotion of practical piety. A number of them (some thirty-four) were after his death collected and published in 4 vols. 12mo, London, 1744. Of these, several, having passed through many editions during his lifetime, have since been adopted, and frequently reprinted for general distribution, by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. It has been said of Synge that his life was as exemplary as his writings were instructive; that what he wrote he believed, and what he believed he practised. As the son of one bishop, the nephew of another, himself an archbishop, and the father of two other bishops, his position in ecclesiastical biography is probably unique.\n\nSynge\u2019s two sons, Edward and Nicholas, were both graduates of Trinity College, Dublin; the former proceeding M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728; the latter M.A. in 1715 and D.D. in 1734. Edward, from being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, was on 28 May 1730 elevated to the bishopric of Clonfert, being consecrated by his father in St. Werburgh\u2019s Church, Dublin, on 7 June. Subsequently he was translated to Cloyne on 21 March 1731, to Ferns on 8 Feb. 1733, and to Elphin on 15 May 1740. He died at Dublin on 27 Jan. 1762, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Feb. Nicholas, having been collated to the archdeaconry of Dublin in 1743, was on 26 Jan. 1746 consecrated bishop of Killaloe. He died in December 1770, the fifth and last prelate of the family, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Jan. 1771.\n\n[Biographia Britannica based on a memoir contributed by the archbishop\u2019s son Edward and practically reprinted in Chalmers\u2019s Biographical Dictionary; Wood\u2019s Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ed.

In one year - 1917 to 18 - all six were at the School at the same time.\n\nThey were, and no doubt still are a remarkable family. The brothers were the sons of the Rev. Francis Synge, vicar of various parishes, including Pitcombe (from 1914 to 1924). They all entered the Junior School in Plox House when they were nine or ten years old, and most stayed at King\u2019s until they were eighteen. Three became Head Boy, several were Scholars, and most were accomplished sportsmen. After leaving school, five went on to university at either Oxford or Cambridge, and three joined the Church.\n\nEdward (KS 1910-19), the first born, was awarded, in 1919, the first Paul Hobhouse Scholarship, the same year he became Head Boy. He went on to Keble College, Oxford, then took Holy Orders and worked for many years in India.\n\nJohn (KS 1910- 20) was equally successful, and he had the distinction of becoming the Captain of the first King\u2019s School rugby XV in 1919, as well as Head Boy. He won a place at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he was an Exhibitioner, and subsequently he followed a career in teaching.\n\nThen there were the twins:\n\nFrancis (KS 1912-21), a Scholar and School Prefect, followed John to Selwyn College, where he was awarded the Stewart of Rannoch Prize for Hebrew and gained a 1st Class in the Theology Tripos. He then took Holy Orders and moved to South Africa and subsequently New Zealand, finishing as a Canon.\n\nand\n\nGeorge (KS 1912-18) was another Scholar. He left before the Sixth Form, going on to Shrewsbury School and then Keble College, following in Edward\u2019s footsteps.\n\nAfter a successful time at King\u2019s, Peter (KS 1914-22) spent most of his working life in the Army and in Government Service in Africa. His two sons - Patrick (KS 1949-54) and Anthony (KS 1949-58) - also came to King\u2019s.\n\nFinally, there was Michael, another talented sportsman who played in the rugby XV and hockey XI, and who was Head of School in his final year. He went up to King\u2019s College, Cambridge as a Choral Scholar, and afterwards he took Holy Orders. He was Chaplain on the RNVR Mediterranean Russian Convoys in the 2WW, and later Canon and then Precentor of Lincoln. He re-founded the Lincoln Cathedral Choir School in 1961.\n\nAfter the First World War, rugby replaced football as a major sport at King\u2019s. Here is the 1st XV, with John Synge (seated, centre) as Captain."}]}
