Tadeusz Szeligowski was born in 1896 in the city of Lw\u00f3w (or Lvov), which at that time was under the control of Austria. Although he received a doctorate in law, he also had a well-rounded musical education in Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, and (later) in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas. Paris between the two world wars had a decisive effect on him, and when he returned to Poland in 1931, he gave up law in order to devote himself entirely to music \u2013 teaching, composing, and conducting. He was among the original founders of the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic, and served as its first music director between 1947 and 1949. Between 1950 and his death in 1963, he was a leading musical figure in Pozna\u0144, teaching at that city's conservatory and organizing major musical events.\n\nThis composer is not entirely new to CD \u2013 there's flute sonata out there, and a wind quintet \u2013 but all five of the works on this new Naxos CD are receiving their first commercial recordings here. The Comedy Overture (1952), which starts things off, isn't literally a curtain-raiser. It's just a bright and unpretentious introduction to the composer. The annotations (co-authored by conductor Smolij) suggest a resemblance between this work and Kabalevsky's Colas Breugnon overture, and I think that's right on the money. Next come Four Polish Dances (1954), and Szeligowski dresses them up so grandly that their folk origins are almost hidden. (Indeed, the outer portions of the \"Korow\u00f3d\" sound like what Elgar might have written on an Eastern European vacation.) The Piano Concerto (1941) is in a diverting neoclassical style that doesn't give much of a hint, except for the lightly melancholy second movement \u2013 that World War Two was raging through and around Poland as it was composed. Here, hints of Elgar have been replaced with hints of Poulenc, perhaps as a souvenir of Szeligowski's years in Paris. The extended Nocturne (1947) is lushly orchestrated, and exhales an atmosphere of magic and veiled eroticism. Finally, the Concerto for Orchestra (1930), composed while Szeligowski was in Paris, is an assured, attractive work, even if it doesn't approach later works in this genre by Bart\u00f3k or Szeligowski's younger countryman Lutos\u00bbawski. It is more modern in style than the other works on this CD, but still very digestible.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic is a top-notch ensemble, and they do their founder proud with the performances on this CD. Smolij, an up-and-coming conductor, makes an excellent case for this music. Czapiewski sparkles in the concerto, and gives substance to its middle movement.\n\nOnce again, Naxos is to be praised for making virtually unknown music available to the masses in excellent performances, and at an almost give-away price.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008, Raymond Tuttle"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/tadeusz-szeligowski", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski was born on 13 September, 1896 in Lviv, Ukraine, is a Polish composer.

He was born on 13 September 1896 in Lw\u00f3w \u0096 then in Austrian-controlled Polish Galicia, now L\u0092viv in the Ukraine. He attended the Lw\u00f3w Conservatoire and later at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, where he received a doctorate in 1922. His early career included that of repetiteur at the Krak\u00f3w Opera and a period practising law in Wilno - now Lithuanian Vilnius. He became heavily involved in the musical life of Wilno and Szeligowski decided to continue his musical studies, moving to Paris where he studied with both Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas between 1929 and 1931. There he met fellow composers Prokofiev, Enescu and Honegger and also encountered the music of Milhaud and Poulenc. Following his return to Poland he eventually settled in Pozna\u0144 where he remained for the rest of his life, becoming the leading light in the city\u0092s musical and educational life.\n\nAll five works on this CD are receiving their first recordings. The Comedy Overture of 1952, not unreasonably likened to Kabalevsky\u0092s Colas Breugnon in the booklet notes, is a suitably attractive, if insubstantial, curtain-raiser. The Four Polish Dances date from two years later and reflect the time when many Polish composers - including Lutos\u0142awski and Panufnik - were looking to folk music for inspiration. The first-movement Korow\u00f3d is a Polish round-dance in duple time with a certain archaic nobility as expressed here. The Walc lubelski is a waltz from the Lublin area of Poland and would not be completely out of place in a Prokofiev ballet. The Sielanka third movement is a carefree idyll rather than a dance, while the final Oberek \u0096 a form of mazurka \u0096 proved to be the most appealing movement for me; a somewhat rustic dance complete with folksy solo violin.\n\nThe Piano Concerto dates from 1941. It is decidedly neo-classical in style and betrays his studies in Paris. It immediately brought similar works by Poulenc, Ravel and Prokofiev to mind. The atmospheric Andante slow movement has a strangely Caucasian sound to it to my ears. I was reminded of shadows of Khachaturian while listening to it. The soloist in this recording is Bogdan Czapiewski, a past finalist in the Busoni and Montreal Piano Competitions in the mid-1970s. His biography claims an extensive discography but this seems to be the only recording of his currently available. He is certainly an able and committed advocate of this music and makes a very good case for the concerto.\n\nThe Nocturne at once betrays the influence of the years Szeligowski spent in Paris but this time in a very different way. Gone is the Poulenc-like neo-classicism. It is replaced by a very Debussian exoticism. On repeated listening to this CD, the Nocturne turned out to be my favourite piece. Finally on this disc, Szeligowski\u0092s Concerto for Orchestra is the earliest piece here. It is also the most contemporary in the impression it makes. It is actually only the second \u0091Concerto for Orchestra\u0092 written as far as I can tell \u0096 only the Hindemith work of that name from 1925 pre-dates it. Being written in 1930, Szeligowski\u0092s Concerto for Orchestra precedes better-known works by Kod\u00e1ly (1939), Bart\u00f3k (1943) and his compatriot Lutos\u0142awski (1954). The Concerto is a substantial three-movement work of some twenty-four minutes. The first is by far the longest and gets under way without any ado, immediately revealing its more modern-sounding musical world, including some quite original writing at, for example, 3:51. There is an extended - almost too extended - violin solo at the end of the first movement which ingeniously melts into an effective motor-like passage at 10:28 shortly before the movement\u0092s close. I was interested to note the ringing-on tam-tam at the end, a device Rakhmaninov later used at the end of his Symphonic Dances of 1941. I wonder if he had heard the Szeligowski piece? The second movement reminded me a little of Honegger slow movements, or the more menacing passages from some of his film scores. The very brief third movement shows some of the folk music influences which would surface again in the music of Lutos\u0142awski some twenty years later. All in all, an enjoyable work.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic Orchestra under its founder Mariusz Smolij is obviously a fine band of players. They prove excellent advocates for the music of Pozna\u0144\u0092s first musical son. The Auditorium of the Adam Minkiewicz University provides a warm yet clear acoustic which is very well caught by the recording engineers.\n\nFor anyone interesting in filling the gap between Szymanowski and Lutos\u0142awski in Polish music, this CD provides a fascinating snapshot. Here is a composer who often betrays his influences more than revealing a truly original voice. However, he proves to be an excellent craftsman of agreeable and very digestible music.\n\nDerek Warby\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/szeligowski-tadeusz", "page_content": "Szeligowski, Tadeusz\n\nSzeligowski, Tadeusz, notable Polish composer and pedagogue; b.

His works include the operas The Rise of the Scholars, Krakatuk and Theodor Gentlemen, the ballets The Peacock and the Girl and Mazepa ballets, two violin concertos, chamber and choral works.\n\nAs a music teacher, Szeligowski was very well established in Vilnius, Lublin, Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw. He was also a respected music writer who frequently wrote for journals and magazines specialized in music such as the Kurier Wile\u0144ski, Tygodnik Wile\u0144ski, Muzyka and the Kurier Pozna\u0144ski. His achievements include the creation of the Poznan\u00b4 Philharmonic, where he served as its first director between the years 1947-1949, and the founding of the Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring, one of the most important festivals of contemporary music at the time.\n\nRead more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Szeligowski"}, {"url": "http://www.classical.net/music/recs/reviews/n/nxs70371a.php", "page_content": "CD Review\n\nTadeusz Szeligowski Comedy Overture\n\nFour Polish Dances\n\nPiano Concerto *\n\nNocturne for Orchestra\n\nConcerto for Orchestra * Bogdan Czapiewski, piano\n\nPozna\u0144 Philharmonic Orchestra/Mariusz Smolij\n\nNaxos 8.570371 DDD 76:48\n\nI was feeling pretty pleased with myself for knowing Pan Twardowski, a ballet by Ludomir R\u00f3\u00f3ycki (1884-1953), a contemporary of Szymanowski, but here's a Polish composer I knew absolutely nothing about until this CD caught my eye. Tadeusz Szeligowski was born in 1896 in the city of Lw\u00f3w (or Lvov), which at that time was under the control of Austria. Although he received a doctorate in law, he also had a well-rounded musical education in Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, and (later) in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas. Paris between the two world wars had a decisive effect on him, and when he returned to Poland in 1931, he gave up law in order to devote himself entirely to music \u2013 teaching, composing, and conducting. He was among the original founders of the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic, and served as its first music director between 1947 and 1949. Between 1950 and his death in 1963, he was a leading musical figure in Pozna\u0144, teaching at that city's conservatory and organizing major musical events.\n\nThis composer is not entirely new to CD \u2013 there's flute sonata out there, and a wind quintet \u2013 but all five of the works on this new Naxos CD are receiving their first commercial recordings here. The Comedy Overture (1952), which starts things off, isn't literally a curtain-raiser. It's just a bright and unpretentious introduction to the composer. The annotations (co-authored by conductor Smolij) suggest a resemblance between this work and Kabalevsky's Colas Breugnon overture, and I think that's right on the money. Next come Four Polish Dances (1954), and Szeligowski dresses them up so grandly that their folk origins are almost hidden. (Indeed, the outer portions of the \"Korow\u00f3d\" sound like what Elgar might have written on an Eastern European vacation.) The Piano Concerto (1941) is in a diverting neoclassical style that doesn't give much of a hint, except for the lightly melancholy second movement \u2013 that World War Two was raging through and around Poland as it was composed. Here, hints of Elgar have been replaced with hints of Poulenc, perhaps as a souvenir of Szeligowski's years in Paris. The extended Nocturne (1947) is lushly orchestrated, and exhales an atmosphere of magic and veiled eroticism. Finally, the Concerto for Orchestra (1930), composed while Szeligowski was in Paris, is an assured, attractive work, even if it doesn't approach later works in this genre by Bart\u00f3k or Szeligowski's younger countryman Lutos\u00bbawski. It is more modern in style than the other works on this CD, but still very digestible.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic is a top-notch ensemble, and they do their founder proud with the performances on this CD. Smolij, an up-and-coming conductor, makes an excellent case for this music. Czapiewski sparkles in the concerto, and gives substance to its middle movement.\n\nOnce again, Naxos is to be praised for making virtually unknown music available to the masses in excellent performances, and at an almost give-away price.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008, Raymond Tuttle"}]}
