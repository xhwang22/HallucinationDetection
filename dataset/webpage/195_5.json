The decision made by the board of governors of the institute was the result of an international movement that urged the officials to re-evaluate their plans of demolition. In fact, the administration plans to \u201cbring down at least 14 of 18 dorms which were built between 1968 and 1978\" for showing \"problems of leakages from the roof, dampness in walls, leakages in toilet walls, slabs, etc.\u201d, was abandoned.\n\nAccording to historian Robert McCarter, the unique buildings of Kahn created a new campus experience. In fact, he said that \u201cWhat really makes those buildings work is the air that comes through individual rooms and then goes out into the shared space and then is evacuated from the building, so you get constant ventilation.\u201d He also added in The Architect\u2019s Newspaper that these dormitories were built using the same technology, as the main buildings that just underwent a successful renovation, explaining that there is no reason not to continue with this process.\n\nAfter various stakeholders wrote to the management and board with many online petitions, the BOG reconsidered his initial choice. Many petitions and letters made their way, with the mobilization of figures of the international architecture scene such as MoMA\u2019s Glenn Lowry and Martino Stierli. Sarosh Anklesaria, Riyaz Tayyibji, Shubhra Raje, T. David Fitz-Gibbon Professor of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University created a petition as soon as the news broke, collecting 700 signatures including Pritzker laureates Balkrishna Doshi, Rafael Moneo, and Alejandro Aravena, Tatiana Bilbao, Annabelle Selldorf, and Marlon Blackwell.\n\nOn January 1st, BoG chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla and other members of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad issued a letter explaining that \u201cwe are. [\u2026] withdrawing the expression of interest that was put out. We will deliberate on the feedback received, reevaluate the options, consult the best global conservation and structural experts, and chart out a course of action, which the institute will communicate in due course\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the letter stated that \u201cMany of you have been writing in ever since the Expression of Interest was put up for the design of the student housing at the main campus of the institute. You have sought to remind us that the dormitories designed by Louis Kahn are a cultural legacy and that these buildings are to be seen as an integral part of the ensemble of buildings that constitute the campus\u201d. Finally, the BoG addressed its initial concerns of safety and stated that it will look into better solutions that protect the legacy of Louis Kahn and ensure the needs of the future.\n\nInfo via The Times of India and The Architect's Newspaper."}, {"url": "https://www.adb.org/who-we-are/organization/board-governors", "page_content": "Afghanistan Mohammad Khalid Payenda (Information as of July 2021) Governor for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the Asian Development Bank\n\nActing Minister of Finance\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nPashtunistan watt\n\nKabul, Afghanistan\n\nPhone: +93202924000 (ofc); Nazir Kabiri (Information as of July 2021)\n\nDeputy Minister for Policy\n\nMinistry of Finance of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\n\nKabul, Afghanistan\n\nPhone: +93 (0) 20 2924009, +93 (0) 795 126206\n\n[email protected] Alternate Governor for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in the Asian Development BankDeputy Minister for PolicyMinistry of Finance of the Islamic Republic of AfghanistanKabul, AfghanistanPhone: +93 (0) 20 2924009, +93 (0) 795 126206\n\nArmenia Vahe Hovhannisyan\n\nMinister of Finance\n\nMinistry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia\n\n1 Melik-Adamyan Street\n\nYerevan, 0010\n\nRepublic of Armenia\n\nPhone: (37411) 800002/800080\n\n[email protected] ; [email protected] Governor for Armenia in the Asian Development BankMinister of FinanceMinistry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia1 Melik-Adamyan StreetYerevan, 0010Republic of ArmeniaPhone: (37411) 800002/800080 Eduard Hakobyan\n\nDeputy Minister of Finance\n\nMinistry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia\n\n1 Melik-Adamyan\n\nYerevan, 0010\n\nRepublic of Armenia\n\nPhone: (37411) 800055\n\n[email protected] ; [email protected] Alternate Governor for Armenia in the Asian Development BankDeputy Minister of FinanceMinistry of Finance of the Republic of Armenia1 Melik-AdamyanYerevan, 0010Republic of ArmeniaPhone: (37411) 800055\n\nAustralia Jim Chalmers MP\n\nTreasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia\n\nParliament House\n\nCanberra ACT 2600\n\nAustralia\n\nFax: +61 2 6273 3420\n\nPhone: +61 2 6277 7340\n\n[email protected] Governor for Australia in the Asian Development BankTreasurer of the Commonwealth of AustraliaParliament HouseCanberra ACT 2600AustraliaFax: +61 2 6273 3420Phone: +61 2 6277 7340 Stephen Jones MP\n\nAssistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services\n\nPO Box 6022\n\nParliament House\n\nCanberra ACT 2600\n\nAustralia\n\nPhone: +612 6277 7230\n\n[email protected] Alternate Governor for Australia in the Asian Development BankAssistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial ServicesPO Box 6022Parliament HouseCanberra ACT 2600AustraliaPhone: +612 6277 7230\n\nAzerbaijan Samir Sharifov\n\nMinister of Finance\n\n83, Samed Vurgun Street\n\nAZ1022, Baku\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nFax: 99412 4044720 / 21\n\nPhone: 0099412 4044701\n\n[email protected] ; [email protected] Governor for Republic of Azerbaijan in the Asian Development BankMinister of Finance83, Samed Vurgun StreetAZ1022, BakuAzerbaijanFax: 99412 4044720 / 21Phone: 0099412 4044701 Mikayil Jabbarov\n\nMinister of Economy\n\nUzeyir Hajibeyli Street 84, Government House\n\nBaku AZ1000\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nFax: (99412) 490-2404\n\nPhone: +994124938867\n\n[email protected] Alternate Governor for Republic of Azerbaijan in the Asian Development BankMinister of EconomyUzeyir Hajibeyli Street 84, Government HouseBaku AZ1000AzerbaijanFax: (99412) 490-2404Phone: +994124938867\n\nBangladesh A H M Mustafa Kamal\n\nMinister for Finance\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nEconomic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance\n\nSher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka\n\nBlock # 6, Ground Floor\n\nBangladesh\n\nFax: +8802-9514404, +8802-48110580\n\nPhone: +8802-48121100, +880-2-9514477\n\n[email protected] ; [email protected] Governor for People's Republic of Bangladesh in the Asian Development BankMinister for FinanceMinistry of FinanceEconomic Relations Division, Ministry of FinanceSher-e-Bangla Nagar, DhakaBlock # 6, Ground FloorBangladeshFax: +8802-9514404, +8802-48110580Phone: +8802-48121100, +880-2-9514477 Sharifa Khan\n\nSecretary, Economic Relations Division\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nRoom: 03, Block: 08\n\nSher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka.\n\nBangladesh\n\nFax: +8802-9180788\n\nPhone: +8802-48117636; +8801-844274269 (mobile)\n\n[email protected] Alternate Governor for People's Republic of Bangladesh in the Asian Development BankSecretary, Economic Relations DivisionMinistry of FinanceRoom: 03, Block: 08Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Dhaka.BangladeshFax: +8802-9180788Phone: +8802-48117636; +8801-844274269 (mobile)\n\nBhutan Namgay Tshering\n\nFinance Minister\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nP.O.

The Group has 50,000 employees worldwide and over five hundred thousand shareholders."}, {"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/board-of-governors.asp", "page_content": "What Is a Board of Governors?\n\nA board of governors is a group of people appointed to oversee the management of an institution. The U.S. Postal Service, the BBC, the World Bank, numerous colleges and universities, as well as professional organizations (such as the CFA Institute), and regulatory bodies (such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)), all have boards of governors.\n\nIn the financial world, the best-known board of governors is that of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States.\n\nKey Takeaways A board of governors oversees an organization's operations, including financial matters.\n\nThe most well-known board of governors in the U.S. is the Federal Reserve, whose responsibilities include analyzing domestic and international economic developments and overseeing operations of the Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nIn a corporation, a board of directors is an appointed group that oversees the business.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nA competent and well-organized board of governors is seen as a key component of the success of an organization.\n\nUnderstanding a Board of Governors\n\nThe U.S. central bank's board of governors is composed of seven individuals who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Members of the board of governors serve 14-year terms, running on a staggered basis to ensure continuity.\n\nLegally, appointments to the board are to consist of a \"fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country.\u201d In practice, appointments have predominantly been of academics and former banking professionals.\n\nOnly one governor can represent a Federal Reserve District.\n\nDuties of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\n\nThe board of governors has seven of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy. The current Federal Reserve Board has six members, with one vacancy as of May 2022.\n\nThe presidents of five of the 12 regional Reserve Banks make up the remaining members of the FOMC.\n\nThe chair of the Fed\u2019s board of governors is responsible for chairing the FOMC.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board:\n\nAnalyzes domestic and international economic developments\n\nSupervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks\n\nHas responsibility for America's payments system\n\nOversees and administers most consumer credit protection laws\n\nThe board has authority over changes in reserve requirements, and it must approve any change in the discount rate initiated by a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nMembers of the board frequently testify before congressional committees on the economy, monetary policy, banking supervision and regulation, consumer credit protection, and financial markets.\n\nThey are also responsible for supervising the work of the regional Fed banks, including approving budgets and appointing directors.\n\nChairs of the Board of Governors\n\nThe current Federal Reserve Chair is Jerome Powell. Recent, notable chairs of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors include:\n\nJanet Yellen, the first female chair to be appointed, served from 2014 to 2018\n\nBen Bernanke, who led the Fed from 2006 to 2014 and oversaw a range of unconventional monetary policy actions to address the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the recession that followed\n\nAlan Greenspan, whose time as chair spanned nearly 20 years and four presidential administrations\n\nThere have been a total of 16 Chairs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve of the United States.\n\nBoard of Governors vs. Board of Directors\n\nNon-profit organizations, government divisions, and higher academic institutions typically have a board of governors as their governing body rather than a board of directors. Corporations, as required by law, have a board of directors appointed to oversee financial decisions and business operations.\n\nWhen two or more boards exist within an entity, the board of governors often reigns supreme as the decision-making authority.\n\nWho Are the Current Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve? A maximum of seven governors can serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The members of the current Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve are Jerome H. Powell, Michael S. Barr, Lael Brainard, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Philip N. Jefferson, and Christopher J. Waller.\n\n\n\nWho Nominates and Confirms the Fed Board of Governors? The governors of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve are nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\nWhy Are the Fed Governors Appointed for Staggered 14-Year Terms? The purpose of the staggered terms is to ensure stability and continuity.\n\n\n\nWho Is the Current Chair of the Federal Reserve? The current chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome H. Powell. He was sworn in for a second four-year term on May 23, 2022. He assumed the role following his confirmation in February 2018.\n\nWhat Are the 12 Banks of the Federal Reserve? The 12 banks of the Federal Reserve are the Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Minneapolis, Dallas, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta, Boston, New York, Richmond, and Philadelphia.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA board of governors is a group of highly qualified individuals responsible for overseeing and managing an institution. Most institutions, from corporations to nonprofit organizations to media outlets to government bodies have a board of governors. The most well-known board of governors is that of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board."}, {"url": "https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/about/governance/leadership/board", "page_content": "Mark Lazberger CFA Board Chair and Executive Committee Chair Member of CFA Societies Australia\n\nMark Lazberger, CFA, has had a career in investment management with more than 35 years\u2019 experience in global leadership roles working in Australia, Europe and Asia.
