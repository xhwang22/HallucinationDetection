{"Danny Smith was previously the special teams coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2007 to 2018.": [{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/team/coaches-roster/danny-smith", "page_content": "Danny Smith is in his 11th season with the Steelers as the special teams coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.\n\nSince joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).\n\nIn 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the NY Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history withat least 200 career field goals made.\n\nIn 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).\n\nSmith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.\n\nUnder the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.\n\nBoswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.\n\nBoswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.\n\nWide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).\n\nBoswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts \u2014 kicks within one minute of regulation \u2014 during the 2017 regular season.\n\nIn 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with 6 (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (5). Since 1960, his 5 made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).\n\nBoswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (6) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.\n\nThough Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.\n\nPrior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.\n\nThrough his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.\n\nBerry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.\n\nIn 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.\n\nIn the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.\n\nIn Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.\n\nIn addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.\n\nPrior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.\n\nPrior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).\n\nSmith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.\n\nSmith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86)."}, {"url": "https://pro-football-history.com/coach/952/danny-smith-bio", "page_content": "Danny Smith\n\nCoaching Record\n\nYears Coached Record Win % Playoff record Playoff win % 29 226-221-3 50.56% 5-12 29.41%\n\nBiography\n\nCareer Summary\n\nDanny Smith is a football coach in the National Football League (NFL) and has been the special teams coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2013.

With a month before contracts officially expire, and the new league year begins, the Steelers will need to start game planning their future.\n\nIn this series we will look at every position group of the Pittsburgh Steelers and what the team will do with the players that were on the 2021 roster, and how they should rebuild the spots heading into the 2022 season!\n\nToday we breakdown the Steelers\u2019 Special teams units. While they aren't the flashiest players on the team, this group still represents a third of the game and are a big part in winning or losing a football game. It was a weird year for the \u2018teamers in 2021, and they will have to be better moving forward.\n\nThe 2021 Roster\n\nChris Boswell (1-Year $4.94 Million)\n\nPressley Harvin III (3-Years $845K)\n\nChristian Kuntz (1-Year $825K)\n\n2021 was an interesting year for the Steelers special teams players. There were moments of brilliance and moments of flat out ineptitude. When the year started Pressley Harvin III looked to be one of the new golden boys of football as a punter. By the time the season ended he was a scapegoat on this team and now there\u2019s talk about replacing him. He did experience more tragedy than a normal human should off the field within the last calendar year. With that said, there is reason for hope that Harvin will bounce back heading into the future.\n\nChris Boswell was his consistent self, as usual. The Steelers kicker was once again one of the best in football and if it wasn\u2019t for Justin Tucker making a ridiculous field-goal in Detroit, I believe he makes the All-Pro team. The only problem was when special team\u2018s coordinator, Danny Smith decided to let Boswell roll out on a fake field goal pass against the Cleveland Browns. The play got Boswell de-cleated and knocked out for the rest of that game. Thankfully, the Steelers still held on to win, but that decision could have proven to be a very costly one.\n\nFinally, Christian Kuntz won the battle for the long snapping job during the preseason. He was steady all year long and relatively unnoticeable. That\u2019s everything you could ask for out of a long snapper.\n\nShould they look to add a player\n\nThe Steelers are in no rush to do anything drastic with their core special teamers. I do think they need to bring in another punter for competition for Pressley Harvin III. Aside from bringing in a punter, most likely an undrafted free agent, I would also consider a Chris Boswell extension to not only lower his cap hit slightly this season, but to make sure he remains a Steeler for the rest of his career. Aside from that, I am not worried about any more moves within the special-teams ranks.\n\nHow should the group look in 2022\n\nRealistically, and probably the best option moving forward, is the core three players from last year remaining the same in 2022. Allow Pressey Harvin III an offseason to not just get back to his normal self after facing so much tragedy in his life, but also to improve after his first season as a professional. Chris Boswell should be a Steeler until he no longer wishes to play football, and Christian Kuntz should continue to be the guy snapping the ball in the middle. If Harvin can regain form, I think this could be one of the best special team trios in the league. But the big question remains, can Harvin get back to that place?\n\nBut what do you think? What should the Steelers Special Teamers look like at the start of the 2022 season?

The enthusiastic and fiery personality of Smith has always caused me to smile and think about two other NFL coaches. The first is former Philadelphia Eagles and St. Louis Rams Head Coach Dick Vermeil. The other is current Seattle Seahawks Head Coach Pete Carroll. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I neglected to mention that both of those gentlemen have a Lombardi Trophy residing at the center of their trophy cases. That common denominator seems to bode well for Danny Smith.\n\nAt the beginning of our conversation, I mentioned that special teams could be a positive or negative component on any NFL team in terms of the year-by-year performance of the players assigned to special teams. Smith pointed out that: \u201cIt can be a hard evaluation process, especially for new players coming out of college, because college punt coverage is different than NFL punt coverage.\u201d\n\nHe continues on: \u201cThe footwork, the assignments and the rules of coverage. They\u2019re a lot different in college, so when you get young guys coming in trying to transition to the NFL, they\u2019re trying hard but they\u2019re just working at what they were taught.\u201d\n\nAlthough many special teamers may be destined for future NFL stardom, Smith says that there is a time-honored process that determines what first-year players or any other players will be placed on special teams. \u201cThose decisions are made after a long training camp and the three preseason games that we play. That is where our evaluation process has an advantage over colleges. Sorting (through) some of that stuff is not the part that\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s teaching them the skill set. Carrying out the details of an assignment at this level sometimes can be difficult. Teams in the NFL have great reputations: not only for special teams that can provide a spark for their offense but for their defense as well.\u201d\n\nWe also talked about the occasions that may dictate that a specific game plan to defend against a star wide receiver for the opposing team that might be back to receive punts or kicks. Smith talked about when the offense of the Black and Gold is set to receive the ball and how game plans are created to neutralize an opposing team\u2019s defensive standout that can potentially break up your blocking wedge at best, creating poor field position or at the very worst, create a turnover for the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars as they do but the NFL is a game of matchups.\u201d\n\nWhen Danny Smith refers to matchups, a perfect example that comes to mind for me was a 2007 Monday Night Football matchup between the Steelers and Ravens. In that game, James Harrison had a potential Hall of Fame performance. \u201cDeebo\u201d was simply a walking wrecking ball on defense and special teams that will more than likely never be repeated. He recorded 3.5 sacks, six quarterback hits, three forced fumbles and an interception as the Steelers battered the Ravens, 38-7.\n\nWhen I reflect on that Steelers/Ravens game, Danny Smiths words are ringing in my ears in an almost prophetic-like fashion\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars and the NFL is a game of matchups\u2026\u201d\n\nWell in this case it was not about matchups because on that fateful Monday night in 2007 at Heinz Field, the Baltimore Ravens could not in any way, shape or form find a matchup to stop James Harrison. The performance by Harrison also possibly provided a shot in the arm for Steelers\u2019 first-year Head Coach Mike Tomlin. When we push the fast forward button, in January of 2013, Tomlin hired Danny Smith as the Steelers\u2019 Special Teams Coordinator. Since he was hired, Smith, with his wisdom and energy, has become the perfect fit for the Steelers.\n\nDanny Smith recognizes and realizes the \u201cguillotine syndrome\u201d associated with being a special teams coach: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to come back on the next play,\u201d he says in a rather matter-of-fact manner. \u201cWhatever happened on the (previous play) has to be corrected, immediately. We have a one-play series and one shot. We\u2019ve been consistent and will continue to be. You\u2019re always looking for the big play. We created a few of them a year ago, but that don\u2019t mean a damn thing about this year.\u201d\n\nDanny Smith is the perfect man for the almost perfect job in the Pittsburgh Steelers coaching hierarchy. Why? Well, because he is not covertly using his job as a springboard or stepping stone to be elevated to a higher coaching position elsewhere. He is satisfied and proud of his coaching performance, as he should be. He is valued and appreciated by the players, the coaches and the fans. As far as the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 \u201cuniversity of special teams\u201d is concerned, Coach Danny Smith is not striving to be the, \u201cbig man on campus:\u201d Danny Smith is the campus.\n\nAbout Post Author"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/football-insider/wp/2013/01/30/special-teams-coach-danny-smith-leaving-for-pittsburgh-steelers/", "page_content": "Gift Article Share\n\nLongtime Redskins special teams coach Danny Smith has accepted the same position with the Pittsburgh Steelers, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed Wednesday. Smith, who has coached Washington\u2019s special teams since 2004, received permission to interview with the Steelers earlier this week. He has long been pursued by opposing teams, but the Redskins have always worked to keep him on staff.\n\nThe Steelers asked to interview Smith in 2010, but were denied. But the Redskins allowed Smith to interview with his hometown team this offseason. Smith still has family in the Pittsburgh area.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the best coaches, from a technician standpoint. Very detailed and just a great motivator. He brought a passion and fire that really spread throughout the building,\u201d special teams captain Lorenzo Alexander said. \u201dGuys loved playing for him and not just because of the football aspects, but because you could really tell he cared about you off the field too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe made it an honor to play special teams,\u201d Alexander added. \u201cA lot of places, it\u2019s like you\u2019re not good enough to play offense or defense so they throw you on special teams and let\u2019s see what happens. But Danny approached it with the mindset that special teams can help decide the outcome of games if guys really took pride in it. He will definitely be missed.\u201d\n\nSmith came under scrutiny early this season when Washington had two punts blocked. But his unit improved as the season progressed and finished in solid statistical standing.\n\nWashington ranked 16th in the league on kickoff returns this season, with a 23.5-yard average, and 17th on punt returns (9.3 ypr). The kickoff return average marked an improvement on last year\u2019s 22.1-yard-per-return average. The Redskins averaged 8.9 yards per punt return in 2011. They ranked 12th in the league on kickoff coverage with an average of 23.0 yards allowed per kick return. On punt coverage, Washington allowed 8.2 yards per return, eighth in the NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kicking game solidified when the Redskins signed Kai Forbath to replace Billy Cundiff six weeks into the season. Forbath went 17-for-18 on field goals, and by making the first 17 attempts of his career, set an NFL record for first-year kickers.\n\nEarlier this offseason the Redskins lost receivers coach Ike Hilliard to the Buffalo Bills. He and Smith are the only coaches to depart so far\n\nIn 2010, Washington hired Richard Hightower to serve as Smith\u2019s assistant. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Smith\u2019s departure would affect Hightower\u2019s status.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://www.pittsburgh-blitz.com/team/coaches/", "page_content": "Mike Tomlin became the 16th head coach in Steelers history when he replaced Bill Cowher on Jan. 22, 2007.\n\nTomlin, 34, was the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 defensive coordinator in 2006 after spending the previous five seasons (2001-05) as defensive backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

That\u2019s usually because the only thing fans pay attention to is returns, and especially kick returns, but the reality is that his units have typically performed better than are given credit for.\n\nOriginally hired by Mike Tomlin in 2013, the 66-year-old is now heading into his eighth season leading Pittsburgh\u2019s special teams units, and has 25 years of coaching under his belt. This year, of course, is unlike any other because of the Covid-19 pandemic that seems likely to force most, if not all teams, to play games in front of empty seats. More than 60 players chose to opt out of the season.\n\nAt least to the best of my knowledge, I don\u2019t believe there has been a single coach choosing to opt out, though several officials have, in spite of the fact that their population would tend to be at much higher risk of suffering an adverse reaction if they were to contract the coronavirus.\n\nFor Smith, though, there really wasn\u2019t much of a decision to make. As he told reporters earlier today before practice, this is his life. \u201cI don\u2019t do nothing but coach football\u201d, Brooke Pryor quoted him as saying. \u201cI don\u2019t have hobbies, I don\u2019t have nothing.

Needless to say, the same goes for the coaching staff, and they have a number of coaches who are well within their 50s and 60s.\n\nThat will provide the team with a lift, a continued stability that some other teams will lack. But for Smith, change is a continual part of his job, because the special teams \u2018roster\u2019 more than any other changes year over year.\n\nRarely has he ever, for example, had the opportunity to keep the same kick returner in consecutive seasons. This year, we may see rookie running back Anthony McFarland step into that role, taking over for Ryan Switzer, who has started the past two seasons there. Switzer was also the punt returner, but that job now appears to belong to Diontae Johnson, who was named a second-team All-Pro for his return work in 2019.\n\nWith key losses of players like Anthony Chickillo, Tyler Matakevich, Johnny Holton, and Roosevelt Nix, as well as Sean Davis, Smith will have his hands full trying to figure out which new faces will be able to help him out, and where, and to do so without the benefit of a preseason. It will be a challenge, to say the least. But it\u2019s probably the sort of thing that he lives for."}, {"url": "https://steelersdepot.com/2021/09/danny-smith-says-punter-battle-was-tight-praises-jordan-berrys-professionalism/", "page_content": "End to end, the battle to be the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 2021 punter was a close one. Heading into roster cutdowns, it was unclear which direction the team planned to go. Stick with veteran Jordan Berry or opt for rookie Pressley Harvin III. Ultimately, it went in Harvin\u2019s favor, beating out Berry, but speaking to reporters Wednesday, special teams coordinator Danny Smith noted how close the fight was.\n\nThat video comes courtesy of ESPN\u2019s Brooke Pryor.\n\nDanny Smith said the punting competition between Jordan Berry and Pressley Harvin was incredibly tight. Of Berry, he said: \u201che punted better than he ever has.\u201d pic.twitter.com/pHG4UEFl62 \u2014 Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) September 1, 2021\n\n\u201cIt was a real battle,\u201d Smith told Pryor and reporters. \u201cIt really was. Pressley handled it well and met challenges.\u201d\n\nHarvin impressed out of the gate in practice and in-game, stealing the headlines with a new perfect performance in the Hall of Fame Game against Dallas, including dropping one punt inside the one-yard line. And though Harvin had a bit of inconsistency to his game, his elite-level hangtimes and big leg, along with being a reliable holder, won him the job.\n\nSmith went on to praise Berry\u2019s performance and how he handled the situation.\n\n\u201cHe punted better than he ever has\u2026Jordan was a real pro. And I knew that and thought that about him. He went above and beyond. He helped that kid. He was a real teammate and those kinds of things. I thought we had two NFL punters, I really did.\u201d\n\nBerry\u2019s 2020 play after being brought back by the team coupled with his 2021 preseason performance should be enough to get him a look from another NFL team at some point during the season, even knowing punting jobs are hard to come by. It\u2019s not easy for any veteran to help mentor someone who could take your job. But Berry stepped up.\n\nFor Pittsburgh, they had two tough decisions to make at punter and long snapper and ultimately went with two new starters in Harvin and Christian Kuntz. But it was a good problem to have. There are teams around the league, and certainly years in Pittsburgh, where it was difficult to find one solid punter. Hopefully Harvin sticks around as the guy as long as Berry did."}, {"url": "https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/danny-smith.html", "page_content": "About\n\nSpecial teams coordinator for the Redskins from 2004 to 2012, before moving to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe graduated from Edinboro State.\n\nTrivia\n\nHe was one of the coaches of Georgia Tech when they split the NCAA Championship with Colorado in 1990.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAssociated With\n\nHe joined Mike Tomlin's coaching staff for the Steelers in 2013."}]}
