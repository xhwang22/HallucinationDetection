As hard as they worked, it\u2019s unlikely that assistants Joe Sacco, Kevin Dean or Chris Kelly will be front-line candidates.\n\nThe Bruins want a new presence and a fresh thinker to take over the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Cam Neely and general manager Don Sweeney identified two areas of deficiency under Cassidy\u2019s watch: optimal player performance, especially that of younger ones, and five-on-five offensive production.\n\nTo management, the former was more troubling than the latter.\n\nThe 57-year-old Cassidy had high demands of young players. He believed in fair but firm guidance until NHL principles became second nature for youngsters. This troubled Jake DeBrusk to the degree that the 2015 first-rounder made his desire to leave quite clear. There may have been others who were not as public with their requests.\n\n'Players being afraid to make mistakes': Management believed Bruce Cassidy's demanding approach with young players demanded his dismissal. https://t.co/M487dgOdR6 \u2014 Fluto Shinzawa (@FlutoShinzawa) June 7, 2022\n\nNeely and Sweeney, then, will hire a coach who will be more aligned with their preferences for greater freedom to play and supportive development. Here are five that fit the profile, starting with the odds-on favorite.\n\nJay Leach\n\nLeach, 42, is the leading candidate. He checks all the boxes.\n\nLeach was Providence\u2019s head coach for four seasons before serving as Dave Hakstol\u2019s assistant in Seattle in 2021-22. In Providence, Leach preached growth mindset, development and positivity. Leach helped Anton Blidh, Connor Clifton, Trent Frederic, Karson Kuhlman, Jeremy Lauzon, Jeremy Swayman and Jakub Zboril become permanent NHL players. He had Kuhlman and Lauzon in Seattle this past season.\n\nLeach served as the right-hand man to former Bruins assistant coach Geoff Ward for Germany\u2019s Adler Mannheim in 2014-15. Ward and Leach helped the team win the DEL championship.\n\nLeach returned to North America to be Mike Sullivan\u2019s assistant in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in 2015-16. The following season, the Bruins hired Leach to be Kevin Dean\u2019s assistant in Providence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManagement is familiar with Leach. Perhaps the former defenseman, who appeared in two games for the Bruins in 2006-07, can help Frederic, Jack Studnicka and Oskar Steen gain greater NHL footholds.\n\n\u201cHe is going to be a great coach,\u201d said one NHL source who has known Leach for decades.\n\nDavid Quinn\n\nQuinn, 55, is hungry for another NHL opportunity after being dismissed by the Rangers. Quinn coached Team USA in the 2022 Olympics after the NHL pulled out of the Winter Games.\n\nThe Rangers did not qualify for the playoffs in two of Quinn\u2019s three seasons. Before that, Quinn was at Boston University for five seasons as Jack Parker\u2019s replacement. He coached Matt Grzelcyk for three seasons and Charlie McAvoy for two. Both Bruins defensemen enjoyed their time playing for Quinn.\n\nQuinn is an outgoing and personable coach. He is acquaintances with Sweeney.\n\nRyan Mougenel\n\nMougenel, 46, concluded his first season as Leach\u2019s replacement in Providence. Before that, Mougenel was Leach\u2019s assistant for two seasons. He was in charge of Providence\u2019s defense when assisting Leach.\n\nMougenel is similar to Leach: positive and enthusiastic. Players, including veterans like John Moore, were appreciative of Mougenel\u2019s hands-on style. This past season, Moore noted he reviewed clips of himself with Mougenel from past years. The two went over what made Moore an effective NHL defenseman.\n\nMougenel is short on experience compared to Leach.\n\nNate Leaman\n\nLeaman, 49, finished his 11th season as Providence College\u2019s head coach. He does not have professional coaching experience. But Leaman is one of the NCAA\u2019s most accomplished coaches.\n\nIn 2014-15, Leaman led the Friars to the NCAA championship. Providence beat Quinn\u2019s BU team in the final. Noel Acciari, Leaman\u2019s captain that season, signed with the Bruins.\n\nBefore Providence, Leaman was the head coach at Union for eight seasons. He was an assistant at Harvard, Sweeney\u2019s alma mater, for four seasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeaman participated in one of the Bruins\u2019 offseason development camps as a consulting coach.\n\nSpencer Carbery\n\nCarbery, 40, finished his first season as an assistant to Sheldon Keefe in Toronto. In 2017-18, Carbery served as Leach\u2019s assistant in Providence. After one year, he was hired to be Hershey\u2019s head coach. He was with the Bears for three seasons.\n\nCarbery worked with the defensemen in Providence. In Toronto, Carbery was in charge of the power play.\n\nRead more\n\n(Photo of Jay Leach: Christopher Mast / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://thehockeywriters.com/boston-bruins-coaching-history/", "page_content": "Bruce Cassidy was hired as an assistant coach to then-Boston Bruins coach Claude Julien in the spring of 2016 after spending five years as head coach of the Bruins\u2019 American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins. When Boston was in danger of missing the playoffs in 2017, the Bruins fired Julien and named Cassidy the interim coach for the final 27 games of regular season.\n\nAfter a first-round exit to the Ottawa Senators in six games in the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Bruins removed the interim tag from Cassidy and named him the 28th coach in club history on April 28, 2017. Cassidy joins a list of historic and iconic former coaches, including five Stanley Cup champions and multiple Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nStanley Cup Winners\n\nArt Ross\n\nRoss was tabbed as the first Bruins coach in 1924 and served that role on three different occasions. Also hired as general manager, he had a career regular season coaching record of 387-290-95 and a 32-33 playoff record. He was the team\u2019s coach for the first two Stanley Cup championships in 1929 and 1939. After stepping aside in 1934, he returned in 1936, and stepped down after the 1939 championship season. He returned to coach for a third tenure in 1941 and spent four more seasons behind the bench, before stepping down to continue as general manager until 1954.\n\nArt Ross (THW Archives)\n\nIn 1947, Ross donated the Art Ross Trophy to the NHL, awarded to the player who is the regular season leading goal scorer. He was also an on-ice official and helped create the hockey puck which is still used today. He also helped improve the style of nets that were used up until 1984, before the currently style of nets were put into use.\n\nA defensemen in his playing days, Ross was one of the first defensemen to skate with the puck instead of passing it forward. After he retired from his 16-year playing career, he was an NHL official, before moving onto coaching his front office position. He was inducted in the Hall of Fame in 1949 for his playing career over his coaching career.\n\nCooney Weiland\n\nWeiland took over for Ross in 1939 and two seasons later, he guided the Bruins to their third Stanley Cup in 1941. Weiland had a 58-20-18 regular season record as coach and 10-7 in the playoffs. He played for Ross and, in 1929, he scored 11 goals and 7 assists, before adding two playoff goals. He was also part of the \u201cDynamite Line\u201d in 1928 with Dit Clapper and Dutch Gainor, which was one of first named lines in NHL history.\n\nThe Dynamite Line- Dit Clapper, Dutch Gainor and Cooney Weiland (THW Archives)\n\nAfter spending the next 10 years coaching the in AHL, Weiland returned to Boston in 1950 after being hired to coach Harvard University. In 21 years as coach of the Crimson, he compiled a record of 315-173-17.\n\nHarry Sinden\n\nSinden was hired as coach in 1966 as a 33-year-old and, like Ross, he had three turns behind the bench. In 1970, Sinden capped off his fourth year as coach with the Bruins\u2019 fourth Stanley Cup and ended a 29-year drought after Bobby Orr scored his famous \u201ctook flight\u201d overtime goal against the St. Louis Blues.\n\nIn 1980, he returned to the bench for the final seven regular season games and 10 playoff games after Sinden, then general manager, fired Fred Creighton. After hiring Gerry Cheevers following the 1980 season, Sinden fired the former Bruins goalie in 1985 and coached the remainder of the season and playoffs. Known to be just as fiery as a general manager, Sinden spent 28 years as GM before stepping aside in 2000.\n\nSinden was fined by the NHL in 1997 for his verbal abuse toward a video replay official who disallowed a goal in a game. He would also battle with players and their agents over contracts and it boiled over with Dmitri Khristich in 1999. An NHL salary-arbitrator awarded Khristich $2.8 million for his 29-goal performance, but Sinden refused to pay the Ukraine forward and let him sign with the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nIn 1986, Boston acquired Cam Neely and the Vancouver Canucks\u2019 first-round pick in the 1987 Draft, third overall, in a trade for Barry Peterson. It would be a trade by Sinden that shaped the Bruins for years to come as Boston selected defenseman Glen Wesley with the third pick, who would end up being a big part of the defensive corps with Ray Bourque.\n\nTom Johnson\n\nJohnson was hired by the Bruins as an assistant general manager in 1970 and later that year, he was named the 10th coach in team history after the team captured their fifth title. He won six Stanley Cups as player with the Montreal Canadiens and one as an assistant general manager in the front office in Boston. Johnson got his eighth title in 1972 as coach when the Bruins beat the New York Rangers in six games.\n\nTom Johnson (THW Archives)\n\nJohnson spent the final two years of his 18-year playing career in Boston (he spent 14 years playing in Montreal and won six Stanley Cups), but was forced into retirement following a number of injuries in 1965. He spent 30 years in the Bruins organization as a player, coach, assistant general manager or advisor.\n\nClaude Julien\n\nOne of the longest tenured coaches in club history, Julien spent 10 years as the Bruins coach, but was fired during the season in 2017. He led the Bruins to the 2011 Stanley Cup after a seven-game series win over the Canucks. In 2013, Boston fell in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks in the Cup Final.\n\nClaude Julien (Photo by Dave Reginek/NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nHe is the organization\u2019s all-time leader in wins with 476, which includes 57 postseason victories. The Bruins made the playoffs in his first seven seasons and won the Presidents\u2019 Trophy in 2013-14. Seven days after he was fired by the Bruins, he was hired by the Canadiens on Feb. 14, 2017.\n\nHall of Famers and Award Winners\n\nBoston\u2019s had eight coaches who were inducted into the Hall of Fame: Ross, Sinden, Johnson, Cheevers, Pat Burns, Frank Patrick, Milt Schmidt and Lynn Patrick.\n\nA coach\u2019s life expectancy is not what is used to be, and eight former coaches spent their entire coaching career with the Bruins: Sinden, Johnson, Cheevers, Frank Patrick, Steve Kasper, Terry O\u2019Reilly, Mike O\u2019Connell and Dit Clapper.\n\nDit Clapper (THW Archives)\n\nThree Bruins coaches have won the Jack Adams Award, three of the most popular and outspoken in team history. Don Cherry won the award in 1976 when he led the Bruins to an Adams Division title with a 48-15-17 record. Pat Burns took home the award 1998 in his first year with the Bruins when he led the team to a second place finish behind the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Northeast Division standings.\n\nJulien was the last winner in 2011. Boston won the Northeast Division that season, but was followed by the most disappointing NHL postseason in 2010 when the team had a historic collapse. The Bruins held a 3-0 second-round lead over the Philadelphia Flyers, but lost the last four games, including Game 7 at home after leading 3-0. They fell 4-3.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nIn their 95 years, the Bruins have had some successful coaches and some unsuccessful ones. Johnson is the winningest coach (by percentage) in club history with at least 100 games coached with a 142-43-23 record. On the other end, Schmidt was 73-157-46 in his seven seasons as coach to earn the distinction of having the lowest winning percentage."}, {"url": "https://www.nhl.com/bruins/news/the-history-of-the-bruins-captaincy/c-320038260", "page_content": "It's an exclusive club that in total includes just 19 men over the course of nearly a century.

Esteemed Bruins like Terry O'Reilly, Wayne Cashman, and Rick Middleton have also donned the 'C' for the Black & Gold.\n\nBostonBruins.com - For almost 100 years, the captaincy of the Boston Bruins has served as one of hockey's most sacred titles.\n\nFollowing the departure of Zdeno Chara via free agency, the torch has been passed. Patrice Bergeron, Chara's longtime teammate and Bruins alternate captain since 2006, has been named the 20th captain in Bruins history.\n\n\"He is absolutely the right person to have as a captain,\" said Chara. \"He's been part of the Boston Bruins organization for [17] years now. He's meant so much to the team, the organization, the community. He's gonna be an unbelievable captain and leader. He's well proven in crunch time to deliver. The impact he has on the players, teammates, coaches, fans, and everybody in the community is tremendous.\n\n\"I can't imagine anybody else to be the captain. I'm truly very happy that he's gonna be the next captain. He really deserves it.

I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nVideo: Bergeron becomes 20th captain in team history\n\nHere is a look through the legendary history of the Bruins captaincy:\n\nSprague Cleghorn | 1925-27\n\nAfter playing without a captain during their inaugural season in 1924-25, the Bruins named newcomer Sprague Cleghorn the first captain in team history the following year. The blue liner - a 1956 Hockey Hall of Fame inductee - was sold to Boston after winning the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1924.\n\nCleghorn played three seasons with the Bruins and also served as an assistant coach in 1927-28, his final campaign with the club.\n\nLionel Hitchman | 1927-31\n\nHitchman took over the captaincy from the retiring Cleghorn - his defense partner and mentor - for the 1927-28 campaign and held the title for four seasons. During that time, the blue liner paired up with fellow legendary defenseman Eddie Shore to form one of the Bruins' best defense tandems of all time. In his second season as captain in 1928-29, the Toronto native led the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup championship.\n\nHitchman resigned the captaincy following the 1930-31 campaign but went on to play three more seasons with the Bruins. His No. 3 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nGeorge Owen | 1931-32\n\nOwen, a Newton High School graduate and the first player from Harvard to play in the NHL, served as captain during his penultimate season in Black & Gold. The blue liner played all five of his NHL seasons with Boston, before retiring in 1933. He lined up alongside Hitchman and Shore on the blue line and won the Stanley Cup with the team in 1929.\n\nOwen was part of the first induction class of the U. S. Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nAubrey 'Dit' Clapper | 1932-38 and 1939-47\n\nPart of the record-setting \"Dynamite Line\" with Ralph 'Cooney' Weiland and Dutch Gainor, Clapper was named captain in 1932. After a one-year break, Clapper took back the captaincy in 1939-40 following Weiland's retirement.\n\nIt was also during that season that Clapper moved to defense, pairing up with Shore in a move that proved highly successful for the Bruins, who went on to win the Cup in 1941.\n\nClapper was captain until he retired in 1947, following his 20th season with the Bruins - he was the first player in NHL history to play 20 seasons. His No. 5 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nRalph 'Cooney' Weiland | 1938-39\n\nClapper's linemate served as captain for one season, his final campaign with the Bruins in 1938-39 during which the Bruins won their second Stanley Cup. Weiland had two stints in Black & Gold, the first coming from 1928-32, helping Boston to the Stanley Cup in 1929 and setting a then league record with 73 points (43 goals, 30 assists) in 1930 in just 44 games.\n\nThe Ontario native transitioned to Boston's head coach after his retirement and led the team to its third Stanley Cup in 1941.\n\nJohn Crawford | 1946-1950\n\nCrawford played 13 seasons with the Bruins and served as captain for the final four, sharing the title with Clapper during the blue liner's last season in 1946-47. The defenseman was a two-time All-Star and helped Boston to Stanley Cup titles in 1939 and 1941.\n\nMilt Schmidt | 1950-54\n\n'The Ultimate Bruin' took over the captaincy from Crawford for the 1950-51 season and went on to win the Hart Trophy as league MVP with 61 points (22 goals, 39 assists) in 62 games. Schmidt was captain for four years and remains the only person in Bruins history to serve the club as player, captain, coach, and general manager.\n\nThe anchor of the iconic 'Kraut Line' with Woody Dumart and Bobby Bauer, Schmidt helped guide Boston to the Stanley Cup in 1939 and 1941 before the trio went off to serve in WWII.\n\nSchmidt, elected to the Hall of Fame in 1961, retired midway through the 1954-55 season and took over for Lynn Patrick as head coach. He went on to coach the Bruins until 1966 - with a year-plus break from 1961-62 - before being promoted to general manager in 1967.\n\nSchmidt, who helped discover Bobby Orr, pulled off the legendary trade for Phil Esposito in 1967. The arrivals of both players led to Boston's Stanley Cup victories in 1970 and 1972. Schmidt's No. 15 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nEd Sandford | 1954-55\n\nSandford, in his last of eight seasons with Boston, was named captain upon Schmidt's retirement. The Toronto native made five consecutive All-Star appearances starting in 1951 and led all scorers with eight goals and 11 points during the 1953 playoffs.\n\nHe was traded to Detroit following the 1954-55 season. At 92, Sandford - who for years served as an off-ice official during Bruins home games - is the team's oldest living former captain.\n\nFerny Flaman | 1955-61\n\nAfter a seven-year stint with the Bruins from 1944-51 to start his career, Flaman was re-acquired from Toronto in 1954. He was named captain the following season and held the title for the remainder of his NHL career, which lasted until 1961.\n\nFlaman was named an NHL Second Team All-Star three times and played in five All-Star Games during his tenure as Bruins captain. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nDon McKenney | 1961-63\n\nMcKenney ascended to the captaincy after a stellar run over his first seven seasons with the Bruins. The Ontario native led the team in scoring four times, including his rookie season in 1954-55, and was named to the NHL All-Star Game on six occasions. McKenney won the Lady Byng Award as the NHL's most gentlemanly player in 1960.\n\nHe served as captain until midway through the 1962-63 season when he was traded to the New York Rangers.\n\nLeo Boivin | 1963-66\n\nThe blue liner was part of two Stanley Cup Finals appearances for the Bruins in the 1950s and became captain following McKenney's departure. Boivin, who played 12 seasons in Boston, wore the 'C' until he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in February 1966.\n\nJohn Bucyk | 1966-67 and 1973-77\n\nAmong the very best to ever don the Spoked-B, 'Chief' took over the captaincy in 1966, his 10th season in Boston. Bucyk held the official title for one season before the team decided to switch to alternate captains. The Edmonton native was still the B's leader and was the one presented with the Stanley Cup when the team won titles in 1970 and 1972.\n\nBucyk reclaimed the 'C' in 1973 and held the position for four more seasons. He retired in 1978 following his 21st season with the Bruins. Bucyk, elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1981, is the club's all-time leading goal scorer with 545 and ranks second to Ray Bourque in assists (794) and points (1,339).\n\nThe 2020-21 season will be his 63rd consecutive campaign with the Bruins, as he's gone on to serve the club as a broadcaster, director of road services, and ambassador following his playing career. His No. 9 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nWayne Cashman | 1977-83\n\nCashman played all 17 of his NHL seasons with Boston, taking over as captain in 1977 - his 12th Bruins campaign. A member of the B's Stanley Cup championship teams in 1970 and 1972, he scored 20 or more goals eight times.\n\nDuring his years as captain, Cashman helped lead the Bruins to the NHL semifinals three times and the Stanley Cup Final in 1978. He retired following the 1982-83 season.\n\nCashman ranks fifth in Bruins history in games played (1,027), sixth in assists (516), seventh in points (793), and ninth in goals (277).\n\nTerry O'Reilly | 1983-85\n\nLike Cashman, O'Reilly played his entire career in Boston, suiting up in the Spoked-B for 14 seasons. Following Cashman's retirement, he took over as captain for his final two campaigns.\n\nKnown as 'Taz' in an ode to the Tasmanian Devil, O'Reilly was beloved for his rugged, physical style of play. He is the club's all-time leader in penalty minutes with 2,095.\n\nO'Reilly also ranks eighth in Bruins history in games played (891) and ninth in assists (402). His No. 24 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nRick Middleton and Ray Bourque | 1985-88\n\nAfter O'Reilly's retirement, the Bruins opted for a co-captaincy, tapping Middleton and Bourque to take over the reins beginning with the 1985-86 campaign. They shared the role for three seasons until Middleton retired in 1988 following Boston's loss in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nMiddleton, who wore the 'C' at home, spent 12 of his 14 NHL seasons in Boston. 'Nifty' is third in team history in goals (402), fourth in points (898), seventh in assists (496), and ninth in games played (881). He held the team record for shorthanded goals (25) until 2019 season when Brad Marchand surpassed him.\n\nMiddleton's No. 16 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nRay Bourque | 1988-2000\n\nBourque took sole possession of the captaincy for the 1988-89 season and held it until he was traded to Colorado on March 6, 2000. His 15-year run as captain is the longest in Bruins history.\n\nThe Hall of Fame defenseman played 21 seasons in Boston, winning five Norris Trophies as the league's top defenseman - the fourth-most in league history. He was named an NHL First-Team All-Star 12 times and a Second-Team All-Star six times. Bourque led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Final in 1988 and 1990.\n\nHe is the Bruins' all-time leader in games played (1,518), power-play goals (164), assists (1,111), and points (1,506), while ranking fourth in goals (395).\n\nBourque's No. 77 hangs in the TD Garden rafters.\n\nJason Allison | 2000-01\n\nFollowing Bourque's departure, the Bruins went without a captain until Allison took over the 'C' on Nov. 8, 2000. It was Allison's fifth and final season in Boston and also the best of his NHL career, as the Ontario native posted a career-high 95 points and 36 goals in 82 games. After a contract holdout at the start of the following year, he was traded to Los Angeles on Oct. 24, 2001 with Mikko Eloranta in exchange for Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray.\n\nJoe Thornton | 2002-05\n\nThe Bruins went without a captain during the 2001-02 season before Thornton, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 NHL Draft, took over the role on Oct. 8, 2002. He held the title until he was traded to the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 30, 2005.\n\nThornton posted a career-high 101 points, ranking third in the NHL in scoring, during his first season as captain in 2002-03.\n\nZdeno Chara | 2006-20\n\nEverything changed on July 1, 2006 when Chara was signed to a five-year, $37.5 million contract on the opening day of free agency. The 6-foot-9 blue liner was named captain three months later on Oct. 3, 2006, and served in that role for 14 seasons, the second-longest run in team history behind Bourque.\n\nChara helped set the tone for a revitalization of Bruins hockey through the 2010s as Boston reached three Stanley Cup Finals and is credited with creating a culture of respect and dedication within the Bruins dressing room. In 2011, Big Zee led the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup title in 39 years.\n\nDuring his tenure in Boston, Chara won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenseman in 2009 and was selected to five NHL All-Star games. He was twice named an NHL First-Team All-Star and three times selected an NHL Second-Team All-Star.\n\nChara ranks sixth in team history in games played at 1,023.\n\nPatrice Bergeron | 2020-\n\nLike Chara, Bergeron has been instrumental in Boston's decade-plus run of success. Among his most legendary performances: a two-goal outing in Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Final against Vancouver and his tying and overtime-winning goals in Boston's stunning comeback over Toronto in 2013.\n\nThere are many others, of course, across a remarkable 17-year run in Black & Gold that has seen him capture a record-tying four Selke Trophies as the league's best defensive forward. Bergeron enters the 2020-21 campaign ranked third in Bruins history in games played (1,089), fifth in goals (352) and assists (517), and sixth in points (869)."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/34175601/boston-bruins-expected-bring-jim-montgomery-new-head-coach-sources-say", "page_content": "The Boston Bruins have named Jim Montgomery as their new head coach, it was announced Friday.\n\nThe appointment was made official Friday, the same day Montgomery's contract as an assistant coach with the St. Louis Blues expired.\n\n\"Jim has a winning history, and throughout the interview process he conveyed his ability to connect with all types of players while also demanding that his teams play with structure,\" Bruins general manager Don Sweeney said in a statement. \"We are excited for Jim to begin to make his imprint on our team.\"\n\nThe 53-year-old Montgomery replaces Bruce Cassidy, who was fired by the Bruins on June 7 after six seasons behind the bench.

Montgomery was also voted the national coach of the year for the 2016-17 season.\n\nBoston is coming off its sixth consecutive playoff appearance, which ended in a first-round loss to the Carolina Hurricanes.

He joined the Bruins in 2006 as the team's Director of Player Development and was named to the position of Director of Hockey Operations in July, 2007 before being promoted to Assistant General Manager in September of 2009.\n\nAs Assistant GM, he oversaw the development of the team's drafted prospects at the AHL, junior hockey, college and European levels in addition to having a supervisory role in the day-to-day operations of the hockey department.\n\nHis portfolio expanded further in 2014 when he was appointed as General Manager of Boston's AHL affiliate in Providence where he oversaw all hockey operations for that franchise.\n\nSweeney organized and ran the team's first off-season Development Camp in July, 2007, bringing the club's top prospects to Boston in advance of the main September training camp and will hold the ninth such camp in the summer of 2015.\n\nDrafted by the Bruins in the eighth round, 166th overall, in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, he went on to play four seasons of college hockey at Harvard University.

That line was outstanding last year after Hall was acquired at the trade deadline, and it gave the Bruins a great complement to their top line of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, and David Pastrnak.\n\nFor years the Bruins had Krejci centering a second line that was weak on the wings.
