Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "http://manu47.magtech.com.cn/Jwk3_jdis/EN/10.1515/jdis-2017-0019", "page_content": "Rediscovering Don Swanson: The Past, Present and Future of Literature-based Discovery\n\nNeil R.

Information developed in one area of research may be of value in another without anyone becoming aware of the fact, so there should be many implicit undiscovered connections of interest which can not be retrieved by conventional computer-aided literature search. Don R. Swanson, professor of information science at the University of Chicago, solved this problem.\n\nHe developed an information method called non-interactive literature-based discovery and designed Arrowsmith, which is an interactive software and search strategies.

Swanson (October 10, 1924 \u2013 November 18, 2012) was an American information scientist, most known for his work in literature-based discovery in the biomedical domain. His particular method has been used as a model for further work, and is often referred to as Swanson linking. He was an investigator in the Arrowsmith System project,[1] which seeks to determine meaningful links between Medline articles to identify previously undiscovered public knowledge. He had been professor emeritus of the University of Chicago since 1996, and remained active in a post-retirement appointment until his health began to decline in 2009.\n\nSwanson received his B.S. in Physics at Caltech, Pasadena, California in 1945, followed by an M.A at Rice Institute, Houston, Texas, two years later, and then a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1952. He worked as a physicist at various laboratories until 1963, when he was made a professor and served as dean of the Graduate School of Library Science at the University of Chicago until 1972 and again from 1977\u201379 and 1987-89.\n\nIn 2000, he was awarded the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor of the society, for his \"lifetime achievements in research and scholarship.\" [2]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nWorks\n\n1986a : \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" Library Quarterly 56(2): 103-118.\n\n: \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" 56(2): 103-118. 1986b : \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 30(1): 7-18.\n\n: \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" 30(1): 7-18. 1987 : \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 38(4): 228-233.\n\n: \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" 38(4): 228-233. 1988 : \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 31(4): 526-557.\n\n: \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" 31(4): 526-557. 1989a : \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 356-358.\n\n: \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" 40: 356-358. 1989b : \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 432-435.\n\n: \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" 40: 432-435. 1990a : \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 33 (1990): 157-186.\n\n: \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" 33 (1990): 157-186. 1990b : \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" bulletin of the Medical Library Association 78(1) 29-37.\n\n: \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" 78(1) 29-37. 1990c : \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" Information Processing & Management 26(1): 9-16.\n\n: \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" 26(1): 9-16. 1990d : \"The absence of co-citation as a clue to undiscovered causal connections.\" In: C.

Imagining commuters on the bus, one might envision a collection of individuals reading the paper, drinking coffee, writing in planners, or simply chatting up the person next to them. Recently, Simpson has been using his commute to chart out word occurrences to a matrix visualization from astronomy journals on his laptop. Some people bus to the beat of a different drum.\n\nHe is creating the matrices according to the nature of work that Don R. Swanson did at the University of Chicago in the late 80's. Swanson, an Information Scientist, discovered connections between Raynaud's Disease and Fish Oil through something called Literature Based Discovery. The literature all came from MEDLINE. Raynaud's causes numbness in the extremities (fingers, toes, etc.) of the body because of blood vessel narrowing. Thanks to Swanson, Fish oil was found to be of relief to Raynaud's patients where previously the relationship had gone unnoticed. No one had ever combined the literatures from MEDLINE that stated the benefits of Fish Oil as far as blood vessel narrowing in connection with Raynaud's. Put another way, if there are many papers that mention the term Raynaud's aligned with certain features and terms of the disease, and there are many papers that name those same features and terms in relation to Fish Oil, chances are better that Raynaud's and Fish Oil might have an interesting relationship.\n\n\u201cIn the present article I demonstrate something similar for the pair of literatures on migraine and magnesium (another discovery by Swanson). The goal of this work is not simply to find unnoticed connections but to develop a systematic approach to the process of hunting for them.\u201d Swanson states in an article he published on the subject. \u201cAs in the preceding case, one begins with a disease for which neither cause nor cure is known. The problem is to find, within the literature, indirect evidence that an unknown cure might already exist. The literatures on fish oil and magnesium, respectively, were not fortuitous choices; they were the survivors of a process of elimination.\u201d\n\nRobert Simpson is taking Swanson's process a step further and putting Literature Based Discovery into a visual computer matrix that plots out the relationship between terms in Astronomy journals, mostly from the abstracts available online. Below is one such Matrix, it is from Simpson's blog, Orbiting Frog:\n\nWhen asked where this idea had come from, the mild-mannered Simpson had this to say,\n\n\u201cI run a conference series called .Astronomy where we have a hack day with the geek elite of astronomy. My pal, local conference organizer, Sarah Kendrew, suggested we try to create a hypothesis generator for astronomy - based on the BrainSCANr project from neuroscience. Although we hacked on it a bit on that day, I became far more interested afterward. I found myself playing about with a big database of terms and papers and just having fun. I realized that doing hypothesis generation with the data would require a decent bit of visualization of correlations between pairs of words. You'd need to start with looking at what pairs appear together and then move on to pairs that both correlate with a third word (I haven't done this yet). The word matrices are a great way to instantly see the patterns, and d3.js (software) - which was suggested by our visualization experts Noah Iliinsky and Julie Steele at .Astronomy - includes lots of examples with matrices.\u201d\n\nBrilliant! Building a hypothesis generator sounds like a sea change that could open up doors in science that no one has even considered. Imagine all of the possibilities! Imagine isolating many papers based on a subject and having all of the relationships that have never been recognized between them staring back at you in a handy matrix. What an amazing idea! But, what are the drawbacks? Well, the structuring of the Data itself.\n\nEnter the wizards of Computer Science and Visual Analytics.\n\nJeffrey Heer is an Assistant Professor at The Computer Science Department of Stanford University, he said this about visualizing text groups,\n\n\u201cText is among our most abundant types of data. However, text is difficult to visualize directly. How does one \"plot\" a sentence or set of words other than to print them? In practice, text visualization requires both modeling (creating statistical models of the content of text collections) and then visualizing the structure and content of those models.\u201d\n\nHeer has been involved with some amazing work that has resulted in success and successful failure. At Stanford, Heer's group found significant flaws in the way that textually derived data was modeled when the visualization of a group of data they were working with was analyzed.\n\n\u201cProbably the most relevant work from our group is on visualizing the shifting similarities among academic dicsiplines over time, based on an analysis of the text of PHD dissertations. We were visualizing the results of a chain of models, including text modeling and dimensionality reduction. These models can sometimes give rise to misleading results, which we then spotted in the visualization. This result led us to consider how visualizations must do more than just turn data into images -- it is vital that visualizations support interactive exploration and verification, so that one can not only uncover new hypotheses but begin the process of assessing their credibility. Another result of this work is that the insights gained from the visualizations enabled us to design better machine learning methods, such that our mathematical models of textual similarity better matched the judgments of human experts.\u201d\n\n\u201cStatistics alone are dangerous and they hide a lot.\u201d Says Ben Shneiderman, a professor of computer science and a founding director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at University Of Maryland. Shneiderman created the widely used \u201cTreemaps\u201d a compact visual display of tree structures that work by \u201c...splitting the screen into rectangles in alternating horizontal and vertical directions as you traverse down the levels.\u201d His work also contributed to the commercial success of Spotfire, a popular visual data analysis company.\n\nShneiderman was profiled in Scientific American by Tim Beardsley in the March 1999 issue about his opposition to anthropomorphizing the interactive qualities of computer programs. \u201cThe purpose of computing is insight, not numbers, Shneiderman likes to reiterate, and likewise the purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures. What people want in their interactions with computers, he argues, is a feeling of mastery. That comes from interfaces that are controllable, consistent and predictable.\u201d\n\nContextualizing, and/or structuring, the data before it is put into a helpful display, seems to be where humans need to have more involvement. If you showed someone who you just met a new gold ring you had acquired, one complete with a nice clear stone attached and automatically expected tears and acclaim from that person, it would seem odd. But if you had instead first told them it was because the person of your dreams had just proposed to you and that they had a house in Bermuda, the visual of the ring would provide useful in attaining squeals, tears, and hugs from your new friend. It is the same with visual analytics, if there is no structure for the information, it goes out without a context and ultimately might lead to a misunderstanding or misrepresentation: Why are you showing me your jewelry, are you bragging or being vain?\n\nThis goes right along with any conversation about how to figure out efficient ways to structure data so that the visual analytics will work properly in displaying the relationships of the data.\n\nShneiderman added the example below of an error that he saw in the data structure from a client that came to his lab. He also highlights using the visualizations as an error finding program:\n\n\u201cI was working with a group that was analyzing emergency room admissions. They had 6400 admissions one month and they were looking at the age of the men and the women, those who were admitted and those who were discharged, etc. They were happily running their statistics and coming up with numbers and statistically significant differences, etc. In 10 minutes, once I put the data through some of the tools we have, there turned out to be 8 patients who were 999 years old! They had no idea! So that throws things off terribly. A lot of people in the statistics or data mining world don't take a look at the data to be able to detect these things.\u201d\n\nRecently, Shneiderman and Heer co-authored a paper on the importance of control panels to help users (scientists, teachers, students, etc) to navigate through a visual display. The paper goes through different methods of displaying legends, navigation boxes, or widgets, etc., to help users navigate to what they want.\n\n\u201cOverview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand\u201d Shneiderman has famously stated about how to display and work through a graph. It is a commentary on what to do with a sound visualization, it lays out a clear path for looking at the data once we can find out out an efficient way to structure the data.\n\nSo, if the data could be properly structured and fed into compelling, but strict, visualizations, we could have this amazingly useful tool that gives scientific insight at a glance (what Simpson was shooting for), new hypotheses in science purely from emergency room admissions programs, or medical journals, or even grocery store cash registers. Is Robert Simpson's matrix intriguing because the data is already structured from scholarly articles? It seems that way because he is using a system put together by a successful innovator. Don R. Swanson, someone without a medical degree, furthered Medical Science purely because he compared contextualized data in a different and efficient way. This was without a colorful visualization. Visualizations have been promoted in science long before Simpson, by people like the inventor of the term 'software', Princeton statistician John Tukey. But, there are still many complications with the process as compiled above. Why are Simpson's efforts important?\n\nSimpson is the smart \u201ckid\u201d with a question here: What is a simple way that I can display data, with contemporary resources, that can streamline and augment the scientific process? Heer serves as a realist, telling us how complicated these efforts might become. Shneiderman serves as a philosopher and craftsman, figuring out a human's role in the act of transitioning data to the screen and then offering responsible ways to do it.\n\nAll in all, we start with a basic question: How do scientists use a computer's ability to attain and process massive amounts of data to provide them with hypotheses that they might never be able to notice with their brains? The answer might well be at the core of Computer Science and Visual Analytics, but it is a dangerous concept that needs some healthy parenting so as not to evolve into a faulty idea generator that will ultimately bring scientists back to square one, with heaps of useless data.\n\nOne last question I had was for Stanford's Jeffrey Heer in reference to his analysis of PhD Dissertations that is linked above:\n\nQ: \u201cDo you ever think, once (in the future) the kinks are worked out with data visualizations and someone can maybe easily rule out spurious results, this process will be available to the general public as a community effort towards Science? (ie: maybe a site where people can go and insert their own data sets to generate testable hypothesis)\u201d\n\nA: \u201cFirst let me clarify something just to be safe... the data visualizations in my earlier anecdote were not responsible for the spurious results. Instead, the underlying models were the culprit and the visualization played a valuable role in helping reveal the problematic data. This issue is unlikely to evaporate -- a single data set can often be analyzed using a variety of algorithms or models, some of which may not be appropriate (the model may make assumptions about the data that are not true). Visualization can play a useful role in helping us understand our data prior to modeling (to help generate hypotheses and assess if modeling assumptions hold) and understanding the results of our models (as in my earlier anecdote).\n\nNow on to your question -- there have already been a number of efforts to enable the type of \"citizen science\" you describe. Even prior to the internet, \"amateurs\" played an important role in astronomy (by observing new stars, etc). Also, websites like IBM's Many Eyes or Google's Fusion Tables allow people to upload data sets, visualize them, and share them. While I haven't seen such a public site dedicated to generating testable hypotheses, you might be interested in this recent work we did using paid crowd workers to help generate explanatory hypotheses for public-interest data sets.\n\nHowever, the more common practice is to engage \"citizen scientists\" in data collection efforts, while the \"professional scientists\" then analyze that data. Of course, it is important to provide transparency in this process and recognize where lay people can contribute valuable insights. Here's one example of putting this idea into practice by engaging with a community to monitor local air quality.\u201d\n\nOne thing about these wizards of Visual Analytics, they are thorough."}]}
