The Ps 50.16 is thus called upon to justify the plural, the ancient name of Capri, in a 10th century hagiographic account of dedicated to Constantine of Capri! 108 4.2. The Bloods of the Virgin Coming from Eastern theology, the question of the \u201cbloods of the Virgin,\u201d from which the virginal conception of Christ is operated, appears in several periods in Western history: it is again a form modelled on a Greek plural. The first occurrence is attributed to Bede the Venerable, who seems to have known Pseudo Dionysius109 directly, perhaps via the school of Theodore and Hadrian110: For Dionysius, remarkable among the authors of the Church, expresses himself in this way in his booklets on the divine names: indeed we do not know how he was formed from the bloods of the Virgin, according to a law other than that of nature, and how, without having feet with bodily weight and a material mass instilled upon him, he moved about in a wet and unstable substance. 111 This theme is found in the translation of the Pseudo-Dionysius by Hilduin, Abbot of Saint-Denis (c. 785\u2013c. 855),112 in very similar terms, as well as in all those that would follow his, those of John Scotus Eriugena (c. 800\u2013c. 877),113 John the Saracen (12th c.),114 Robert Grosseteste (c. 1168\u20131253),115 Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499),116 Ambrose Traversari (1386\u20131439).117 The other occurrences, on the other hand, all stem from translations of the synthesis done by John of Damascus (675\u2013749),118 attributable to Cerbanus and Burgundio of Pisa (12th c.), and recognizable by the characteristic expression purissimi sanguines of the Virgin,119 in particular by way of the dissemination that Peter Lombard\u2019s Sententiae 120 would procure them. Peter Lombard here is an essential link for the transmission of the uses of John of Damascus\u2019 ideas, leading to a searing but poorly inspired response from Walter of Saint-Victor (\u2020 c. 1180),121 and above all to all the great summae of the 12th (Zachary of Besan\u00e7on) and 13th centuries (Albert the Great,122 Alexander of Hales,123 Bonaventure,124 William of Auxerre,125 Henry of Ghent,126 John Duns Scotus,127 Thomas Aquinas128), all the way up to Lawrence of Brindisi in the 17th century, all of whom include a discussion on this point inherited from Eastern theology. The most interesting point, however, is what is happening in Reichenau, well before the 13th century. It is indeed there that are collected, in the ms Aug. 80, Latin translations of the 9th century, by the hand, perhaps, of the bishop John of Arezzo (\u2020 900), of Greek homilies on the Virgin that take up this theme, one by John of Damascus129, the other by his contemporary Andrew of Crete130 (660\u2013740), which convey the same expression sanguines Virginis . 4.3. Autonomous Uses Outside the field of exegesis strictly speaking, many authors use plural forms of sanguis , which we will call \u201cautonomous\u201d here. Let us note that as early as the 4th century, we find in Vegetius\u2019 Mulomedicina (late 4th c.-early 5th c.) a plural use of sanguis , in which the word designates, like cruores seen above, ocular petechiae: sanguines therefore means here bloodstains that the eye can discriminate individually, and therefore could, in theory, count, which means that sanguis escapes, here, by way of an identical catachresis, the meaning \u201ccontinuous liquid belonging to a single individual.\u201d131 Various expressions emerge very early on, such as uiri sanguinum , used to designate, outside of any exegetical context, disreputable people, adversaries,132 etc., in a phenomenon related to the \u201cpatois de Canaan\u201d (Cabanel 1995). Along the same lines, Aistof, king of the Lombards (749\u2013756), defeated by Pepin the Short at the request of Pope Stephen II, was described by the latter as a \u2018devourer of Christian bloods.\u2019133 The expression effusio sanguinum , shedding of blood, appears very early, and is also the most frequent. At an early date, it is particularly represented in translations from Greek, whether it be the revised version by Bede of the hagiographic dossier relating to the martyr Anastasius,134 or a letter to Pope Zacharias, of Greek origin, to Boniface.135 The expressions sanguinum fluores and perfusiones/profusiones sanguinum that we find in the translations of Anastasius the Librarian (c. 810\u2013c. 878)136 can be compared. Although the expected expression effusio cruoris is more frequent, effusio sanguinum is highly present in historical and hagiographic accounts,137 in contexts that closely evoke the aforementioned plural uses of cruores ; let it be noted in particular that, as in the case of cruores , it refers to distinct individuals and in general many individuals. These \u201ceffusions of blood\u201d would then lead to a variant of uiri sanguinum , that would become, by the hand of Bruno of Cologne (c. 1030\u20131101), uiri effusores sanguinum , \u201cshedders of blood.\u201d138 We have chosen to set aside the sputamina sanguinum mentioned in the Passion of Saint Leger of Autun (7th c.), because here we are dealing with <drops of> blood, 139 and we have seen an identical use of cruores (note 58). Though it is the most represented, the plural genitive is not isolated, and Rupert of Deutz (c. 1075/1080\u2013c. 1129) speaks spontaneously of regnare in sanguinibus ,140 while a bishop from Reims uses, during the same period, the accusative sanguines to designate murders.141 Finally, sporadically, sanguis in the plural designates the blood of menstruation, a usage attested from Tertullien (155\u2013220) to Coluccio Salutati (1331\u20131406),142 just as doctors speak indifferently of urine or of urines. Let us note, in conclusion, that this evolution is thoroughly described by M\u00e9nage in his Observations (M\u00e9nage 1675, p. 296), going from the ancient language, to biblical Latin, to medieval Latin: Sang. On dit tousjours le sang , & jamais les sangs . Les Latins ont dit demesme sanguis au singulier seulement. J\u2019entens les Latins des pr\u00e9miers si\u00e9cles: car ceux des derniers ont dit sanguines. Arbor sanguinum , dans Luitprandus. Libera me de sanguinibus dans le S\u00e9aume 50. Sur lequel endroit S. Augustin a fait cette note: Expressit Latinus Interpres verbo minus Latino : proprietatem tamen ex Greco: nam omnes novimus Latin\u00e8 non dici sanguines, nec sanguina sed sanguinem. Tamen quia ita Grecus posuit plurali numero non sine causa nisi quia hoc invenit in prima Lingua Hebr\u00e6a, maluit pius Interpres min\u00f9s Latin\u00e8 aliquid dicere qu\u00e0m min\u00f9s propri\u00e8. The example of Liutprand of Cremona (c. 922\u2013972) seems a priori poorly supported by the modern editions of the Lombard laws143 to which M\u00e9nage is referring here in 1675, but it is relayed by Keyssler (1720) and Eckhart (1729), the latter borrowing it from the former.144 If we, however, follow the lexicographer John of Genoa (13th c.),145 it is more like a shrub, so named for its red color (the blood dogwood, Cornus sanguinea ), which Bayet (1935, pp. 39\u201341) also confirms. However, sanguinum turns out to be the accusative of a noun, sanguinus according to John of Genoa, and no longer the plural genitive of sanguis , which invalidates the romanticized deductions of Keyssler and Eckhart, repeated in learned treatises on Germanic mythology (Tk\u00e1ny 1827, p. 44). 5. Conclusions Grammar and faith shared an entangled history in the context of Western Christianity146. This article has shown how roles could be merging, shedding light upon exegetes acting as grammarians and grammarians acting as exegetes. Exegetes aim at exempting the Holy Scripture from any reproach of grammatical error, while at the same time no grammarian will use these passages to criticize the language of the translators of the Bible. Both agree indeed in seeing them as clues proper to reveal hidden meanings of a text located out of the Latin canon. What role does grammar ultimately play in the analysis of these plurals? Augustine is the one to draw attention to these plural forms of sanguis in the Scriptures. It was obviously to Donatus that he was referring to implicitly, and his analysis would be taken up and repeated, without Donatus\u2019 name ever being mentioned, except when the Gregorian adage according to which Scripture is not subject to the rules of Donatus is recalled. While no exegete or commentator cites him, Priscian, the reading of which could have encouraged a more tolerant approach to these deviant forms, is never cited either. It is in fact the opposite that occurs when Petrus Helias evokes, in his commentary on Priscian, the biblical plurals, but rejects the Scriptures outside of Latin canon, ultimately confirming Donatus\u2019 postulate. In any case, the two grammatical traditions have never explicitly confronted each other on this point. One should also note the lack of any reference to the question of continuity and discretion: Pompeius had nonetheless posed the problem very clearly, in terms largely borrowed by Carolingian commentaries on Donatus, the same ones that integrate the biblical aspect. Grammar has therefore played an important role, but a static one since Augustine, in an unchanging topos, reinforced by the Gregorian adage: a translator must not fear overriding Latin grammar, nor should he fear being scolded by grammarians, and the reader should not be troubled by this infraction. Exegetes and commentators have long repeated over and over that sanguis exists only in the singular, but none of them have gone further to gain an understanding of the reason for that prohibition. No one even mentions the Isidorean distinction, which is almost more awkward for the correction of these occurrences, but comes much later than the translations of the Bible. Rule, use, authority: the plural forms of sanguis question the logic of the language, which wants grammatical number and extralinguistic reality to correspond. However, at what level does this transgression occur, and what is its degree of gravity? While the late-antique grammarians did not take sides, Eucherius is the first to have a clear opinion and to say that the plural use of sanguis constitutes an infraction of a grammar rule ( contra regulam latinitatis ). As for the grammarians, the first to discuss the subject was Priscian, for whom the exclusively singular use of sanguis reflected use and was in no way any kind of rule. The majority opinion would fall with Eucherius: the Ars of Lorsch, Agobard, Haimo of Auxerre, Berno of Reichenau, unanimously consider that sanguis in the plural violates a grammar rule, which, in the Cassiodorian view consisting in awarding congratulations to scrupulous translators, is obviously more valorizing than a mere infringement of a usage. According to Priscian, this is indeed the level on which the use of sanguis in the plural plays out\u2014but Priscian denies that there are examples\u2014and we have seen that cruores , which is just as abusive, gives legitimacy to sanguines , just as cineres allows for pulueres . The lack of recourse to Priscian can be explained by the comfort found in the repetition of patristic exegesis, but perhaps also because there needs to be transgression in order to trigger the \u201chermeneutical leap\u201d (Dahan 2009, p. 197 sq.). This statement again raises the eternal question of authority, of the authorities and of the possibility of imitating them. Let us remember that Fronto incited his students to seek out plural forms of arena , but not in just any author, only in the authors who possessed authority. For Pompeius, however, although an author can use pulueres , puluis remains singular: authority is therefore no match for the weight of the logic of the language, the ratio . However, we it is in fact authority that, in function of how we consider it, opens the path to a second type of justification, introduced by the Anonymus ad Cuimnanum, that of the difference of languages, in connection with Cassiodorus and his consideration of scriptural idioms. Biblical Latin thus interferes with grammatical reasoning, and becomes, like the poets, a potential factor of transgression. However, does the Bible have any authority over Latin? We have seen that the range of answers has been wide, extending to the rejection of the corpus and its exclusion from usage, by Petrus Helias, on the grounds that it is not common to all speakers of Latin. Hearing the Bible nonetheless accustomed Latin ears to the plural of sanguis , in exactly the way that Biblical Latin made popular the use of cutis instead of pellis (Grondeux 2005). In addition, later translations from Greek (lives of saints, theologies of Pseudo Dionysius and of John of Damascus) have caused these plural uses to multiply, and have fully convinced authors that these uses were, in the end, licit. Following on Bede\u2019s observations, it would be interesting to investigate whether early Romance vernacular could have been more permeable to the use of sanguis in the plural. Although a quick survey carried out in Godefroy\u2019s dictionary and in the corpus http://zeus.atilf.fr/dmf/ (accessed on 5 September 2022) does not suggest that the investigation would be conclusive, it is perhaps worth carrying out, but in another framework than that of this study, which is limited to Latin.\n\nShare and Cite MDPI and ACS Style Grondeux, A.

Legend says that the name was coined by the monks of the city of Santarcangelo Di Romagna and that it refers to the Roman god Jupiter.

Sangiovese has good adaptability to all types of soils, but if a producer wants to obtain elegant wines with wonderful aromas, soil with high concentration of limestone would be the best option. Sangiovese thrives very well in soils with slate, alberese, and gaestro elements.\n\nSangiovese Wines\n\nSangiovese is an essential part of the so-called Super Tuscans from Toscana IGT (it is often blended with such international grapes as Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot). Sangiovese is also used in production of mono-varietal wines, most known of which is Sangiovese di Romagna.

If any of those four humors \u2013 phlegm, black bile (also called melancholy), yellow bile (or choler), and blood \u2013 predominated, then your disposition and health were said to be ruled by that humor.\n\nPeople who were calm, slow, undemonstrative, and unexcitable were thought to have an abundance of phlegm \u2013 they were governed by that humor and were therefore phlegmatic. Those who were bilious had a bad disposition because of the large amount of yellow or black bile in their system. But those lucky people who were governed by blood were strong, confident, and ruddy (all that blood, you know) \u2013 in a word, sanguine.\n\nIn time, the physiological theory behind the humors dissipated, but the word sanguine is still commonly used to describe those who are cheerfully confident \u2013 a label we\u2019ll gladly accept, no matter where it comes from."}]}
