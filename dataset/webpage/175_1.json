Ledecky currently sits at five Olympic gold medals, putting her three behind Jenny Thompson of the United States for the most gold medals won by a female swimmer in the Olympics. She competes in five events this year, giving her more than enough to surpass Thompson.\n\nBut there's more than just that at stake. Should Ledecky claim all five gold medals, she would become only the second swimmer ever to reach double-digit Olympic gold medals, behind just Michael Phelps.\n\nIt won't be easy. She's got some tough competition in the 200 meter freestyle with Australian Ariarne Titmus the favorite to win the event and the Australian relay team posing a major threat to the United States on the 4x200 freestyle relay team, but Ledecky should have at least a few gold medals locked up this year.\n\nSporting News is tracking Ledecky's performance through the Olympics to see how many medals she brings home and what times she is posting in each of these events.\n\nMORE: Katie Ledecky's Olympic history and medal count\n\nHow many medals has Katie Ledecky won?\n\nComing into the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Ledecky was already the most decorated female swimmer of all time.\n\nLedecky entered the games having won five gold and one silver medal at the Olympics, while also claiming 15 FINA World Aquatics Championships gold medals and three silver medals.

She went on to win four golds at the 2014 Worlds.\n\nGoing into the Rio 2016 Games expectations were high, and Ledecky didn\u2019t disappoint.

Big names pulled out of competition. The host city reported its highest one-day total of coronavirus cases. A typhoon buffeted the region with rain and wind. Pre-event light shows swirled through arenas devoid of fans because of the pandemic.\n\nLeave it to Katie Ledecky to provide a few minutes of normalcy.\n\nThe 24-year-old completed a grueling double by cruising to victory in the 1,500-meter freestyle at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre on Wednesday, about an hour after swimming the 200 freestyle final.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople maybe feel bad that I\u2019m not winning everything, but I want people to be more concerned about other things in the world,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cPeople are truly suffering. I\u2019m just proud to bring home a gold medal.\u201d\n\nNo other swimmer at the Games attempted a similar test of speed and endurance. The feat looked routine. She spent most of the race in a familiar position: all alone in the lead with the seven other competitors trailing far behind.\n\nLedecky finished in 15 minutes 37.34 seconds \u2014 the fifth individual Olympic gold of her decorated career \u2014 in a race she\u2019s dominated like no other woman.\n\nAfter touching the wall, she pumped her arm in celebration. Then she hugged teammate Erica Sullivan, who used a strong push in the final laps to win silver, in the adjacent lane.\n\nKatie Ledecky, right, and Erica Sullivan show off their gold and silver medals after their 1-2 finish in the 1,500-meter freestyle Wednesday. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a legend and she\u2019ll forever be a legend,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe fact that I get to swim in the same generation as her, it\u2019s just so cool.\u201d\n\nThe event joined the women\u2019s Olympic program for the first time, though the men have competed in at the Games since 1904. That provided an opportunity for Ledecky to win gold in an event in which the outcome was as certain as, if not more certain than, any other competition.\n\nWhen Ledecky swims the 1,500, the real race is for second place. She first broke the world record in the event in 2013, her most recent record is from 2018 and, including Wednesday\u2019s race, she owns the top 13 times in history. No one else is close.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the victory, impressive as it might have been, that stood out; it also was how Ledecky did it. The race capped an exhausting 48-hour span in which she swam 4,000 meters over six races.\n\nCompeting in the 1,500 is demanding enough. Adding a sprint like the 200 an hour beforehand doesn\u2019t happen unless your name is Ledecky.\n\nKatie Ledecky walks away from the pool at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre after finishing fifth in the 200-meter freestyle Wednesday. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nHowever, her morning didn\u2019t start in characteristic fashion.\n\nThe 200 freestyle is the most competitive event in Ledecky\u2019s program, but she entered the final as the defending Olympic champion and appeared on track to contend for a medal, if not challenge to claim gold again, after promising swims during the preliminaries and semifinals.\n\nIt quickly became apparent this wasn\u2019t a normal race. Ledecky fell to seventh place after the first 50 meters and never challenged the leaders. The sight of the woman who has dominated freestyle swimming for more than a decade \u2014 and makes a habit of winning long-distance races by several body lengths \u2014 trailing by such a margin was jarring for the handful of athletes, officials and media in the building.\n\nAustralian sensation Ariarne Titmus, who recorded the second-best all-time mark in the event last month, won in 1:53.50. Ledecky improved her semifinal time by a tenth of a second, but still finished more than a second and a half behind in fifth place.\n\n\u201cBloody exhausted,\u201d said Titmus, who will race Ledecky later this week in the 800 freestyle. \u201cThat was a hell of a tough one.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time Titmus has gotten the better of Ledecky at the Games after edging her in the neck-and-neck 400 freestyle Monday. In that race, at least, Ledecky recorded her best time in three years and the second fastest of her career, and sounded satisfied with the accomplishment, even if it earned silver instead of gold.\n\nLedecky\u2019s first six Olympic finals \u2014 spanning London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo as she transformed from a little-known teenager to one of the faces of the sport \u2014 ended on the podium.\n\nThis was the first miss.\n\n\u201cI knew I had to turn the page very quickly and in the warm-down pool I was just thinking of my family,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cEach stroke I was thinking of my grandparents. They\u2019re the toughest four people I know and that\u2019s what helped me get through that.\u201d\n\nThe sting didn\u2019t last long. The 1,500 beckoned. And so did another gold medal."}, {"url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/athletics/news/katie-ledeckys-olympics-medals-records/8snnvvj8uoku1p9rd7afo65vt", "page_content": "Still early in her career, Katie Ledecky has set the gold standard for female swimmers.\n\nThe 24-year-old distance freestyle swimmer has been on the international stage for nearly a decade and has dominated, winning a record amount of Olympic and world championship gold medals among women in the sport.\n\nShe'll have a chance this year to add to her legacy when she competes in five more events this year. And this year, without Michael Phelps competing on the men's side, she'll be the American swimmer most in the spotlight at the games.\n\nSporting News is taking a look at Ledecky's swimming timeline and how she became the most accomplished female swimmer of all time.\n\nHow many Olympic medals has Katie Ledecky won?\n\nWhile most kids her age were enjoying the summer break between sophomore and junior year of high school, Ledecky was off in London for her first Olympics. The then-15-year-old Ledecky took first place in the 800-meter freestyle at the Olympic trials, coming in two seconds ahead of world champion swimmer Kate Ziegler, who earned the second spot on the team. Ziegler wouldn't be the only swimmer stunned by the young phenom. At the London Olympic Games, Ledecky finished third in the 800 free heats before winning gold with a time of 8:23.84, which was the fastest in the field by 4.13 seconds and set a new American record in the event.\n\nIn the time between London and Rio, Ledecky continued her domination. She set a world record in the 1,500 freestyle at 15:36.53 in a gold-medal winning performance at the 2013 FINA World Aquatics Championships. That wasn't the end of her trip to Barcelona, Spain. Ledecky added gold medals in the 400 free, 800 free and 4x200 free relay, with a world record set in the 800 at 8:13.86. She broke world records in the 800 and 1500 the next year a few times and took down the record in the 400 to establish herself as the sports' premier distance freestyle swimmer. She added five more gold medals at the the 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Russia, and five more at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships.\n\nNeedless to say, she was not considered a \"sleeper pick\" to win any events by the time Rio came around. And she didn't disappoint. Ledecky set Olympic and world records en route to winning the 400 and 800 frees, along with adding gold medals in the 200 free, 4x200 free relay and a silver in the 4x100 free relay.\n\nShe's kept up the pressure on the world stage since then. She added five more medals \u2014 three gold, one silver, one bronze \u2014 at the 2018 Pan Pacific Championships, took home five gold medals and a silver at the 2017 world championships and added a gold and two silver medals in the 2019 world championships.\n\nLedecky managed silver in her first attempt at a medal in the 2021 Olympics. She was beaten in the 400 freestyle by Australia's Ariarne Titmus. Ledecky later finished fifth in the 200 freestyle with Titmus claiming the gold in the race. She claimed her first gold medal of the 2021 Tokyo Games when she swam the first-ever women's 1500 freestyle at 15:37.34. She also anchored the women's 4x200 freestyle relay to a silver medal finish and won the 800 freestyle at 8:12.57.\n\nHer total international medal count after that race is 28 gold, six silver and one bronze. Her 20 Olympic and world championship gold medals are the most of any women's swimmer.\n\nKatie Ledecky's records\n\nLedecky has taken down a number of records over the years. She's at the point in her career now where the records she breaks are often her own.\n\nBetween the world stage, the Olympics, national and collegiate, Ledecky has claimed a wide range of best times.\n\nHere is a look at the records Ledecky still holds.\n\nWorld records\n\n400m freestyle (LC): 3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games)\n\n3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games) 800m freestyle (LC): 8:04.79 (2016 Rio Games)\n\n8:04.79 (2016 Rio Games) 1500m freestyle (LC): 15:20.48 (TYR Pro Swim Series)\n\nOlympic records\n\n400m freestyle (LC) : 3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games)\n\n: 3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games) 800m freestyle (LC): 8:04.79 (2016 Rio Games)\n\nAmerican records\n\n400m freestyle (LC): 3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games)\n\n3:56.46 (2016 Rio Games) 400m freestyle (SC): 3:54.06 (2019 International Swimming League)\n\n3:54.06 (2019 International Swimming League) 800m freestyle (LC): 8:04.79 (2016 Rio Games)\n\n8:04.79 (2016 Rio Games) 1500m freestyle (LC): 15:20.48 (TYR Pro Swim Series)\n\n15:20.48 (TYR Pro Swim Series) 4x200m freestyle relay (LC): 7:41.87 (2019 World Championships; Simone Manuel, Melanie Margalis, Ledecky, Katie McLaughlin)\n\n7:41.87 (2019 World Championships; Simone Manuel, Melanie Margalis, Ledecky, Katie McLaughlin) 500y (SC) freestyle: 4:24.06 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships)\n\n4:24.06 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships) 1000y (SC) freestyle: 8:59.65 (2015 Nation's Capital Swim Club Invite)\n\n8:59.65 (2015 Nation's Capital Swim Club Invite) 1650y (SC) freestyle: 15:03.31 (2017 Art Adamson Invitational)\n\n15:03.31 (2017 Art Adamson Invitational) 400y (SC) freestyle relay: 3:07.61 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships; Stanford: Manuel, Ledecky, Janet Hu, Lia Neal)\n\nNCAA records\n\n500y (SC) freestyle: 4:24.06 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships)\n\n4:24.06 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships) 1000y (SC) freestyle: 9:08.4 (2016 Ohio State Invitational)\n\n9:08.4 (2016 Ohio State Invitational) 1650y (SC) freestyle: 15:03.31 (2017 Art Adamson Invitational)\n\n15:03.31 (2017 Art Adamson Invitational) 800y (SC) freestyle relay: 6:45.91 (2017 NCAA Division I Championships; Stanford: Manuel, Neal, Ella Eastin, Ledecky)\n\nWhere did Ledecky go to school?\n\nLedecky might have been internationally renowned in high school, but that didn't mean she missed college. She attended Stanford, starting at as a freshman in 2016 after she wrapped up her trip to Rio for the 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the freshman swept through the college field. She was an NCAA champion in five events and broke a litany of collegiate and American records along the way.\n\nShe only spent two seasons with the Cardinal, but it was a memorable two-year stint in Stanford as she became the American record-holder in the 500-yard, 1000-yard, 1650-yard, 800-meter and 1500-meter freestyle events, claimed six Stanford school records, won eight events at the national championships, was nine times an All-American. She claimed 11 American, 15 NCAA and six NCAA meet records during her two years at Stanford.\n\nWhen is Katie Ledecky swimming?\n\nCompeting in five different events, Ledecky will be on the television often for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of her latest run at history.

Now, she's made history once again in Tokyo, winning a record sixth individual Olympic gold medal \u2014 more than any other woman in the history of the sport. That brings her career Olympic medal count to 10, including a team gold and three silver medals.\n\nHeading into the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Ledecky had won an impressive six Olympic medals, five of which were gold. She was just 15 and the youngest member of Team USA when she took home her first gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle event at the 2012 Olympics in London. Four years later in Rio, she cleaned up, scoring four gold medals in the 200m, 400m, 800m, and 4x200m freestyle events. She also won a silver medal in the 4x100m freestyle relay.\n\nAt the Tokyo Games, which marked her third Olympic appearance, a now 24-year-old Ledecky competed in a total of four individual finals \u2014 the women's 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1,500m freestyle \u2014 as well as the 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\nIn her first event, the 400m freestyle, she came in second behind Australian rival Ariarne Titmus, who first beat Ledecky at the 2019 FINA World Championships. On the fifth day of competition in Tokyo, Ledecky finished just off the podium in the 200m \u2014 but an hour later, she was back in the pool to compete again, this time in the 1,500 distance, a race Ledecky was heavily favored to win. She did just that, touching the wall four seconds ahead of her American teammate Erica Sullivan.\n\nThe following day, Ledecky swam the final leg of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, surging from behind to secure the silver medal for her team, which included swimmers Paige Madden, Katie McLaughlin, and Allison Schmitt. To cap off her Tokyo campaign, Ledecky predictably won gold in the 800m freestyle, a race she has not lost since her Olympic debut in 2012. She finished more than a second ahead of Titmus to win her sixth individual gold, carving out yet another place in history before telling NBC that she expects to be back for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Karen Snyder Duke"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/athletes/katie-ledecky", "page_content": "(1997-)\n\nWho Is Katie Ledecky?\n\nBorn in Maryland in 1997, Katie Ledecky began swimming competitively at age six. After earning a berth on the U.S. Olympic team at age 15, she set an American record in the 800-meter freestyle to win a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Games. Ledecky has since shattered world records across an array of freestyle events ranging from 400 to 1,500 meters. At the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, she dominated the pool, winning gold medals in the 400-meter freestyle in world record time, the 200-meter freestyle and the 4x200 meter freestyle relay, and silver in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay. She also broke the world record, winning gold in the 800-meter freestyle.\n\nEarly Years and Competitive Career\n\nKathleen Genevieve \"Katie\" Ledecky was born on March 17, 1997, in Bethesda, Maryland. The second child of David, a lawyer, and Mary Gen, a former collegiate swimmer and hospital administrator, she began swimming competitively at the Palisades Swim & Tennis Club at age six, alongside her older brother, Michael.\n\nWith her seemingly insatiable appetite for pool activity, Ledecky became a standout at the Nation\u2019s Capital Swim Club under coach Yuri Suguiyama. In 2011, Suguiyama began instructing Ledecky to kick more aggressively while racing, a technique commonly used by elite men's swimmers but rarely seen on the women's side. That summer, before the start of her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, she dominated the U.S. Junior Championships with wins in the 400-, 800- and 1,500- meter freestyle events.\n\n2012 London Olympics Breakout Star\n\nLedecky made her senior debut at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, entering the 200-, 400- and 800-meter freestyles. The lack of top-level experience proved to be no obstacle for the 15-year-old, who surged to an eye-opening win in the 800m to become the youngest member of the U.S. team.\n\nHer momentum continued through the competition at the 2012 London Games, where Ledecky paced her heat in the 800m. She then blew the competition out of the water in the final, breaking Janet Evans's 23-year-old American record with a time of 8:14.63 to win the gold medal.\n\nAfterward, Ledecky displayed the easy confidence of someone who expected to win. \u201cI knew if I put my mind to it, I could do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intimidated at all.\u201d\n\nContinued Swimming Success\n\nUnder the guidance of new coach Bruce Gemmell, Ledecky showed that her 2012 Olympic performance was merely the tip of the iceberg. Proving capable of winning both middle- and long-distance events, she established world records in the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyles en route to four gold medals at the 2013 FINA World Championships. She claimed another four golds at the 2014 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, and at the 2015 FINA World Championships, she became the first woman to win the 200- 400- 800- and 1500-meter freestyles in a major competition. Her victories often coming via huge margins, Ledecky has been honored as the FINA Swimmer of the Year, the USOC's Olympic SportsWoman of the Year and a three-time Golden Goggle Female Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe champion swimmer was accepted to Stanford University prior to her graduation from Stone Ridge in 2015, but she elected to defer enrollment to focus on training for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Proving to be in peak form well before the start of Olympic competition, she set her 11th world record with a time of 8:06.68 in the 800m free at the Arena Pro Swim Series in January 2016.\n\nAdditionally, Ledecky headed into the summer as the world-record holder in the 400- and 1,500-meter freestyles. Unbeaten in all major international competition, she was expected to add to her already impressive gold medal count and become one of the American team's most celebrated Olympians by the close of the 2016 Rio Games.\n\n2016 Rio Olympic Games\n\nLedecky did not disappoint in Rio.

The 26-year-old Maryland native is on the hunt for more Olympic hardware, including a return to golden glory in the 400-meters, where legendary Australian swimmer Ariarne Titmus bested her in Tokyo. The current 800-meter world record holder is looking to make it a four-peat in that event, after claiming gold in London, Rio and Tokyo.

Though the sport of gymnastics is always making changes, one thing remains constant: Jordan Chiles always brings her A-game. Hoping to expand on the team silver she won at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, Chiles his hoping to secure some individual medals at the Paris Games. Given her outstanding performances at the 2022 world championships, where she claimed silvers in the vault and floor exercise, and the 2023 NCAA championships (golds in uneven bars and floor exercise), all signs point to her being a top contender in Paris.

And this year, without Michael Phelps competing on the men's side, she'll be the American swimmer most in the spotlight at the games.\n\nSporting News is taking a look at Ledecky's swimming timeline and how she became the most accomplished female swimmer of all time.\n\nHow many Olympic medals has Katie Ledecky won?\n\nWhile most kids her age were enjoying the summer break between sophomore and junior year of high school, Ledecky was off in London for her first Olympics. The then-15-year-old Ledecky took first place in the 800-meter freestyle at the Olympic trials, coming in two seconds ahead of world champion swimmer Kate Ziegler, who earned the second spot on the team. Ziegler wouldn't be the only swimmer stunned by the young phenom. At the London Olympic Games, Ledecky finished third in the 800 free heats before winning gold with a time of 8:23.84, which was the fastest in the field by 4.13 seconds and set a new American record in the event.\n\nIn the time between London and Rio, Ledecky continued her domination. She set a world record in the 1,500 freestyle at 15:36.53 in a gold-medal winning performance at the 2013 FINA World Aquatics Championships. That wasn't the end of her trip to Barcelona, Spain. Ledecky added gold medals in the 400 free, 800 free and 4x200 free relay, with a world record set in the 800 at 8:13.86. She broke world records in the 800 and 1500 the next year a few times and took down the record in the 400 to establish herself as the sports' premier distance freestyle swimmer. She added five more gold medals at the the 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Russia, and five more at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships.\n\nNeedless to say, she was not considered a \"sleeper pick\" to win any events by the time Rio came around. And she didn't disappoint. Ledecky set Olympic and world records en route to winning the 400 and 800 frees, along with adding gold medals in the 200 free, 4x200 free relay and a silver in the 4x100 free relay.\n\nShe's kept up the pressure on the world stage since then. She added five more medals \u2014 three gold, one silver, one bronze \u2014 at the 2018 Pan Pacific Championships, took home five gold medals and a silver at the 2017 world championships and added a gold and two silver medals in the 2019 world championships.\n\nLedecky managed silver in her first attempt at a medal in the 2021 Olympics. She was beaten in the 400 freestyle by Australia's Ariarne Titmus. Ledecky later finished fifth in the 200 freestyle with Titmus claiming the gold in the race. She claimed her first gold medal of the 2021 Tokyo Games when she swam the first-ever women's 1500 freestyle at 15:37.34. She also anchored the women's 4x200 freestyle relay to a silver medal finish and won the 800 freestyle at 8:12.57.\n\nHer total international medal count after that race is 28 gold, six silver and one bronze. Her 20 Olympic and world championship gold medals are the most of any women's swimmer.\n\nKatie Ledecky's records\n\nLedecky has taken down a number of records over the years.

She attended Stanford, starting at as a freshman in 2016 after she wrapped up her trip to Rio for the 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the freshman swept through the college field. She was an NCAA champion in five events and broke a litany of collegiate and American records along the way.\n\nShe only spent two seasons with the Cardinal, but it was a memorable two-year stint in Stanford as she became the American record-holder in the 500-yard, 1000-yard, 1650-yard, 800-meter and 1500-meter freestyle events, claimed six Stanford school records, won eight events at the national championships, was nine times an All-American.

She's got some tough competition in the 200 meter freestyle with Australian Ariarne Titmus the favorite to win the event and the Australian relay team posing a major threat to the United States on the 4x200 freestyle relay team, but Ledecky should have at least a few gold medals locked up this year.\n\nSporting News is tracking Ledecky's performance through the Olympics to see how many medals she brings home and what times she is posting in each of these events.\n\nMORE: Katie Ledecky's Olympic history and medal count\n\nHow many medals has Katie Ledecky won?\n\nComing into the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Ledecky was already the most decorated female swimmer of all time.\n\nLedecky entered the games having won five gold and one silver medal at the Olympics, while also claiming 15 FINA World Aquatics Championships gold medals and three silver medals.

She won 10 Olympic medals, 7 of which were gold.\n\nLedecky made her first splash in international swimming after her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda, Maryland, when she set an Olympic-trials record in the 800-metre freestyle to qualify for the 2012 London Games as the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. At the Games she set an American record en route to the gold medal in the 800 metres. The following year Ledecky set her first world records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 13.86 seconds) and 1,500 metres (15 minutes 36.53 seconds) at the 2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA) world championships. In addition to the golds that she won in those two events, Ledecky earned a gold medal in the 400-metre freestyle and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay team, and she won the FINA Trophy as the highest-scoring overall female swimmer at the world championships.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn June 2014 Ledecky bettered her own records in the 800 metres (8 minutes 11 seconds) and the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 34.23 seconds), and at the U.S. national championships in early August she set a global standard in the 400-metre freestyle with a time of 3 minutes 58.86 seconds, thus becoming the first female swimmer since American Janet Evans to hold simultaneous world records for the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre distances. At the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships, Ledecky became the first woman to capture four individual golds in that competition by winning the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle events, and she claimed another gold in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She also broke her own world marks in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 28.36 seconds) and the 400 metres (3 minutes 58.37 seconds).\n\nThe 6-foot- (1.83-metre-) tall Ledecky continued her stellar performance at the 2015 FINA world championships. She captured gold medals in five events (the 200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and earned a place in history as the only person to have won four individual freestyle swimming distances in a single world championship or Olympic competition. She also set a world record three times\u2014in the 800-metre final (8 minutes 7.39 seconds) and twice in the 1,500 metres (15 minutes 27.71 seconds in the heats and then 15 minutes 25.48 seconds in the final).\n\nShe put on a dominant showing at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where she captured four gold medals (the 200-, 400-, and 800-metre freestyle and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay) and one silver (4 \u00d7 100-metre freestyle relay). Moreover, she set world records in the 400- and 800-metre races (3 minutes 56.46 seconds and 8 minutes 4.79 seconds, respectively), and the 800-metre final saw Ledecky take almost two seconds off the record time as she finished more than 11 seconds faster than her nearest competitor.\n\nAt the 2017 world championships, Ledecky won five gold medals (the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre freestyle as well as the 4 \u00d7 100- and 4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle). However, she suffered an unexpected loss in the 200 metres, having to settle for silver. At a meet in 2018, Ledecky bettered her previous world record in the 1,500 metres, finishing in 15 minutes 20.48 seconds. Later that year she competed at the Pan Pacific Championships, winning gold medals in the 400-, 800-, and 1,500-metre races. She also captured one silver (4 \u00d7 200-metre freestyle) and one bronze (200-metre freestyle). Illness limited her participation at the 2019 world championships, though she managed to win gold in the 800-metre freestyle and silver in both the 400 metres and the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay. She entered the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) as one of the favourites, and she won the 800- and 1,500-metre freestyle; it was the first time that women had competed in the latter event at the Olympics. However, in the 400 metres she suffered her first loss in an individual race at the Games, finishing in second place. In addition, she won a silver in the 4 \u00d7 200-metre relay.

She wrapped up the Games as the most bemedaled female athlete, garnering four golds (200-meter, 400-meter, 800-meter, and 4x200-meter freestyle) and one silver (4x100-meter freestyle).\n\nShe broke two world records in the process, and also earned the distinction of being the most decorated US female athlete ever in a single-Olympic performance.\n\nSee also\n\nThis year, she will be defending her titles in the 200- and 400-meter events, and is going for a three-peat in the 800-meter freestyle. If she achieves this, she will join Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi as the only women to win the same swimming event at three consecutive Summer Olympics.\n\nLedecky: Hands down favorite in the 1500-meter freestyle\n\nLedecky is also heavily favored to win in the 1500-meter event, which makes its debut for women at the Games this year. Men have participated in this distance since 1908.\n\nDuring the US Olympic trials for the 1500-meter, she clocked 15 minutes, 40.50 seconds, well off her world record of 15:20:48 that she set in 2018. However, her winning time was still the fastest in the world this year.\n\nThis is her third time to compete in the Summer Games. She first took part in London in 2012, bagging the gold in the 800-meter freestyle when she was just 15 years old. She was also the youngest member of the US swim team at the time.\n\nHer performance outside of the Olympics is just as impressive. Ledecky has won the World Championship gold medal 15 times, the most for any female swimmer. She has also broken 14 world records and 37 US records thus far in her swimming career.\n\nWith her consistent record-breaking track record since Rio, the freestyle specialist is all set to dazzle and make even more history at the Tokyo Games."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/athletes/katie-ledecky", "page_content": "(1997-)\n\nWho Is Katie Ledecky?\n\nBorn in Maryland in 1997, Katie Ledecky began swimming competitively at age six. After earning a berth on the U.S. Olympic team at age 15, she set an American record in the 800-meter freestyle to win a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Games. Ledecky has since shattered world records across an array of freestyle events ranging from 400 to 1,500 meters. At the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, she dominated the pool, winning gold medals in the 400-meter freestyle in world record time, the 200-meter freestyle and the 4x200 meter freestyle relay, and silver in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay. She also broke the world record, winning gold in the 800-meter freestyle.\n\nEarly Years and Competitive Career\n\nKathleen Genevieve \"Katie\" Ledecky was born on March 17, 1997, in Bethesda, Maryland. The second child of David, a lawyer, and Mary Gen, a former collegiate swimmer and hospital administrator, she began swimming competitively at the Palisades Swim & Tennis Club at age six, alongside her older brother, Michael.\n\nWith her seemingly insatiable appetite for pool activity, Ledecky became a standout at the Nation\u2019s Capital Swim Club under coach Yuri Suguiyama. In 2011, Suguiyama began instructing Ledecky to kick more aggressively while racing, a technique commonly used by elite men's swimmers but rarely seen on the women's side. That summer, before the start of her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, she dominated the U.S. Junior Championships with wins in the 400-, 800- and 1,500- meter freestyle events.\n\n2012 London Olympics Breakout Star\n\nLedecky made her senior debut at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, entering the 200-, 400- and 800-meter freestyles. The lack of top-level experience proved to be no obstacle for the 15-year-old, who surged to an eye-opening win in the 800m to become the youngest member of the U.S. team.\n\nHer momentum continued through the competition at the 2012 London Games, where Ledecky paced her heat in the 800m. She then blew the competition out of the water in the final, breaking Janet Evans's 23-year-old American record with a time of 8:14.63 to win the gold medal.\n\nAfterward, Ledecky displayed the easy confidence of someone who expected to win. \u201cI knew if I put my mind to it, I could do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intimidated at all.\u201d\n\nContinued Swimming Success\n\nUnder the guidance of new coach Bruce Gemmell, Ledecky showed that her 2012 Olympic performance was merely the tip of the iceberg. Proving capable of winning both middle- and long-distance events, she established world records in the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyles en route to four gold medals at the 2013 FINA World Championships. She claimed another four golds at the 2014 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, and at the 2015 FINA World Championships, she became the first woman to win the 200- 400- 800- and 1500-meter freestyles in a major competition. Her victories often coming via huge margins, Ledecky has been honored as the FINA Swimmer of the Year, the USOC's Olympic SportsWoman of the Year and a three-time Golden Goggle Female Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe champion swimmer was accepted to Stanford University prior to her graduation from Stone Ridge in 2015, but she elected to defer enrollment to focus on training for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Proving to be in peak form well before the start of Olympic competition, she set her 11th world record with a time of 8:06.68 in the 800m free at the Arena Pro Swim Series in January 2016.\n\nAdditionally, Ledecky headed into the summer as the world-record holder in the 400- and 1,500-meter freestyles. Unbeaten in all major international competition, she was expected to add to her already impressive gold medal count and become one of the American team's most celebrated Olympians by the close of the 2016 Rio Games.\n\n2016 Rio Olympic Games\n\nLedecky did not disappoint in Rio. In her first individual event, the women's 400-meter freestyle, she won gold, soaring past the competition early on and finishing with a time that was two seconds better than her own world record and four seconds more than her second place finisher. She also helped her teammates win silver in the Women's 4x100 meter freestyle relay. She went on to win gold again in the 200-meter freestyle race, edging out Swedish swimmer Sarah Sjostrom, who won silver. After the grueling race, Ledecky spoke about finding the strength to grab the gold. \u201cI did come pretty close to throwing up during that last 50,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cI knew I just needed to get my hand on the wall and be done. Everything was hurting . . .I just had to dig deep and do my own thing. I had no idea whether I touched first . . .I was done when I touched the wall. I knew I\u2019d given it everything I had to.\n\nShe continued to dominate as the anchor in the 4x200 meter freestyle relay, winning the gold medal with teammates Allison Schmitt, Leah Smith and Maya Dirado. She also defended her 2012 world title in the 800-meter individual freestyle in a stunning victory, finishing the race at 8:04:79 and smashing the world record. With this gold win, Ledecky became the second woman to win three individual freestyle events at a single Olympic Games, a feat also accomplished by Debbie Meyer at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.\n\n2021 Tokyo Olympics\n\nLedecky will compete at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, swimming in the 200-meter freestyle, 400-meter freestyle, 800-meter freestyle and 1,500-meter freestyle, as well as the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Katie\n\nBirth Year: 1997\n\nBirth date: March 17, 1997\n\nBirth State: Maryland\n\nBirth City: Bethesda\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: American swimmer Katie Ledecky won a gold medal at the 2012 Olympics before shattering numerous world records.

Despite being just 23-years-old, the USA star has already won five Olympic gold medals and 15 world championships titles - the most by a woman in history. In addition, she is the current world record holder in the 400m, 800, and 1500m freestyle events. Such achievements have led a growing number of voices wanting to see the Washington DC native take on men in the pool. \u201cI\u2019d love to, that\u2019d be fun.\u201d Ledecky told swimoutlet.com, upon being asked if she\u2019d like to compete against the men.\n\nLedecky sets 400m Freestyle world record\n\nAt the Des Moines Pro Swim Series meet in March 2020, Ledecky\u2019s performance added fuel to the flames. She swam a 15:29.51 time in the 1500m, which would have placed her fifth in the men\u2019s competition. \u201cI\u2019ve done that at a couple of meets when I was back on the east coast. I\u2019d love that opportunity. I\u2019ll have to talk to some meet organisers.\u201d\n\nLedecky V Titmus rematch But there was one woman who managed to beat Ledecky last season. At the 2019 world championships, Australia\u2019s Ariarne Titmus caused the shock of the event by defeating Ledecky in the 400m freestyle final. While it should be noted that the American was struggling with an illness in Gwangju (pulling out of two events later in the competition), the Ledecky v Titmus rematch was one of the most hotly-anticipated subplots to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Ledecky admitted at the time that the loss \u2018stung\u2019, and it would appear she was taking no chances with her preparations for Japan. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a bad practice since January,\u201d the Stanford-based swimmer revealed in March 2020. \u201cThere have been a lot of practices that have stood out. Definitely some that I\u2019d put in my top 10 of all time.\u201d\n\nThe importance of goal setting Aside from total dedication to her training, Ledecky sees goal setting as one of the key components of her success. As a six-year-old, she kept a list of \u2018want times\u2019 - which were her swimming goals. \u201cFrom early on, I enjoyed the math and was fascinated by how tenths of a second or hundredths of a second could make a difference,\u201d the psychology student told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how those goals have spurred me to set records.\u201d\n\nAthlete Evolution: Katie Ledecky\n\nAs a 15-year-old qualifier for the 2012 Olympic trials, Ledecky\u2019s goal was to make the London 2012 team. Not only did she succeed, but she also took home the 800m free gold medal. Ledecky\u2019s three goals ahead of Rio 2016 were to win the 200m free, to go 3:56 or faster in the 400m free, and to go 8:05 or faster in the 800 free. She achieved all three feats, setting world records in the 400m and 800m.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nGREENWICH, CT \u2014 Greenwich Public Schools announced this week that Jon Ledecky, co-owner of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League, will be the 2023 commencement speaker at Greenwich High School. Graduation is slated for June 15 at Cardinal Stadium.\n\n\"It\u2019s an honor to be asked to speak at this year\u2019s commencement,\" said Ledecky, a GHS alum, in a news release. \"I made so many friends and created a lifetime of memories at Greenwich High School. I cannot wait to celebrate this momentous occasion with the students and their families.\" While at GHS, Ledecky reported on GHS sports for WGCH Radio and the Greenwich Time, and was awarded the nationally prestigious Grantland Rice Scholarship as the nation\u2019s top teenage sports reporter.\n\n\n\n\"Greenwich High School has a rich and proud tradition of educational excellence in the state of Connecticut,\" GHS Principal Ralph Mayo said in a news release. \"To welcome back Jon Ledecky, a GHS graduate with such an accomplished and successful business career, as the 2023 commencement speaker, is a true honor for us.\"\n\nLedecky founded U.S. Office Products in 1994 and by 1997, the company had become the fastest entrant ever in the history of the Fortune 500, according to a news release from the school district. Ledecky has also served on over 20 public company boards during his career and helped to raise over $25 billion in financing for these companies.\n\n\n\nLedecky\u2019s initial foray into professional sports ownership came in in 1999 when, with partner Ted Leonsis, he bought the NHL\u2019s Washington Capitals and an interest in the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association. He later sold his partnership interest and started a foundation that dedicated itself to the education of inner-city children in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C.\n\nLedecky and Scott Malkin bought into the Islanders franchise as partners with now-former owner Charles Wang in 2014. In 2016, Ledecky and Malkin took over as majority owners."}]}
