Tisci\u2019s critics have argued that he failed to make the most of Burberry\u2019s British heritage and there was a sense of disconnect between his designs and the brand\u2019s history.\n\nTisci leaves less than a year after the man who brought him in, Gobbetti, departed; he was replaced by a Briton, Jonathan Akeroyd. The changing of the guard also includes the long-term finance head, Julie Brown, who, it was announced earlier this week, is moving to the drug group GSK.\n\nTisci brought a streetwear aesthetic to Burberry, which helped re-energise its brand image and attract a younger, more diverse and fashion-conscious set of customers.\n\nHis exit had long been rumoured since Gobbetti left.

But Tisci\u2019s contract runs out in early 2023, and rumours of a potential creative reset have been swirling, with British designer Lee among those touted as potential candidates for the role.\n\nDuring his tenure, Tisci made significant headway in expanding Burberry\u2019s footing in streetwear, introducing a broader offering of hoodies, trainers and sweatpants, while the brand\u2019s white-hot collaboration with Supreme in March generated queues outside its stores and sold out online in minutes. The Italian designer also played with notions of Britishness through his refined tailoring and a collaboration with Dame Vivienne Westwood.

Daniel Lee, the former creative director of Bottega Veneta, will take Tisci\u2019s spot at the British heritage house joining on October 3.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that Daniel is joining Burberry as our new Chief Creative Officer. Daniel is an exceptional talent with a unique understanding of today\u2019s luxury consumer and a strong record of commercial success, and his appointment reinforces the ambitions we have for Burberry,\u201d Akeroyd said in a release. \u201cI am excited about working closely with him and I am confident he will have the impact we are aiming for in this next phase, supported by our talented and experienced teams.\u201d\n\nTisci\u2019s appointment at Burberry reunited him with then-CEO Marco Gobbetti, who held the same role at Givenchy during the designer\u2019s tenure there. Under his leadership, Tisci gave Burberry a more international gloss, and re-engaged millennial and Gen Z fans. But Gobbetti left Burberry in June of last year. (He is now at Ferragamo.) Akeroyd, formerly of Versace, was named Burberry\u2019s new CEO last October and began working in the role in April of this year.\n\nInterrupted by the Covid crisis, Tisci\u2019s Burberry failed to reach lift-off the way the LVMH-owned Givenchy did when he helmed that brand. The timing was hard, but Tisci was also playing against type. His predecessor Christopher Bailey embraced and extrapolated on Burberry\u2019s storied heritage; each collection was a sort of love letter to Britain. Being Italian-born, even though he is Central Saint Martins-trained, Tisci came at the label as more of an outsider. His run at the brand has also intersected with Brexit, which perhaps complicated the job of selling Burberry\u2019s Britishness to the world.\n\nNonetheless, he has had his triumphs at Burberry. Straight away, he hooked up with the design legend Peter Saville (of New Order album fame) and reimagined the house logo, adding a T for Thomas to the famous Burberry B. The company\u2019s use of fur ended on his watch, as did the controversial and environmentally harmful policy of burning unsold merchandise. And the Adam Driver-fronted campaign for Hero, Tisci\u2019s first Burberry men\u2019s fragrance, was an unmissable viral phenomenon."}, {"url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a18961097/burberry-riccardo-tisci-creative-director/", "page_content": "In a surprising move, Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci as its new Chief Creative Officer.

Daniel Lee is reportedly replacing Riccardo Tisci as the next creative director of Burberry , signaling a major change for the heritage British label. While neither the house nor Daniel Lee has confirmed if this is true, the rumor has nonetheless sparked the question of whether or not Burberry is ready to move away from Tisci and whether or not Lee is the one for the job.\n\nThe rumors were first ignited by WWD, when the publication claimed that it had obtained new information from an \u201cindustry source\u201d that the former Bottega Veneta creative head is currently in \u201cadvanced discussions\u201d with Burberry\u2019s upper management. The move toward a new creative director is not unsurprising, since Tisci\u2019s contract with the house ends in 2023. When Tisci first joined Burberry in 2018, many fashion critics were skeptical of the decision. While he will always be considered a veteran in the world of luxury fashion, his appointment at Burberry did not create as much of a buzz as one might expect. Prior to taking on the new role at the British fashion house, Tisci was Givenchy\u2018s creative director between 2005 to 2017 where he introduced an unforgettable meld of Gothic design with futuristic minimalism to the French label.\n\nAt the time when Tisci joined Burberry, the label was already in need of a branding face-lift that would amalgamate the house\u2019s almost two-century old heritage values and the contemporary ethos that sees luxury focus on real-to-wear. Tisci brought a sense of sleek minimalism that resembled parts of Phoebe Philo\u2018s \u201cold\u201d C\u00e9line, but has also included moments of theatrical maximalism that would be equated to Gucci\u2018s own Alessandro Michele. Under his tenure, the designer revamped the Burberry image, modernizing the branding and stabilizing the growth of the company. Understanding that Burberry has always fallen into the category of premium luxury as opposed to ultra-luxury, Tisci was able to take the brand in an unforeseen direction to appeal to the masses. Following the present-day real-to-wear trend demanded by luxury clients, he was able to turn Burberry into an elevated brand that has transcended the traditional streetwear connotation, while also maintaining heritage house values.\n\nDespite operating in the midst of the pandemic, Tisci was still able to repopularize the brand, expanding its visibility by utilizing his relationship with celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Billie Eilish and Bella Hadid to grow its streetwear range and introduce the new \u201cTB\u201d monogram . He also launched co-branded collaborations with the likes of Opening Ceremony and Vivienne Westwood. His star-studded campaigns as well as influencer-approved handbags like the Lola, have proven to be a major hit amongst trend spotters.\n\nAround the same time as Tisci\u2019s appointment, Lee was putting in his work as Bottega Veneta\u2019s creative director between 2018 and 2021. Lee\u2019s transformation of Bottega has helped the house to harness a new generation of consumers, something that the brand had been struggling with prior to his leadership. Perhaps one of his greatest achievements at the house included reviving the Intrecciato pattern \u2013 he created hype around the Pouch clutch and Cassette bag, all while building up to the reformed reputation of the brand, better known as \u201cNew Bottega.\u201d His creative leadership not only included product design, but Lee\u2019s ability to create buzz by focusing on a \u201cno social media\u201d strategy is to be commended. In an internet age, Lee proved that he could ensure Bottega\u2019s relevance without a presence on social media.\n\nWhen Bottega and Lee made the \u201cjoint decision\u201d to announce his departure from the house, it sent shockwaves throughout the industry, with many eager to know where he will land next. Now, about a year after the news, it appears that fans may have an answer. Different from Tisci\u2019s vision at Burberry, Lee has been able to consistently elevate Bottega\u2019s interest without a social media presence and all while not comprising the traditional Bottega essence by following the overwhelming streetwear trends. Lee maintained the clean-cut aesthetic, while still keeping the vision fresh. Looking back at Lee\u2019s success and his potential new position at Burberry, it poses the question of whether or not Lee will be able to continue his successful streak and bring his creative direction to the London-based brand.\n\nSo, as the industry gears up for a series of changes, fashion onlookers will have to be patient and see what Burberry has in store next and whether or not it is ready to part with Riccardo Tisci and start a new partnership with Daniel Lee. What is certain is that no matter who will take on the role, they will be refreshing the brand under difficult circumstances brought on by the shifts in the industry and economy.\n\nIn other big fashion changes in the luxury world, Martine Rose, Grace Wales Bonner, and Telfar Clemens are reportedly front runners in succeeding Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/workplace-talent/riccardo-tisci-is-the-new-creative-director-of-burberry/", "page_content": "LONDON, United Kingdom \u2014 Burberry has named Riccardo Tisci its new creative officer, effective March 12, 2018. Tisci succeeds Christopher Bailey, who announced his departure in October 2017 after 17 years with the company.\n\nTisci joins the British megabrand after more than a decade as creative director at Givenchy, where he is credited with resurrecting the LVMH-owned couture house with his dark, sensual and subversive collections. The Italian designer left the brand on January 31, 2017 when his contract ended. He was replaced by Clare Waight Keller.\n\nIn his new role, Tisci will be based in London and direct all of Burberry\u2019s collections, presenting his first outing for the brand in September 2018. The announcement sent the company's share price up more than five percent.\n\n\"Riccardo is one of the most talented designers of our time. His designs have an elegance that is contemporary and his skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today's luxury consumer. Riccardo's creative vision will reinforce the ambitions we have for Burberry and position the brand firmly in luxury,\u201d said Marco Gobetti, Burberry\u2019s chief executive who joined the company on July 5, 2017, from LVMH-owned C\u00e9line.\n\n\"I have an enormous respect for Burberry's British heritage and global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand,\u201d added Tisci. \u201cI am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this is not the first time Tisci and Gobbetti have worked together. Gobetti, who was previously president and chief executive at Givenchy from 2004 to 2008, was responsible for hiring the designer, who was then relatively unknown. Tisci breathed much-needed life into Givenchy's womenswear, menswear and accessories.\n\nSince joining Burberry in 2001, Bailey worked with former chief executive Rose Marie Bravo and her successor Angela Ahrendts to save the British stalwart \u2014 best known for its classic, durable trench coats \u2014 from a period of brand dilution.\n\nDuring his tenure, Burberry became a new star of the global luxury industry. By 2011, the company was generating \u00a31.5 billion in revenue \u2014 a 27 percent increase over the previous year \u2014 with a market capitalisation of \u00a35.8 billion. That was twice the rate of growth of LVMH\u2019s revenue and market value over the same period. At the same time, Burberry gained recognition for its digital savvy. But it\u2019s no secret that in recent years Burberry has struggled to maintain its momentum, with the company\u2019s sales growth lagging its peers.\n\nTaking Burberry Upmarket\n\nLast November, Gobbetti outlined an ambitious three-pronged plan to elevate the British brand's positioning, placing the label \"firmly in the luxury segment, the most enduring and rewarding part of the industry.\" As part of the strategy, Gobbetti plans to enhance the brand's leather goods offering, bring greater newness to its collections, tighten distribution by scaling back its lower-end wholesale partnerships, refresh stores and use its reputation as a digital innovator to better communicate its new product offering.\n\n\u201cBy re-energising our product and customer experience to establish our position firmly in luxury, we will play in the most rewarding, enduring segment of the market,\u201d Gobbetti said in a statement that coincided with the announcement of first-half results for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nBurberry is betting that Tisci's expertise in elevating casual wear to high-fashion status will increase the label's relevancy amongst luxury consumers, according to a source close to the brand. (Burberry has already entered the streetwear category with conviction, unveiling a partnership with skater-inspired label Gosha Rubchinskiy for Spring/Summer 2018.) It's a strategy with validity: High-end streetwear helped boost global sales of luxury personal goods by 5 percent this year to an estimated \u20ac263 billion, and the sector is projected to grow 5 percent through 2020, according to a report from consulting firm Bain & Co.\n\n\"The contemporary street style orientation of Riccardo Tisci is a great match to relaunch the image of Burberry,\" wrote Mario Ortelli, senior analyst of luxury goods at Stanford C. Bernstein, in a note. \"We believe that Burberry's management will try to emulate the action plan of Gucci.\" This includes the clearance of previous collections in the next two to three quarters; launching new campaigns and initiatives; presenting an impactful and bold collection at London Fashion Week in September; extend the new style to other product lines and lowering price points to reach a wider consumer base; and renewing the store network progressively.\n\nThe main questions now, said Ortelli, are whether Tisci\u2019s style will resonate among industry insiders and opinion makers, and if Burberry\u2019s management will be able to manage the pace of its new action plan. \u201cA star designer like Riccardo can have demanding requests about the new store format and the timing to deploy it,\u201d he added.\n\nFinancial analysts were tough on Gobbetti when he presented Burberry's third-quarter results in January 2018. Retail revenue was \u00a3719 million in the three months to December 31, 2017, down from \u00a3735 million in the same period in 2016. The company said retail revenue was up 1 percent on an underlying basis, while comparable store sales rose 2 percent, below analysts' expectations.\n\nComparable store sales grew by a mid-single figure percentage in Asia Pacific and mainland China, and by a low single digit in the Americas. However, they fell by a low single figure in its Europe division, hurt by a larger fall in the UK.\n\nTisci left his hometown of Taranto in southern Italy to study at Central Saint Martins in London, graduating in 1999. In September 2004, he set up an eponymous ready-to-wear label, showing his first collection in Milan for the Autumn/Winter 2005 season. The show caught the attention of Gobetti, who hired Tisci to replace Julien Macdonald as creative director of Givenchy in February 2005.\n\nBailey will step down from Burberry\u2019s board on March 31, 2018.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n[ Unpacking Burberry\u2019s New Strategy ]\n\n[ Burberry Plots Life After Bailey ]"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019.

He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/burberry-rebrands-under-riccardo-tisci/", "page_content": "LONDON, United Kingdom \u2014 Burberry has a new graphic identity.\n\nThe British megabrand's chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci took to his personal Instagram Stories to unveil a new logo \u2014 stark capital letters saying \"Burberry London England,\" replacing the previously softer, rounder font \u2014 and monogram \u2014 the founder Thomas Burberry's initials \"TB\" interlocked across a honeyed background \u2014 on Thursday.\n\nIt marks the first time the brand has changed its logo in almost 20 years (the previous logo, which saw Burberry drop the \"S\" from its name, was designed by Fabien Baron in 1999).\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the renowned British art director and graphic designer Peter Saville \u2014 best known for his New Order and Joy Division record sleeves, and more recently, his work for Calvin Klein under Raf Simons \u2014 the brand's new logo was inspired by Tisci's visit to the house's archive, \"especially a logo from 1908 and a Thomas Burberry monogram,\" according to an email correspondence between the two creatives, which Tisci shared on social media.\n\nThe logo and monogram print will appear across all Burberry channels and in a new advertising campaign.\n\nBurberry's new logo developed by Riccardo Tisci in collaboration with Peter Saville | Source: Courtesy Burberry's new logo developed by Riccardo Tisci in collaboration with Peter Saville | Source: Courtesy\n\nBurberry's new logo developed by Riccardo Tisci in collaboration with Peter Saville | Source: Courtesy\n\nThe new visual identity comes five months after Tisci took the creative helm at Burberry, replacing Christopher Bailey. Chief executive Marco Gobbetti, who joined the company in July 2017, is nine months into his 5-year plan to reposition Burberry as a genuine luxury player and re-energise a brand whose sales growth has significantly lagged rivals LVMH and Kering. Core to the strategy is a renewed focus on leather goods, which currently account for less than 40 percent of revenue, and will presumably leverage the new monogram.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, fashion that so conspicuously screamed commercialism and consumption fell out of favour. Even Louis Vuitton changed tack, reserving its signature stamp for only limited-edition goods. After all, decreasing availability means increasing exclusivity \u2014 and for luxury brands, this means increasing demand.\n\nBut now, luxury brands are returning to logos. As part of his maximalist revolution, Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele resurrected the brand's interlocking G motif from its '90s heyday, reinterpreting it for a younger, modern audience by adorning it with flowers or pairing it with playful motifs. Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri reintroduced the house's logo print on handbags for her first ready-to-wear show. Fendi, too, has been reviving its black and brown double 'F' logo print across its clothing and accessories.\n\nTisci previously revealed on social media the news that Burberry and Vivienne Westwood would be collaborating on a limited-edition collection, launching in December 2018.\n\nTisci will show his first full collection for Burberry in September 2018.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n[ Why Burberry Chose Riccardo Tisci ]\n\n[ Burberry\u2019s New Strategy Takes Shape ]\n\n[ As Branding Evolves, What\u2019s a Logo Worth? ]"}, {"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/burberry-riccardo-tisci-out-daniel-lee-in", "page_content": "Burberry has announced that Riccardo Tisci is departing the label after nearly five years as its chief creative officer. Tisci first joined Burberry in 2018, following his noteworthy 12-year tenure at Givenchy. His successor has already been announced: Daniel Lee, the buzzy British designer best known for transforming the fortunes of Italian label Bottega Veneta in recent years, has been announced as the newly-appointed Chief Creative Officer of the brand.\n\nAt Burberry, Tisci also brought his star power to the brand, with the likes of Naomi Campbell, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Irina Shayk becoming regulars on the catwalk. He brought a new attitude, too: Burberry's long-standing logo was replaced with a boxy, Helvetica one designed by art director and graphic designer Peter Saville. Tisci also introduced a new monogram: a riff on Thomas Burberry's initials implemented across bags, T-shirts, trainers and outerwear.\n\nWhile still producing the trench coats and suiting that have long shaped Burberry's heritage, Tisci brought his gothic glamour to a brand not known for it. \u201cThe chapter I was asked to write in its long story is one that I am incredibly proud of and one I have decided would culminate with my show on Monday,\" Tisci said this morning. \"I thrived to continue a legacy of innovation, and consistently championed for creativity and diversity, in order to always keep Burberry moving forward. I want to thank my teams, past and present, and the army of collaborators and friends who helped me write a chapter that I hope will stay in Burberry\u2019s future for years to come.\u201d\n\nLee, who had previously worked at Maison Margiela, Balenciaga and Donna Karan, left Bottega Veneta abruptly in November of last year by mutual agreement. It's safe to assume that he'll be expected to deliver Burberry the same commercial heat he did Veneta, where he took the brand from a lesser-known luxury label to the backs of most celebrities on the planet, with Hailey Bieber, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jacob Elordi giving the label a big \u201cBottega Green\u201d light.\n\n\u201cI am honoured to join Burberry as Chief Creative Officer,\" Lee has said in a press release. \u201cTogether with the team, we will write the exciting next chapter for this legendary British luxury brand, continuing its historic heritage and building on Riccardo\u2019s legacy. I am very excited to be returning to London, a city that champions pioneering creativity and that continues to inspire me.\u201d\n\nLee will present his first collection for the label at London Fashion Week next February.\n\nThis story originally ran on British GQ with the title \u201cRiccardo Tisci out, Daniel Lee in at Burberry\u201d"}]}
