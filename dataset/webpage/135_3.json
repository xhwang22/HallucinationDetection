His lawyer, Angela Berry, argued that the board should base its decision on who Sirhan is today.\n\nProsecutors declined to participate or oppose his release, under a policy by Los Angeles county district attorney George Gascon, a former police officer who took office last year. Gascon, who said he idolized the Kennedys and mourned RFK\u2019s assassination, believes the prosecutors\u2019 role ends at sentencing and they should not influence decisions to release prisoners.\n\nAs Douglas Kennedy spoke, Sirhan, in a blue prison uniform with a paper towel folded like a handkerchief and tucked into his pocket, smiled as Kennedy spoke.

Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, denied his parole in 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031507957/sirhan-sirhan-robert-f-kennedy-parole-hearing", "page_content": "Sirhan Sirhan Has Served 53 Years For Killing Robert F.

Robert F. Kennedy during a Los Angeles presidential campaign stop in 1968, was recommended for parole Friday in San Diego.\n\nTwo commissioners of the California Board of Parole made their recommendation after a review of Sirhan's record while in prison and hearing from two of Kennedy's sons, according to The Associated Press. Here's what we know.\n\nIt could take months to have a final decision\n\nThe commissioners' decision is still subject to further review and, ultimately, final approval by the governor of California. That process could take up to 120 days.\n\nSirhan, 77, was convicted of the murder in 1969 and sentenced to death. In 1972 the California Supreme Court ruled capital punishment to be unconstitutional, and Sirhan was resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\n\nThe shooting occurred in the kitchen area of the Ambassador Hotel. Kennedy had just given a victory speech after winning California's Democratic presidential primary and looked likely to win the party's nomination. He and five other people were shot as they made their way through the hotel kitchen.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Harry Benson/Daily Express/Getty Images Harry Benson/Daily Express/Getty Images\n\nSirhan was tackled to the ground, gun in hand, moments after the shooting. But there have long been some people who have advanced alternate versions of what happened that night.\n\nKennedys divided over Sirhan's release\n\nOne theory holds that Sirhan had been hypnotized or programmed to shoot Kennedy. Others think there were other shooters. Kennedy's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Washington Post he doesn't think Sirhan killed his father.\n\nPaul Schrade, a labor leader who'd worked with the senator, was also shot by Sirhan that night, but he believes Sirhan should be released.\n\n\"Sirhan did not shoot Robert Kennedy,\" Schrade, now 96, maintains. \"I got the first shot, the second shot missed Kennedy.\"\n\nSchrade said unreliable ballistics evidence by the Los Angeles Police Department muddied the case, and as long as Sirhan is in prison, it will make it harder to identify the person who, in Schrade's opinion, really killed Kennedy.\n\n\"Getting him out of the picture means that we have a better chance of making the case,\" Schrade said. \"We can get the second gunman identified and convicted \u2014 the second gunman killed Robert Kennedy!\"\n\nBut the parole board ruling is not intended as an endorsement of the second gunman theory.\n\nAt the hearing, the AP reported that Douglas Kennedy spoke about being moved by the remorse shown by Sirhan over his father's killing.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr. Sirhan face to face,\" he said. \"I think I've lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.\"\n\nBut most of Robert Kennedy's nine surviving children oppose parole. A few hours after the hearing, six of them, including former Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II, sent NPR a statement saying they were \"devastated\" by the parole recommendation.\n\nThe ruling \"ignores the standards for parole of a confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California,\" the statement says.\n\n\"Our father's death impacted our family in ways that can never adequately be articulated and today's decision by a two-member parole board has inflicted enormous additional pain,\" the statement said, and called for a reversal of the recommendation by the full parole board or the governor.\n\nThis was his 16th time trying to get parole\n\nSirhan tried and failed to get parole 15 times earlier, with the last hearing in 2016. But this time around, there was no opposition from the new Los Angeles district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, whose office has a policy of not weighing in against parole.\n\nAlso working in Sirhan's favor this time were changes to California law in recent years that make it easier for a prisoner to get parole for a crime committed at a young age. Sirhan was 24 when he shot Kennedy.\n\nIf Sirhan is released, he may face deportation to Jordan.

We each adhere to a religion that teaches the virtue of forgiveness and redemption. We each have experience in public safety and national security.

We each adhere to a religion that teaches the virtue of forgiveness and redemption.\n\nFor starters, under the law of California and elsewhere, a showing of remorse is a factor that supports parole. Sirhan fails that test. Even after 53 years\u2019 reflection in jail, Sirhan still avoids a straightforward acknowledgment of the fact that, in a room full of witnesses, he was the one who killed Robert Kennedy. Though Sirhan acknowledges he fired a gun at Kennedy, at his most recent parole hearing the best he could do was to express sorrow for the crime \u201cif I did in fact do that.\u201d One parole commissioner noted Sirhan\u2019s \u201clack of taking complete responsibility.\"\n\nThen there are the views of the Kennedy family. Their views should be given great weight. Morally they should have a voice \u2014 not because they are Kennedys, but because they are the direct victims of Sirhan\u2019s crime. Compassion is in the DNA of the Kennedy family. Yet, it is significant that most of the family, including Bobby\u2019s wife, Ethel, oppose parole. Kennedy\u2019s murder left 11 children of all ages without a father. The youngest, Rory was born six months after her father died. David Kennedy learned of his father\u2019s shooting watching TV, and died of a drug overdose 16 years later. Ethel Kennedy was left a single mother. The extended Kennedy family had to absorb the pain and shock of their loved one\u2019s public murder just five years after his older brother\u2019s public murder.\n\nFinally, we oppose parole because of the gravity of the crime. Legally, Sirhan stands convicted of an act of first-degree murder committed by one man against another. The reality is that Sirhan\u2019s crime was a political assassination that likely altered the course of American history. It was in a crime against the nation as a whole.\n\nIn June 1968 America was in turmoil. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated two months before. The Vietnam War raged on. With his unique blend of eloquence and compassion, Bobby Kennedy promised to restore hope, end the war and bring us together. We saw his eloquence and compassion on display in impromptu remarks in Indianapolis the night King was killed, and while touring poor white communities in Appalachia. We saw his ability to bring us together in the thousands of working class whites, Blacks, Boy Scouts, nuns and police officers who stood vigil and watched his slow, sad funeral train travel along the Northeast corridor. Arguably no American politician has attracted such a broad coalition of Americans since.\n\nThe night of June 4, 1968, was a pivotal moment for the country. Kennedy had won the crucial California primary, propelling him on a trajectory to win the Democratic nomination and possibly the presidency. As he concluded his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles with the words \u201cIt\u2019s on to Chicago and let\u2019s win there,\u201d Americans looked to Kennedy to recapture Camelot, and make us optimistic about the future of our country again.\n\nThat all came crashing down minutes later when Sirhan shot Kennedy in a kitchen passageway of the hotel.\n\nFollowing Kennedy\u2019s death, the Vietnam War continued for another seven years, tens of thousands more American troops died, Watergate became known as more than a hotel, and Americans\u2019 trust and confidence in their government and their leaders spiraled downward.\n\nEach of us believes this course of American history would have been different and better had Bobby Kennedy lived beyond June 1968.\n\nEach of us believes this course of American history would have been different and better had Bobby Kennedy lived beyond June 1968. We can never know with certainty whether Kennedy would have been elected president in 1968. We do know with certainty that, with a .22 caliber pistol, Sirhan Sirhan took it upon himself to deny Americans the opportunity to make that pivotal choice at the ballot box. That was Sirhan\u2019s crime against the nation.\n\nIt must not be forgotten that Sirhan hated Robert Kennedy for his support of military aid to Israel, that Sirhan proclaimed that he killed Kennedy \u201cfor my country,\u201d and that in 1973 Palestinian gunmen in Sudan took several diplomats hostage and killed three, including two Americans, when the U.S. refused to release Palestinian prisoners, including Sirhan.\n\nSirhan was initially sentenced to death in 1969. A California Supreme Court ruling in 1972 converted that death penalty to life imprisonment. Since then, the California criminal justice system has been unyielding in its view that, for the man who assassinated Bobby Kennedy, life means life. We urge California authorities to not bend from that view."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-13/parole-debate-continues-sirhan-sirhan-rfk-murder", "page_content": "Sirhan Sirhan is sworn in during a 2016 parole hearing at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.\n\nCarol Germain lives on a quiet, tree-lined street in Pasadena a few houses down from the brother of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s murderer.\n\nFor 30 years, she has watched TV crews pop by the middle-class neighborhood, where Munir Sirhan\u2019s fenced-off home was featured on a Pasadena true-crime bus tour. At the brother\u2019s request, she recently signed a letter supporting Sirhan Sirhan\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s 77,\u201d she said. \u201cHe probably just wants to come and sit in the backyard.\u201d\n\nBut Germain understands the whirlpool of emotions surrounding the decision last month by California parole commissioners to recommend the release of the man convicted in one of the most infamous political assassinations in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recommendation has stirred intense debate in many corners \u2014 among the Kennedys, others who remember the killing, and even in the Pasadena neighborhood where the convicted killer hopes to settle with his brother if he is freed.\n\nAt its core is the question of how much mercy should be shown to people who commit horrific crimes, including those that may have changed history. Kennedy was a leading candidate for president when he was fatally shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at age 42.\n\nSirhan\u2019s testimony during a virtual hearing \u2014 in which he said he didn\u2019t remember shooting the senator but expressed remorse \u201cif I did in fact do that\u201d \u2014 has been insufficient for many members of the Kennedy family.\n\n\u201cOur family and our country suffered an unspeakable loss due to the inhumanity of one man... he should not have the opportunity to terrorize again,\u201d Ethel Kennedy, the late senator\u2019s widow, who was pregnant with their daughter when he was assassinated, said in a statement.\n\nAlthough six of his children said they were devastated by the commissioners\u2019 decision, two have voiced support for Sirhan.\n\nDouglas Kennedy told the panel that he\u2019d lived in fear of Sirhan but now saw him \u201cas a human being worthy of compassion and love.\u201d Robert Kennedy Jr., who has echoed claims that a second gunman killed the senator, told the Los Angeles Times he was \u201chappy that the justice system showed some humanity.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of rehabilitation point to the small fraction of people who have committed crimes after being released from life sentences. A 2020 report by California\u2019s prison system states that only 2.3% of the 688 such inmates freed in fiscal year 2014-15 were convicted of a new crime \u2014 the majority of them misdemeanors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a single or even a series of behaviors defines the worth of a human being,\u201d said Suzanne Neuhaus, who worked for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from 1988 to 2015 as a parole agent and victims\u2019 services specialist. \u201cAre people worthy of an opportunity for change? Does a just system require mercy?\u201d\n\nSirhan, a Palestinian immigrant, was 24 when he fatally shot the senator minutes after Kennedy\u2019s speech on the night he won the California Democratic presidential primary. He later said he had felt angered by Kennedy\u2019s support for Israel.\n\nHe initially faced the death penalty, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after California briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972.\n\nSirhan has been consistently denied parole. At a 2016 hearing, commissioners decided he hadn\u2019t shown enough remorse or insight into why he had committed a crime that \u201cclearly affected the potential of this nation.\u201d\n\nSirhan\u2019s supporters say he\u2019s recently doubled down on efforts to change that.\n\nOver the last year, they note, Sirhan began working with several prisoners at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego who are trained to help other inmates with conflict resolution.\n\nThe group worked with Jen Abreu, a facilitator for the Alternatives to Violence Project, who said Sirhan spent hours every day working with members of the group on concepts such as empathy and remorse.\n\n\u201cThey would talk about the material and how these giant abstract concepts applied to his life,\u201d Abreu said, \u201creally trying to get him to understand the nuances of this life crime.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, Sirhan told commissioners that he had attended self-help programs and meditates regularly. While he began crying when asked how he felt about the Middle East, he said he would try to detach himself by \u201cdropping it from my conscience.\u201d At 24, he said, he had wanted to be a \u201csolid member of the community\u201d and that\u2019s what he hoped to do with the rest of his life.\n\nCommissioner Robert Barton said Sirhan had no criminal history before the killing and had not committed any serious violations for several decades. The board was required to give \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the fact that Sirhan qualified for youth parole, which operates under the rationale that the parts of the human brain responsible for understanding consequences hadn\u2019t fully developed yet, he said.\n\nAlthough the board considered the political nature of the killing, Barton said, denying parole requires evidence of dangerousness and an unreasonable risk to public safety.\n\nBut much of the opposition to Sirhan receiving parole has focused on his crime.\n\nHeidi Rummel, co-director of USC\u2019s Post-Conviction Justice Project, said that the case is complicated by the fact that Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted from death to life imprisonment.\n\n\u201cThe faction that\u2019s saying it\u2019s unfair to release him should be arguing with California sentencing laws,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an argument with the parole board.\u201d\n\nChristopher Hawthorne, the director of Loyola Marymount University\u2019s Juvenile Innocence and Fair Sentencing Clinic, said that the board cares about Sirhan\u2019s remorse and that \u201cthe current thinking is that if he understands what led him to that [the crime], he also understands how to live a lawful life going forward.\u201d\n\nBut Robert Weisberg, the co-director of Stanford University\u2019s Criminal Justice Center, said that the parole board has discretion to determine whether Sirhan\u2019s release would inflict emotional harm and social distress even if he would never commit another crime.\n\nThe decision must still be reviewed by parole legal staff and can be blocked by Gov. Gavin Newsom, or whoever might replace him following the recall election.\n\nNewsom has rejected the board\u2019s decisions in the past. In November, he reversed parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, 72, who had spent about five decades in prison for the killings of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca \u2014 the fourth time a governor had blocked her release.\n\nIn a letter submitted to the parole board, a Cleveland resident described how in his youth he had knocked on doors to get people to vote for Kennedy. The senator, he said, \u201cwas a person who I loved and respected and in whom I had deep confidence that he would put a quick end to that unjust and immoral war in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nBut Sirhan, he said, \u201chas been punished beyond any reasonable humane realization.\u201d He urged commissioners to let Sirhan\u2019s remaining time alive \u201cbe peaceful.\u201d\n\nMost of Kennedy\u2019s children disagree.\n\nMaxwell Kennedy, who served as a prosecutor for several years and was a toddler when his father was assassinated, told The Times that \u201cretributive justice is vital to my sense of what the justice system is,\u201d holding that people who commit capital murder should not be eligible for parole.\n\n\u201cIf you say you can kill a politician if you\u2019re willing to give 50 years of your life, we are setting a dangerous precedent for Americans, and we are encouraging the dissolution of the rule of law,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an op-ed for the New York Times, Rory Kennedy wrote that she had never met her father \u2014 having been born six months after his death \u2014 and that the loss \u201chas had impact beyond measure.\u201d She wondered whether Sirhan had not already been shown compassion when his death sentence was changed to life in prison.\n\n\u201cIt is a high-minded notion, after all, the belief that everyone \u2014 everyone \u2014 deserves a chance for rehabilitation and, after having served enough time in prison, even parole,\u201d she said.\n\nSirhan\u2019s parents and four of his five siblings are dead.

But if not, he would like to return to his family home in Pasadena.\n\nFor more than a decade, the Sirhan family home was a stop on Pasadena Confidential, a bus tour to places associated with historic and obscure crimes. Richard Schave, who ran the tours with his wife, said they were never comfortable with the police investigation into Kennedy\u2019s death and chose to add the Sirhan home as a stop in order to ask questions about L.A. history that \u201cwe don\u2019t think are looked at closely enough.\u201d\n\nReaction to his possible release has played out in Pasadena through the Nextdoor app, with some residents saying they would be opposed to living close to a murderer.\n\nBut several who live on Munir Sirhan\u2019s street have said they wouldn\u2019t be bothered by Sirhan\u2019s return, pointing to their respect for his brother. One man, who declined to provide his full name, said that Munir had been \u201csuch a good neighbor.\u201d He recalled how his own prom had been held at the Ambassador Hotel where Kennedy was shot.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it, to tell you the truth,\u201d he said, standing on his front porch holding a hummingbird feeder. \u201cI understand it\u2019s polarizing.

Donovan Correctional Facility in Otay Mesa, will be released. The decision by a two-person parole panel will enter a 120-day review period, after which it will be forwarded to the governor, who will have 30 days to decide to uphold the decision, reject it or modify it.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s hearing, Kennedy\u2019s youngest son, Douglas, spoke in favor of Sirhan\u2019s release. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sent a letter to the board in support of parole.\n\nSix of Kennedy\u2019s other seven living children, though issued a statement after the hearing saying they \u201cadamantly oppose\u201d the decision, calling on \u201cparole board staff, the full board and ultimately, Governor (Gavin) Newsom, to reverse this initial recommendation.\n\n\u201cIt is a recommendation we intend to challenge every step of the way and we hope that those who also hold the memory of our father in their hearts will stand with us,\u201d former Rep.

Given today\u2019s unexpected recommendation by the California parole board after 15 previous decisions to deny release, we fell compelled to make our position clear. We adamantly oppose the parole and release of Sirhan Sirhan and are shocked by a ruling that we believe ignores the standards for parole of a confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California. Our father\u2019s death impacted our family in ways that can never adequately be articulated and today\u2019s decision by a two-member parole board has inflicted enormous additional pain. But beyond just us, six of Robert Kennedy\u2019s nine surviving children, Sirhan Sirhan committed a crime against our nation and its people. He took our father from our family and he took him from America.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was not attended by anyone from the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office. District Attorney George Gascon has set a policy against attending parole hearings for defendants who have served lengthy prison sentences beyond the required minimum term.\n\nHis office took the position that the parole board has all the information it needs to decide if an inmate is suitable for release.\n\nSirhan was convicted in April 1969 of first-degree murder and assault for the June 5, 1968, assassination of Democratic Sen.

But unlike the first 15 times, no prosecutor will stand to oppose the release of Sirhan, who is now 77. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Sirhan was arrested at the scene of Kennedy\u2019s shooting in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for the slaying of a U.S. senator who appeared headed for the Democratic presidential nomination. The assassination, along with that of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. two months earlier, created a turning point in American history with the sudden elimination of the charismatic leaders of the American civil rights movement and the Democratic Party respectively.\n\nWhen California abolished the death penalty, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was reduced to life with the possibility of parole. And now Sirhan, who has been incarcerated for 53 years, may benefit from a new push among progressive prosecutors to seek the release, or not oppose the release, of convicts who have served decades behind bars, no longer pose a threat to society and will be costly to treat medically in their later years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewly elected Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n told The Washington Post shortly before his inauguration in December that he was creating a sentencing review unit to revisit the cases of about 20,000 prisoners for possible resentencing, analyzing both the fairness of long sentences and the cost savings for releasing low-risk or older inmates. Gasc\u00f3n issued a directive that his office\u2019s \u201cdefault policy\u201d would be not to attend parole hearings and to submit letters supporting the release of some inmates who had served their mandatory minimums, while also assisting victims and victim advocates at parole hearings if requested.\n\nIn Sirhan\u2019s case, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s office is remaining neutral. The office said it will not attend the parole hearing, as Los Angeles prosecutors have done historically, but it also will not send a letter in support of Sirhan\u2019s parole.\n\n\u201cThe role of a prosecutor and their access to information ends at sentencing,\u201d said Alex Bastian, special adviser to Gasc\u00f3n. \u201cThe parole board\u2019s sole purpose is to objectively determine whether someone is suitable for release. If someone is the same person that committed an atrocious crime, that person will correctly not be found suitable for release. However, if someone is no longer a threat to public safety after having served more than 50 years in prison, then the parole board may recommend release based on an objective determination.\u201d\n\nKennedy is survived by his wife, Ethel Kennedy, and nine children, many of whom declined to comment. The family has not submitted any letters taking a position on Sirhan\u2019s parole and has not requested to speak at Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Post that he thought that Sirhan had not killed his father and that he had met with Sirhan in prison to tell him so. Kennedy said this week that he supports Sirhan\u2019s parole application and that he still thinks a second gunman committed the assassination but that he would not participate in the parole process and declined to comment further. Robert Kennedy Jr.\u2019s stance against vaccines, most recently the coronavirus vaccine, has drawn controversy.\n\nFormer Maryland lieutenant governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in 2018 that she supported her brother\u2019s call for a reinvestigation of their father\u2019s assassination. She declined to comment before the parole hearing, as did human rights activist Kerry Kennedy and former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II.\n\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s announcement that his office would not appear at parole hearings, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced that members of his department would attend the hearings, \u201cin support of those who have been victimized by violent crime.\u201d But Villanueva\u2019s office declined to comment on whether they would appear in the Sirhan case, and they did not file a request to be present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan has a new parole lawyer for this hearing, who does not raise any claims about Sirhan\u2019s involvement in the shooting, in which five other people standing behind Kennedy in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel were wounded. Instead, lawyer Angela Berry focuses on Sirhan\u2019s age at the time \u2014 24 \u2014 his clean record in prison, his remorse and his unlikely chance of reoffending if released.\n\nBerry does not mention Kennedy in her prehearing brief, other than to argue that \u201cdenying parole on an opinion that Mr. Sirhan\u2019s actions \u2018changed the course of history\u2019 or \u2018disenfranchised millions of Americans\u2019 violates due process.\u201d She cites the California Supreme Court\u2019s guidance on parole consideration, which says that an analysis \u201ccannot be undertaken simply by examining the circumstances of the crime in isolation, without consideration of the passage of time or the attendant changes in the inmate\u2019s psychological or mental attitude.\u201d\n\nBerry argues that \u201ccurrent dangerousness is the relevant inquiry by the Board. Statutory and case law dictate that parole shall be granted unless the prisoner poses a current danger to public safety.\u201d Under California law in effect in 1968, a life sentence with parole would have made Sirhan eligible for release after seven years. He has had no disciplinary violations since 1972, and although he claims not to remember the act of shooting Kennedy, he has expressed remorse in parole hearings since the 1980s and said at one, \u201cI have feelings of shame and inward guilt ... I honestly feel the pain that [the Kennedys] may have gone through.\u201d\n\nMunir Sirhan, Sirhan\u2019s younger brother, continues to live in the family\u2019s home in Pasadena, Calif., where they grew up after emigrating as children from Jordanian-controlled territory in East Jerusalem, as Palestinian refugees, with their parents. \u201cHis home is ready for him,\u201d Munir Sirhan told The Post, and his neighbors have filed letters in support of Sirhan\u2019s return. \u201cWe\u2019re awaiting the deserved, proper decision from the parole board.\u201d\n\nBerry\u2019s pleadings raise the possibility that Sirhan could be deported if paroled, because he did not obtain citizenship before his arrest. \u201cHe has said he would give up his right to live in this country,\u201d Munir Sirhan said, \u201cand go back to the Arab world. There are a number of countries who have said they would accept him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn California, two parole commissioners conduct the hearing, corrections department spokesman Luis Patino said. The two-person panel typically issues its decision and explains its rationale on the day of the hearing. Following that, the parole board staff has 120 days to review the case, followed by a 30-day period in which the governor can uphold, reverse or modify the decision, take no action, or send the decision to the full 17-person parole board, Patino said.\n\nLooming over all of this are Sirhan\u2019s supporters who say he did not shoot Kennedy, and who have raised that issue in vain both in the California courts and in parole hearings. The most prominent of those supporters is Paul Schrade, now 96, who was also shot while walking behind Kennedy, and appeared at Sirhan\u2019s last parole hearing to advocate for his release.\n\nShortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was declared the winner of the Democratic presidential primary in California. He gave a short victory speech in a packed ballroom, with Schrade standing next to him, then walked through the hotel pantry toward a news conference. But witnesses said Sirhan moved forward and began firing a .22-caliber gun, striking Kennedy and five others. One shot entered Kennedy\u2019s brain, and he died a day later. Sirhan was tackled immediately and arrested. A jury convicted him in 1969, and all appeals were rejected.\n\nBut Kennedy was shot four times at point-blank range from behind, one shot passing through his jacket and not striking him, with the fatal shot fired so close that gunpowder was on his hair, coroner Thomas Noguchi found. Multiple bullet holes in the ceiling and door frames indicated that more than eight shots, the capacity of Sirhan\u2019s gun, were fired. Prosecutors and some experts have said that Kennedy probably turned his back on the advancing gunman, enabling the wounds to the rear, that the extra bullet holes weren\u2019t really bullet holes and that Sirhan is lying when he claims not to remember the shooting.\n\nSchrade said that he and the other people behind Kennedy were shot by Sirhan but that a second gunman killed Kennedy from behind. He said the lead crime scene investigator lied when he testified that he test fired Sirhan\u2019s gun and the bullets matched those taken from Kennedy and two other victims; subsequent investigation showed that the test bullets did not match the victim bullets. Prosecutors claimed the mismatch came from a clerical error, although the crime scene investigator was later found to have bungled other major cases.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the guilty one,\u201d Schrade said of Sirhan. \u201cThe important thing is to get him out, and then identify the second gunman, who\u2019s never been identified by the LAPD.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department has declined to comment on the case in recent years. As a victim, Schrade is entitled to speak at Sirhan\u2019s hearing, but instead is sending Denise Bohdan, a lawyer and filmmaker whose father, journalist Fernando Faura, pursued the Kennedy assassination story for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many years, Sirhan\u2019s post-conviction attorney was William Pepper, who proclaimed Sirhan\u2019s innocence and lost three parole hearings for him. Now 84, he stepped aside for Berry but is pessimistic about Sirhan\u2019s chances when sized up against his role in history.\n\nThis time \u201ccould be\u201d different, Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely, but it could be,\u201d he said. \"They have enacted this new policy of letting elderly prisoners go and cutting back the costs.\u201d Coronavirus considerations have enabled more releases as well, corrections officials said.\n\n\u201cHe never had a fair trial,\u201d Pepper said. Sirhan\u2019s lead attorney was under indictment by the same prosecutors who were trying Sirhan, ignored the autopsy evidence of the rear gunshot wounds and tried to quickly plead Sirhan guilty. \u201cThe parole board doesn\u2019t like to hear that, they\u2019re not there to adjudicate a prior hearing. They want to know, \u2018Do you admit you did it, are you sorry you did it and will you live an exemplary life?\u2019 I think he can satisfy the basic requirements, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make a bit of difference.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said the California parole board has 90 days to review the panel\u2019s decision. It has 120 days. A state corrections spokesman initially provided incorrect information.\n\nAn earlier version of the story also misstated the country from which Sirhan emigrated to the United States. He emigrated from Jordanian-controlled territory in East Jerusalem, not Israel.

Kennedy, as it passed through North Philadelphia Station, June 8, 1968.\n\nMy father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was murdered in June 1968 by Sirhan Sirhan in full view of many witnesses, including my mother, some of my father\u2019s closest friends and a number of journalists and photographers. There is no question that Sirhan killed my father.\n\nOn Friday, a two-person panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings determined that Sirhan\u2019s request for parole should be approved. I was shocked by this decision. On behalf of my mother and all Americans whose lives were altered by this appalling crime, I condemn this unwarranted recommendation and urge Gov. Gavin Newsom to do the right thing and publicly reject the panel\u2019s decision.\n\nJustice is not served by releasing a confessed political assassin, a first-degree murderer, who is serving a life sentence for his role in a crime against America. To begin with, the process was flawed. No prosecutor appeared at the hearing, for the first time ever. Because of L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s policies, no one from his office was allowed to be present at the parole hearing to give voice to the views of the families affected by this crime. Nor did Gasc\u00f3n have the courage to show up to restate the severity of the crime and the reasons so many Americans feel that Sirhan should remain behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith no one representing the D.A., it was inevitable that the hearing would be incomplete. I appreciate very much the expressions of solidarity and sympathy from the L.A. police and so many Americans who hold my father in their hearts.\n\nAt the last parole hearing, in 2016, the board rejected parole, stating that Sirhan did not show remorse, or perhaps even understand the enormity of his crime. If the former, he is unrepentant, and should not be released. If the latter, he remains a danger to society. In either case, he should not be released.\n\nPolice, immigrants, truck drivers, farmworkers, factory workers, the young and the elderly all came together in June 1968 to stand along the tracks of my father\u2019s funeral train. Even then, our country showed signs of fragmenting along political lines, in the way that has become so familiar in 2021. But I have always believed that my father could have bridged that divide and helped us heal our wounds. Much of that was destroyed by the violent acts of a single deranged anti-Israeli terrorist.\n\nBecause of Sirhan we never got to live out that better history. He killed my father for supporting Israel and the mere thought of Sirhan returning to Palestine, where he may be cheered for his crime, is sickening.

Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. He received the death penalty, but the sentence was later commuted to life.\n\nSirhan, a Christian Palestinian, was born in Jerusalem. In 1948 Jordan took control of East Jerusalem and what is now the West Bank, and the following year it granted citizenship to people living in those areas. It is believed that this is how Sirhan became a Jordanian citizen. In the 1950s, he and his family moved to the United States and eventually settled in Pasadena, California. There he attended Pasadena City College and later held odd jobs, notably working at a horse stable and later at a health food store.\n\nDuring this time, Sirhan became vocal in his opposition to Israel, especially after the Six-Day War (June 1967), in which the country seized control of various territories, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Old City of Jerusalem. Sirhan began directing his anger at Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who expressed support for Israel while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. On June 4, Kennedy won the California primary, and shortly after midnight, he gave a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. As he left through a service pantry, Kennedy was fatally shot; he died on June 6. In addition, five bystanders were wounded. Sirhan was apprehended at the scene\u2014tackled by George Plimpton, Rosey Grier, and others\u2014and he reportedly said, \u201cI did it for my country.\u201d The attack took place on the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.\n\nSirhan later claimed he was unable to remember the shooting, saying that he was intoxicated at the time. However, during his 1969 trial, he admitted to having committed the crime, though he later said that his statements were the result of his defense attorney\u2019s making him think he was guilty. On April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of Kennedy\u2019s murder, and several days later he was given the death sentence. When California abolished capital punishment in 1972, Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life. His efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful.\n\nNumerous conspiracy theories surrounded Kennedy\u2019s assassination. One of the most notable concerned the belief that there was a second gunman. On an audio tape of the shooting, 13 shots are reportedly heard, though Sirhan\u2019s revolver had only 8 rounds. In addition, at Sirhan\u2019s 2016 parole hearing, one of those wounded in the attack testified that a different gunman had shot Kennedy. The parole board, however, was not swayed by the claims, and Sirhan was again denied release. In 2021 he faced the board for the 16th time. The panel\u2014which was operating under recent reforms that required it to consider age, health, and other factors\u2014recommended that he be freed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, denied his parole in 2022."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/crime/sirhan-sirhan", "page_content": "(1944-)\n\nSynopsis\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, on March 19, 1944. Sirhan moved to the United States at the age of 12, graduating from college in California. He later objected to Senator Robert Kennedy's support for Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. On June 5, 1968, Sirhan shot and killed Kennedy during a presidential primaries appearance, and was convicted of the crime the following year. Sirhan initially received the death penalty. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after a change in state law.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born on March 19, 1944 in Jerusalem. He was raised as a Palestinian Christian and was also born with Jordanian citizenship. Sirhan moved to the United States at the age of 12\u2014living first in New York and then in California, where he eventually attended Pasadena City College.\n\nA fervent Christian, Sirhan explored several denominations as an adult. He identified as a Baptist and Seventh Day Adventist before joining the occult Rosicrucians. He also worked at the stables for a race track in Arcadia.\n\nMurder of Robert Kennedy\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Sirhan shot and killed Senator Robert Kennedy, who was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president and had just won the California primary. Kennedy was the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, who'd been assassinated in 1963. Robert Kennedy had served as attorney general in his brother\u2019s cabinet and was the Democratic front-runner at the time of his death. Sirhan shot Kennedy four times, leading to his death 26 hours later. Several other victims sustained gunshot wounds from which they recovered.\n\nAs corroborated by an Inside Edition TV interview decades later, Sirhan greatly resented Kennedy\u2019s support of the Six-Day War intervention in Israel the previous year. The prosecuting attorneys in the subsequent trial had also pieced together these motives based on Sirhan\u2019s personal journals, seized from his home, and from his taped confession.\n\nTrial and Parole Requests\n\nSirhan was captured and disarmed at the scene of the crime. He confessed the murder to police a few days later, but then pleaded not guilty. Sirhan was tried at length, and a judge rejected his request to change his plea to guilty after papers were found in his home with highly implicating language. The defendant behaved strangely throughout the trial, potentially bolstering counsel\u2019s argument of diminished capacity at the time of the murder. The argument was not enough to sway the jury: Sirhan was convicted of premeditated murder on April 17, 1969, and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment three years later due to the California Supreme Court ruling in People v. Anderson, outlawing the death penalty in the state.\n\nOngoing requests for parole have been denied. (As of 2011, there have been 14 parole requests.) Sirhan\u2019s counsel has argued that their client has no memory of the murder due to brainwashing by the Rosicrucians or a political organization. There has also been talk of a second gunman, with a witness at the scene, Nina Rhodes-Hughes, stating there was an additional shooter. Having made previous statements that he acted alone and was under the influence of alcohol, Sirhan has also expressed remorse over his actions and claimed to have no memory of confessing to the murder of Robert Kennedy, either in police custody or during his trial.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Sirhan Bishara Sirhan\n\nBirth Year: 1944\n\nBirth date: March 19, 1944\n\nBirth City: Jerusalem\n\nBirth Country: Mandatory Palestine\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Sirhan Sirhan murdered Robert F.

Kennedy died after being shot in the dimly lit kitchen of a Los Angeles hotel.\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\nKennedy\u2019s killer confronted him in the heady moments after the senator had scored a victory in the all-important California Democratic primary during the race for president of the United States in 1968.\n\nIt was there that Kennedy\u2019s dream of being the next president would end with a bullet to the head.\n\nHis assassin, Sirhan B. Sirhan, was 24. He was a young man who struggled not only with the violence he saw firsthand as a child in the Middle East but also with finding his place as an adult in one of the most seminal decades in U.S. history.\n\nThe course of history would change just after midnight on June 5, 1968, as the two came face-to-face in the Ambassador Hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry.\n\nWho is Sirhan and why did he shoot Kennedy? Here\u2019s what you may not know about him.\n\nSirhan\u2019s early years\n\nSirhan Bishara Sirhan was born into a Christian family in the Palestinian section of Jerusalem in 1944. By the time he turned 3, witnessing violent clashes stemming from the war for Israeli independence was a daily occurrence.\n\nHis mother, Mary, said that as a youngster Sirhan had seen a man ripped to pieces by a bomb during an attack in his neighborhood. The image haunted her son, she said, and he would never be the same.\n\nWhen he was 12, his family emigrated to the United States on a special visa granted to Palestinian refugees. The family stayed briefly in New York and then moved on to California where Sirhan attended junior high, high school and community college.\n\nHis faith was important to him, according to his mother. He even complained to her once that children of his age did not take religion seriously enough.\n\nHe joined the Baptist church and was briefly a Seventh-day Adventist. In 1966, two years before he would kill Kennedy, he turned to an occult organization called the Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosae Crucis, or the Rosicrucians. The organization studies mystical and philosophical doctrines and how they apply to modern life.\n\nSirhan never settled into a career but held a series of menial jobs. At one point, he was working at the Santa Anita racetrack, and at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 115 pounds, he had hopes of one day becoming a jockey. That plan had not panned out, and by the end of May 1968, Sirhan was adrift with no job prospects.\n\nPhotographer David Hume Kennerly on memories of RFK on 55th anniversary of his assassinationhttps://t.co/jpOrlSSQXY \u2014 Mike Mathews @memathews@twit.social (@memathews) June 6, 2023\n\nKilling Kennedy\n\nLate on June 4, 1968, election returns in the California and South Dakota Democratic primaries for president were counted and Kennedy was declared the winner. As the people who had been crammed into the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles cheered, Kennedy\u2019s victory speech recalled the themes that had propelled him to victory that night \u2013 resetting the moral compass of the country, the fight against poverty and hunger in the United States, peace in Vietnam.\n\nFrom the stage, he acknowledged supporters by name and thanked volunteers \u2013 many of them in their late teens and 20s \u2013 who had worked hard for him in California, a state vital to his run for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cMy thanks to all of you. Now it\u2019s on to Chicago and let\u2019s win there,\u201d Kennedy said to the crowd.\n\nWhile Kennedy was ending his speech in the ballroom, Sirhan was in the hotel\u2019s kitchen pantry area with a .22-caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet handgun in his pocket. Two hotel employees would later say they saw Sirhan near the service elevator close to the door that leads into the Embassy Ballroom as Kennedy came down earlier to give his victory speech.\n\nAccording to Jesus Perez and Martin Petrusky, Sirhan asked if Kennedy would be returning through the kitchen area, the same way as he had gone to the stage. Petrusky and Perez told him they did not know. Both men remembered that Sirhan lingered around the elevator area as Kennedy spoke from the stage.\n\nIt was not the first time Sirhan had been in the hotel, according to testimony at his trial. The prosecution was able to place him there on June 3, two days before Kennedy was shot. According to testimony, he was noticed by someone who worked at the Ambassador because he seemed to be out of place.\n\nTwo days before he was spotted at the hotel, Sirhan visited the Lock, Stock \u2018N Barrel gun shop, according to testimony. He purchased two boxes of .22-caliber hollow-point bullets. Early on June 4, hours before he would confront Kennedy in the hotel kitchen, he visited the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club to practice at its gun range.\n\nSirhan was waiting with the gun in the service area as Kennedy finished speaking. Kennedy was led off the stage, through a door and down a hallway toward the Colonial Room of the hotel where the press was waiting to talk to him.\n\nAccording to witnesses, Kennedy was moving slowly through the pantry, shaking hands with some of the people who worked there. Kennedy reached out to shake the hand of a busboy, Juan Romero, when Sirhan, smiling, moved toward Kennedy, planted his right foot, raised his arm and shouted \u201cKennedy, you son of a bitch,\u201d and began shooting.\n\nKennedy was hit three times \u2014 one bullet went into his armpit, a second hit him in the back and the third went into the back of his head behind his right ear. A fourth bullet tore a hole in his jacket. He fell to the floor bleeding as those in his entourage, including former NFL star Rosey Grier, writer George Plimpton, Olympic track star Rafer Johnson, journalist Pete Hamill and others, wrestled Sirhan down, pried the gun from his hand, grabbed him up and slammed him down on some metal steaming tables.\n\n\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Sirhan screamed. \u201cI can explain. I did it for my country. I love my country.\u201d\n\nBefore the gun was wrested from his hand, five others in the pantry \u2014 Paul Schrade, William Weisel, Ira Goldstein, Elizabeth Evans and Irwin Stroll \u2014 were shot. All five would recover from their wounds.\n\nRomero, an Ambassador busboy, knelt to help Kennedy, who was on the floor, bleeding from his head and back. According to Romero, he bent down to hear Kennedy reportedly ask, \u201cIs everybody OK?\u201d Romero told The Los Angeles Times, \u201cI told him \u2018Yes, everybody\u2019s OK\u2019. And then he turned away from me and said, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThose were the last words he spoke. Kennedy died about 26 hours later, having never regained consciousness.\n\n\u201cSomeone said he\u2019s been shot!\u201d 55 yrs ago today. Chaos at the Ambassador Hotel as Sen. Robert F.

In the spiral notebook showed evidence of a growing rage against all Zionists, with Kennedy\u2019s name mentioned throughout.\n\nOne entry even named the date by which Sirhan said Kennedy should die. The date was June 5, the day Kennedy was shot. June 5, 1968, was the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and Syria.\n\nSirhan was angry with Kennedy for his support of Israel and his support for the U.S. selling jet fighters to Israel. He said he had made the decision to kill Kennedy after he heard him say in a speech in the spring of 1968 that he would support giving the planes to Israel.\n\nThe entry on May 18, 1968, read, \u201cMy determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th.\u201d Other entries more hauntingly read, \u201cdie, die, die, die, die.\u201d\n\nCaught, confessed, convicted\n\nSirhan refused to speak or to identify himself after he was taken into custody in the hotel\u2019s pantry that night. It wasn\u2019t until June 9, four days after the shooting, that he confessed to police that he was the one who shot Kennedy. Despite the confession, Sirhan pleaded not guilty in court.\n\nThe trial was set for January 1969.\n\nOpening statements began in February, and, after a three-month trial in which his defense team argued he was mentally ill, Sirhan was found guilty of Kennedy\u2019s murder. He was sentenced to death in California\u2019s gas chamber.\n\nSirhan testified in his own defense, saying he had no memory of killing Kennedy, and that he had been drunk the night of the shooting. He testified that he had borne no \u201cill-will towards Kennedy.\u201d\n\nAfter three years in prison, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned California\u2019s death penalty law, and Sirhan\u2019s sentence was commuted to life in prison. He has remained an inmate of the state of California since.\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy with children and John Glenn at Disneyland two days before 1968 California Presidential primary, fifty-five years ago today: pic.twitter.com/rHEHE93poS \u2014 Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) June 3, 2023\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThrough the years, Sirhan changed aspects of his story in some ways but has always repeated the claim that he does not remember what took place in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel.\n\nConspiracy theories were born even as Sirhan was being restrained in the moments after the shooting According to Hamill, someone yelled as Sirhan was being slammed onto the table, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him. Don\u2019t kill him. No Jack Ruby!\u201d\n\nMany thought Sirhan a patsy, the same thing Lee Harvey Oswald called himself following JFK\u2019s assassination. They said larger forces used him as a cover so someone else could kill another Kennedy.\n\nIn 2011, Sirhan\u2019s lawyers claimed in court papers that he had been speaking to and had been hypnotized by a psychiatrist. According to the filings, Sirhan revealed that while he shot Kennedy, he had not killed him and that he had seen a flash from the gun of the person who did kill him. The flash came from behind Kennedy, Sirhan said under hypnosis.\n\nOne of his attorneys said Sirhan also revealed under hypnosis that a \u201cgirl in the polka-dot dress\u201d tapped or pinched him on the arm and that when that happened he was conditioned to believe that he was on a weapons firing range and he was to begin firing.\n\nUnder hypnosis, he remembered meeting the girl that night and that she led him to the pantry, according to an Associated Press report.\n\n\u201cI am trying to figure out how to hit on her.... That\u2019s all that I can think about,\u201d he said in one interview cited in the documents. \u201cI was fascinated with her looks .... She never said much. It was very erotic. I was consumed by her. She was a seductress with an unspoken unavailability.\u201d\n\nWhen he was not under hypnosis, he remembered nothing about the shooting, according to his attorneys.\n\nSirhan\u2019s defense team in 1969 claimed Kennedy\u2019s autopsy proved that he could not have killed the senator because the fatal shot entered his head from behind his right ear. Sirhan was standing in front of Kennedy.\n\nIn a parole hearing in 2016, Paul Schrade, one of the five other people injured in the shooting, apologized to Sirhan for not helping him before by testifying at his parole hearings. It was the first time Schrade had seen Sirhan since 1969. Schrade said the evidence clearly showed a second gunman had been in the kitchen pantry.\n\n\u201cI should have been here long ago and that\u2019s why I feel guilty for not being here to help you and to help me,\u201d Schrade said in the hearing.\n\nSchrade since called for the investigation into Kennedy\u2019s shooting be reopened.\n\nOther conspiracy theories claim:\n\nThe CIA was involved in Kennedy\u2019s death. According to a story in the Guardian, a CIA agent named David Morales once bragged to friends while talking about the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, \u201cI was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.\u201d\n\nStill, others have wondered how Sirhan shot Kennedy in the back if he was standing in front of him as he fired the gun. The Los Angeles Times reported in 2005 that Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi found: \u201cEyewitnesses put Sirhan no closer than 18 inches from Kennedy, but Noguchi testified that when the fatal wound was inflicted the gun was 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches from Kennedy\u2019s ear. His testimony fed conspiracy theories that Sirhan had not acted alone.\u201d \u201cBased solely on the examination of the remains and the scene afterwards, I came to the conclusion that Senator Bobby Kennedy was shot by a small caliber gun from the right side of the back of the head,\u201d Noguchi said.\n\nA radio reporter recorded the sound of 13 shots being fired in the pantry. Sirhan\u2019s gun held only eight bullets.\n\nAn actress and Kennedy campaign volunteer, Nina Rhodes-Hughes, was in the pantry when the shooting started and she reported to the FBI that she heard anywhere from 12-14 shots that night. \u201cThere were at least 12, maybe 14. And I know there were because I heard the rhythm in my head,\u201d Rhodes-Hughes told CNN in 2012. She says she believes senior FBI officials altered statements she made to the agents to \u201cconform with what they wanted the public to believe, period.\u201d\n\nAccording to some witnesses, a security guard standing behind Kennedy at the time was seen drawing his weapon. That man, Thane Cesar, later passed a polygraph test that included questions about whether he shot Kennedy.\n\nThrough the years other theories have been advanced and even members of Kennedy\u2019s family have wondered if the right man is in prison for the assassination. Robert Kennedy\u2019s son, Robert Kennedy Jr., told The Washington Post that he believes that there were two shooters in the kitchen pantry that night. \u201cThere were too many bullets,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire 13 shots out of an eight-shot gun.\u201d\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. is running for president in 2024."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/us/convicted-rfk-assassin-sirhan-sirhan-granted-parole-2021-08-27/", "page_content": "[1/2] Sirhan Sirhan is shown in this handout photo taken February 9, 2016, and provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

In murder cases, the governor can reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision without referring the case back to the board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Sirhan\u2019s attorney Angela Berry expressed concern that the board had been swayed by Newsom, who overruled the previous recommendation in 2022 and has argued that Sirhan has not been rehabilitated.\n\nShe also argued against the idea that her client lacked \u201csufficient insight\u201d into his actions, citing psychiatric evaluations dating back to 1975 and the 2021 parole hearing.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times last year, Newsom said Sirhan had \u201cnot developed the accountability and insight required to support his safe release into his community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence that Sirhan assassinated Kennedy is overwhelming and irrefutable,\u201d Newsom wrote, pointing to what he said was the inmate\u2019s \u201cshifting narrative\u201d about the events of June 5, 1968.\n\n\u201cAs recently as last year, Sirhan portrayed himself as the victim, claiming he \u2018was in the wrong spot at the wrong time,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2026 Over the years, Sirhan and his advocates have churned false claims about Kennedy\u2019s assassination. Each claim of Sirhan\u2019s innocence has been investigated and disproved. These falsehoods fuel Sirhan\u2019s denial of accountability.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.\n\nSirhan, a Palestinian Christian who emigrated with his family from Jordan to the United States, fatally shot Kennedy as he was leaving the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, shortly after the senator won California\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Five others were also injured in the shooting, and Kennedy died the next day.\n\nSirhan was convicted of first-degree murder and assault with intent to murder and was initially sentenced to death, but that sentence was later reduced to life with the possibility of parole.\n\nSince 1975, Sirhan has been eligible for release more than a dozen times.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}]}
