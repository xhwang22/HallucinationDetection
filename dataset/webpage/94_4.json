He was, for example, a key figure in the founding of the Norwegian National Gallery and of several other major art institutions in Norway, as well as in the preservation of Norwegian stave churches and the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and Bergenhus Fortress in Bergen.\n\nDahl came from a simple background \u2013 his father was a modest fisherman in Bergen, Norway \u2013 and he would later look back at his youth with bitterness. He regretted that he never had a \"real teacher\" in his childhood and, despite all his spectacular success, he believed that if he had been more fortunate in his birth, he would have achieved even more than he had.\n\nAs a boy, Dahl was educated by a sympathetic mentor at the Bergen Cathedral who at first thought that this bright student would make a good priest, but then, recognizing his remarkably precocious artistic ability, arranged for him to be trained as an artist. From 1803 to 1809 Dahl studied with the painter Johan Georg M\u00fcller [no], whose workshop was the most important one in Bergen at the time. Still, Dahl looked back on his teacher as having kept him in ignorance in order to exploit him, putting him to work painting theatrical sets, portraits, and views of Bergen and its surroundings. Another mentor, Lyder Sagen, showed the aspiring artist books about art and awakened his interest in historical and patriotic subjects. It was also Sagen who took up a collection that made it possible for Dahl to go to Copenhagen in 1811 to complete his education at the academy there.\n\nAs important as Dahl's studies at the academy in Copenhagen were his experiences in the surrounding countryside and in the city's art collections. In 1812 he wrote to Sagen that the landscape artists he most wished to emulate were Ruisdahl and Everdingen, and for that reason he was studying \u201cnature above all,\u201d Dahl's artistic program was, then, already in place: he would become a part of the great landscape tradition, but he would also be as faithful as possible to nature itself.\n\nDahl held that a landscape painting should not just depict a specific view, but should also say something about the land's nature and character \u2013 the greatness of its past and the life and work of its current inhabitants. The mood was often idyllic, often melancholy. When he added snow to a landscape he painted in the summer, it was not to show the light and colors of snow; it was to use snow as a symbol of death. As one critic has put it, \u201cUnlike the radically Romantic works also appearing at the time, Dahl softens his landscape, introducing elements of genre painting by imbuing it with anecdotal materials: In the background a wisp of smoke rises from a cabin, perhaps the home of the hunter on the snow-covered field.\u201d Thanks to Sagen's recommendations and to his own personal charm, Dahl soon gained access to the leading social circles in Copenhagen.\n\nDahl took part in annual art exhibitions in Copenhagen beginning in 1812, but his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited no fewer than 13 paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark, who developed an early interest in Dahl's artistic genius and saw to it that his works were purchased for the royal collection, became a lifelong friend and patron of the artist.\n\nIn 1816 C. W. Eckersberg returned from abroad with his paintings of Roman settings; Dahl was impressed at once, and they became good friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting Den Store Kro i Fredensborg marked the real beginning of his lifelong production of oil paintings depicting natural subjects.\n\nAfter his success in Copenhagen, Dahl realized that he wanted to live as an independent, self-supporting artist. One challenge facing him was that the academic preference of the day was for historical paintings with moral messages. Landscapes were considered the lowest kind of art, and perhaps even not as art at all, but as a purely mechanical imitation of nature. The only landscapes that could be considered art, according to the academy, were ideal, imaginary landscapes in pastoral or heroic styles. In accordance with this reigning taste, Dahl attempted to give his Danish themes a certain atmospheric character in order to lift them up above what was considered a merely commercial level. But at the same time it was his deepest wish to provide a more faithful picture of Norwegian nature than were offered by the old-fashioned, dry paintings of Haas and Lorentzen. This desire was partly motivated by homesickness and patriotism, but it was also suited to the public taste of the day for \u201cpicturesque\u201d works.\n\nDahl traveled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his close friend. One critic has written: \u201cFriedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816\u201317) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both profoundly despised. One writer has put it this way: \u201cA warm and sociable character, he soon met and became friendly with the more introverted and reclusive Friedrich, recording how they once walked together in the park of the Gr\u00f6sser Garten among 'many lovely trees of different kinds, and the moon looked beautiful behind the dark fir trees.'\u201d\n\nTogether with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Dahl would become one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting.\n\nIn Dresden, as in Copenhagen, Dahl traveled around the area to draw subjects that could be of use to him in larger works that would be painted later in his atelier. He wrote to Prince Christian Frederik in 1818 that \u201cmost of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\u201d Dahl found enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his paintings, but he continued to paint imaginary landscapes with forests, mountains, and waterfalls. One such painting, completed in 1819, entitled Norsk fjellandskap med elv (Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\u201d), garnered great attention among younger artists who considered the striking natural quality of the painting a breath of fresh air on Dresden's stagnant art scene. Another monumental waterfall painting, completed the next year, was lavished with praised by the critic for Kunstblatt who said that Dahl was greater than Jacob van Ruisdael. Dahl was accepted into the Dresden academy in 1820.\n\nPrince Christian Frederik wrote to Dahl in 1820 from Italy and invited him to join him at the Gulf of Naples. Dahl was at the time courting a young woman named Emilie von Bloch, but felt he should take the prince up on his offer, so he married Emilie quickly and traveled to Italy the next day. He ended up spending 10 months in Italy. Though he missed his bride, the sojourn was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light, that Dahl's art truly flowered. It forced him to see nature plain, without the mediation of the old masters' renderings of light and color.\n\nDahl went to Rome in February 1821. He spent a great deal of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and painting pictures to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt, who ran a major article on Dahl in 1822.\n\nAs a member of the academy, Dahl always dedicated his time to young artists who sought him out. In 1824 he and Friedrich were named \u201cextraordinary professors\u201d who had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade, Peder Balke, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. \u201cWell before their meeting,\u201d writes one critic, \u201cDahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in the Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began\u2014the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823\u2014he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a more stormy subject from Dahl.\u201d\n\nDahl never formed a \u201cschool\u201d around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy \u2013 he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like John Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \u201cIn...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\u201d The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \u201cDahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his View of Dresden by Moonlight (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\u201d\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \u201creal thing\u201d was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \u201cmore Nordic painter\u201d with a \u201clove for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\u201d He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \u201can enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\u201d\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \u201cIn his late Fjord at Sunset (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\u201d\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830, Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Siegwald and Caroline, who married the Norwegian minister Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted Bull 1848.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture, and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang, and Henrik Heftye, he founded the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening).\n\nDahl died after a brief illness and was buried on 17 October 1857 in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia T\u00f8nnesen (1859\u20131948) was erected on the facade of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art in Bergen. In 1934, his remains were brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C.

The two men contemplating the sinking moon have been identified as Friedrich himself, on the right, and his talented young colleague August Heinrich (1794-1822). The mood of pious contemplation relates to fascination with the moon as expressed in contemporary poetry, literature, philosophy, and music. Both figures are seen from the back so that the viewer can participate in their communion with nature, which the Romantics saw as a manifestation of the Sublime.\n\nAlthough the landscape is imaginary, it is based on studies after nature that Friedrich had made in various regions at different times. Both men wear Old German dress, which had been adopted in 1815 by radical students as an expression of opposition to the ultraconservative policies then being enforced in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. The staunchly patriotic Friedrich deliberately ignored the 1819 royal decree forbidding this practice and depicted figures in traditional costume until his death.\n\nFriedrich was fourteen years Dahl's elder and an established artist, but the two found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature that was based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic clich\u00e9s that they both profoundly despised.

In addition to painting sights in Rome and pictures of the Gulf of Naples, he painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned north to Emilie and a quiet life of family and painting.\n\nGrotto near Naples: 1821\n\nEruption of Vesuvius: 1823\n\nGulf of Naples Seen from a Cave: 1821\n\nStudy of Clouds at Full Moon: 1822\n\nCoast near Castellammare in the Morning Mist: 1822\n\nMausoleum of San Vito near Pozzuoli: 1820\n\nScene of the Villa Malta: 1821\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1824\n\nThe Eruption of Vesuvius: 1826\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1820\n\nVesuvius Seen from Castellsmmare: 1821\n\nView from a Window at Quisisana: 1820\n\nView of Naples' Bay: 1823\n\nVolcano at Evening, Siciliy: Date Unknown\n\nDahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of poets, artists, and scientists, among them the archeologist C.

In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Bay of Naples in 1821 when Mount Vesuvius was active.

Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed.

In 1824 he and Friedrich were namedwho had no chair but who received a regular salary. In 1823 Dahl moved in with Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Knud Baade Peder Balke , and Thomas Fearnley , were equally influenced by both artists. \"Well before their meeting,\" writes one critic, \"Dahl had also painted a number of 'moonlights' and, travelling in Europe, he was in thewhen Mount Vesuvius was active. Here he painted 'Boats on the Beach Near Naples', where fishing crafts lie at anchor in the calm, shimmering waters with the twin peaks of the mountain smoking and flaming behind. Predictably, after his close association with Friedrich began - the two families shared a house in Dresden from 1823 - he was considerably influenced by him, but his own more spontaneous and painterly style soon prevailed. Clients sometimes commissioned pictures from them both, a tranquil coastal scene by Friedrich to pair with a stormier subject from Dahl.\"\n\nDahl never formed a \"school\" around himself, but rather preferred for his students to cultivate their own styles; it was against his principles and his respect for artistic freedom to try to inhibit his students' individuality. It was this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to turn down an offer of a permanent chair at the academy - he didn't want to feel compelled to show up for class when he was busy working on a painting.\n\nDahl continued his studies of nature in the area around Dresden when he had the time, or on longer trips which provided him with themes for his paintings. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. Like Constable, Dahl felt that the sky was an important part of a landscape painting, and he never grew tired of watching the clouds move over the flat plain. One critic has compared two paintings of Friedrich and Dahl: \"In...Dahl's 'Mother and Child by the Sea', there are echoes of Friedrich's 'Woman by the Sea' (1818). Whereas in Friedrich's work a woman dressed for the windy weather sits idly watching five fishing boats sailing past, in Dahl's picture, there seems to be a more personal note, with echoes of his own upbringing in a seafaring community, as the mother and small child eagerly await the return of the little ship from the sea.\" The same critic has written about one of his paintings of Dresden: \"Dahl also commemorated the magnificent Baroque buildings of his adopted city, and a version of his 'View of Dresden by Moonlight' (1838) has travelled from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo. This small picture, measuring only 18.5 x 34.5 cm, shows the dome of the Frauenkirche and the tower of the Hofkirche dominating the skyline; silvers and deep blue combine to give it a wonderful jewel-like effect, together with a certain elegiac quality, perhaps indicative of the artist's awareness that his long friendship with Friedrich was nearing an end.\"\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1830\n\nMother and Child by the Sea: 1840\n\nView of Dresden by Moonlight: 1838\n\nAs Dahl wrote in 1828 to the director of the Dresden academy, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \"real thing\" was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He viewed himself as a \"more Nordic painter\" with a \"love for seacoasts, mountains, waterfalls, sailboats, and pictures of the sea in daylight and moonlight.\" He longed to return to Norway, but not until 1826 was he able to make a journey home.\n\nHe made subsequent trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850, mostly exploring and painting the mountains, leading to the monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). During his visits to Norway he received \"an enthusiastic welcome as a painter of renown.\"\n\nView of Fortundalen: 1836\n\nStalheim: 1842\n\nA critic notes Dahl's late stylistic changes: \"In his late 'Fjord at Sunset' (1850), based on studies made earlier, free and adventurous brush strokes represent the cloud-swept sky and broken surface of the water. Here he has moved far away from the purity and intensity of Friedrich's oeuvre.\"\n\nIn 1827 Emilie Dahl died in childbirth while having their fourth child, and two years later two of the older children died of scarlet fever. In January 1830 Dahl married his student Amalie von Bassewitz, but she, too, died in childbirth in December of that same year. Dahl was crushed, and many months passed before he was able to paint again. Some years later this youngest child also died, leaving Dahl with two surviving children, Caroline and Siegwald.\n\nDahl's trip to Norway in 1850 would be his last. He was aging and weak, but continued to paint landscapes in the mountains. This last journey to his homeland resulted in several magnificent works, including M\u00e5bodalen, Fra Stugunoset, and Hjelle i Valdres.\n\nDahl was also among the founding fathers of the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet ), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. Together with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye, he also founded the Art Society in Oslo ( Oslo Kunstforening ).\n\nDahl died lonely and bitter after a brief illness and was buried on October 17, 1857, in Dresden. In 1902, a statue of Dahl by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia Tonnesen (1859-1948), was erected on the facade of the Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum in Bergen. In 1934, his remains brought back to Norway and buried in the cemetery of St. Jacob's Church (Sankt Jakob Kirke) in Bergen.\n\nJ.C. Dahl occupies a central position in Norwegian artistic life of the first half of the 19th century. His Romantic yet naturalistic interpretations of Norwegian scenery were greatly admired in Norway as well as on the European continent, particularly in Denmark and Germany. His place in the pantheon of European artists is secure and his influence on the course of art history is indelible.\n\nQuoted From: Johan Christian Dahl - Wikipedia Various Works of Johan (John) Christian Dahl Alpine Landscape: 1821 Avaldsnes Church: 1813 Avaldsnes Church: 1820 Birch in a Storm: 1849 Birch in a Storm: 1849 (Alternate View) Birch in Autumn Landscape: Date Unknown Birch Tree in Winter: 1838 Chalk Pit near Maxen: 1835 Cloud Study, Thunder Clouds over the Palace Tower at Dresden: 1825 Cloud Study: 1832 Cloud Study with Horizon: 1832 Coastal Landscape with Burial Mounds and Standing Stones: 1837 Copenhagen Harbor in Moonlight: 1831 Copenhagen Harbor by Moonlight: 1846 Copenhagen Harbor by Twilight: 1846 Dresden at Night: 1845 Dresden at Night: 1845 (Alternate View) Dreyhaven near Copenhagen: 1845 (Alternate View Elbe Seen From Bruhls Terrace: 1824 Entrance to the Port of Copenhagen with the\n\nMasting Sheer seen to the right: 1830 Forest Fire Glows: 1846 Fredericksborg Castle: 1817 Frederiksborg Castle: 1814 Frederiksholms Canal in Copenhagen with Christian IV's Brewery: 1817 Holmestrand: 1843 Julie Vogel in the Garden: 1825-28 Labrofossen: 1829 Lake Esrom by Moonlight: 1814 Landscape at Kaupanger with stave church: 1847 Landscape in Evening Light Landscape with Memorial Stones: 1839 Larvik, Vestfold County, Norway: 1848 Lyshornet near Bergen: 1836 Maridalen: 1852 Megalith Grave near Vordingborg in Winter: 1824-25 M\u00f8ensklint: 1828 Mill in Liebethaler Grund: 1823 Morning after a Stormy Night: 1819 Mountain Landscape with a Castle: 1816 Northern Landscape: 1822 Norwegian Landscape, Rogna Waterfall: 1812 Norwegian Landscape: 1823 Norwegian Landscape: 1829 Norwegian Landscape with a Bridge: 1815 Norwegian Mountain Landscape with Waterfall: 1821 Pedersborg: 1832 Plauenscher Grund: 1819 Prospect of Dresden Seen from Pieschen, March Haze: 1844 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1832 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1829 Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway: 1831 Stormy Day in Dresden: 1830 Stugun\u00f8set, Filefjeld: 1851 The Elbe and Dresden Neustadt in the Evening Light: 1837 The Elbe Valley near Dresden: Date Unknown The Frankenkirche, Dresden: 1840 The Grosser Garten, Dresden: 1822 The Lower Falls of the Labrofoss: 1827 Thunderstorm Near Dresden: 1830 Trolltindene: 1823 Two Belfries at Sunset, Copenhagen: 1825 View from Bastei: 1819 View from Vaekero near Christiania: 1827 View of Naerodalen: 1847 View of \u00d8ylo Farm, Valdres: 1846 View over Hallingdal: 1844 View of Swinoujscie: 1840 View of the Feigumfoss in Lysterfjord: 1848 View over the Elbe and the 'Der B\u00e4r' Bastion: Date Unknown Watzmann: 1825 Waves and Breakers in the Bay of Naples: 1821 Winter Landscape near Vordingborg: 1829 Related Source Material : Johan Christian Dahl Online Johan Christian Dahl -

However, his real breakthrough came in 1815, when he exhibited 13 of his paintings. Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark developed an early interest in Johan Dahl's artistic skills and purchased his numerous artworks for the royal collection. The two became lifelong friends and the Prince became the artist's patron. In 1816 Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, a Danish painter, returned from abroad to Denmark with his paintings of Roman settings. Johan Dahl was impressed straightaway, and they became close friends and exchanged pictures. Dahl's 1817 painting \u201cDen Store Kro i Fredensborg\u201d is considered to mark the real beginning of his lifelong creation of oil paintings depicting natural subjects. Dahl travelled to Dresden in September 1818. He arrived with introductions to the city's leading citizens and to major artists, including Caspar David Friedrich, who helped him establish himself there and became his good friend. One critic later wrote: \"Friedrich's still, meticulously executed landscapes - products of an art informed by his strict Protestant upbringing and a seeking for the divine in nature - were justifiably famous by the time he and Dahl became acquainted. We are able to see his Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), which ranks among his greatest works, and features two \"R\u00fcckfiguren,\" or figures seen from behind, solemnly and companionably gazing at a young sickle moon from the edge of an old forest. 'Greifswald in Moonlight' (1816-1817) depicts the artist's birthplace in Pomerania, on the Baltic coast: bathed in an even, gauzy moonlight, the ancient university town assumes an almost ethereal appearance.\" Caspar David Friedrich was fourteen years elder then Dahl and an acknowledged painter. Nevertheless, both artists found in each other a shared love for nature and a shared enthusiasm for a way of depicting nature, based on the study of nature itself rather than on the academic cliches that they both deeply detested. As a result, together with Friedrich and Carl Gustav Carus, Johan Dahl became one of the Dresden painters of the period who exerted a decisive influence on German Romantic painting. In Dresden Dahl travelled around the area to draw subjects that could be used later in his larger artworks. In 1818 he wrote to Prince Christian Frederik that \"most of all I am representing nature in all its freedom and wildness.\" Dahl collected enough material in the Dresden area to supply motifs for his works, but he continued his work on imaginary landscapes with mountains, forests, and waterfalls. One such painting, entitled \"Norsk fjellandskap med elv\" (\"Mountainous Norwegian landscape with river\"), was completed in 1819. Another monumental waterfall artwork was painted the next year. Prince Christian Frederik invited Dahl to come to Italy and join him at the Gulf of Naples in 1820. Johan Dahl spent 10 months in Italy. The trip was a decisive factor in his artistic development. It was in Italy, with its strong southern light that the artist's art truly blossomed. In February 1821 Johan Dahl went to Rome. He spent a lot of time visiting museums, meeting other artists, and creating paintings to sell. In addition to painting sights in Rome and views of the Gulf of Naples, Dahl painted landscapes inspired by the mountains of Norway. Dahl said that not until he was in Rome did he started to truly appreciate Norwegian nature. In June 1821 Dahl returned home. Johan Dahl quickly became a member of Dresden's leading circles of artists, poets, and scientists, among them the archaeologist C. A. B\u00f6ttiger, who was the publisher of Artistisches Notizenblatt. B\u00f6ttiger ran a major article on Dahl in 1822. Dahl always dedicated his time to young painters who sought him out. In 1824 Dahl and Friedrich were named \"extraordinary professors\" of the Academy of Fine Arts Dresden, although they had no chair there but received a regular salary. In 1823 Johan Dahl moved in with Caspar David Friedrich, so that many of his students, such as Peder Balke, Knud Baade, and Thomas Fearnley, were equally influenced by both artists. Dahl never created his own \"school\", but rather preferred his students to develop their own styles. He respected artistic freedom, trying not to inhibit his students' individuality. It was due to this impulse toward individuality that later caused him to reject a permanent chair at the academy. In his free time, Johan Dahl studied nature in the area around Dresden, or went on longer trips which provided him with topics for his artworks. But most often he painted the view of the Elbe outside his windows in various kinds of light. As the artist wrote in 1828 to the director of the Academy of Fine Arts, he found the area around Dresden useful for nature studies, but the \"real thing\" was always missing; that was something he could only find in his mountainous homeland. He considered himself a \"more Nordic painter\" and aspired to return to Norway. However, he was able to make a journey home only in 1826. Subsequently, Dahl made trips to Norway in 1834, 1839, 1844, and 1850. During these trips, he mainly explored and painted the mountains, creating his monumental works Fortundalen (1836) and Stalheim (1842). After the deaths of his two wives, Dahl was devastated. It took many months before he was able to paint again. Johan Dahl's trip to Norway in 1850 became his last one. Even in his later years, the artist continued to paint landscapes in the mountains, producing several magnificent works, such as M\u00e5b\u00f8dalen, Fra Stugun\u00f8set, and Hjelle i Valdres. Lohan Dahl co-founded the National Gallery of Norway (Norwegian: Nasjonalgalleriet), now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, and donated his own art collection to the institution. In cooperation with Frederik Stang, Johan Sebastian Welhaven, and Henrik Heftye, he also became a founder of the Art Society in Oslo (Oslo Kunstforening)."}]}
