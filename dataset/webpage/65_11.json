The University of Washington recruit and national team player led Issaquah to state titles her freshman and junior seasons. Dan DeLong/Seattle Post-Intelligencer Issaquah's Kate Deines, a University of Washington soccer recruit, perfects her headers by practicing with tennis balls. Scott Eklund/Seattle Post-Intelligencer\n\nISSAQUAH -- Three hours before every game, Kate Deines' mother tosses about 100 tennis balls into the air. Her daughter, an all-state midfielder for the Issaquah High School, locks onto each ball and thwacks it across the driveway with her head.\n\n\"If you can hit a tennis ball, when it comes time to heading a soccer ball it seems so much easier just because of the size,\" said Deines, a University of Washington recruit and the senior leader of Issaquah's undefeated soccer team, ranked seventh in the nation by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.\n\nDeines (pronounced DINE-us) wasn't always a skilled airborne attacker, but the two-time state champion spent countless hours perfecting one of the sport's most difficult skills.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNow the Eagles' co-captain is so fearless in the air that when she goes up for a ball \"all you can do is impede her and pray,\" Bellevue coach Jon Anderson said.\n\n\"There's no one in the air better. She gets a foot taller than everybody else.\"\n\nSmacking soccer balls isn't the only way Deines uses her head. In addition to leading KingCo 3A in scoring each of the past two seasons, she has a 3.9 grade-point average and considered top academic schools such as Stanford and Harvard before deciding on Washington.\n\n\"She's a brilliant kid, and I think that translates onto the soccer field,\" Issaquah coach Tom Bunnell said. \"When we're talking strategy or whatever, she knows. She understands.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines has been a star at Issaquah since she set foot on campus four years ago. The Eagles won the state championship her freshman year in 2004, and finished first again last season when Deines was named Gatorade State Player of the Year.\n\nSandwiched between the two crowns was a runner-up finish in 2005. Deines missed the state championship game that year because of a conflict with her under-16 U.S. national team, which began practicing in Boca Raton, Fla., the same day as the state final. Without Deines, the Eagles lost 2-0 to Camas.\n\n\"We don't like to talk about that,\" Deines said.\n\nThis season, Deines has the Eagles soaring with their sights set on a third state title in four years. Issaquah is 6-0-1 and riding a 28-game unbeaten steak after Thursday's 4-1 victory over Mount Si in which Deines scored three times for her second hat trick of the season.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDeines is again leading the conference in scoring, netting 10 goals with one assist. The defense has given up one goal all season.\n\nBecause of a change in scheduling, Deines' national team responsibilities have ended for the year. That means for the first time in her high school career, she won't have to worry about missing any portion of Issaquah's state tournament run.\n\n\"It's really fortunate I get to go and represent my country, but at the same time this team is close to my heart,\" Deines said of the Eagles. \"It's hard leaving when you work and you work and you work to get to that point, yet you have to miss it.\"\n\nThat kind of commitment is precisely what makes Deines so likable, teammates said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"She's probably the most humble person I've ever met,\" said Issaquah senior Elissa King, who also plays club ball with Deines for Eastside Futbol Club.\n\nAway from the pitch, Deines is like many other 18-year-olds. She's the school's student government assembly director and enjoys watching \"America's Next Top Model.\"\n\nOn the field and under the lights, Deines has an incredibly well-rounded game. She's fast, she's strong, and she can find the net with either foot. She also stands 5 feet 9, which allows her to see the field and read each play as it develops, giving her a huge advantage when it comes time to fly high.\n\n\"If you can be the most dominant team in the air you're going to have a lot of success because if you can win those balls, you're already off to the races,\" Deines said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"It's also intimidating for another team when your opponent's going up strong and winning all of the air battles. It's kind of shocking, especially in the women's game, because heading is definitely a weakness.\""}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/kate-deines", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nKate Deines was born on 17 September, 1989 in Portland, OR, is an American soccer midfielder-defender.

After suffering from a badly torn quadricep in high school, her coach recommended cross-training with yoga, which the former Husky and Seattle Sounders star credits for helping her play to her potential during her college years and into her current position as a midfielder in the Icelandic Pro League. Athletes for Yoga chatted with Kate about focus, recovery, and the importance of athletes taking time out of their schedules for a little happy baby and some gummy bears!\n\nHow did you first get introduced to yoga?\n\nI started doing yoga in high school due to some nagging injuries that just wouldn\u2019t go away. I tore my quad pretty badly and couldn\u2019t seem to get healthy. One of my trainers recommended I try yoga and I\u2019ve been practicing every since. I really stepped up my yoga game when I joined the women\u2019s soccer team at the University of Washington and was introduced to Athletes for Yoga. Erin (Owner and Head Coach) had an amazing ability to transform the way I thought about recovery and I credit my regular sessions with her during college for keeping me injury-free and helping me take my game to the next level.\n\nWith a career like yours, it must be hard to find time to fit yoga into your schedule. Why is it important for you to prioritize this form of training?\n\nI think for athletes who are constantly on the go and trying to balance so many different pressures in our daily lives, being able to take an hour of your day to relax and refocus through yoga is huge. Since I started, I\u2019ve noticed improvements in my flexibility, performance, and overall well-being. I feel a lot more relaxed and I feel like yoga really takes the edge off all the pressure I feel as a competitive athlete \u2014 especially when I was in college and juggling school and practice and friends and family. It just always takes me to a happy place, and it helped get me back on the soccer field at 100 percent after my injury. I\u2019m definitely grateful that I have yoga in my life and it will remain part of my life\n\nDo you notice the difference when you skip a few yoga sessions?\n\nThe minute I have not been good about practicing on a regular basis, I\u2019ve gotten a tweak here or there so I always try to practice as often as I can, especially now that I\u2019ve gone pro \u2014 staying on top of my game and keeping my body right is super important.\n\nWhat's your favorite pose?\n\nIt's hard to pick just one but it would probably be happy baby. As a soccer player, my hip flexors and groin are always tight so for me, I always feel like I get the most out of that kind of stretch. I also love savasana but then again, who doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s just the most gratifying feeling when you make it to the final pose and feel the weight of the day just lift off your shoulders. There are few things better than that.\n\nOther than yoga, how do you relax and blow off steam?\n\nEven though my career revolves around being active, I still love being as active as possible in my downtime. My family and friends and I are always finding ways to boost our energy outdoors, from hiking to walking, we are always moving!\n\nFavorite post-workout snack?\n\nChocolate milk is my go-to for the protein and of course, gotta have the gummy bears!\n\nWhen I play soccer I feel\u2026\n\nEmpowered!\n\nKate is currently playing for Stjarnan FC in the Icelandic Pro League along with fellow former Husky teammate Veronica Perez.

Although she's worn the tiara on multiple occasions before, the glamorous moment marked the first time Kate has ever worn a tiara outside of the U.K.\n\nKate also wore the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot differently than usual, making for a personal style first.

The royal then shifted to chignons, which would dominate as her go-to tiara hairstyle for the next seven years.\n\nAccording to the Court Jeweller, Queen Mary's Lover's Knot tiara \u2014 which features pearls hanging from diamond knots \u2014 is more than a century old and was originally commissioned from jeweler Garrard by Queen Mary in 1913 or 1914.
