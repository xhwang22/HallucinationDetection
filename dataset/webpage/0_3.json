His father gave him the greater part of his general education and University College, London, his medical training. He graduated in 1851 as University scholar and gold medallist in physiology, comparative anatomy and medicine. For so outstanding a student, a great future seemed assured. But his means were slender and he decided to begin practice in Leeds where he had relatives. However, his old teacher Marshall Hall persuaded him to return to London, offering him his house in Grosvenor Street on favourable terms. His enterprise was rewarded by appointments as assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1855, the Westminster Hospital in 1857 and University College Hospital in 1859.

Somewhat shy and grave of mien, he could reveal both a quiet humour and a directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.

He followed and developed Hughlings Jackson\u2019s original ideas about positive and negative neurological symptoms. His approach to patients was holistic at a time when more objectively defined notions of illness dominated medicine. He wrote on vertigo, and about criminal lunacy, and his book The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages was a major text of the period.\n\nWell versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music, he was widely admired. He became President of the Royal College of Physicians.\n\nLike the great Sir Jonathan Hutchinson and other Victorians of privileged stock, Sir John Russell Reynolds (1828\u20131896) (Figure 1) never attended school. His father, a nonconformist minister at Romsey in Hampshire, educated him personally. His grandfather Henry Revell Reynolds (1745-1811), FRS, was an illustrious physician at the Middlesex and St Thomas\u2019s Hospitals and Physician to George III.\n\nFigure 1: Sir J Russell Reynolds. [Published in British Medical Journal, 6 June 1896)\n\nAs a nonconformist he was excluded from Oxford and Cambridge* and read Medicine at University College London, graduating with a gold medal in physiology, comparative anatomy, and medicine in 1851 [1]. An impecunious young doctor, he sought a living, practicing in Leeds where his brother was a Minister of the East Parade Mission Chapel, and his brother-in-law a journalist on the Leeds Mercury.\n\nA year later his former teacher Marshall Hall, FRS. (1790-1857), a physician and brilliant experimental physiologist persuaded him to return to London [2], where at modest cost Hall let him live in his home at 38, Grosvenor Street and join his Consultant practice, mainly in nervous diseases.\n\nOnly four years after graduating Russell Reynolds\u2019 outstanding ability led to his appointment as assistant physician at the Hospital for Sick Children and to the Westminster and University College Hospitals. There he became Holme Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1862, and in 1867 succeeding Sir William Jenner as Professor of Medicine. Just five years after the opening of the National Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Paralysis and Epilepsy, Russell Reynolds showed his interest in neurology and was appointed to its staff. He was elected FRS on 3rd June 1869.\n\nAt this time neurology began to flourish; he worked with many distinguished early neurologists. They included Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911), Jabez Ramskill (1825-1897), Charles Bland Radcliffe (1822\u20131889) who succeeded Brown\u2013S\u00e9quard in 1863, and published Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864, and articles in Reynolds\u2019s System of Medicine. His brother John Netten Radcliffe (c. 1830-1884), a pioneering epidemiologist, was also Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic.\n\nNo man works in a vacuum. Marshall Hall, (who in spite of his acknowledged distinction [3] surprisingly had failed to get an academic post in London) inspired and encouraged Reynolds. Amongst contemporary and subsequent notable physicians he influenced were: the erudite Charlton Bastian (1837-1915); Charles Edward Beevor, (1854-1908); Howard Tooth (1856-1925); James Taylor, (1859-1946) editor of Jackson\u2019s Selected Writings; and the punctilious Thomas Buzzard (1831-1919), his neighbour in Grosvenor Street, and friend of both Hughlings Jackson and David Ferrier (1843-1928).\n\nSuch was Reynolds\u2019s reputation that he was rewarded with both the Lumleian and the Harveian lectures at the Royal College of Physicians of London, becoming President from 1893\u20131895. Like his grandfather, he was physician to the royal household in 1879 and was made a baronet in 1895. He was president of the BMA until his death.\n\nA popular and fluent lecturer, he was shy and serious but had a quiet humour and a \u2018directness of speech that was no respecter of persons.\u2019 Described as courteous, shrewd, and kind, his approach was holistic \u2013 long before it became fashionable:\n\nNot to merely make a diagnosis, much less to write a prescription, but to advise the individual patient what he or she should best do to regain their health\u2026 and what changes in the environment, mental, emotional, or physical were most likely to achieve this end. [2]\n\nMedical works\n\nRussell Reynolds is often remembered for his descriptions of epilepsy, eclamptic convulsions, and febrile convulsions in children [4,5]. He also used electrotherapy in various nervous diseases [6].\n\nInterestingly, he is widely quoted for commending the \u201cgreat value of Cannabis indica\u201d in migraine, epileptic conditions, depression, and asthma. In 1890 he prescribed a cannabis tincture for the menstrual cramps suffered by Queen Victoria. He noted in The Lancet:\n\nWhen pure and administered carefully, [cannabis] is one of the most valuable medicines we possess. [7]\n\nOf greater import was his 1861 paper (Figure 2) that espoused the concept of positive and negative neurological symptoms [5,8]. Positive symptoms were abnormal behaviours that included not only clonic jerking and abnormal movements but also hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n\nSome symptoms are negative, i.e. they consist in the negation of vital properties. Of this kind are paralysis, anaesthesia, and the like\u2026Other symptoms are positive, i.e. they consist in excess or alteration of vital properties. Of this kind are spasms, pain, convulsions and the like\u2026 (p.9-12, 28)\n\nUnfortunately, he failed to write further on this theme. Like Jackson, Russell Reynolds shrewdly noted that the lesion did not directly cause the symptoms observed.\n\nThe origins of positive and negative symptoms were inextricably intertwined with Herbert Spencer\u2019s ideas of dissolution and evolution of the nervous system [9]. Hughlings Jackson extended Spencer\u2019s idea to patients\u2019 symptoms, both positive and negative. Jackson believed that negative symptoms related to the dissolution of neural function while positive symptoms resulted from excitation or the release of lower levels from higher inhibitory control:\n\nSpeaking of the physical side, there are degrees of loss of function of the least organized nervous arrangements with conservation of function of the more organized. There is in each reduction to a more automatic condition; in each there is dissolution, using this term as Spencer does, as the opposite of evolution. [10]\n\nFigure 2. Reynolds: Epilepsy, its symptoms, treatment and relation to other chronic convulsive diseases. 1861\n\nRussell Reynolds wrote his first book on Vertigo. In 1856 he examined legal pleas for insanity in his Criminal Lunatics: are they Responsible? He believed that epilepsy could be a distinct or \u2018idiopathic\u2019 disease, a controversial view well expressed in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, Nerves and their appendages in 1855 (dedicated to Marshall Hall), This was later contradicted by Kinnier Wilson who stated that all epileptic events were symptoms, whether or not any underlying pathology could be demonstrated [11].\n\nAlways inclined to a broad approach he described the interictal symptoms of 62 patients with idiopathic epilepsy. He found about one-third had mild impairment of recent memory and a similar proportion had moderate to severe psychopathological findings. His interpretation of epileptic activity (well described by Eadie) [12] was in large measure approved by Hughlings Jackson.\n\nHe edited and wrote many chapters in A system of medicine (London: Macmillan, in five volumes from 1866 to 1879), a major text rivalled only by John Cooke\u2019s Treatise in Nervous Diseases, published in two volumes, in 1820 and 1823, the second volume of Bright\u2019s Reports of Medical Cases 1831, and Romberg\u2019s Manual of the Nervous Diseases of Man 1840 [13].\n\nRussell Reynolds practiced at a time when neurology was in its infancy. It relied on clinical description and elementary pathology. In this morass of evolving knowledge, Reynolds formulated a classification of neurological diseases that remains the kernel of modern systems. His work in neurology linked the highly original physiological and clinical works of his mentor, Marshall Hall, to Hughlings Jackson\u2019s intellectual explorations of the brain\u2019s complex functions and hierarchies, and to the more systematic descriptive neurology of William Gowers [12]. His students included Charlton Bastian (1837-1915) and Sir William Gowers (1845-1915), whose writings often reflect his influence.\n\nLegacy\n\nHe was well versed in poetry, philosophy, art, and music. He was married, first, to Margaret Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances Crespigny, but left no children. He died aged 68 of \u2018pulmonary congestion\u2019 at his home in 1896.\n\nThe scholarship and clinical advances made by Reynolds can be seen as important influences on contemporary and also later notable neurologists at the National Hospital. He bridged the eras of Victorian Neurology with that of the dawning 20th century.\n\nHe was noted as:\n\nA man of scholarship and wisdom, in his presidential address in 1894, in a spirit of prophecy he warned the subject-ridden student of to day of the danger of becoming entangled in the net of an ill-considered and misunderstood technical phraseology, and of juggling with words when he ought to be dealing with concrete things. [2]\n\nAnd Eadie characterised him as:\n\nA most eminent, scholarly, and influential physician who was greatly respected and admired by his contemporaries\u2026the sort of man whose ideas would not readily be discarded because it might almost seem disrespectful to do so unless a better alternative could be clearly demonstrated to exist. [12]\n\n* So-called dissenters (Catholics, Jews, and Quakers) were denied admission because their religious beliefs prevented their taking an oath to adhere to the 39 articles of the Anglican Church. This was abolished by the Universities Tests Act in 1871.\n\nWomen had studied at Oxford since the 1870s. But until 1921, they were not entitled to claim the degrees they had earned. Cambridge followed in 1947.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown GH. Munk\u2019s Roll. Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1826-1925).

United States 1879\n\nPetitioner: George Reynolds\n\nRespondent: United States\n\nPetitioner's Claim: The Morrill Act, which made practice of polygamy a crime, violated his First Amendment right to freedom of religion.\n\nChief Lawyers for Petitioner: George W. Biddle and Ben Sheeks\n\nChief Lawyers for Respondent: Charles Devens, U.S. Attorney General, and Samuel F. Phillips, U.S. Solicitor General\n\nJustices for the Court: Joseph P.

In Reynolds v. U.S., the Supreme Court found that laws banning polygamy were constitutional. They did not violate the Mormons' right to free exercise of their religion. This still remains the most important legal case to address the issue of polygamy.\n\nThe Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act is passed\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, after a long trek westward, the Mormons settled the land that became the state of Utah. The Mormons were followers of a religious prophet named Joseph Smith. Their religion was called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They held a variety of beliefs. The most controversial belief was that a man could have two or more wives, a practice known as polygamy.\n\nMany people in the United States had known about the Mormon practice of polygamy since 1852. Most Americans were traditional Christians who believed in monogamy\u2014having only one spouse. Until the Mormons arrived, however, there were no federal laws against bigamy or polygamy. The government left the Mormons alone for many years, but in 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act into law. The Morrill Act outlawed polygamy throughout the United States in general and in Utah in particular. The government did not do much to enforce the law at that time because it was concerned with the Civil War.\n\nCongress strengthens anti-bigamy law\n\nCongress again took up the issue of Mormon polygamy after the Civil War ended. The Morrill Act was strengthened when the Poland Law was passed in 1874. The Poland Law increased the powers of the federal courts in the territory of Utah. Because federal judges were not appointed by local politicians, they were usually non-Mormons who were more aggressive about enforcing the anti-bigamy law.\n\nMormon leader Brigham Young's advisor, George Q. Cannon, was a territorial delegate to Congress. Together, Young and Cannon decided to challenge the federal government in court. They were confident that if the government tried any Mormons for bigamy, the United States Supreme Court would throw out the convictions. Their belief was based on the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. They arranged to bring a \"test case\" to court. They chose Young's personal secretary, George Reynolds, to act as the defendant. Reynolds was a devout Mormon and practicing polygamist.\n\nYoung and Cannon were successful. The government indicted (charged) Reynolds with bigamy in October of 1874. However, the first trial failed because of jury selection problems. The government indicted Reynolds again in October of 1875.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged that Reynolds was married to both Mary Ann Tuddenham and Amelia Jane Schofield. The prosecutors had little trouble proving that Reynolds lived with both women. However, they did have some trouble serving Schofield with a subpoena. (A subpoena is a legal document ordering a person to appear in court.) The following dialogue is taken from questions the prosecution asked the deputy marshal sent to serve the subpoena on Schofield:\n\nQuestion: State to the court what efforts you have made to serve it. Answer: I went to the residence of Mr. Reynolds, and a lady was there, his first wife, and she told me that this woman was not there; that that was the only home that she had, but that she hadn't been there for two or three weeks. I went again this morning, and she was not there. Question: Do you know anything about her home, where she resides? Answer: I know where I found her before. Question: Where? Answer: At the same place.\n\nJudge White gave instructions to the jury after more evidence was presented that Reynolds had two wives. The instructions completely destroyed Reynolds's defense that the First Amendment protected his practice of polygamy allowed by his Mormon faith.\n\nThe jury found Reynolds guilty on December 10, 1875. On July 6, 1876, the territorial Supreme Court affirmed (maintained) his sentence. Reynolds then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 14 and 15, 1878, his lawyers, George W. Biddle and Ben Sheeks, argued before the highest court in the land that Reynolds's conviction must be overturned on the basis of the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court destroys the Mormons' hopes\n\nOn January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision. The Court based its decision on historic American cultural values, namely that from the earliest times polygamy was considered an offense against society. Most civilized countries considered marriage a \"sacred obligation,\" and a civil contract usually regulated by law. Therefore, the Court ruled that the First Amendment did not protect polygamy. Reynolds's sentence of two years in prison and a $500 fine remained.\n\nThe Court's decision rocked the Mormons. Initially, they vowed to resist the Court's ruling. Later, however, they seemed to accept their fate. In 1890, Mormon leader Wilford Woodruff issued a document called the Manifesto. The Manifesto ended \"any marriages forbidden by the law of the land.\" After 1890, most Mormons abandoned the practice of polygamy.\n\nThe Reynolds case is still the leading Supreme Court case on the issue of polygamy. In 1984, a U.S. District Court considered the case of Utah policeman Royston Potter, who was fired from his job because of bigamy. District Court Judge Sherman Christensen rejected Potter's First Amendment defense. The U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this ruling. In October 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Potter's appeal. By refusing to hear cases like Potter's, the Court has effectively decided to keep Reynolds as the law of the land.\n\nMany legal scholars have criticized the Supreme Court for not altering or overturning its opinion in Reynolds. It has been more than a century since the decision was handed down. During that time, the Court has greatly expanded First Amendment protection of free exercise of religion. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Court increased the Constitution's protection for the civil rights of women, minorities, and other classes of persons whose equality under the law had not been a part of the old \"common law\" on which Reynolds was based. As of 2000, however, the Supreme Court has not reconsidered the ruling it gave in Reynolds.\n\nFIGHTS OVER POLYGAMY\n\nT he Mormon practice of polygamy had been controversial for almost as long as the religion existed in the United States. In 1857, 2,500 Army troops were sent into Utah to install a governor to replace Mormon leader Brigham Young. Mormons responded angrily. The result was the \"Utah War.\" During this war, Mormons killed 120 people passing through Utah on their way to California.\n\nFor years, Utah was refused statehood because of its approval of polygamy. The controversy spread to the Mormon community itself. In 1873, Ann Eliza Webb Young made history by moving out of the home owned by her husband, Brigham Young, and demanding a divorce. She became a nationwide crusader against polygamy. The battle continued throughout the 1880s and 1890s. Over 1,000 Mormons were fined or imprisoned for polygamy. It wasn't until Mormons themselves outlawed the practice of polygamy that Utah's application for statehood was accepted, on January 4, 1896.\n\nSuggestions for further reading\n\nCannon, George Quayle.

He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851 he graduated M.B. in the university of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852 he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a fellow of the college in 1859. In the same year he was appointed assistant physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, assistant physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 assistant physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865 he became professor of the principles and practice of medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen's household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian oration in 1884, and was elected president in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a baronet. In the winter of 1895\u20136 he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as president of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children.\n\nThe Reynolds Baronetcy, of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death.\n\nReynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an Essay on Vertigo; in 1855 Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves, as well as Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity; in 1872 The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the System of Medicine, in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write\u2014compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe. Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.\n\nReynolds died in London."}, {"url": "https://history.rcplondon.ac.uk/inspiring-physicians/russell-john-reynolds", "page_content": "Russell John Reynolds was the son of Dr John Reynolds, a general practitioner in Streatham, who with Sir William Crookes constructed the X-ray apparatus now in the Science Museum, South Kensington. His mother was Caroline Harriets, daughter of Dr Trott. From Westminster School he went to Guy\u2019s Hospital and after two years in practice with his father set up as a full time radiologist in 1920. In World War I he served with the R.A.M.C, in home hospitals until 1917 when he became electrical specialist to the Karachi Brigade in India, returning home in 1919. In 1921 he was appointed physician-in-charge of the X-ray departments of Charing Cross and the National Hospitals; his son, Seymour, succeeded him at Charing Cross in 1946, and he retired from the National Hospital in 1939.\n\nFor many years he was adviser in radiology to the Ministry of Pensions and Supply and an examiner to Cambridge University, the Conjoint Board, the Faculty of Radiologists and the R.A.M.C. On his retirement in 1946 he acted as honorary consulting radiologist to the Charing Cross, National, Samaritan, Bethlem Royal and Lambeth Hospitals, and to the Caernarvon and Anglesey Infirmary.\n\nFrom 1924 he had experimented with methods of cineradiography, pioneering in photofluorography with a very wide aperture camera lens. His success brought worldwide recognition. He was president of the British Institute of Radiology and of the section of radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, warden of the Fellowship of the Faculty of Radiologists, Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1936, and was awarded the Antoine Beclere award in Paris in 1957.\n\nIn addition he was made a member of the Canadian Radiological Society, the American Roentgen Ray Society, the New York Roentgen Society, the Association of Physicians of Vienna and the Society of Radiologists of Italy; the Australian College of Radiology elected him a fellow.\n\nHe was the author of many publications, particularly in his specialised field of cineradiography which culminated in the production of the Russell Reynolds cineradiographic unit. His paper on the early history of radiology in Britain was published in Clinical Radiology (1961, 12, 136-42).\n\nReynolds was quiet, unassuming and kindly; his strong personality was shown only in his teaching, which brought him the enthusiasm of students and the deep respect of his colleagues. In 1908 he married Anna Thekla Henriette, daughter of Adolf Romer, a banker.

The firm evolved to Padova & Lisi when Nicholas Lisi formed a partnership with John R. Padova Sr., where I worked as an associate attorney handling general litigation. In 1992, after Padova Sr. was appointed to serve as a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, I became partner with Lisi. Subsequently, Padova & Lisi became Padova, Lisi & Della Guardia. Joseph Della Guardia relocated to Florida, and the firm continued as Padova & Lisi up until the passing of Lisi in 2009. A new entity, The Padova Firm, was established with me being the president of the firm. The firm\u2019s focus was general civil litigation, primarily in personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation and, to a lesser degree, discrimination cases and commercial litigation.\n\nI have litigated motor vehicle crashes, construction/premises injury cases and medical malpractice cases. I have litigated worker\u2019s compensation cases, Social Security disability cases and insurance bad faith matters. I have also served as an arbitrator for personal injury matters and uninsured and underinsured matters in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Dec. 18, 2019, I was appointed by Gov. Thomas Wolf and approved by the Senate to fill a vacancy as a judge in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. On Jan. 20, 2020, I was sworn in and assigned to the criminal trial division in Philadelphia County. In January of 2022 my judicial term ended and I resumed the practice of law where I was of counsel at the firm of Messa & Associates. I was appointed again by Wolf as a judge in the Court of Common Pleas and sworn in at the end of July 2022 where I am presently serving.\n\nThe Legal: What is one major thing about your career experience that most qualifies you for this position, and why?\n\nPadova: Since my appointment to the Court of Common Pleas, I have proven himself as a fair jurist on the Court of Common Pleas. In numerous cases, I have demonstrated my commitment to promoting diversionary programs for nonviolent criminals with underlying issues such as drug addiction and mental health, so that they can get the treatment they need and are not just relegated to prison. I\u2019ve supported re-entry programs for individuals to give them the ability to find jobs, housing and education opportunities. As a trial attorney for over 30 years, I know the nuances and difficulties in litigating cases along with the risks and expenses.\n\nI am the oldest of six children born to U.S. District Judge John R. Padova, Sr. of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Ann M. Padova, a retired nurse. I am married to Lua Thi Kim who immigrated to the United States from Vietnam in 1987 and is a licensed esthetician. From an early age, my parents instilled a strong sense of responsibility and growing up in a large family has helped me prepare for a future in the courtroom. I am equally inspired by my father\u2019s legal and judicial career and my mother\u2019s commitment to caring for others while raising a family of six and see my upbringing as a natural precursor to running for judicial office.\n\nThe Legal: What is the main reason Pennsylvania voters should pick you?\n\nPadova: My trial experience as an attorney over a 30-year period and recent Judicial endeavors enable me to understand the problems of everyday people, laborers and attorneys. I recognize that the law in the courthouse belongs to all people alike. It is my philosophy to administer the law fairly and mannerly to all parties. When parties leave the courthouse, it is my goal that they feel they were sufficiently heard in a respectful manner. My philosophy is to offer the willingness to listen, the desire to understand and to give respect and consideration to everyone who comes before me.\n\nThe Legal: What will be your approach to moving matters efficiently through the case management system?\n\nPadova: I have proven myself capable of doing so already on the bench and I will continue to do so.\n\nThe Legal: What would you say to voters regarding your plans to ensure the equal administration of justice for all people?\n\nPadova: Everyone in Philadelphia, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, gender identity, ethnicity or sex, deserves equal access and dignity in the courtroom. Anyone who participates in the justice system should be given respect and treated fairly. If I am given the honor of continuing to serve as a jurist, I will continue to practice this philosophy. When appropriate, I would make defendants and victims active participants in the justice system and ensure that all parties see me as a fair arbiter of the law and the system as fair as a whole. I\u2019ve learned the importance of our system\u2019s demonstrating legitimacy and fairness in order to ensure the public\u2019s trust. In my courtroom, I would do everything in my control to ensure that those who come before me believe in the fairness and impartiality of the process.\n\nThe Legal: Where can voters go for more information about you?\n\nPadova: padovaforjudge.org"}, {"url": "https://www.reynoldsforjudge.com/about", "page_content": "John's father, E.

Those comments are due Thursday, June 23.\n\nIt will be Reynolds\u2019 fifth appointment to the seven-member court. It comes on the heels of a recent Iowa Supreme Court decision that reversed a 2018 ruling that had established abortion as a right guaranteed by the state constitution. Reynolds did not appoint any of the justices who joined the 2018 ruling, and just one of the four new justices disagreed with the majority in the recent decision.\n\n\u201cThis rather sudden change in a significant portion of our court\u2019s composition is exactly the sort of situation that challenges so many of the values that (legal precedent) promotes concerning stability in the law, judicial restraint, the public\u2019s faith in the judiciary, and the legitimacy of judicial review,\u201d wrote Chief Justice Susan Christensen in a dissenting opinion.\n\nChristensen was Reynolds\u2019 first appointment to the Supreme Court.
