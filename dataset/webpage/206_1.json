It's always unique to have a Rampant Horse on steering wheel spokes. I would say I acted in \"Lippi's way\", getting out of GT1 as World Champion to enter in GT2 aware that there will be a lot to work upon, starting from my driving style. At the same time I'm still longing for new records and above all I wish I could support the whole Team. In AF Corse team I will meet a group of strongly motivated people I worked with in the past, will be supported by Michelin and - least but not last - I will have a very strong team companion Christian Montanari.

A forgettable chapter in the long history of the Silverstone team now known as Aston Martin it may be, but to Thomas Biagi it is a prized memory of a career that had its finest days in GT racing.\n\nThe 2003 FIA GT champion had been out of single-seaters for three years by the time he landed his long-awaited test opportunity, a decade after his last official test with Minardi at Fiorano in 1995.\n\nA stalwart of International Formula 3000 and its Italian/European cousin between 1995 and 2002, Biagi\u2019s crushing victory at Donington in 2001 \u2013 against opposition that included F1 2008's nearly-man Felipe Massa \u2013 was the exception rather than the rule.\n\nBut even at 29, Biagi never lost sight of his F1 goal \u2013 \u201cI believe in the power of your dream,\u201d he says \u2013 and despite having no manager in his corner convinced team boss Colin Kolles to give him a run out with a view to racing in 2006.\n\nWith the 2005 Toyota V10 powerplant behind his back, he completed 91 laps and lapped 1.37s quicker than new Midland signing Christijan Albers in an EJ15B with a 2006-spec V8.\n\nBiagi felt quickly at ease with the car as it was easier, he says, than his 2005 steed \u2013 the Maserati MC12 \u2013 \u201cbecause the weight of the car, the downforce, all of the electronic sup-port like traction control, differential that helps you\u201d.\n\nThomas Biagi, 2005 Midland F1 test Photo by: Motorsport Images\n\n\u201cFor me it was nice and easy for me to drive a Formula 1 car, [but] then to be world champion is another story!\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe test went extremely well, in the end they were extremely happy about my performance and my consistency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because in the end they showed me an agreement to make a full season, but I was just missing the budget. We were pretty close.\u201d\n\n\"There are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you. I miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s\" Thomas Biagi\n\nMidland used a bevy of third drivers in 2006, with Markus Winkelhock (four), Giorgio Mondini (nine), Adrian Sutil (three), Alexandre Premat and Ernesto Viso (one each) all taking their turns to drive on grand prix Fridays. Biagi wasn\u2019t among them and continued in GT1, but that wasn\u2019t the end of his F1 story.\n\nA chance paddock meeting with Kolles in 2007, when Biagi was commentating on GP2 for Sky Sport Italy, yielded an offer to sign a race-by-race deal for the renamed Spyker team in place of the cash-strapped Albers. But budget was again a stumbling block and Biagi remained in the MC12 to claim a second FIA GT title.\n\nIn his place, Winkelhock made a memorable debut at the rain-hit European GP. Thanks to a pre-race switch to wets, he was in the lead when the waterlogged track \u2013 with an expensive carpark forming in the Turn 1 gravel \u2013 caused the race to be red-flagged.\n\n\u201cWatching the race from home and seeing that the car I was supposed to drive was leading was strange!\u201d says Biagi, who would rack up further sportscar titles in Italian GT (2012) and International GT Open (2016) after prevailing in the Italian-based Superstars tin-top series in 2010.\n\nMarkus Winkelhock, Spyker F8-VII leads Felipe Massa, Ferrari F2007 Photo by: Lorenzo Bellanca / Motorsport Images\n\nA final opportunity for a crack at the F1 whip came in 2010, the year three new teams arrived on the grid, when he found a sponsor that tabled \u201ca reasonable budget\u201d. But by this point, Biagi concedes he \u201cwas definitely too late\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to do a couple of races, but that\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the years after I achieved very good results in GT categories so I\u2019m happy about my career.\u201d\n\nOpportunity of a lifetime: A fallen Indycar star's Jaguar F1 test\n\nAnd he at least had the good fortune to drive a contemporary V10\u2026\n\n\u201cThere are no words that can describe the feeling this kind of engine behind your shoulders gives you,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss the F1 of the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s, because for me, F1 is that kind of sound.

The announcement of the modenese\u2019s return to the race did not leave motorsport fans indifferent. Suffice it to say that Maserati at the beginning of the third millennium was the real ruler of racing reserved for Gran Turismo. Among the protagonists at the wheel Thomas Biagi, driver from Bologna born in 1976, in 2007 winner of the Fia GT endurance championship in the \u201cqueen\u201d class with the Maserati MC12 of the Vitaphone Racing team.\n\nMASERATI: RETURN TO RACES \u2013 A golden age for Maserati. In fact, between 2005 and 2009, the unforgettable MC12 dictated the \u201claw\u201d in the Fia GT. In addition to the style of rare beauty, the Italian supercar exploited uncommon aerodynamic qualities that enhanced the power of the 6-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine capable of delivering 630 horsepower, so much so that the racing supercar exceeded 330 km / h top speed. A domination in GT1 that lasted five years until the last season of the competitive international series (2009). \u201cI participated in that project from the very beginning \u2013 Biagi tells on the phone \u2013 The Maserati MC12 took part in the entire Fia GT season in 2005, but already the previous year ran in three races outside the standings. Maserati had a dream team directed by Claudio Berro. The car was beautiful to look at and unbeatable, it left only crumbs to the opponents despite race to race, and from season to season, with the Balance of Performance they tried to limit its supremacy \u201c.\n\nBiagi, what did you think about the announcement of Maserati\u2019s return to racing, starting in 2023 in Formula E?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be frank: I learned it with amazement, I was not aware of it. I hope to be proved wrong by the facts, but the choice seems to me to be dictated by a communication operation, considering that in FE the chassis and engine will not be produced by Maserati. I think that participation in the championship is in line with a progressive electrification of the road range. Without a doubt, however, I also appreciate this news because it gives the opportunity to train the staff for racing and get them used to a competitive environment. Even if I dream of something else \u2026 \u201c.\n\nOr?\n\n\u201cConsidering that Maserati has produced the MC20, a beautiful supercar that recalls the name of the legendary MC12, I would be delighted if I knew of a return to racing with covered wheels, perhaps in the GT3 category. In any case, seeing the Maserati brand on the track is always nice \u201d.\n\nHow do you remember the Fia GT season with Maserati which saw its victory in 2007?\n\n\u201cI think all car enthusiasts remember that period with nostalgia. We had a squadron, among the other pilots there were colleagues of the caliber of Andrea Bertolini, Mika Salo, Johnny Herbert. In 2007 I won the title in the last race by finishing third in Zolder: there was an incredible pressure because I was the only rider who had remained in the running for the victory that year with the MC12. And then the victory paired with Mika Salo at the Silverstone Tourist Trophy, writing our name on a roll of honor where people like Jackie Stewart and Jacky Ickx stand out \u201d.\n\nHow was the Maserati MC12 once you got inside the passenger compartment?\n\n\u201cFirst of all it was beautiful. In my career I have driven many cars, including Formula 1 despite never having participated in a GP, but I have never tried a more beautiful car to drive than the Maserati MC12. The naturally aspirated 6-liter engine \u2018sang\u2019 in a fantastic way, and then many details, from the sequential gearbox and not at the steering wheel, to the carbon brakes, to the huge downforce made it a racing car with a capital initial. It was going so fast that every race they forced us, with the BoP, to limit it. Suffice it to say that from 2005 to 2006 they made us reduce the rear wing by 30% and forced us to redo the project of the front body, effectively \u2018shortening\u2019 the nose, and then they made us reduce the engine power trying to cripple ours. thoroughbred horse.

The setting offered by fans today was simply great, spectators of the greatest occasions on grand stands and my fans club did the rest.\n\nBMW Team Italy have done a great job since winter tests and the merit of today's success has to be shared among all members of the team. A key role was certainly played by Roberto Ravaglia, whom I always admired as a driver and he is certainly not any worse as a team principal.

The Italian has traditionally competed in GT racing, winning the FIA GT Championship in 2003 and 2007. At the end of the weekend, Biagi said: \u201cThis is a dream come true for me. This championship was new territory for me, and the car was obviously very different to drive compared to those I am familiar with from GT1 and LMP2. I found my feet quickly, however, and was competitive from the word go. BMW Team Italy has worked very hard since the winter tests. Everyone in the team contributed to this success. Roberto Ravaglia, who I always admired as a driver, also played a key role. He is also an outstanding team principal. Our focus now turns to the final in Kyalami, where there is another title up for grabs.\u201d\n\nRavaglia said: \u201cThis victory is one of the two objectives we set at the beginning of the year.

My last choice has been determined by different factors, firstwhole the desire to give myself a chance in an extremely competitive championship like this year GT2 with 20 teams in the lists, moreover a strong belief in the consistency of Ferrari long time plans and above all the high opinion for Mr Amato Ferrari, who I can reflect myself with for his expierence as a pilot. It's always unique to have a Rampant Horse on steering wheel spokes. I would say I acted in \"Lippi's way\", getting out of GT1 as World Champion to enter in GT2 aware that there will be a lot to work upon, starting from my driving style. At the same time I'm still longing for new records and above all I wish I could support the whole Team. In AF Corse team I will meet a group of strongly motivated people I worked with in the past, will be supported by Michelin and - least but not last - I will have a very strong team companion Christian Montanari. I think there are all the premises for a good start!\".\n\nThose are the words of Team Principal Amato Ferrari: \"I believe that this year I will have in my team precious pilots. Together with Vilander and Bruni, the arrival of Biagi and Montanari from GT1 is a confirmation that GT2 is becoming more amd more important. This year, Ferrari and Porsche will fight strongly, and there is high interest for the new Aston Martin.

Its endless main straight is famous, a part of the Route Nationale 138, whereby the top speed is crucial for the final braking. The track is a tough test-bench both for drivers and for mechanical parts, the car is full throttle for more than 70% of the lap.\n\n\n\nLe Mans has always been a speed temple, and at the end of '80s this was impressive: in 1988 a WM P88 powered by a Peugeot V6 Turbo reached 405 km/h in the race, whole the following year a Suber C9 reached 400 km/h during practices.\n\n\n\nAt that point FISA decided that cars were too dangerous and two chicanes were added before the 1990 race. At the time, towards the end of the straight the Mulsanne's hillock was present, on which the Mercedes-Benz CLR of Mark Webber took off and tipped over in 1999. The hillock was successively made smaller for security reasons.\n\nThe roll of honour of the 24 Hours of Le Mans is full of names that made the history of motor racing, such as Tazio Nuvolari, Henri Pescarolo, Jacky Ickx, Klaus Ludwig, Tom Kristensen, Rinaldo Capello and Emanuele Pirro.
