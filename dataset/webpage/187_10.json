He spoke to German Hoops about basketball.\n\nWhat is your impression of MBC this season?\n\nThey lost some key players, but they are still a tough team. You always will hav eto give them respect because they are a good team.\n\nAre you surprised how well the EWE Baskets have played in the first two months despite so many new players?\n\nI am a little surprised, but I am very happy the way we are playing. It is never easy with a new team and everyone gelling. We will have some growing pains, but it is good that we are winning now.\n\nHow important have been the signing of Nemanja Protic and Mindaugas Lukauskis?\n\nThey have been very important. Protic has done a good job learning our system and running the team. He is a quick guard. Lukauskis gives us a lot of veteran leadership.is a great shooter, is always under control and always a threat from the bench.\n\nCoach Predrag Krunic always seems to find the right players from eastern Europe. Why does he seem to have that right feeling for the right players?\n\nI dont know, but I guess he has the expertise. He always looks for players with the right character in a player and does a good job finding those type of players.\n\nAlba Berlin and The Brose Baskets Bamberg are the two top teams and favorite to with the 2011 BEKO BBL title. When will Oldenburg be where they are?\n\nI hope that we can be where they are. They play very well, but we can\u00b4t worry about them, but take each game at a time. We are anew group, but I hope that we can be in the mix with them at the end of the season.\n\nYou are playing your fourth season with The EWE Baskets Oldenburg. What makes Oldenburg so special?\n\nI like Oldenburg. It is small, but not to small. I feel very comfortable raising my family in Oldenburg. The club takes care of me and I like what coach Krunic is doing for the club. I am happy they wanted me around another season.\n\nYou are a very versatile player, but only fourth in scoring. Has your role changed this season?\n\nI dont think my role has really changed. There are many guys scoring this season and with a new team it is a part of the growing pains. My shot isn\u00b4t falling the way it should, but I dont want to focus on scoring, but helping the team win and do my job rebounding and playing defense.\n\nWould you like to get more shots in games?\n\nEvery player always want more touches, but as long as we are winning, I am happy. We have many different guys like Campbell, Protic or Stevic that can step up on any given night. I hope that my night will come soon.\n\nYour friend Jimmy Mckinney was injured again this season. He is a real fighter. What makes him so strong that he keeps coming back from injuries?\n\nMckinney has a good staff in Frankfurt. He is young and is a good kid. He has been lucky that he hasn\u00b4t had a too serious injury where he couldn\u00b4t come back from. He has a strong focus to come back and help the team.\n\nWhat is a strength in your game that doesn\u00b4t always get noticed right away?\n\nI am known as an athletic player that can get to the basket, but I think that my defense doesn\u00b4t always get noticed.\n\nIf you could ask Allen Iverson one question what would you ask him?\n\nI would ask him he had any regrets how his career has gone the last few years since he always had had a great career.\n\nYou played against Skyliner Roger Powell. How important is he for the BEKO BBL?\n\nI remember that he and Illinois always beat us at Missouri. He is really important for the league. He will get even more fans involved. he is a great guy with a good character and is very mature.\n\nWho wins a 1-1, you or Mindaugas Lukauskis?\n\nI would win, but he is a crafty slick ball handler and can shoot the ball. I would have to stay on my feet, because you can\u00b4t give him the open shot.\n\nHow well will the Miami Heat do with Lebron James?\n\nThey will play at the top. They will begin to click more and more as season progresses. I hope they beat Boston in the east, but Boston is strong on defense.\n\nWhat was the last DVD movie that you saw?\n\nIron Man 2\n\nThanks Ricky for the chat."}, {"url": "https://www.proballers.com/basketball/player/14025/rickey-paulding", "page_content": "Rickey Paulding - Points Rickey Paulding scores a career high 39 points (2007) On May 02, 2007, Rickey Paulding set his career high in points in a France - Betclic Elite game.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nWill the Pistons be in a big hole after the first 10 games?\n\nWill the Pistons be in a big hole after the first 10 games? by Aaron Kellerstrass\n\nThe Detroit Pistons finished their perfect defeated preseason, dropping their fourth in a row to the Memphis Grizzlies last night.\n\nWins and losses aren\u2019t important in the preseason, but the Pistons didn\u2019t look great, though they did have some nice moments in the finale.\n\nThe team still has a ton of question marks around the starting lineup and rotation, especially after Marvin Bagley III went out with an injured knee.\n\nWith Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Hamidou Diallo all banged up and possibly missing the start of the season, someone is going to have to pick up those minutes in the 10-man rotation.\n\nIt may change from night to night depending on matchups, but who is currently winning the battle for the back end of the rotation?\n\nDetroit Pistons rotation: Which two-way guy will get a shot?\n\nStanley Umude, Jules Bernard and Buddy Boeheim\n\nAll three of these guys played sparingly in preseason and will not be on the roster for the start of the year unless 3-4 more guys go down with injury.\n\nAll of them need reps and will get them in the G-League. Umude was the best of the three but none of them did much in their limited run.\n\nKevin Knox\n\nKnox got his first action last night and played 18.5 minutes against the Grizzlies, scoring 13 points on 4-of-9 shooting overall.\n\nWe got a glimpse of what Knox can do for this team, which is to provide some outside shooting, as he hit 3-of-6 from long range. Knox has always been a streaky shooter, but if he can consistently knock them down, he has a chance to make this rotation even if everyone is healthy, as Detroit is desperate for shooting.\n\nBraxton Key\n\nBraxton Key played in all four preseason games and averaged 17.5 minutes off the bench. Key is not spectacular by any means, but he is solid in pretty much every area of the game and is a more versatile defender than Knox.\n\nKey averaged six points and four rebounds in the preseason and knocked down 50 percent of his 3-point attempts, though he only took 1.5 per game on average. If Key can continue to hold his own on defense and knock down shots, he\u2019ll be the frontrunner for early minutes if all of these guys are still out.\n\nKey is a glue guy who always seems to be in the right place, though he is not great at any one thing.\n\nIf the Detroit Pistons still have several players injured in the first few games of the season, I think we\u2019ll see both Key and Knox depending on the matchup and what they need at the moment. If Knox can hit shots though, he could work his way into the rotation even after all of the regulars get back."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/d04/tracker/player?playerId=78634", "page_content": "Summary: Rickey Paulding Notes:After having a phenomenally successful sophomore year where many NBA scouts predicted that Paulding would be a lottery pick, he suffered setbacks during his junior and senior campaigns that have made them rethink his draft stock. Upside: He's a very athletic slasher who uses his athleticism to elevate over his opponents. His vertical leap is off the charts. Has a nice mid-range jumper. A good ball handler. Good lateral quickness should allow him to be a decent defender in the pros. Has a good body. Downside: Consistency and that outside shot. Paulding took a 158 threes this season, but made just 34 percent. Last year he was much more effective from downtown. This year he was just streaky. Made four or more threes five times during the season. Missed four or more threes eleven times. Insider Projection: The biggest problem was consistency. The Tigers never knew who was going to show up. Paulding was huge in several big games this year including a 31 point performance (shooting 5-fot-7 from three) against Oklahoma State. But he also had a number of nine point stinkers against Kansas, Kansas State and Texas A&M. Scouts feel that his game is a better fit in the NBA than it was in college. However, he didn't stand out at all at the Chicago pre-draft camp. The fact that he measured at just 6-foot-4 also didn't help things. Will he even be drafted?\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.rp23athletics.com/aboutus", "page_content": "OUR COACHES\n\nRickey Paulding is a former professional basketball player from Detroit, Michigan.
