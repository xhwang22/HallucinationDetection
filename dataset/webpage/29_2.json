I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\u201d\n\nCalls to Steven Threet\u2019s cell phone last night from The Michigan Daily were not returned. When contacted last night by the Daily, Threet\u2019s father, Jewel Threet, said his son would release a statement today and declined further comment.\n\nAn Athletic Department spokesperson also declined to comment about the statement.\n\nThe Wolverines\u2019 starter in 8 of 12 games last year, Threet transferred from Georgia Tech prior to the 2007 season. He finished last season 102-of-200 for 1,105 yards, nine touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nMichigan signed two quarterbacks, Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson, on National Signing Day on Feb. 5. Forcier, a four-star recruit according to rivals.com, enrolled early in January and will practice with the team this spring.\n\nRedshirt sophomores Nick Sheridan and David Cone are the only returning quarterbacks on Michigan\u2019s roster. Sheridan started four games last season. Freshman Justin Feagin, who began last season at quarterback and moved to slot receiver, will also return.\n\nPhil Jacobs, Threet\u2019s coach at Adrian High School, said yesterday he didn\u2019t know about Threet\u2019s plan to transfer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty much kept it to himself and his family,\u201d Jacobs said yesterday before the quarterback announced his intention to leave the Wolverines. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best and do the right thing. I\u2019m supportive of the kid.\u201d\n\nThreet enrolled at Georgia Tech in January 2007 but transferred after spring practice. He cited the departure of Yellow Jacket offensive coordinator Patrick Nix, who primarily recruited Threet, as the main reason for the transfer.\n\nAlthough Michigan had five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett, Threet told Jacobs he wasn\u2019t intimidated. Threet thought he outplayed Mallett at Michigan\u2019s quarterback camp after his junior year of high school, Jacobs told The Michigan Daily in September 2008.\n\nWhen Threet decided to transfer to Michigan, Jacobs said the quarterback called him with a simple message.\n\n\u201d \u2018Coach, I\u2019m going to go back to Michigan, and I\u2019m going to beat Mallett out for that starting job,\u2019 \u201d Jacobs said Threet told him.\n\nThreet sat out the 2007 season because of NCAA transfer rules, and Mallett transferred to Arkansas after that season.\n\nThreet competed with Sheridan, a former walk-on, during spring and fall practices for the starting job. Sheridan started in the season opener, but Threet got the starting nod in the next game against Miami (Ohio).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating not to hit the passes to help the team win more than anything,\u201d Threet said after the Miami game, in which he went 6-of-13 for 63 yards, including one 50-yard screen pass. \u201cSome passes, some plays, I\u2019d like to have back. But that\u2019s the situation, so you just keep on working, and try and come back next week and make the plays.\u201d\n\nThreet\u2019s breakout start came against Notre Dame on Sept. 13. In South Bend, he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.\n\nHe started seven more games but missed two of Michigan\u2019s final three games with a shoulder injury. He didn\u2019t play at Minnesota and didn\u2019t make the trip to Ohio State.\n\nThreet said early last season that being Michigan\u2019s quarterback wouldn\u2019t affect his laid-back personality.\n\n\u201cI feel that I can be focused, but be myself at the same time,\u201d Threet said. \u201cMe as a person, I can\u2019t be uptight. I don\u2019t like that feeling, so that\u2019s not how I\u2019m going to approach a game.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nate Sandals and Joe Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nThink the loss of Steven Threet is a setback for the Wolverines?

When he and roommates Artis Chambers and Vince Helmuth study, \"it's no library environment,\" Helmuth says.Music frequently plays in the background of Threet's life; hip-hop, classic rock, even classical. During his weekday ritual of studying film alone in the Schembechler Hall team room - sometimes until midnight - Threet will sit in front of the big projector screen, remote in hand, wearing headphones.\n\nOn game days, such as today, when Michigan (2-2, 1-0 Big Ten) hosts Illinois (2-2, 0-1), Threet will begin his routine at Michigan Stadium by tossing a ball back and forth with a manager as fans trickle into the venue well before kickoff.\n\nWhile playing catch, Threet may listen to Bob Seger's \"Greatest Hits.\" Or it could be the sounds of a hip-hop artist such as Lil Wayne, T.I. or Jay-Z.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\u2022 Scouting report: Illinois at Michigan\n\n\u2022 Carty: With loss of civility, everyone loses\n\n\u2022 Q&A: Psych major Dutch has NFL dreams\n\n\u2022 Illinois quarterback Williams a proven playmaker\n\n\u2022 Huron High School receiver Jackson stays home, will play for Michigan\n\n\u2022 Lunch with Heuser: Limiting turnovers critical for U-M against Illinois\n\n\u2022 More Wolverines Football Coverage\n\nWhen the stadium's filled and fans are cheering, Threet \"definitely thrives off it,\" says Helmuth, a Michigan fullback.\n\nIt wasn't cheers, however, the Wolverines heard when they jogged off the field at halftime last Saturday against Wisconsin. Michigan trailed 19-0 and the team's offense had generated 21 total yards.\n\nAs for Threet, \"he had about the worst half I've ever seen a quarterback have,\" Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith says bluntly. Threet completed 2 of 10 passes for minus-7 yards. He had also thrown two interceptions, lost a fumble, but remained unfazed by it all.\n\n\"He wasn't doing well in the first half, obviously,\" offensive tackle Stephen Schilling says. \"But he didn't get down on himself, and none of his teammates got down on him. We stuck with him, kept blocking for him. We knew eventually he'd make the right throws and the right reads and we'd turn it around.\"\n\nWhen Threet and the Wolverines were finished, they had reversed things completely, scoring 27 consecutive points and holding off the then-No. 9-ranked Badgers, 27-25. It was the largest comeback in the 500-game history of Michigan Stadium, and it was directed by a redshirt freshman quarterback who said he never doubted himself.\n\n\"He still fought and scratched and made some plays for us and led us to a victory,\" Smith says.\n\nAdds Gary Gray, a family friend and coach from Adrian, the town where Threet was raised: \"I was more proud of him in the first half than in the second. When things aren't going well, that's when you see what Bubba's really all about.\"\n\nWhiz at memorization\n\nTo family and childhood friends, Threet is better known as Stevie, or more often, Bubba. That nickname started out as Chubba Bubba, Threet says.\n\n\"I was a hefty boy,\" he says, laughing. \"I was a large child. When I slimmed down a little bit it was just Bubba.\"\n\nWhatever he was called, Threet was born into a sporting family on Jan. 2, 1989, the day Michigan beat Southern California in the Rose Bowl.\n\nHis father Jewel played baseball at Adrian College, and coached the Lookouts youth travel baseball team in Lenawee County. Threet's older brother Jay played college baseball, first at Purdue, then at Bowling Green. Sister Krissy was a softball pitcher at Eastern Michigan University.\n\nSteven Threet pitched as well, and played basketball and soccer as an elementary student. Threet always told his parents that football was his favorite sport, however, but he didn't have an opportunity to play until he switched to the Adrian public schools.\n\nIn eighth grade, Threet's middle school football coach asked each boy to list two positions they wanted to play. Jewel Threet joked with his son that they'd make him a lineman. Steven Threet wrote down tight end and quarterback.\n\nThreet tried out for the quarterback job, won it, and soon impressed his coach with his ability to learn the offense.\n\n\"I remember the coach telling me that he was able to know his assignment, everybody else's assignment,\" Jewel Threet says. \"He knew every play, every position. And this was in the eighth grade, and I go, 'That's not surprising.' \"\n\nSteven Threet was a whiz at memorization, easily retaining scriptures he learned at Lenawee Christian School, helping with driving directions years before he turned 16 and excelling in academics. What Threet needed was a better grasp of how to play the quarterback position.\n\n\"I had never played football,\" Jewel Threet says. \"So when Stevie wanted to get serious about it, I had to find someone who could teach him.\"\n\nJewel Threet had ferried Jay to the Detroit area and Krissy to Ann Arbor for pitching lessons. For his youngest son's quarterbacking tutorials, he turned to Ken Calhoun, then the offensive coordinator at Adrian College. He also enlisted Mike Howe, a local conditioning coach, and Gray, a physical therapist by trade who has treated professional athletes such as Mario Lemieux and Dan Marino.\n\nThreet worked on his quickness, agility, change of direction, acceleration, deceleration, the proper way to throw from an off-balance position and more. He trained throughout high school, sometimes working out two or three times a day in the summer.\n\n\"I've never seen a kid work so hard,\" Gray says. \"A lot of times, kids are willing to work on their strengths. But he was willing to work to turn his weaknesses into strengths.\"\n\nLong road to starter\n\nThreet's mom, Pam, had graduated from the University of Michigan, and the family began buying football season tickets in the early 1980s. Pam and Jewel joined the Victors Club, and Jewel traveled to the 1992 and '93 Final Fours to watch the Michigan men's basketball team.\n\nWhen Jay was being recruited by Big Ten baseball programs, he tried to schedule his official visits for fall weekends when the Michigan football team was in town. During Jay's visit to Purdue, Stevie tagged along, wearing his Drew Henson No. 7 jersey.\n\nWhen Jay went to Northwestern, Stevie watched the Wildcats win a wild 54-51 game in 2001.\n\n\"We would be sitting there in their recruiting section, and I would have my Michigan jersey on, cheering for Michigan while my brother was looking at the other school,\" Threet says.\n\nHis Henson jersey and the one with former Michigan tailback Anthony Thomas' No. 32, were tucked away at home when Threet - who grew to be 6-feet, 6-inches tall - began his college career, not in Ann Arbor, but at Georgia Tech. Though Michigan expressed some interest in Threet, the school never offered a scholarship, and signed one of the nation's best high school quarterbacks - Ryan Mallett - to succeed four-year starter Chad Henne.\n\nThreet graduated from high school early as class valedictorian, and enrolled at Georgia Tech in January, 2007. But offensive coordinator Patrick Nix - who had recruited Threet - left almost immediately for Miami. By summer, Threet, too, had decided to leave Atlanta.\n\nOne of those he spoke to about where to go next was Helmuth, a Saline High graduate who had known Threet since middle school.\n\n\"I said: 'Come over here,' \" says Helmuth, who had started classes at Michigan in January 2007, along with Chambers, a safety, and Mallett.\n\nBecause another Michigan quarterback, Jason Forcier, had transferred to Stanford, there was a scholarship available for Threet. He sat out the season per NCAA transfer rules, then saw coach Lloyd Carr retire following Michigan's bowl game.\n\nShortly after Rich Rodriguez took over the program, Mallett - who backed up Henne in 2007 - transferred to Arkansas. When Terrelle Pryor, the nation's No. 1 prep quarterback, picked Ohio State over Michigan earlier this year, Threet and redshirt sophomore Nick Sheridan became the top contenders for the starting job.\n\n\"My goal transferring here was, obviously, to compete for the starting position,\" Threet says. \"I didn't come to sit and watch, that's not the type of person I am. I love to compete.\"\n\nAn instant leader\n\nThreet ultimately won the competition with Sheridan in the season's third game, when he completed 16 of 23 passes for 175 yards at Notre Dame. Threet followed that performance with the outing against Wisconsin, in which he had a 58-yard run, but finished 12 of 31 passing for 96 yards.\n\nMechanically, he still needs some polish, as Threet and his quarterbacks coach readily acknowledge. Threet sometimes plants his feet too wide when he throws the ball, and he tends to lower his release point too much, which can be traced to his baseball-playing days.\n\n\"We've gotta keep getting him fundamentally sound in practice,\" Smith says. \"I don't want him thinking on the game field. I want him reacting. Through the week of practice, when he gets all those reps, that's when he's gotta focus on that and concentrate on his technique.\"\n\nThough Threet's overall numbers aren't pretty - he's not ranked in the top 100 nationally in passing efficiency - Smith is optimistic, noting that it's rare for a such a young player to quarterback a spread offense, which requires him to make multiple decisions quickly on each play.\n\n\"I love his mentality, I love his attitude,\" Smith says. \"The kid wants to work, the kid takes coaching and he doesn't ever question or make excuses for anything, which is why I love him. The second thing is, he showed us all on Saturday there's no quit in that dog right there.\"\n\nAmong an offensive cast that includes a single senior, and has several true freshmen in starting roles, Threet has become an instant leader. He never speaks poorly about anyone, right tackle Stephen Schilling says, noting that Threet's positive attitude and enthusiasm are infectious.\n\n\"The young guys, especially, all look up to him, you can tell,\" Helmuth adds. \"That may be hard to say since we're all big football players, but they ask him for help before they go to anyone else.\n\n\"For a guy that's a freshman to be put in such a big role, nothing has gone to his head. He's still the same Stevie I've known from way back.\"\n\nOr the same Bubba, who wears a Galapagos Island T-shirt given to him by his late grandfather under his uniform; the same fashion-conscious Steven who owns upward of 50 pairs of sneakers he keeps meticulously clean; the same person who possesses other, less tangible, things.\n\n\"He has integrity, he has tremendous passion and character,\" Gray says. \"That's why it's so fantastic to see such a neat kid out there, playing the game he loves. All the hard work has come together for him. Rarely is the world fair. In this case it is.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.annarbor.com/sports/um-football/former-michigan-quarterback-steven-threet-vying-for-starting-job-at-arizona-state/", "page_content": "Michigan quarterback Steven Threet watches highlights of the past season on a video screen during the annual Michigan Football Bust held in 2008.

He addressed that and much more this week in a wide-ranging Q&A with 247Sports this week on campus, with Sanders and Colorado providing behind-the-scenes access to one of its summer football camps.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.\n\n247Sports: What have you seen so far from your new team?\n\nSanders: \"Want, determination, effort, camaraderie. It is a collection of men \u2014 some wanting a second chance. And some of them are just trying to get to the next level. But all of them share a desperate want to get where they want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\n247Sports: What do you say to people like Pat Narduzzi who have been critical of your roster overhaul?\n\nSanders: \"What was his situation when he came to Pitt? He had a different situation than me. He is not mad at me, he is mad at the situation in football now that allowed his best player to leave a year ago. He\u2019s not mad at me, he\u2019s using me to shoot bullets at another coach who he has an issue with. I don\u2019t know who he is; if he walked in here right now I wouldn\u2019t know him.\"\n\n247Sports: There was a lot of smoke surrounding Travis Hunter when he entered the portal: Would he follow you to Colorado or land somewhere else? He obviously enrolled at Colorado. What are your expectations for him this season?\n\nSanders: \"People offered Travis Hunter a bag. About $1.5 million to try to lure him and buy him out of the transfer portal. But Travis is not the kind of guy that can be bought. He isn't built like that. Travis is a relational young man that is built on relationships and stability. And that\u2019s what he wanted and desired. That is why he decided to ride and stay with us. I cannot wait until they see what he is capable of doing in these next couple of years. Because he will be a top-5 or top-3 pick after his junior year. But the sky's the limit, he is going to play both ways and he is a vital part of the offense and the defense, and he wants that.\n\n247Sports: How do you manage him playing both ways?\n\nSanders: \"We don\u2019t have to manage that. His game is his game. It\u2019s nothing that we manage. Travis is bored when he is not on the field, Travis is not intertwined with things when he is not on the field. Travis likes to be in the action, that\u2019s who he is.\"\n\n247Sports: As I watched the workouts this week, one of the things that has stood out to me is the vocal leadership of Shedeur Sanders. You\u2019ve been coaching him from youth, to high school and now college football. How has Shedeur grown as a leader this spring in the transition to Colorado?\n\nSanders: \"It\u2019s funny telling you this because his brother is sitting here filming this, but [Shedeur\u2019s] nickname is \u201cGrown.\u201d Because he has always been truly mature for his age at different stages of his life that he has encountered and different obstacles he has overcome. He is rock-steady. Grown doesn't get flustered. He is not a 'ra-ra' guy. He's not a 'I\u2019m gonna talk about what he\u2019s going to do\u201d [type of person]. It\u2019s not too many things in life that will get him up or get him down. He is like a baseball player. Baseball players are rock-steady. Football players are up because they have to practice for six days and play one. Baseball players have to do it every day. That is his character. And I love the expectation that he has placed on himself. My expectation of him is far less than his expectations he places on himself. Because not only does he have tremendous expectations, but he is a Sanders. And he knows what that means.\"\n\nGet offseason and recruiting information on your favorite college team for $1 for first month\n\n247Sports: A lot of roster changes have been made.\n\nSanders: \"Necessary changes. Say: 'Necessary.'\n\n247Sports: How do you like your team going into the fall as opposed to what you had in the spring?\n\nSanders: \"Apples and Oranges. You can\u2019t compare the two. You are talking about a situation in which we inherited a team that was 1-11. And everyone knows there are going to be some changes. I don\u2019t understand how you would think that the coaching staff is the only thing that deserved a change. Now when you rid yourself of the entire coaching staff, you think you are going to keep all the kids? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And that just doesn\u2019t make sense whatsoever when the previous staff was responsible for securing those kids. That\u2019s not the way that this game is played with us.\"\n\n247Sports: From a recruiting standpoint, if a young man wants to play for Colorado, what does he need to have?\n\nSanders: \"First he needs to have his grades correct and needs to be eligible through our compliance department. Then, he needs to be tough, smart, fast, disciplined and with character. And he has to understand that this coaching staff is old school. Not old fools, but old school. A lot of our principles and the way we attack the game comes from way back when. And we are still that way because that way is the way and it has not failed us yet. So it\u2019s a tremendous expectation, but we go hard and we play fast. And you have to love this thing. We don\u2019t want you to be 'in like' with it. We want you to be 'in love' with it.\"\n\nRELATED: 5 things Carl Reed learned from Colorado's spring game"}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2009/02/quarterback_steven_threet_will.html", "page_content": "Redshirt freshman Steven Threet, the most experienced quarterback at the University of Michigan, is planning to leave the school.\n\n\"I've decided to transfer from the University of Michigan,\" Threet said in a prepared statement. \"I have requested and received my release.

When Carr retired, his pro-style, pocket-passing attack was replaced by Rodriguez's spread, which ideally features a more mobile quarterback.\n\nEven so, Threet said it wasn't an easy decision to leave Michigan and its football program, the team he had grown up rooting for in his hometown of Adrian.\n\n\"I love the University of Michigan, but the way it is now is not the place for me any more,\" he said. \"It took a lot of thought, prayer, talking to people who are familiar with me and what type of quarterback I am.\"\n\nThreet, who announced he was leaving Michigan over the winter, said a family friend contacted Arizona State, which in turn contacted Threet to gauge his interest.\n\n\"I felt it was a perfect fit for me,\" he said.\n\nThreet will arrive on campus in July, but won't able to play during the 2009 season per NCAA transfer rules. He will then be eligible for competition in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"It will be definitely be difficult,\" Three said about sitting out a second season. \"I want to be out on the field, having an opportunity to help my team win. My role this year is to do what I can in practice to get myself better to compete for the starting job next spring.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/3791/qb-threet-to-transfer-from-michigan", "page_content": "Posted by ESPN.com's Adam Rittenberg\n\nWhen Michigan's quarterback competition resumes March 14 at spring practice, Steven Threet won't be a part of it.\n\nThreet announced Sunday he will transfer from Michigan after being granted his release from the team. The redshirt freshman quarterback told The Detroit News in a prepared statement that he doesn't know where he'll play next.\n\n\"I've decided to transfer from the University of Michigan,\" Threet said, reciting from a prepared statement during a telephone conversation Sunday. \"I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career and will have no further comment until that decision is made.\"\n\nThreet's decision comes as somewhat of a surprise, especially since he has already transferred once, from Georgia Tech to Michigan before the 2007 season. He certainly had his struggles last fall and true freshmen Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson seem better suited to run Rich Rodriguez's spread offense, but Threet held an edge in experience over both players.\n\nHe started eight games in 2008 and led Michigan in passing yards, completions and touchdowns.\n\nForcier, who enrolled at Michigan in January, appeared to be a formidable candidate for the starting job before Sunday night. After Threet's transfer, it's hard not to consider him the frontrunner, at least until Robinson arrives this summer.\n\nNick Sheridan also remains in the mix, but Rodriguez has a lot of confidence in his two recruits, which could have played a role in Threet's decision.\n\n\"I don't know if we could have gone out and gotten two better dual-threat quarterbacks than Tate Forcier and Robinson,\" Rodriguez said on national signing day. \"So we're very excited about those guys coming in and competing with the guys we have. ... You know, both Tate and Denard are the guys that can run and throw. They're not the tallest guys, but they're guys that also, again, can make plays when they're there and sometimes make plays when they're not there. Again, they've got to learn. I didn't promise Tate he was going to be the starting quarterback, didn't on promise Denard yet. We promised them an opportunity to compete right away.\"\n\nForcier's opportunity begins March 14."}, {"url": "https://www.maizenbrew.com/2009/2/16/760533/steven-threet-granted-rele", "page_content": "\"He's leaving and he has no idea where he's going,\" Threet's father Jewel, said today.\n\nFar be it for me to comment of the decision of another man, or the intentions behind it, but, um.... What?\n\nAs reported around the print media and all over the interwebs, Michigan Quarterback, ney, former Michigan Quarterback, Steven Threet will transfer from the University of Michigan. The transfer marks the second transfer of Threet's collegiate career and has us at Maize n Brew shaking our heads. With a full season under his belt and 8 career starts to his credit Threet was the odds on favorite to start this coming season. Instead, Steven will look for other opportunities to be a starting quarterback at the college level.\n\nUnfortunately for Threet his options are limited. Because he burned his redshirt during his intitial transfer to Michigan, he won't be able to transfer to another Bowl Subdivision school without losing a year to transfer restrictions. As a result it's likely Threet will move down to D-1AA in an effort to avoid losing a season of playing time.\n\nWhile we at Maize n Brew respect Steven's decision to transfer and wish him the best in his future endevours, we're a little perplexed by his decisions. Watching Threet play this year, he's not really that bad a fit for the offense. He's got a live arm and decent speed for a gigantic honky. While he's not a prototypical \"spread\" quarterback, I can really name only protoytpical spread quarterback in college football. I'll give you a hint. His last name is Pryor. So if you're running the spread, chances are you're imporvising a tad with a quarterback that is spread deficient in some manner or another.\n\nBut what struck me is that Threet's deficiencies in the spread were the same deficiencies he'll have in any offense: Overthrows; staring down receivers; bad reads; muffing the throw; etc. It's not like Threet did anything this year that made you say, \"Dang, if only he was in a different offense.\"\n\nThere's always the physical punishment argument, but I'm not buying that either. Threet did get banged up this season. He suffered a nasty concussion against Purdue, battled elbow problems the whole season, and finished the year on the shelf with a separated shoulder. Sure his 6' 6\" frame took a pounding this year, but Lord knows it wasn't anything on par with what Jimmy Clausen took two years ago at Notre Dame. There's no comparison. How Clausen can eat in any other manner than via feeding tube is a mystery to me. And that was in a \"pro-style\" offense with a line that was ten times worse than Michigan's this year. I don't care what style you play, you're gonna get popped.\n\nNo one will argue Threet had a rough year and that he's facing a pair of incoming quarterbacks that are, on paper, better suited to this offense than he is. But competition is what makes you better. It was my hope that these freshmen would push Threet to be the quarterback he has the talent to become. Instead, Threet will start over, again, and those incoming freshmen will push themselves to get ready for the opening kickoff."}]}
