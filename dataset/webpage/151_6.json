{"Josiah Mason was knighted in 1872 for his philanthropic work.": [{"url": "https://www.sjmt.org.uk/sir-josiah-mason-trust", "page_content": "Sir Josiah Mason Trust was found in 1868 by Josiah Mason, a Victorian industrialist and philanthropist.\n\n\u200b\n\nSir Josiah was born in 1795 in Kidderminster, a 'self-made man with no advantages of birth, or connections, or education, or means'. Born 17 years before Charles Dickens began to write about the poverty of the Victorian era, Josiah taught himself to write and joined a unitarian Sunday School as they could provide him with a basic education. He went on to build a vast fortune from self taught engineering skills and astute business knowledge.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom an early age, Josiah showed an entrepreneurial flare and tried his hand at many inventions, trades and business ventures before moving to Birmingham in 1816. By 1824, he invested the savings he had earned into a business which manufactured split rings. It was here that he improved the machinery that made the rings so that it was bevelled, hence the modern day key ring. He later went on to become the largest manufacturer of steel pens and pen nibs in the World and contributed heavily to the Birmingham pen trade. He also improved the machinery to make the split pen nib.\n\n\u200b\n\nJosiah, most likely influenced by his childhood experiences was an extremely caring and generous man who went on to do many charitable works, including the founding of schools, a dispensary and Mason Science College, the forerunner of the University of Birmingham. He was knighted for his good works in November 1872.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust\n\nIn 1858, Josiah built the first Almshouses in Station Road, Erdington for 30 'spinsters and widows' over 50 years old and rooms for 20 orphan girls. These Almshouses were demolished in 1974.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt was 10 years later that the Trust was officially founded on the 29th July 1868, in readiness for the opening of a second, larger orphanage in Bell Lane (now Orphanage Road), Erdington, with rooms for 26 women and dormitories for 300 children. It cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the sum of \u00a3200,000. All of this was financed by Sir Josiah and it amounted to a huge fortune at this time. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated. The orphanage was eventually re-designated as a school, but by the 1960's the cost of upkeep had become prohibitive, leading the Trustees to close it in 1960.\n\nThe Trust retained ownership of a small part of the Orphanage site which contained 36 Almshouses built in the 1920's and which are now called Mason Cottages. It then went on to build further Almshouses on our sites in Shirley in 1974 and Olton in 1979 and started providing care services in the 1980's.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Trust has continued to grow and evolve over the years and the need for the Trust is as real today as it was 150 years ago. We now enter an exciting and ambitious new phase of development in which we aim to improve the lives of many more people living in Birmingham and Solihull."}, {"url": "https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/history-and-heritage/our-heritage.aspx", "page_content": "Although the University received its Royal Charter in 1900, the foundations for its establishment were being laid for years previously. Already pushing forward the boundaries of research in medicine and the sciences, Birmingham was beginning to change the world.\n\nThe early days\n\nThe University grew out of Mason College, which can trace its roots back to the medical education seminars of Mr John Tomlinson in 1767-68. He was \u2018First Surgeon\u2019 to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary and his 28 weekly lectures on anatomy were the first to be held outside London or south of the Scottish border. Mason Science College was founded by Kidderminster-born Josiah Mason in 1875. From humble beginnings, Mason made his fortune by mass-producing key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating.\n\nHe became one of the country\u2019s most esteemed industrialists and philanthropists and was knighted for his generosity in establishing a great orphanage in the suburb of Erdington. The College became Mason University College in 1898 with the Rt Hon Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nThe socio-political landscape\n\nTo set the scene, at this time, England\u2019s only other independent universities were in Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and London. While compulsory education had been introduced in 1880 for children between the ages of five and ten years old, most of the population entered work by the age of 14.\n\nJoseph Chamberlain was acutely aware of these limiting factors when he proposed the establishment of the University of Birmingham. He sought to provide \u2018a great school of universal instruction\u2019, so that \u2018the most important work of original research should be continuously carried on under most favourable circumstances\u2019. It was his ambition that \u2018the individual trades of the new University [would] forever associate their name and their industry with this new institution\u2019. Many aspects of Chamberlain\u2019s vision continue to inspire and guide the University today, including our continuing responsibilities to, and aspirations within, our region; providing a skilled, professional workforce and ground-breaking research that benefits regional industries.\n\nEstablishing the University\n\nChamberlain\u2019s impact on the city of Birmingham, beyond the establishment of the University, was immense, particularly in his improvements to living conditions and education. Thanks to Chamberlain's tireless work, the University was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900 - and with the generous donation of land and funds, the University of Birmingham was born. Since then we have led the way with research discoveries and Nobel Prize-winners.\n\nPreserving and researching our history\n\nWhile we highlight Chamberlain\u2019s legacy in terms of the impact on establishing our University as a centre of education for the many, we are committed to encouraging our expert historical researchers to reflect on our past and acknowledge contested narratives."}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Mason,_Josiah", "page_content": "\u200bMASON, Sir JOSIAH (1795\u20131881), pen manufacturer and philanthropist, second son of Josiah Mason, carpet-weaver, by his wife Elizabeth Griffiths, was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster, on 23 Feb. 1795. At the age of eight he commenced selling cakes in the streets, and afterwards fruit and vegetables, which he carried from door to door on a donkey. In 1810 he taught himself shoemaking, and was afterwards a carpenter, a blacksmith, and a house-painter. In 1814 he became a carpet-weaver, and from 1817 to 1822 he acted as manager of the imitation gold jewellery works of his uncle, Richard Griffiths of Birmingham. In 1824 he became manager for Samuel Harrison, a split-ring maker, and in 1825 he purchased his master's business for 500l. He then invented a plan for making split key-rings by machinery, which proved to be profitable. John and William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott had already commenced making steel pens, when, in 1829, Mason tried his hand at pen-making, and putting himself into communication with James Perry, stationer, of Red Lion Square, London, became Perry's pen-maker for many years. These pens bore the name of the seller and not of the manufacturer. The first order of one hundred gross of pens was sent to London 20 Nov. 1830. About twelve workpeople were employed, and one hundred weight of steel was thought a large quantity to roll for a week's consumption. In 1874 one thousand persons were employed, the quantity of steel rolled every week exceeded three tons, and on an average a million and a half of pens were produced from each ton of steel. In 1844 the Brothers Elkington took out a patent for the use of cyanides of gold and silver in electro-plating, and, requiring capital to develop the business, were joined by Mason. The electro-plated spoons, forks, and other articles soon came into use, and their popularity was much increased after the Great Exhibition of 1851. Having made a large sum of money in this connection, Mason retired from the firm in 1856. But, with Elkington, he also established copper-smelting works at Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, and became a nickel smelter, importing the ore from New Caledonia. In December 1875 he sold his pen manufactory to a limited liability company. He died at Norwood House, Erdington, near Birmingham, on 16 June 1881. He married, 18 Aug. 1817, his cousin, Anne, daughter of Richard Griffiths of Birmingham. She died 24 Feb. 1870.\n\nMason gradually accumulated upwards of half a million of money, the greater part of which he spent on charitable objects. In 1858 he founded, in Erdington village, almshouses for thirty aged women and an orphanage for fifty girls. Between 1860 and 1868 he spent 60,000l. on the erection of a new orphanage at Erdington, and then, by a deed executed in August, he transferred the edifice, together with an endowment in land and buildings valued at 200,000l., to a body of seven trustees. This orphanage is capable of receiving three hundred girls, one hundred and fifty boys, and fifty infants. On 30 Nov. \u200b1872 he was knighted by letters patent. His most important work, the Scientific College at Birmingham, which cost him 180,000l., was opened on 1 Oct. 1880, and in 1893 had 556 students. Mason placed the trustees of his college under the obligation to overhaul each department every seven years, with a view to maintaining the teachig at the highest level of scientific research. Medical classes have lately been added.\n\nA portrait of Mason by H. J. Munns is in the board-room of the college which he founded at Birmingham, and a seated statue by F. J.

He was a man of many trades, manufacturing dip pens and other goods, but his true gift was his ability to see beyond the present and into the future. Mason's foresight allowed him to establish the Mason Science College in 1875, which would eventually become the prestigious University of Birmingham.\n\nMason's journey began in 1795 in the charming town of Kidderminster, where he was born into a working-class family. Despite his humble beginnings, Mason's natural curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit set him on a path of success. He became an accomplished businessman, and his pen manufacturing business quickly rose to become one of the most successful in England. But Mason's ambition was not limited to profit; he recognized the importance of education and the role it played in shaping society.\n\nMason's belief in education was not only evident in his philanthropic endeavors, but also in his personal life. He was an avid reader and collector of books, and his extensive library was a testament to his love for knowledge. Mason's passion for learning was infectious, and he inspired those around him to strive for academic excellence.\n\nBut Mason's legacy extended far beyond his personal interests. His commitment to education and philanthropy was unparalleled, and he used his wealth to make a difference in the world. He established the Mason Orphanage in 1869, which provided housing, education, and support for disadvantaged children. Mason also donated generously to medical research and was a strong advocate for public health.\n\nMason's vision and philanthropy were recognized during his lifetime, and he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1872. His impact on society continued even after his death in 1881. The statue created in his honor by Francis John Williamson in 1885 may have been destroyed, but the memory of his legacy lives on in the Mason Science College, the University of Birmingham, and the countless lives he touched.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Josiah Mason was a remarkable man who embodied the spirit of innovation, philanthropy, and commitment to education. His legacy serves as a shining example of what can be accomplished through hard work, determination, and a commitment to making the world a better place.\n\nBiography\n\nJosiah Mason's life began in humble beginnings, as the son of a carpet-weaver, born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He was a man of many talents, trying his hand at various trades such as shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting, and carpet-weaving in his hometown. However, his thirst for success led him to move to the bustling city of Birmingham in 1816, where he found employment in the gilt-toy trade.\n\nAfter eight years of hard work, Mason set up his own business in 1824 as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, later adding the production of steel pens. Though he was the largest producer of steel pens in England, his name was not as well known as other makers due to his pens being marketed through James Perry, founder of Perry & Co., the London stationer whose name they bore.\n\nApart from his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on with other businesses such as electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making in partnership with George Elkington. Despite his commercial successes, Mason felt keenly aware of his lack of formal education, having taught himself to write when he was a shoemaker's apprentice.\n\nIn 1860, he founded a great orphanage in Erdington, near Sutton Coldfield, about 6 miles from Birmingham, which he funded with about \u00a3300,000. His munificent endowment led to him being knighted in 1872. Before this, he had already given a dispensary to his hometown and an almshouse to Erdington.\n\nMason's philanthropy did not end with the orphanage. In 1880, he opened Mason College, which was later incorporated into the University of Birmingham. The total value of his endowment was about \u00a3250,000.\n\nMason's accomplishments were celebrated even after his death. His bust, made by William Bloye from a marble statue by Francis John Williamson in 1885, stands at the center of a roundabout at the junction of Chester Road and Orphanage Road in Erdington. Though the marble statue has been destroyed, the bronze bust is still adorned with festive decorations during special occasions and seasonal holidays.\n\nIn conclusion, Josiah Mason's life is an inspiring story of a man who rose from being a street hawker to becoming a successful businessman and philanthropist. He lived a life of purpose, leaving a lasting legacy that has continued to inspire generations."}, {"url": "https://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/news/17953946.plaque-honour-kidderminster-industrialist-sir-josiah-mason/", "page_content": "An English Heritage Blue Plaque has been installed at Sir Josiah Mason\u2019s birthplace in Mill Street - now the thriving Cafe Masala restaurant.\n\nBorn into a carpet-weaving family in 1795, Mason sold cakes, fruit and vegetables on the street from the age of eight in order to buy books to educate himself.\n\nHe went on to become a leading industrialist of his time, and never forgot his humble origins, funding many projects to help the needy and setting up a college which later became Birmingham University.\n\nHe was knighted for his philanthropy in 1872.\n\nAs a teenager he tried his hand at shoemaking, baking, blacksmithing and carpet weaving but his life took off when he moved to Birmingham in 1816\n\nHe finally found his niche when he went to work for a pen manufacturer and eventually bought the business, turning it into the largest producer of pens in England.\n\nHe was also at the forefront of electro-nickel plating, copper smelting and india-rubber ring making and quickly amassed a great fortune.\n\nAs he was virtually self-educated and taught himself to write when a shoemaker's apprentice, he was keen to use his wealth to help the less fortunate and in 1860 spent \u00a3300,000 establishing an orphanage at Erdington.\n\nHe had previously given a dispensary to his home town and an almshouse to Erdington and in 1880 spent a further \u00a3250,000 creating Mason College which was later incorporated into Birmingham University.\n\nThe plaque is the second to be installed by Kidderminster Heritage Opportunities Group to promote the town\u2019s rich past.\n\nChairman Colin Hill said: \u201cWe want to make sure the lives of inspiring people like Josiah Mason are never forgotten.

It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham.\n\nIn 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Josiah Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and Comparative Anatomy.\n\nThe transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a university college was made.\n\nAs the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 it became incorporated as Mason University College on January 1, 1898, with the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain MP becoming the President of its Court of Governors.\n\nFrom http://bobmiles.bulldoghome.com/pages/bobmiles_bulldoghome_com/morejmason.htm As you might imagine, Josiah Mason became extremely wealthy and in the 1850s he turned his thoughts to philanthropy. In 1858 he opened almshouses in Station Road, Erdington, Birmingham, for spinsters and widows over 50 and orphan girls, providing accommodation in furnished rooms 14ft x 11ft with coal, gas and a small annual income provided.\n\nThis huge, Italianate building, dominated by three tall towers, cost \u00a360,000 to build and was endowed to the tune of \u00a3200,000. After differences of opinion with Anglican supporters, who were less keen than Josiah Mason on helping poor children, Josiah Mason decided to go it alone and found all this money, which amounted to a huge fortune in those days, himself. Later a new wing was added to enable a total of 500 children to be accommodated\u2026\n\nIn 1870 Josiah Mason embarked upon his greatest charitable project, drawing up trust deeds for a college of science. This being intended to equip its graduates to serve local industry, the curriculum was confined to maths, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, physiology and engineering. Literature and theology were specifically excluded.\n\nThe college, which was situated in Paradise Street in the city centre, cost Mason \u00a3170,000 in building costs and endowments. It was opened in Two of its earliest alumni - Stanley Baldwin and Arthur Neville Chamberlain were to become prime ministers.\n\nIn 1882 Mason\u2019s College absorbed the medical faculty of the older Queen\u2019s College, and in 1888 it became Mason\u2019s University College. This institution in turn became the University of Birmingham in 1900. The university having been established on a site at Edgbaston, in 1964 the old Mason\u2019s College buildings were knocked down to make way for the new central library\u2026\n\nEven after he had given almost \u00a3500,000 to his various charitable projects, his estate was still worth \u00a356,000. These were, of course, vast sums of money at the time.\n\nThe Sir Josiah Mason Trust is still active today.\n\nHere he found employment in the gilt toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens.\n\nOwing to the circumstance of his pens being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade.\n\nIn 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company.

It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Birmingham.\n\nUpon it he expended about \u00a3300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872.\n\nHe had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880 Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about \u00a3250,000.\n\nIn commemoration of him, his bust stands at the centre of the roundabout at the junction of Chester Road & Orphanage Road in Erdington. This bronze bust, erected in 1951, was cast by William Bloye from a marble statue by Francis G Williamson in 1885, which stood opposite Mason Science College in Edmund Street.\n\nOf interest:\n\nRobert Martineau (1798-1870) (Mayor of Birmingham 1846-7) brother of Harriet Martineau, father of Robert Francis Martineau, and Patron of the Birmingham Homeopathic Hospital and Dispensary (John Ryan (Ed.), The Monthly Homeopathic Review, (1863). Page 758).\n\nRobert Francis Martineau (1831-1909) was a town councillor in Birmingham, secretary of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, chairman of the Technical School committee, trustee to Mason Science College, and then a member of the council of the University of Birmingham when it evolved from Mason College).\n\nJosiah Mason had a debilitating illness (?did he meet Samuel Hahnemann there?):"}]}
