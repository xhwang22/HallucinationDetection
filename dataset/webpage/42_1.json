Mr. Dodard says he was lucky to have survived that day. He had left a meeting at the National Palace shortly before it was destroyed, and then his car nearly ran off the road as the ground beneath it shuddered and swayed.\n\n\u201cI was saved that day twice,\u201d he said. \u201cI said it must be for a reason.\u201d\n\nBut in his studio here high on a hillside above the throng of the capital below, Mr. Dodard, 59, was speaking in metaphors, the vibration coming not from the earth but the \u201csilent drumbeat communicating the energy of life.\u201d His African ancestors used the drum, but his instrument is the paintbrush.\n\n\u201cThe vibration I am looking for is one color,\u201d he said, as he touched up the blues, blacks and rusty oranges of an abstract sea goddess emerging from churning waters. \u201cOne color has the vibration of another color.

Through bold brush strokes and vibrant color combinations, graphic and visual artist Philippe Dodard, critically engages and empowers audiences throughout the world. Dodard, who was born and raised in Haiti, studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Port-au-Prince and the International School of Bordeaux, France, where he explored pedagogic graphic design. Dodard\u2019s artistic style is a direct reflection of his personal connection to various political, social, and cultural movements in Haiti.\n\nAs curator Babacar Mbow explains, \u201cThe presence of the African masks in the work of Philippe Dodard allows thinking on the richness of the intertextual relationships in African Diaspora Art. Dodard paints a mythology that is both individual and collective through the use of anaphors, for construction of an aesthetic language capable of expressing the specificity of African Diaspora culture\u201d\n\nAs his social and political reach continues to extend, Philippe Dodard will continue to use his art as a viable platform through which social awareness, growth, and progress can be accessed and appreciated. \u201cMy work builds on the socio-historical experiences of African Diaspora and indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Hundreds of thousands lost their lives and thousands more were left vulnerable. Philippe Dodard, a celebrated and admired figure in the Haitian art world and abroad, used the significant and tragic event to create art and encapsulate the emotions and memories born out of the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\u201c[At first] I could not paint because painting seemed to be a recreation to me in a period of emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to help as much as I could, those who were in severe difficulties. My home in Montagne Noire was left unscathed and thus became a host house for those who were coming to help the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt that moment, he was focused on what needed to be done to help the country get back on its feet. However, after an interview with a German television station about the loss of major art in museums and patrimonial places like the St. Trinity Church, his focus started to shift. During the interview, he showcased a piece titled \u201cThe Premonition\u201d that he began one week before the earthquake. Inspiration had returned to Dodard.\n\n\n\nThe Rising\n\nSince then, the artist has painted five emotive and powerful pieces immortalizing this traumatic moment in Haitian history. The \u201cEarthquake\u201d collection is a reflection on the toll the catastrophe took on the land and its people. There is one painting in particular, \u201cRising Souls,\u201d that Dodard believes especially captures the apocalyptic moment.\n\n\n\nDodard is not only an artist but also a man of action. He participated in an art therapy program to help those trying to cope with the trauma of the earthquake. Exploring tragedy through creative outlets can help people cope, he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe experience of art therapy with the 3,000 children of Plas Timoun, Djenny Seneque and the children from Champ de Mars Camp revealed how the expression of art can rebuild someone\u2019s broken soul and restore life with love and hope,\u201d said Dodard. \u201cChildren that could not speak after the trauma, captured the attention of others by telling their dramatic story through painting, singing, dancing, and sculpting with clay.\u201d\n\n"}, {"url": "https://haitianartsociety.org/dodard-philippe-haitian-b-1954", "page_content": "Photo by Ian Willms\n\nPhilippe Dodard, often called the Picasso of Haiti, is a Haitian graphic artist and painter.

He lives in Haiti and has always come to visit one family member or another.\n\n\"What is interesting about Miami is every time I come back, I see something new,\" says Dodard. \"And now I see that the culture is getting more and more alive everywhere.\"\n\nBy \"culture,\" he means Miami's Haitian Heritage Museum, Haitian Compass Festival, and Haitian Heritage Month in May.\n\nDodard says the growing culture here gives young Haitians exposure to life on the island. Particularly, he says, to the Haitian students who either never lived in Haiti or left long before they could remember their roots.\n\nCarol Damian, director of the Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, invited Dodard to display his work for Haitian Heritage Month. His exhibit is called \"Tradition,\" made up of large paintings and metal sculptures.\n\n\"We want people to see it and say, 'Oh, I'm coming to a Haitian show. This isn\u2019t what I expected. I expected to see small sort of naive paintings with palm trees, the beautiful landscape and the sea.\u2019 And this doesn't look like that at all,\" she says.\n\nDamian describes Dodard\u2019s art work as abstract. She says he has a \"magical way\" of transporting himself from the island and its traditions into the contemporary world.\n\n\"It's a wonderful example of the fact that Haitian art is as diverse as art anywhere,\" says Damian.\n\nDodard says his work is \"profoundly inspired from the human conditions of the Haitian people and the way they express their joy, their sorrow, their hope.\"\n\nBefore Dodard\u2019s exhibit opened, he took a walk through his display in the Frost Museum.\n\nHe stood in front of an older acrylic painting from 1996 called \"A Coeur Ouvert.\" It depicts a Haitian woman carrying a filled basket on her head. Dodard chose orange and light yellows to recreate dawn. Around 4 a.m., he often hears these women walking past his house in La Montagne Noire, or the Black Mountain.\n\n\"I believe that women in Haiti are very powerful and very strong and they carry the weight of the whole family sometimes on their shoulders,\" he says.\n\nOn the other side of the wall where the painting hangs is a metal sculpture. It\u2019s called \"In Memoriam.\" He made it for the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the United States.\n\n\"I used the tools that enslaved people used to work on the field,\" he says.\n\nOn the black metal of the tools, you can see small line markings Dodard says symbolize the whipping of enslaved people, but they also count the days of slavery.\n\n\"You see that the piece can... symbolize also the sugar cane machine,\" he says. \"When you look at this piece you can feel what they went through.\"\n\nWhen \u201cTradition\u201d opened to the public, some observers picked up on the Haitian symbols Dodard uses throughout his work.\n\n\"We memorialize dead people a lot in Haiti, so I think that's one of the ways that his paintings kinda show tribute to his culture,\" says Haitian FIU junior Phalancia Louisy.\n\nVodou symbols appear throughout Philippe Dodard's collection. So do musical representations.\n\n\"I really like what he's doing right now,\" says retired Broward professor Shirley Bayard. \"He's involving a lot of music and dances to the art.\"\n\n\"Haiti is a very beautiful country to discover, to visit and the culture is very rich there,\" says Dodard. \"And they will see that through the collection that I am presenting.\"\n\nPhilippe Dodard's \"Tradition\" will be open at the Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami, until June 29."}, {"url": "https://www.7thheavenproperties.com/magazine/issue-4/caribbean-contemporary-art-philippe-dodard-haiti/", "page_content": "On 12th January 2010 a powerful earthquake ravaged the island of Haiti, devastating lives, homes and vital infrastructure in and around the island\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince. Many of the city\u2019s key landmarks, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building and the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, were destroyed or severely damaged. During the two weeks following the earthquake a series of at least 52 aftershocks continued to rock Haiti.\n\nFor Haiti\u2019s people, the impact has continued to be felt long after the aftershocks ceased. Lives were turned upside down and priorities reassessed. Haitians and their friends on the international stage channelled their energy into rebuilding people\u2019s lives \u2013 the country\u2019s artists were no exception.\n\nDespite its poverty, Haiti has always been culturally rich, famous for its abundance of artists and vibrant art scene. The earthquake destroyed much of Haiti\u2019s cultural heritage. Irreplaceable artwork, sculptures and historical buildings lay in ruins. However, with such a rich cultural heritage and long artistic tradition to draw on, art has since been identified as one tool for building a sustainable future for Haiti. In the aftermath of the earthquake, one of Haiti\u2019s most highly regarded contemporary artists, Philippe Dodard, who has turned his hand to everything from painting and graphic design to sculpture and metal work, was called upon to play his role in rebuilding the nation.\n\nBorn in 1954, Dodard was awarded his first prize for drawing in 1966 when he was just 12 years old. Drawing led him to painting, a passion he inherited from his mother, who used to produce copies of the classical French masters. During his twenties Dodard dabbled with various styles from Impressionism to Surrealism and Cubism until he developed his own style, Aquatisme. Through fluid water-like imagery he explored \u201cthe essence of spirituality\u201d and his relationship with people and nature. As Haiti entered a period of political turmoil during the 1980\u2019s, Dodard\u2019s style evolved once again, into what has become his signature style: Use of bold black and white strokes of ink to capture the reality of life for people in Haiti and powerful symbols from the Haitian voodoo tradition. His \u201cabstract expressionist\u201d artwork, heavily influenced by African art, aims, he tells me, to \u201cspeak to your soul and appeal, not only to your sense of aesthetic, but to what humans have inside, an essential spirituality and power\u201d, like \u201cthe beat of the silent drum that you can feel inside your body and soul.\u201d\n\nTragically, the earthquake drowned out the beat of the drum for a time. Dodard told me about his personal experience of 12th January 2010.\n\n\u201cMy life changed that day\u2026 I almost died twice. I was at the Presidential Palace and I left 20 minutes before the earthquake, thanks to my agent who called me for a meeting. I was in a car very close to the Hotel Montana where all the houses collapsed completely. My phone was working \u2013 I told him \u201cjust keep on driving, don\u2019t stay there\u201d and even though the car was bumping along and he said \u201cI can\u2019t drive\u201d, I told him to \u201cjust keep on driving, go.\u201d We passed a 15 metre wall and right after that the wall collapsed on five cars behind me.\u201d\n\nThe earthquake has had a profound impact on Dodard. Ever since, he has dedicated himself to projects which use art for the benefit of Haiti and its people. He tells me \u201csince that time I have wanted my art to be useful for my community.\u201d For the entire year after the earthquake he worked with Haiti\u2019s First Lady Madame Pr\u00e9val on a project called Plas Timoun (The Children\u2019s Place), which provided a safe place for Haitian children to express how they had been affected by the earthquake through art and learn to cope with the trauma. The children who participated in the project learned not only to cope with their traumatic past but to explore their creativity and hidden talents. Dodard is now a strong advocate of the power of art and its potential to contribute to Haiti\u2019s future.\n\nBesides Plas Timoun, Dodard has worked on other projects to help rebuild the country. He played a key role in the reconstruction of the iconic Iron Market (Marche de Fer), which served as a commercial and social hub in Port-au-Prince from 1891 until the earthquake brought it down. The new market, rebuilt with as much of the original material as possible, provides a base for almost 1,000 market traders to sell their wares and stands as a potent symbol of hope for future economic and cultural regeneration.\n\nThereafter Dodard went on to work with one of the world\u2019s most famous fashion designers, who shares a passion for Haiti and the potential of its artists. On a visit to the island, Donna Karan was inspired by his artwork, writing in her blog \u201cno one captures Haiti\u2019s heart and soul like artist Philippe Dodard.\u201d Donna Karan\u2019s Spring/Summer 2012 collection featured prints inspired by Dodard\u2019s black and white paintings and were exhibited side by side in Miami\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art. He also continues to be involved in Urban Zen, the foundation she established to help develop and market the work of Haitian artisans internationally. Dodard told me about this initiative.\n\n\u201cWith Donna and her Urban Zen Foundation we are developing artisans\u2019 skills to produce very high quality products that can be sold on the international market. Working with a designer of such a high level has helped me see how Haitian art can be promoted on the international market. We are working on developing the skills of artisans, the quality of the products and developing an understanding of how to be competitive on the international market, to ensure good service and how to conduct business sustainably.\u201d\n\nDodard\u2019s current primary focus is the National School of Arts (ENARTS). In January 2012 he received a phone call from President Martelli requesting he take on the role of Director of the School. Dodard accepted. The role is in many ways a natural progression of the various projects he has been involved in up until this point. He explains his hopes for the school.\n\n\u201cIt was a school that needed to developed, to be more professional, to be equipped and develop new spaces to be built. It is a challenge for an artist. I accepted the challenge and it is my main work now\u2026 I want to make the students aware of their role in developing the country and how they can contribute to it and make a living out of that.\u201d\n\nDodard firmly believes that, with nurturing, the emerging generation of Haitian artists can make a major impact on the world stage and on Haiti\u2019s cultural and economic regeneration.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in our culture, we can really take that to sell different kinds of products and different kinds of services: performance, theatre, music, dance, fine art, fashion\u2026 The fashion industry is big \u2013 why can\u2019t Haiti be in that market? Artisans have a big role to play in that development.\u201d\n\nSo, with memories of the earthquake still raw and its impact still keenly felt, Dodard is firmly focussed on the future and the beat of the silent drum is reverberating more powerfully than ever.\n\nThis article was originally published in Issue 4 of The Caribbean Property Investor magazine.
