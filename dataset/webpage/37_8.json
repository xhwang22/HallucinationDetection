{"Jeanine Riley also appeared in the television movie Return to Green Acres (1990).": [{"url": "https://eleven-magazine.com/green-acres-cast/", "page_content": "Let\u2019s start with are any of the Green Acres cast members still alive? Well, Tom Lester was the last main member survivor up to 2020. But in April 2020, he passed away. The iconic TV show produced a lot of entertaining moments and episodes. Some say it was the prequel to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What happened to the cast of Green Acres?\n\nBefore creating Green Acres, producer Paul Henning created The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction. And then he teamed up with Jay Sommers to create Green Acres. All three shows worked together. The show ran for six seasons from 1965 to 1971. They produced a total of 170 episodes and then had a reunion movie in 1990.\n\nYou can now get the sitcom on DVD or VHS release. During its run, Green Acres received solid ratings. But the concept is what we all remember. Green Acres is a sister show to Petticoat Junction. Let\u2019s take a look at what happened to the cast of Green Acres.\n\nEddie Albert \u2013 Oliver Wendell Douglas\n\nThe American actor and activist got popular before stepping on the set of Green Acres. He received an Academy Award nomination in 1954 for his performance in Roman Holiday. He appeared in several movies before making the change to television.\n\nIn the 1950s, Albert appeared in The Fuller Brush Girl, The Sun Also Rises, Carrie, Roman Holiday, Oklahoma, Who\u2019s Got the Action, and more.\n\nDuring the 1950s, he even had his own daytime variety program, The Eddie Albert Show. And then from 1954, he hosted Saturday Night Live for some time.\n\nFollowing the end of Green Acres, he went on a small hiatus. In 1975, he accepted a big role for the crime drama Switch. That was after four years of absence from the small screen. And at the age of 69. The show had two solid seasons, but ratings started going down during the third season. CBS canceled it after 70 episodes.\n\nIn 1972, he also appeared in the movie The Heartbreak Kid. He received an Oscar nomination for that role for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nIn 1995, he got diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He exercised regularly until shortly before his death. He died of pneumonia in May 2005 at the age of 99.\n\nEva Gabor \u2013 Lisa Douglas\n\nThe Hungarian-American actress played the second half of the duo on Green Acres. That role made her famous, playing the wife of Eddie Albert\u2019s character.\n\nFollowing the end of the show, she mostly did voice work. Eva voiced Duchess in the Disney movie The Aristocats and Miss Bianca in The Rescuers. She found success as an actress in Hollywood, actress on Broadway, and as a voice actor.\n\nDisney loved her European-accented voice for a couple of projects. In 1983, she and Albert reunited on Broadway in You Can\u2019t Take It with You.\n\nEva used her popularity in Hollywood to launch her business career. In 1972, she launched her fashion collection.\n\nSome might say that her legacy is marriages and divorces. She got married five times but had no children. Gabor died in Los Angeles in July 1995 from respiratory failure and pneumonia.\n\nTom Lester \u2013 Ed Dawson\n\nUp until 2020, Tom served as the last surviving main cast member of Green Acres. But that changed in April 2020. The American actor and evangelist reached stardom as Ed Dawson on Green Acres.\n\nFun fact: he won the role because of his farming skills. He said he won the role because he knew how to milk a cow. And he was the only one with those skills. Luckily, he grew up on a farm in Mississippi, which helped him in the role.\n\nLester\u2019s character started as a recurring one but got promoted to a main one because of the show\u2019s and character\u2019s popularity. Lester also appeared in episodes of the two other CBS series, Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies. He played a part in nearly all Green Acres episodes. He took a small break during the first half of the 1967-68 season because of mononucleosis illness.\n\nAfter the show ended, he returned to his parents\u2019 house in Mississippi. He did some occasional movie or TV role. During the 1980s, he had guest roles in Little House on the Prairie, Knight Rider, Love, American Style, and some more.\n\nIn 1990, he returned to Green Acres for the reunion movie. In his later years, he traveled the nation and preached a message of faith and obedience to the people. He also participated in autograph shows and fan forums. Often, he dressed up as Ed Dawson.\n\nHe formed a great relationship with Eddie Albert, referring to him as his \u201csurrogate father\u201d. In April 2020, he died because of complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nPatt Buttram \u2013 Mr. Haney\n\nPatt got famous for his distinctive voice. In his own words, his voice never quite made it through puberty. Buttram served in the US Army Air Force during World War II. Following his return to the US, he united with Gene Autry. The two worked in more than 40 movies and television shows together.\n\nThat is how he got the part in Green Acres. Following the end of the show, he used his voice for work. Patt did voice work for Disney animated movies, including Napoleon in The Aristocats, Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood, Luke in The Rescuers. He also took part in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and provided a recurring voice for Cactus Jake in Garfield and Friends.\n\nHe died in 1994 at the age of 78 due to kidney failure. In 1988, Buttnam got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nFrank Cady \u2013 Sam Drucker\n\nFrank is an interesting actor. He studied journalism and drama at Stanford. He even worked on the campus humor magazine. After graduation, he got an apprenticeship at the Westminster Theater in London, and he appeared in four plays.\n\nHe returned to Stanford for graduate studies and a position as a teaching assistant. There he met his future wife, Shirley Katherine Jones.\n\nCady also served in the military up to his discharge in 1946. Following his discharge, he had a couple of roles in plays, leading to movie roles and television roles.\n\nGreen Acres actually served as his last role. Following the end of the television series, he also appeared in the reunion movie.\n\nAfter the end of the show, he started writing humorous poems, parodies of songs, and limericks. Frank died in June 2012, at the age of 96.\n\nAlvy Moore \u2013 Hank Kimball\n\nBefore getting a big part in Green Acres, Moore had a couple of guest and supporting roles in movies and television shows. The show helped him reach new career heights.\n\nFollowing the end of the show, he continued with guest appearances in shows like The Dick Van Dyke Show, Little House on the Prairie, and more. And then in the 1980s, he appeared in cult horror movies like Scream, Intruder, The Horror Show, and more."}, {"url": "https://people.com/tv/tom-lester-dead-parkinsons-disease-green-acres-star-81/", "page_content": "Actor Tom Lester has died.

You\u2019ll never be able to do that. You\u2019re too tall, too skinny, too ugly. You\u2019ve got a Southern accent, and you\u2019ll never make it in the motion picture business.\u201d\n\nAlbert L.

He played the salesman and con man Mr. Haney on the show!\n\nMr. Haney was always trying to find a way to make a quick buck through his various schemes. His idiosyncratic behavior made him, arguably, the most popular character from Green Acres.\n\nSo, who was the mastermind behind the role? Pat Buttram was born Maxwell Emmett Buttram in Addison, Alabama in 1915.\n\nHe was the son of a Methodist Minister and considered entering the Ministry himself. He studied at Birmingham-Southern College to pursue his future career as a Minister.\n\nBut, it was during his time in college that he acted in plays and performed on his local radio station.

He eventually became a sidekick to Gene Autry and appeared with him in over 40 films and in several episodes of Gene Autry\u2019s TV show.\n\nBut it was his role as Mr. Haney that made Pat Buttram a major star.

He was a popular character who was best known for his character Sam Drucker whom he played on Petticoat Junction, The Beverly Hillbillies, and, of course, Green Acres.\n\nSam Drucker was the owner of the local general store in Hooterville. The character was the average Joe who wanted to do good by his community. That\u2019s why, apart from his work at the general store, Sam Drucker also worked as a newspaper editor, fireman, postman, constable, notary, and a justice of the peace! Quite an impressive resume isn\u2019t it?\n\nApart from his role as Sam Drucker, Frank Cady also had a recurring role as Doc Williams on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.

Join Facts Verse to learn about the details How Each Green Acres Cast Member Died.\n\nEDDIE ALBERT AND EVA GABOR\n\nGreen Acres made many Americans romanticize of leaving the craziness of their cities to the simpler life of the countryside. It showed us the beauty of the natural landscapes, small towns, and rural culture of our country.\n\nAnd for that, we have to thank Oliver Wendell Douglas and his wife Lisa. They were played by Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor who are sadly no longer with us.\n\nEddie Albert was born in Illinois in 1906. He grew up in Minneapolis and worked as a newspaper delivery boy during his childhood. During his high school years, he joined the Drama Club and began to hone his acting skills.\n\nHowever, he decided not to pursue an acting career. He majored in business at the University of Minnesota and decided to become an entrepreneur. However, The Great Depression hit upon his graduation, and he struggled to find employment.\n\nAmong the various odd jobs he took included working as a trapeze performer and as a nightclub singer. He even later co-hosted a radio show. It was clear that his love for performing had come back and he decided to pursue an acting career.\n\nIn Green Acres, he played Oliver Wendell Douglas who was a New York lawyer who wanted to escape the madness of New York to live in the idyllic countryside. Apart from his work in Green Acres, he appeared in the TV shows Switch and Falcon Crest. He also appeared in the films Roman Holiday and The Heartbreak Kid \u2013 both which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nEddie continued to have a prolific career in film and television after his work on Green Acres. He died at age 99 in 2005.\n\nLisa Douglas was played by Eva Gabor. She was born in Hungary and emigrated to the United States after her first marriage to Swedish doctor, Eric Drimmer.\n\nLisa began her acting career with a role in the 1941 film Forced Landing. She continued to act in films and soon graduated to television as well. She even had a short-lived talk show called The Eva Gabor Show.\n\nBut it was her role in Green Acres that really resonated with audiences. She herself loved her work on the show. She later said that her experience with the show was \u201cthe best six years of my life. I adored every minute of it.\u201d\n\nIn her later career, she did voice acting for many animated films. She reunited with her Green Acres co-star Pat Buttram in both The Aristocats and The Rescuers.\n\nEva Gabor died in 1995 due to complications from pneumonia.\n\n\n\nAre you a fan of Green Acres? The show was one of the best sitcoms America has produced and one that reminds us of simpler and happier times.\n\nSo that brings up the question:\n\nDo you think that a show like Green Acres with its simplicity would work today?
