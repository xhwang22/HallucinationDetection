Swanson believed laboratories weren't the only source of new scientific discoveries. Swanson, a specialist in the relationship between natural and computer languages, thought electronic databases also held the key to medical knowledge.\n\nA trailblazing information scientist, Swanson died Nov. 18 at age 88.\n\nConcerned that excessive specialization could inhibit scientific creativity, Swanson pioneered the field of literature-based discovery, which uses existing research to create new knowledge. The three-term dean of the University\u2019s Graduate Library School and professor emeritus in the Humanities Division believed that unearthing unseen links between two distinct areas of study could yield new discoveries\u2014what he called \u201cundiscovered public knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Swanson received the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor from the American Society for Information Science & Technology, for his work.\n\nArrowsmith: \u2018An intellectual adventure\u2019\n\nSwanson famously tested his theory of undiscovered public knowledge with a 1986 paper in which he made a provocative connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud\u2019s disease, a circulatory disorder.\n\nIn a search of the Medline database, which houses millions of scientific journal abstracts, Swanson found a common thread in research on Raynaud's disease and dietary fish oil. His hunting turned up numerous articles that described high blood viscosity in patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease; in a separate search, he found a body of research that showed dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity.\n\nThe implication of bringing these two literatures together was powerful: could fish oil, Swanson wondered, be used to treat Raynaud\u2019s disease?\n\nA clinical trial three years later validated the use of fish oil for patients with Raynaud\u2019s disease. Swanson later hypothesized a connection between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency that was also subsequently supported by clinical research.\n\nSpurred on by these findings, Swanson and Neil Smalheiser of the University of Illinois at Chicago developed Arrowsmith, a piece of software that assists investigators in identifying connections between two sets of Medline articles.\n\nArrowsmith (named after the 1925 Sinclair Lewis novel) was aimed at building a \u201csystematic, computational\u201d method to find possible links among articles, Smalheiser said. \u201cThe computer was not supposed to generate discoveries, but it was supposed to identify and put together these potential assertions.\u201d\n\nThe Arrowsmith model proved influential, and the approach Swanson and Smalheiser developed has been adapted to study the correlations of genes with diseases and find possible new uses for medications.\n\nDespite the impact of Swanson and Smalheiser's work on Arrowsmith, \u201cWe never saw it as anything other than an intellectual adventure,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\n\u2018Experiments with information\u2019 not salamanders\n\n\u201cDon was doing science, without dissecting a salamander,\u201d said Mark Olsen, assistant director of the American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL) project, a major digital humanities project that was influenced by Swanson\u2019s work. \u201cHe was doing experiments with information.\u201d\n\nSwanson began his career studying physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology. He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "http://manu47.magtech.com.cn/Jwk3_jdis/EN/10.1515/jdis-2017-0019", "page_content": "Rediscovering Don Swanson: The Past, Present and Future of Literature-based Discovery\n\nNeil R.

Consistently linking to definitive version of ACM articles should reduce user confusion over article versioning.\n\nACM Author-Izer also extends ACM\u2019s reputation as an innovative \u201cGreen Path\u201d publisher, making ACM one of the first publishers of scholarly works to offer this model to its authors.\n\nTo access ACM Author-Izer, authors need to establish a free ACM web account. Should authors change institutions or sites, they can utilize the new ACM service to disable old links and re-authorize new links for free downloads from a different site.\n\nHow ACM Author-Izer Works\n\nAuthors may post ACM Author-Izer links in their own bibliographies maintained on their website and their own institution\u2019s repository. The links take visitors to your page directly to the definitive version of individual articles inside the ACM Digital Library to download these articles for free.\n\nThe Service can be applied to all the articles you have ever published with ACM.\n\nDepending on your previous activities within the ACM DL, you may need to take up to three steps to use ACM Author-Izer.\n\nFor authors who do not have a free ACM Web Account:\n\nGo to the ACM DL http://dl.acm.org/ and click SIGN UP. Once your account is established, proceed to next step.\n\nFor authors who have an ACM web account, but have not edited their ACM Author Profile page:\n\nSign in to your ACM web account and go to your Author Profile page. Click \"Add personal information\" and add photograph, homepage address, etc. Click ADD AUTHOR INFORMATION to submit change. Once you receive email notification that your changes were accepted, you may utilize ACM Author-izer.\n\nFor authors who have an account and have already edited their Profile Page:\n\nSign in to your ACM web account, go to your Author Profile page in the Digital Library, look for the ACM Author-izer link below each ACM published article, and begin the authorization process. If you have published many ACM articles, you may find a batch Authorization process useful. It is labeled: \"Export as: ACM Author-Izer Service\"\n\nACM Author-Izer also provides code snippets for authors to display download and citation statistics for each \u201cauthorized\u201d article on their personal pages. Downloads from these pages are captured in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact measurements. Consistently linking to the definitive version of ACM articles should reduce user confusion over article versioning.\n\nNote: You still retain the right to post your author-prepared preprint versions on your home pages and in your institutional repositories with DOI pointers to the definitive version permanently maintained in the ACM Digital Library. But any download of your preprint versions will not be counted in ACM usage statistics. If you use these AUTHOR-IZER links instead, usage by visitors to your page will be recorded in the ACM Digital Library and displayed on your page.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. What is ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer is a unique, link-based, self-archiving service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles for free.\n\n\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer is a unique, link-based, self-archiving service that enables ACM authors to generate and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles for free. Q. What articles are eligible for ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer can be applied to all the articles authors have ever published with ACM. It is also available to authors who will have articles published in ACM publications in the future.\n\nQ. Are there any restrictions on authors to use this service?\n\nA. No. An author does not need to subscribe to the ACM Digital Library nor even be a member of ACM.\n\nQ. What are the requirements to use this service?\n\nA. To access ACM Author-Izer, authors need to have a free ACM web account, must have an ACM Author Profile page in the Digital Library, and must take ownership of their Author Profile page.\n\nQ. What is an ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. The Author Profile Page initially collects all the professional information known about authors from the publications record as known by the ACM Digital Library. The Author Profile Page supplies a quick snapshot of an author's contribution to the field and some rudimentary measures of influence upon it. Over time, the contents of the Author Profile page may expand at the direction of the community. Please visit the ACM Author Profile documentation page for more background information on these pages.\n\nQ. How do I find my Author Profile page and take ownership?\n\nA. You will need to take the following steps: Create a free ACM Web Account Sign-In to the ACM Digital Library Find your Author Profile Page by searching the ACM Digital Library for your name Find the result you authored (where your author name is a clickable link) Click on your name to go to the Author Profile Page Click the \"Add Personal Information\" link on the Author Profile Page Wait for ACM review and approval; generally less than 24 hours\n\n\n\nQ. Why does my photo not appear?\n\nA. Make sure that the image you submit is in .jpg or .gif format and that the file name does not contain special characters\n\nQ. What if I cannot find the Add Personal Information function on my author page?\n\nA. The ACM account linked to your profile page is different than the one you are logged into. Please logout and login to the account associated with your Author Profile Page.\n\nQ. What happens if an author changes the location of his bibliography or moves to a new institution?\n\nA. Should authors change institutions or sites, they can utilize ACM Author-Izer to disable old links and re-authorize new links for free downloads from a new location.\n\nQ. What happens if an author provides a URL that redirects to the author\u2019s personal bibliography page?\n\nA. The service will not provide a free download from the ACM Digital Library. Instead the person who uses that link will simply go to the Citation Page for that article in the ACM Digital Library where the article may be accessed under the usual subscription rules.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the author provides the target page URL, any link that redirects to that target page will enable a free download from the Service.\n\nQ. What happens if the author\u2019s bibliography lives on a page with several aliases?\n\nA. Only one alias will work, whichever one is registered as the page containing the author\u2019s bibliography. ACM has no technical solution to this problem at this time.\n\nQ. Why should authors use ACM Author-Izer?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer lets visitors to authors\u2019 personal home pages download articles for no charge from the ACM Digital Library. It allows authors to dynamically display real-time download and citation statistics for each \u201cauthorized\u201d article on their personal site.\n\nQ. Does ACM Author-Izer provide benefits for authors?\n\nA. Downloads of definitive articles via Author-Izer links on the authors\u2019 personal web page are captured in official ACM statistics to more accurately reflect usage and impact measurements.\n\n\n\nAuthors who do not use ACM Author-Izer links will not have downloads from their local, personal bibliographies counted. They do, however, retain the existing right to post author-prepared preprint versions on their home pages or institutional repositories with DOI pointers to the definitive version permanently maintained in the ACM Digital Library.\n\nQ. How does ACM Author-Izer benefit the computing community?\n\nA. ACM Author-Izer expands the visibility and dissemination of the definitive version of ACM articles. It is based on ACM\u2019s strong belief that the computing community should have the widest possible access to the definitive versions of scholarly literature. By linking authors\u2019 personal bibliography with the ACM Digital Library, user confusion over article versioning should be reduced over time.\n\n\n\nIn making ACM Author-Izer a free service to both authors and visitors to their websites, ACM is emphasizing its continuing commitment to the interests of its authors and to the computing community in ways that are consistent with its existing subscription-based access model.\n\nQ. Why can\u2019t I find my most recent publication in my ACM Author Profile Page?\n\nA. There is a time delay between publication and the process which associates that publication with an Author Profile Page. Right now, that process usually takes 4-8 weeks."}, {"url": "https://doaj.org/article/b17c585f0fe546e6bb0ad5d101af289b", "page_content": "Abstract\n\nRead online\n\nThe late Don R.

In this informal essay, I will give my personal perspective on Don\u2019s contributions to science, and outline some current and future directions in literature-based discovery that are rooted in concepts that he developed.\n\nKeywords"}, {"url": "https://www.expert.ai/blog/text-mining-research-papers/", "page_content": "Luca Scagliarini - 17 February 2017\n\nImproving our ability to find the right information at the right time is important for every business and every user. The constant growth in unstructured information makes text mining applications increasingly important in achieving this goal. In looking ahead to see how text mining will solve some of our biggest challenges in extracting the value from large and noisy volumes of unstructured data, I thought I\u2019d share some of the text mining research papers that I\u2019ve recently come across. From clustering, problems related to entities and more, these text mining research papers focus on certain techniques, and may prove helpful for others facing similar issues.\n\nStarting from categorization and classification, \u201cSupport-vector networks,\u201d an older but still relevant a text mining research paper by Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik is worth mentioning. Another paper on the same topic is \u201cText categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features\u201d by Thorsten Joachims.\n\nMoving on to clustering, the text mining research paper \u201cA comparison of document clustering techniques\u201d by Michael Steinbach, George Karypis and Vipin Kumar from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Minnesota provides the foundation for understanding how clustering algorithms work.\n\nInformation scientist Don R. Swanson is known as one of the most respected scholars in text mining. His text mining papers are relevant for understanding the big picture evolution of the topic. Here is a collection of some of his work: (Don R Swanson \u2013 Google Scholar).\n\nAmong the text mining research papers focusing on the problem of entity linking, in other words linking entities in a document to the entities in the Wikipedia page, for example, I found a valuable resource in Ji Heng. Heng is an Associate Professor, Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. You can take a look at\n\nseveral papers that are available on her website(publication) by searching for entity linking.\n\nIt is also worth to mention the text mining research paper \u201cLocal and Global Algorithms for Disambiguation to Wikipedia\u201d. This paper is authored by Lev Ratinov, Dan Roth, Doug Downey and Mike Anderson from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and focuses on entity linking as an optimization problem.\n\nFinally, the last text mining research paper that I will include on entity linking is \u201cA Neighborhood Relevance Model for Entity Linking\u201d by Jeffrey Dalton and Laura Dietz from the University of Massachusetts. This paper focuses on the extremely important aspect of disambiguating context in information.\n\nThe last text mining technique that I would reference is about pure extraction. This topic offers many interesting text mining research papers for this area. For specific reasons related to the development of entity recognition in different languages, I would recommend the following paper about name recognition for Arabic, which is a real challenge: \u201cA Rule Based Persons Names Arabic Extraction System,\u201d is authored by Ali Elsebai and Farid Meziane from the University of Salford and Fatma Zohra Belkredim from the Universitie Hassiba Ben Bouali in Chlef, Algeria.\n\nIn addition, to the above text mining research papers, I would like to suggest a few books that I covered in a previous post:"}], "Don R.

He received his MA in physics from Rice University in 1947 and his PhD, also in physics, from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952.\n\nEven in their early days, computers were a source of fascination for Swanson. \u201cI think he was always dazzled by the idea of the computer,\u201d said his wife, Patricia Swanson.\n\nSwanson worked as a computer systems analyst at Hughes Research & Development and research scientist at Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. & TRW, Inc., before he joined the UChicago faculty in 1963 as dean of the Graduate Library School (which closed in 1990). Swanson's background as a physical scientist set him apart from the seven previous deans of the school, who represented a variety of other disciplines.\n\nAt the GLS, Swanson initially focused on computer-aided information retrieval, an entirely new area of study at the time.\n\n\u201cAt the time Don began working on it, people simply couldn\u2019t imagine that you could retrieve information with a computer,\u201d said his colleague Abe Bookstein, professor emeritus in the Humanities. \u201cIn a field that was very qualitative, Don was instrumental in introducing quantitative formal techniques.\u201d\n\nHe was also a rigorous and encouraging teacher, according to his former GLS student Charles Blair, who remembered Swanson for his \u201cvery clean, organized and methodical approach to his subject.\u201d\n\nSwanson happily lent his expertise to colleagues around the University. In the early days of the ARTFL project, Prof. Robert Morrissey came to Swanson for advice on how to handle organization of the massive new database. \u201cHe told me, \u2018What this project needs is a little sunshine and water,\u201d remembered Morrissey, the Benjamin Franklin Professor of French Literature and director of ARTFL. \u201cHe was very generous with his time.\u201d\n\nThat generosity was not unusual for Swanson, according to Smalheiser\u2014Swanson went \u201cout of his way to be nice and encouraging,\u201d Smalheiser said.\n\nSwanson\u2019s quiet manner belied a mischievous sense of humor that led him to write satiric articles, for example, \u201cNew Horizons in Psychoanalysis: Treatment of Necrosistic Personality Disorders,\u201d in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine (1986).\n\nNot only intellectually witty but also physically fit, Swanson was an avid runner who completed a half-marathon at the age of 80.\n\nBut his work was by far his greatest passion, according to Patricia Swanson. \u201cHe was always trying to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Swanson is survived by his son, Richard B. Swanson; and his daughter, Judith A. Swanson, PhD\u201987. Another son, Douglas A. Swanson, died in 2004.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Swanson\u2019s honor may be made to the University of Chicago Library, the Nature Conservancy or the Heritage Foundation."}, {"url": "http://manu47.magtech.com.cn/Jwk3_jdis/EN/10.1515/jdis-2017-0019", "page_content": "Rediscovering Don Swanson: The Past, Present and Future of Literature-based Discovery\n\nNeil R.

Hence it is clear that manual intervention based on human knowledge is required to perfect algorithmic results. ACM is meeting this challenge, continuing to work to improve the automated merges by tweaking the weighting of the evidence in light of experience.\n\nThe more conservative the merging algorithms, the more bits of evidence are required before a merge is made, resulting in greater precision but lower recall of works for a given Author Profile. Many bibliographic records have only author initials. Many names lack affiliations. With very common family names, typical in Asia, more liberal algorithms result in mistaken merges.\n\nACM will expand this edit facility to accommodate more types of data and facilitate ease of community participation with appropriate safeguards. In particular, authors or members of the community will be able to indicate works in their profile that do not belong there and merge others that do belong but are currently missing.\n\nA direct search interface for Author Profiles will be built.\n\nAn institutional view of works emerging from their faculty and researchers will be provided along with a relevant set of metrics.\n\nIt is possible, too, that the Author Profile page may evolve to allow interested authors to upload unpublished professional materials to an area available for search and free educational use, but distinct from the ACM Digital Library proper.

He worked as a physicist at various laboratories until 1963, when he was made a professor and served as dean of the Graduate School of Library Science at the University of Chicago until 1972 and again from 1977 to 1979 and 1987 to 1989.\n\nIn 2000, he was awarded the ASIST Award of Merit, the highest honor of the society, for his \"lifetime achievements in research and scholarship.\"[2]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 2 Views: 1 538 012 3 565 593\n\nNick Offerman Answers Woodworking Questions From Twitter | Tech Support | WIRED\n\nThe basics on a Speed square Transcription\n\nReferences\n\nWorks\n\n1986a : \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" Library Quarterly 56(2): 103\u2013118.\n\n: \"Undiscovered public knowledge.\" 56(2): 103\u2013118. 1986b : \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 30(1): 7\u201318.\n\n: \"Fish oil, Raynaud's syndrome, and undiscovered public knowledge.\" 30(1): 7\u201318. 1987 : \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 38(4): 228\u2013233.\n\n: \"Two medical literatures that are logically but not bibliographically connected.\" 38(4): 228\u2013233. 1988 : \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 31(4): 526\u2013557.\n\n: \"Migraine and magnesium: Eleven neglected connections.\" 31(4): 526\u2013557. 1989a : \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 356\u2013358.\n\n: \"Online search for logically-related noninteractive medical literature: A systematic trial-and-error strategy.\" 40: 356\u2013358. 1989b : \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" Journal of the American Society of Information Science 40: 432\u2013435.\n\n: \"A second example of mutually-isolated medical literatures related by implicit, unnoticed connections.\" 40: 432\u2013435. 1990a : \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 33 (1990): 157\u2013186.\n\n: \"Somatomedin C and arginine: Implicit connections between mutually-isolated literatures,\" 33 (1990): 157\u2013186. 1990b : \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" bulletin of the Medical Library Association 78(1) 29\u201337.\n\n: \"Medical literature as a potential source of new knowledge.\" 78(1) 29\u201337. 1990c : \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" Information Processing & Management 26(1): 9\u201316.\n\n: \"Integrative mechanisms in the growth of knowledge: A legacy of Manfred Kochen.\" 26(1): 9\u201316. 1990d : \"The absence of co-citation as a clue to undiscovered causal connections.\" In: C.
