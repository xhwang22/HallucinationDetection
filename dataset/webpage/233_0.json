This is especially because there could be some key changes in the team\u2019s midfield options, with Felipe Anderson\u2019s future in question and Jesse Lingard\u2018s return to West Ham looking uncertain.\n\nOne player that could ease West Ham\u2019s midfield worries is Fenerbah\u00e7e midfielder Ferdi Kadioglu. The 21-year-old Dutch international has impressed Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2019s fans and is building a reputation for being a hard-working, interdependent team player.\n\nKadioglu, born in the Netherlands to a Turkish father and a Dutch-Canadian mother, joined Fenerbah\u00e7e from NEC Nijmegen in 2018. Then-manager Phillip Cocu saw a lot of potential in Kadoiglu\u2019s style of play, referring to him as a \u201cyoung, talented and very high potential player\u201d in December 2019.\n\nKadioglu has established himself as a regular starter for Fenerbah\u00e7e thanks to Cocu\u2019s encouragement. Although Kadioglu does not have consistent goalscoring attributes, his work with the ball and passing makes him a flexible attacker.\n\nHe can be deployed as either an attacking midfielder or a winger because of his ability to adapt to different roles, but he plays predominantly as a winger for Fenerbah\u00e7e. He is known for his long passing, movement on and off the ball, and dribbles efficiently.\n\nKadoiglu notices gaps in the attacking zone and can quickly move into position to either create a chance or make a forward pass. Kadioglu\u2019s dribbling ability and pinpoint passing would make him a major improvement on Andriy Yarmolenko, given that the latter\u2019s constant stopovers and hesitant movement have frustrated West Ham fans.\n\nMoreover, Kadioglu would suit David Moyes\u2019 ethos of prioritizing hard work over flair. This is also because his hard work matches his existing talent, and the high intensity of the Premier League will help him add more variety to his own playing style. In the question of needed depth, this guy is it for the Hammers in 2021/22."}, {"url": "https://dictionary.sensagent.com/G%C3%BCnd%C3%BCz%20K%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7/en-en/", "page_content": "\"Baba\" G\u00fcnd\u00fcz K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 (1919\u20131980) was a Turkish football player and coach.
