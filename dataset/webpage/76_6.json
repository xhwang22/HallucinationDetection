He studied for his PhD in Epidemiology on the INTERSALT Study under the mentorship of Professor Geoffrey Rose. He remained at the London School working as a lecturer, and subsequently as senior lecturer and reader in epidemiology before being appointed as Head of the Environmental Epidemiology Unit at LSHTM 1990. In 1995 he was appointed to the Chair in Epidemiology and Public Health Medicine at Imperial College London. Since then he has managed the transformation of the Department of Public Health into the present Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the School of Public Health. The Department has expanded significantly during recent years to encompass a wide-ranging programme of health research and extensive collaborations with national and international research groups, hosting both honorary and visiting staff. Paul Elliott is also Director of the MRC Centre for Environment and Health, which was launched in 2009 (as the MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health in collaboration with King's College London) and forms a major part of the Department. The UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) is also based in the department.

Founded in 1917, we stand candidates at elections at all levels of government \u2013 including local councillors, metro mayors, MPs, Members of Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly Members. We have 26 MPs \u2013 making us the 4th largest party in Parliament. We also have over 1,300 councillors all across Britain.\n\nWait, you have 26 MPs? 1,300 councillors? How haven\u2019t I heard of you?\n\nSince 1927, we have had an electoral agreement with Labour, meaning we only stand Labour and Co-operative joint candidates. Some \u2018Co-operators\u2019 you might recognise are Labour Party Chair Anneliese Dodds MP, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham or the campaigning MP Stella Creasy.\n\nOur candidates come from across the broad church of the Labour Party, united by their belief in the co-operative values of sharing wealth and power. Co-op MPs have served on every Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet for a generation.\n\nIsn\u2019t the Co-op a supermarket?\n\nWe aren\u2019t the same as the Co-op supermarkets on your high street \u2013 but interestingly they played a role in starting the Party over a century ago and continue to support us. Like the Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement, we were founded in 1917 by the co-operative movement \u2013 who wanted representation and to defend itself against a government dominated by private business interests.\n\nCo-operative principles don't stop at the shopfront. As co-operators, we believe that the principles that lie behind successful co-operatives \u2013 democratic control by customers and workers, and a fair share of the wealth we create together \u2013 ought to extend to the wider economy and our society.\n\nSo what\u2019s a co-operative then?\n\nA co-operative is a business \u2013 but instead of being owned by private shareholders it is owned and run jointly by its members. Members might be employees, customers, or members of the local community. Consumers owning the shops they buy from. Parents who run their own nursery. Fans who own their local football club. Each member, regardless of their stake, has an equal vote, and decisions are made democratically.\n\nWhat does the Co-operative Party stand for?\n\nWe believe in an economy where wealth and power are shared. This means a radical shake up of the way our economy functions and how it shares its rewards. We think that workers, not private shareholders, should own the businesses they work in \u2013 so that they have a vote on how it is run and a share in its profits.\n\nOur values and principles \u2013 like democracy, equality and community \u2013 shape our policies. Our policy platform includes:\n\nRebalance Britain's economy by doubling the size of the co-operative sector\n\nTackling the climate emergency with a Co-operative Green New Deal\n\nlntroducing a Right to Food so nobody goes hungry\n\nTaking utilities like water and energy into democratic public ownership\n\nEnsuring business pay their fair share of tax\n\nSupporting fan-owned football clubs\n\nExpanding community energy\n\nWhat if I\u2019m already a supporter or member of the Labour Party? Why should I support the Co-operative Party as well?\n\nThis is an exciting time for the Co-operative Party. Over the past 18 months we elected a record number of Councillors, Mayors, MSs, MSPs and London Assembly members \u2013 winning seats from Chipping Norton to Preston and from the Welsh valleys to the Scottish Highlands.\n\nIn a time of increasing polarisation and ill-will in politics, co-operators are getting stuck in and transforming communities from the bottom up. If you\u2019re looking for a radical, practical political movement with ideas and energy \u2013 that\u2019s us. Working in partnership, the Co-op Party and the Labour Party are bringing together the best of our practical traditions of co-operation and trade unionism to change Britain for the better.\n\nAnd what if I don\u2019t support the Labour Party at all?\n\nThe Co-operative Party is an independent political party with our own NEC, membership and policy platform. We\u2019re a grassroots party that is making change on the ground all over the country, running successful campaigns on everything from safer shopworkers to food justice at local, regional and national levels.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to support or be a member of the Labour Party to be a supporter or member of the Co-operative Party. However, because of our electoral agreement, you cannot join the Co-operative Party if you are a member of a political party other than the Labour Party or SDLP.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m on board \u2013 how can I keep supporting your campaigns?\n\nThe best way of keeping up to date with our campaigns is to sign up to our email updates. You can do that here.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to financially support our amazing campaigns by becoming a member, you can join now from just \u00a32.25 a month. You\u2019ll be part of a movement with historic roots, be able to join to local parties, and have an opportunity to shape the national agenda through campaigns and success in the wider Labour movement."}, {"url": "https://party.coop/2022/11/10/a-labour-government-will-unlock-the-full-potential-of-the-co-operative-sector/", "page_content": "Britain has a long tradition of fostering the principles of co-operation and mutual support, and the histories of the co-operative movement and the Labour Party in this country are closely entwined.\n\nThis relationship was institutionalised in 1927, when the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party entered an electoral agreement to stand joint candidates in elections. To this day, both parties continue to make the case for co-operatives, friendly and mutual societies, and as a long-standing Co-operative Party member I have always been proud to work with the Party to promote the co-operative businesses which are leading the way in improving equality and productivity at work.\n\nAs Shadow City Minister, I have had the privilege of meeting many of the inspiring people working in co-operatives and mutuals, such as building societies and credit unions, in the UK\u2019s financial services sector. These British businesses play such an important role in supporting working people across the country to access affordable finance and gain greater control over their lives.\n\nBuilding societies provide people with a low risk, member focused banking alternative, and research has shown that trust in building societies is consistently high. Building societies are also typically well capitalised, making the sector more resilient to financial shocks and better able to lend and plan for the long-term.\n\nWhile credit unions serve an extraordinary 1.9 million members and 2.1 million depositors across the UK. There is currently around \u00a31.7 billion in loans to credit union members, providing a crucial lifeline to the most financially vulnerable in society and preventing people from turning to loan-sharks and high interest loans.\n\nWith the right support, the co-operative sector has the potential to provide new ideas and the solutions to many of the crises and challenges we face as a country, such as the cost of living crisis or climate change.\n\nBut despite the distinctly British character and history of mutually and co-operatively owned companies, and the important role they play in promoting financial responsibility and resilience among their members, the sector\u2019s needs have too often been ignored by this Conservative Government.\n\nWe have seen numerous building societies threatened with demutualisation in recent years, while the number of mutual credit unions has plummeted by more than 20% since 2016. Unlike the USA and many other European countries, the UK is also uniquely lacking in mutually or co-operatively owned regional banks, which could play a crucial in providing the affordable credit that small and medium sized businesses need to reach net zero.\n\nIt has been ordinary families who have paid the price, with many forced into the arms of unethical lenders. This is only going to get worse as the Conservative\u2019s cost-of-living crisis deepens.\n\nThis is because credit unions, building societies and co-operative banks are working within an outdated regulatory regime \u2013 leaving them unable to compete on a level playing field with standard providers.\n\nIt\u2019s time to radically reform the rules governing the sector to give greater flexibility and allow mutuals and co-operative financial services to grow.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Bill currently passing through the House of Commons does contain some welcome and long overdue provisions, such as enabling credit unions to offer a wider range of products. But the Treasury\u2019s plans for the wider sector have lacked ambition.\n\nThat\u2019s why I have tabled amendments to the Bill which would require the regulators \u2013 the FCA and PRA \u2013 to have an explicit remit to report on how they\u2019ve considered specific business models, including mutuals and co-operatives, to ensure they\u2019re given parity of esteem with standard providers.\n\nIf the Government is serious about supporting people to gain greater control of their personal finances, and supporting co-operatives to grow and reach their full potential, they should support my amendments. But so far, the Conservatives have rejected my attempts to engage with them on this important issue.\n\nThe Labour Party and the co-operative movement share a commitment to building a society in which power and wealth are fairly shared. That is why the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party has agreed an important ambition for government \u2013 we will double the size of the co-operative and mutual sector in the UK.\n\nOnly a Labour Government, made up of Labour and Co-operative Party MPs, can deliver on building the stronger, greener and fairer economy that Britain so desperately needs."}, {"url": "https://vmbuildingsociety.myvmgroup.com/leadership-team/paul-elliott/", "page_content": "Paul is a Results Focused member of the VM\u2019s Executive Leadership team, having been promoted to the Group Leadership post in January 2022.

I actually wanted to go into the Navy when I was young, so I did all my training courses and then the Falklands War happened. I asked myself, did I really want to be in the bottom of a boat cooking when it's struck by something.\n\nThen I thought I would join the RAF, but I was rejected becauseI had asthma as a child. I was fit and I used to do a lot of rugby, but because you have been classified as asthmatic, they won't touch you at all. It was upsetting, but then I had the chance to work as a chef. I wanted to go into the services as a youngster, but nowI have ended up in a services club.\n\nIt doesn't bother me that as a club chef I can't really get the same accolades and awards as restaurant chefs because I have had a varied career. I have managed a three-rosette restaurant and earned a Michelin Bib Gourmand in my own right. I have done development work and some of the products I developed are still on shelves today. Here, I get my personal satisfaction from the people we serve.\n\nIn my first session at the Ritz I was on the garnish section and I stuck a plastic ladle into the fryer. I got the bollocking of a lifetime and had to clean the fryer out, right in the middle of service. You learn quickly. I once worked at a place in Hertfordshire where on my first day I spent four hours cooking brunoise carrots. I thought I was the bee's knees because I was out of college and had done some time at the Ritz. The chef came to me and he said, \"What the bleep have you done?! What a load of bleep bleep bleep.\" He punched me to the floor then took four hours' worth of brunoise carrots and threw them in the bin.\n\nWe don't do that sort of beasting in our kitchens. We try to teach chefs the lessons I have learned the hard way. You need to explain to your younger chefs the reason for something before you can expect them to do it.\n\n\"Cook to your client base. If you ever want to do your own food, buy your own restaurant.\" That's what one of my old bosses used to tell me and it's very true. A lot of young chefs will use places that they work in as their own platform. But as you get older you will understand that you have to cook to your client base.\n\nHere at the Rag, they wantedto bring modern food into the club, which is sustainable with a good profit margin, but also to bring the glamour and the luxury of the Ritz.\n\nI would recommend this as a line of work for any chef so long as you get a good employer. Not all clubs are the same. The Army and Navy Club really sets itself out against all of them. The other clubs look at us for what we are doing, how the business runs and how the employer treats the employees.\n\nI have been here two years and I am still as passionate now about my food as I was when I won a Michelin Bib Gourmand.

The meeting was said to be professionally conducted but with feelings running high at times as members argued that the mutual group\u2019s democratic principles were at risk.\n\n\n\nThe members\u2019 main complaint was about the selection of candidates for election to the board. On Thursday, Co-op management announced three candidates for the three director posts: former Labour cabinet minister Hazel Blears; Ruth Spellman, chief executive of the Workers\u2019 Educational Association; and Paul Chandler, former CEO of the fair trade group Traidcraft.\n\nThe group and its recruitment firm rejected three other candidates from a shortlist of six, including Dame Pauline Green, the president of the International Co-operative Alliance, and Nick Eyre, the Co-op\u2019s former group secretary.\n\nOn Saturday, the council told the group to reinstate the three candidates and called for a fourth member-elected board director to ensure greater representation of members.\n\nA member of the council said: \u201cMembers have asked the board to go back to that decision to reinstate all six people on to the ballot paper to make sure members have the say they were meant to have,\u201d said a member who attended the meeting.\n\n\n\nThe decision to present members with just three candidates for three positions was criticised last week by Sir Graham Melmoth, the respected former Co-op boss. Melmoth pointed out that vetoing Green and Eyre meant the board election would not be contested and claimed the three candidates selected had tenuous links to the Co-op. Each candidate needs a majority of votes to be elected.\n\nMembers also resisted an attempt by the Co-op Group to take a historic step back from direct involvement in politics, by calling on management to withdraw a motion concerning contributions to political parties.\n\nThat motion asks whether the Co-op should donate to parties, whether it should fund the Co-operative party and whether it should donate to various parties.\n\nFor the first time in almost a century, the board failed to back a members\u2019 motion endorsing up to \u00a31m of funding for the Co-operative party.\n\nThe members\u2019 council argued that the board\u2019s three questions were incoherent and unhelpful. They had previously called for continued funding to the Co-operative party \u2013 which is allied with Labour and had 30 MPs in the last parliament.\n\nThe council also asked the group to withdraw its revised description of the Co-op\u2019s purpose in society: \u201cChampioning a better way of doing business, for you and your communities.\u201d The council\u2019s requests are not binding but the board has an obligation to try to reach agreement.\n\n\n\nLeighton, the former Royal Mail chairman who joined the Co-op in February, attended the meeting on Friday but was not there when the council made its demands. Pennycook and other officials were asked to leave the room while the council decided on its requests on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe membership council will be revamped after the AGM. A transitional council was put in place to oversee governance changes recommended by Lord Myners, the former City minister, last year.\n\nVeteran Co-op members were unhappy about Myners\u2019 changes but accepted most of them as a way to draw a line under the turmoil created by the near-implosion of the Co-op Bank in 2013.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Leighton said: \u201cThe Co-operative Group operates under a unique governance model which ensures members have a direct say in the group\u2019s future. After the reforms of last year, this remains a fledgling democracy and we are working to ensure it becomes firmly established so it can operate in the interests of all our members, colleagues and customers whilst avoiding the catastrophic events of our recent past.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.policyforum.labour.org.uk/about/npf/chris-bain", "page_content": "Elected and party organisation\n\nCo-operative Party\n\nChris has been a member of the Labour Party and committed Trade Unionist for more than 35 years.
