In their first game, they defeated the St. Louis Hawks 97-84 on Dec. 26, 1964 in what became the first of 14 straight wins with the new starting five (Boston had won its two previous games prior to inserting Naulls into the starting five). That helped set the tone for the franchise\u2019s 7th straight NBA title, and 8th overall.\n\nIn addition to Naulls, the starting five for that game included Satch Sanders, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones and Bill Russell \u2013 all Naismith Memorial Hall of Famers in addition to being the only black players on the Celtics roster at that time.\n\nWhile there was certainly a heightened sense of social consciousness throughout the country at that time, Red Auerbach was a coach consumed by winning and because of that, didn\u2019t initially recognize the historical significance of putting Naulls in with the first unit.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I had no idea that I started five black players until a writer pointed it out to me a few weeks later,\u201d Auerbach said at the time. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make a difference to me what color any of my players were. I was putting the five best players out on the court so that we could win.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the first all-Black starting five was just part of the history-making narrative surrounding Naulls.\n\nHe spent his first seven seasons with the New York Knicks and served as a team captain for the last three. Naulls was the first Black captain in New York Knicks history and one of the first for any major professional sports team.\n\nDuring his career, the 6-foot-6 Naulls, known for his one-handed outside shot, was a four-time All-Star (1958; 1960-1962) who was a career 15.8 points per game scorer who left New York as one of the franchise\u2019s all-time leader scorers.\n\nSensing he could be of some help to the Boston Celtics in their quest to win yet another championship, Auerbach convinced Naulls to join forces with the Celtics.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the famous guys Red (Auerbach) enticed to come out of retirement,\u201d Heinsohn said.\n\nUpon retirement, the former UCLA star went into real estate and commercial development in addition to activating several community-based initiatives designed to aid youth.\n\nThat would serve as a precursor to his true calling as a pastor.\n\n\u201cThe main factors contributing to my success have been, first, the wisdom of my parents in seeing that I received a disciplined Christian upbringing and the best education available and, second, my good fortune in having achieved a high and rare degree of success in athletics,\u201d Naulls said in a curriculum vita obtained by NBC Sports Boston. \u201cAs an adult, I can reflect back and realize how blessed I am to have escaped the perpetuation of mediocrity foisted upon most African-American people. Even though I have had the opportunity of meeting and associating with the \u201celite\u201d of our society, I have always understood that my successes were a deviation from the norm, and I have never stopped agonizing over the plight of poor, underprivileged people who have not experienced the benefits of a mother\u2019s unselfish sacrifice and vision to equip her children.\n\nNaulls added, \u201cThe insecurities that I felt growing up in a disadvantaged community I have never\n\nforgotten. These memories have directly influenced my life\u2019s commitment to serve young people of all ethnic backgrounds who would commit themselves to the pursuit of Truth and excellence. I was taught very early the value of a positive attitude about working toward becoming the best that I could be. Young people are our most valuable resource, and my life\u2019s goal is to bring together prepared and committed teachers who will share their specific knowledge and wisdom with youth who commit themselves to preparing to become positive and productive members of our society.\u201d\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

A true pioneer, Willie was the first African-American team captain in franchise history and currently 13th on the all-time Knicks scoring list. pic.twitter.com/hv6YsiQ4ER \u2014 NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) November 25, 2018\n\nHis Path To The Knicks\n\nNaulls was born in Dallas, Texas in 1934, but before long his family moved to San Pedro, California in order to seek a more diverse and welcoming community. He loved Major League Baseball as a child and in high school was originally on track to play baseball, but the 6\u20196\u201d, 225-pound athlete wound up turning to basketball and becoming an All-American at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nNaulls was a second round draft pick of the St. Louis Hawks in 1956, selected in a draft class that included Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor and Tommy Heinsohn. Naulls was not necessarily a fan of the team that took him, seeing as they were stationed in the still-segregated Southern U.S., according to an interview he gave to NBA.com in December 2015.\n\n\u201cMy parents took us out of the South to experience the freedom of competition and of choice of the integrating West Coast,\u201d Naulls said in the interview. \u201cTo go to St. Louis and its segregated hotels, restaurants, cabs, living districts and attitude was a cultural shock. As a 21-year-old man, I had rarely experienced that since I was eight years old.\u201d\n\nLucky for Naulls, his stay in St. Louis did not last long; on December 10th, 1956, only 19 games into his rookie season, Naulls was traded to the Knicks.\n\nNaulls\u2019 Career As A \u2018Bocker\n\nNaulls quickly carved out a significant role for himself with the Knicks, averaging 18.1 points and 11.8 rebounds in his first full season with the team and earning a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team. He was one of only three black players selected as All-Stars that season, the others being Russell and Maurice Stokes.\n\nDuring the roughly seven seasons he was with the Knicks, Naulls made four All-Star teams, and his overall Knicks stats stand at 19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds a game. He averaged more than 20 points a game three times for the Knicks, including during the 1961-62 season when he put up 25 points and 11.6 rebounds per contest.\n\nThe Knicks made the playoffs only once during Naulls\u2019 tenure, in 1959, when the team\u2019s 40-32 record was good for second place in the East. The Knicks lost in the division semifinals that year to the Syracuse Nationals, two games to none.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Naulls was named Knicks\u2019 captain, becoming the first African-American athlete to earn the title for any team in any of the major American sports.\n\nOn March 2, 1962, Naulls posted 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 169-147 loss to the Philadelphia Warriors. Naulls\u2019 strong showing represented the seventh straight game he had scored 30 or more points, setting a franchise record that wouldn\u2019t be broken for almost five decades (Amar\u2019e Stoudemire scored 30 or more in nine consecutive games in 2010). Naulls\u2019 record-setting night against the Warriors was overshadowed by Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points and grabbed 25 boards.\n\nToday, Naulls sits at 13th on the Knicks all-time scoring list, one spot behind John Starks and just ahead of Gerald Wilkins. His 8,318 points as a Knick are more than than the likes of Bernard King, Latrell Sprewell and Stephon Marbury, among others big names. His 5,015 rebounds is good for 5th on the Knicks all-time rebounds list, behind only Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, Charles Oakley and Harry Gallatin.\n\nHis Post-Knicks Career as a Champion\n\nIn December 1962, Naulls was traded to the San Francisco Warriors, and in September 1963 he was traded again, this time to a Boston Celtics team that was in the middle of an absolutely dominant stretch of basketball that included 11 championships between 1957 and 1969.\n\nNaulls notched three titles as a member of the Celtics, in 1964, 1965 and 1966. He retired from the NBA in 1966.\n\nIn 1964, Naulls was part of the NBA\u2019s first all-black starting lineup with the Celtics, in a game that was ironically played against his former team, the St. Louis Hawks\n\nFor his career, Naulls averaged 15.8 points and 9.1 rebounds a game. His career field goal percentage was 40.6 percent, and he shot free throws at a clip of 81.2 percent.\n\nLife After The NBA\n\nNaulls focused on business once his NBA career was over, and his original pursuits included owning an auto dealership in Los Angeles and investing in \u201centerprises that he felt could provide jobs in black communities,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nIn 1993, he formed Willie Naulls Ministries, a non-profit venture that aims to \u201cequip believers to testify the Truth of how to live victoriously in God\u2019s Kingdom here on earth by teaching Biblically based principles for personal growth of spirit, soul, and body,\u201d according to its website.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, and six grandchildren, along with a legion of Knicks fans who appreciate his contributions to both the team and the world of sports at large.

He established UCLA's single-game rebounding record, totaling 28 rebounds in a game against Arizona State on Jan. 28, 1956. His record still stands today.\n\n\n\nThrough three varsity seasons at UCLA, Naulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. He secured All-America honors after his senior season.\n\n\n\nWhen he had finished playing at UCLA, Naulls had established the program's all-time scoring record (1,225 points in three seasons). He currently ranks No. 40 on the Bruins' all-time scoring list and No. 7 on the all-time rebounds list. Naulls led the Bruins in rebounding in each of his three seasons on the varsity team.\n\n\n\nNaulls was an all-conference selection (Pacific Coast Conference) in 1955 and 1956.\n\n\n\nAfter a remarkable collegiate career, Naulls was selected in the second round of the NBA Draft by the St. Louis Hawks. He enjoyed a 10-year NBA career, competing for St. Louis, the New York Knicks, the San Francisco Warriors and the Boston Celtics. He became the first former UCLA player to lead his team to the NBA Finals. Boston advanced to the finals and won the NBA Championship in 1964, 1965 and 1966 (Naulls' final three NBA seasons).\n\n\n\nNaulls, along with Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Tom Sanders, became the first all-African-American starting team in the history of integrated professional sports in Dec. 1964, when Naulls replaced injured Tom Heinsohn in the starting lineup.\n\n\n\nChoosing to retire from the NBA after leading Boston to the 1966 NBA Championship, Naulls returned to Los Angeles and completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA. Naulls was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, the NCAA honored Naulls with the Silver Anniversary Award, bestowed upon five former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their collegiate eligibility. While the award factors in an individual's athletic accomplishments, the Silver Anniversary Award also uses professional accomplishments and philanthropic work as criteria.\n\n\n\nAfter his basketball career had ended, Naulls worked with youth for over five decades. He served young people growing up in communities similar to those of his childhood in San Pedro and Watts and founded a non-profit organization. The foundation raised funds to provide week-long free summer basketball camps on college campuses for junior high and high school boys, recommended by coaches in southern California.\n\n\n\nNaulls enrolled in Fuller Theological Seminary in 1990, earning a master's degree in theology in 1993. During that time, he worked as a college counselor for Brentwood Presbyterian Church. Later, he served as associate pastor for Antelope Valley Christian Center. In 1993, he incorporated Willie Naulls Ministries.\n\n\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; his children Lisa, Shannon, Joanh and Malaika; and his grandchildren Celia, Michael, Dean, Jonathan, Elle and Jojo.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/194971861/willie-naulls", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!

Naulls signed with UCLA but never made the epic, game-changing splash that many expected. His problem was Coach John Wooden. The two didn\u2019t get along at first. But his college career wasn\u2019t a washout either. He left Westwood as a second-team All American and UCLA\u2019s top all-time scorer and rebounder.\n\nNaulls went in the second round of the 1956 NBA draft to St. Louis. He seized his opportunity to carve out a solid 10-year NBA career, passing from St. Louis to New York, San Francisco, and Boston, where he retired in 1966. As Naulls explained, \u201cAfter 10 years, the fun has essentially gone out of the game for me.\u201d But at age 31, he walked away with many tall tales to tell. Among them was the day that he and his Knick teammates had finished practicing at a local high school, per usual. Everyone was on their way out of the gym when he heard someone say, \u201cHello, Mr. Naulls, I want to introduce myself . . .\u201d Naulls glanced in the direction of the voice, then he looked up, up, up. It was the teenaged Lew Alcindor, already seven-feet tall. A friendship began, and Naulls helped to recruit Alcindor to UCLA. He also proved highly influential in keeping him there for four years.\n\nAfter basketball, Naulls chased several business opportunities and eventually founded Willie Naulls Ministries. In his role as Pastor Naulls, he published eight books about God and faith, including his autobiography, which isn\u2019t easy find. In 2018, after a battle with the rare Churg-Strauss syndrome, Pastor Naulls passed away at age 84. His was truly a life well-lived.\n\nToday, there\u2019s not a whole lot out there about his fine basketball career. So, I was happy to stumble on this article from the great Lou Sahadi in the magazine Complete Sports Basketball, 1961-62. Thought I\u2019d share it with anyone who remembers or might be interested in the kid they once called Willie the Whale.]\n\nIn a steamy dressing room underneath the rotunda of Madison Square Garden one day last March, members of the New York Knickerbockers were flitting around at a leisurely pace. The mood reflected by the players signified the end of a long season. And yet, the starry-eyed rookies still had the bounce they brought with them to training camp months before. They were the first to shower and change into street clothes.\n\nWhile most of the other players in the National Basketball Association were packing their gear for the upcoming playoffs, the Knicks were left to bid farewell to one another until next season. The veterans on the squad had been through it before. A handshake, some encouraging words, and a goodbye until the next campaign. Their pace was much slower than the others. One of the veterans, Willie Naulls, was in a corner of the dimly-lit cubicle. He sat reclining on his elbows with a towel draped around his midsection. He had a big year, and his teammates congratulated him on such before departing from the humid room.\n\nAlthough innately quiet, Naulls nevertheless commanded respect for his skills with a basketball, not only from his teammates, but from around the league as well. He sat with his thoughts reflecting on the game against Detroit, the final regular-season contest for both squads, which had concluded some 10 minutes before on the floor upstairs. Only when addressed did he turn his head to acknowledge a teammate or a friend\u2019s greeting. By this time, only a few players remained dutifully going about the task of securing their equipment until next year.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a nice game to win,\u201d said Naulls. \u201cAt least it wouldn\u2019t have seemed like such a long season.\u201d\n\nThe campaign Naulls was referring to was the worst in Knick history. Virtually mired in last place all season, New York only showed 21 victories for its season\u2019s work. Their losses numbered 58, which is the highest on record for any NBA club. The Philadelphia team of 1952-53 previously was shackled with the most losses, 57, but it came during a shorter season as attributed by its 12 wins. That year, the Knicks finished on top of its division. They did so the following season, bu haven\u2019t since. Last year, they reached their lowest point.\n\nThey could have salvaged some token of success if they had beaten Detroit on the last day of the season. The Pistons and Cincinnati had reached the final game of the schedule deadlocked for the third-and-final playoff berth in the Western Division. But the Knickerbockers couldn\u2019t even play the role of spoilers. They provided Detroit with the triumph it needed to assure the existing deadlock, which was ultimately broken, as Cincinnati lost at Los Angeles hours later.\n\nIndividually for Naulls, however, last season was the greatest he produced in the five years he has earned a living as a professional basketball player. He gave evidence during the early segment of the season that he was headed for a banner campaign. But his individual prowess wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the 6-foot-6 graduate of UCLA. Time and again throughout the course of the season when he was complimented for his stellar play, he would remark: \u201cWhat good is it, we\u2019re not winning any games.\u201d\n\nIn most of those games, Naulls excelled as he never did before. He executed his skills quietly, but with electrifying results. Time and again, he brought the Madison Square Garden crowds to their feet with his velvety one-handed jump shots. The buffs around the famous Eighth Avenue arena called it \u201cthe touch.\u201d\n\nNaulls brought the touch with him to New York from St. Louis in 1956. Desperately in need of backcourt strength, the Hawks traded Naulls, then a rookie, for the veteran guard Slater Martin. As it turned out, it was an excellent exchange for both clubs. In the ensuing years, Martin sparked the Hawks to three consecutive divisional titles before his retirement last year. Naulls has filled a hole at forward for the Knicks, and he still has plenty of basketball left.\n\nThe past season, the 27-year-old Naulls was an explosive offensive weapon. He scored points at a record-setting pace, finishing with 1,846, the highest total ever produced by a player wearing the livery of the New York Knickerbockers. His average of 23.4, which ranked him seventh in the NBA, also was the highest in Knick annals.\n\nBut Naulls effectiveness wasn\u2019t limited to scoring alone. He was a determined rebounder, topping the Knicks in that department for the fourth-consecutive year. The number of stray shots he pulled down, 1,055, besides being a career high, was the second highest in New York history. Only Harry Gallatin with 1,098 in 1953-54 ranks ahead of Naulls.\n\nDespite all this, Naulls wasn\u2019t selected on the first team of the Eastern Division all stars. Boston\u2019s rugged Tom Heinsohn was the coaches\u2019 pick for one spot; while Dolph Schayes, a veteran of many campaigns, received the other. Naulls was given a second-team berth, and it hurt him inside. He wondered what else he had to do?\n\nAnd yet, the knock on Naulls is that he\u2019s not aggressive enough. A majority of the basketball cognoscenti is of the opinion Naulls dogs it most of the time he is in a game. Like most of the pros, Naulls paces himself throughout the course of a contest. He\u2019ll admit doing such, as would any other player. The arduous grind of an NBA season dictates such a course of action. No one in the league can go 48 minutes at top speed.\n\nNaulls must judiciously conserve his strength. As players go, Naulls is not strong. He has a tendency to tire, and he knows it more than anyone else. One time during a game last season in the Garden, Naulls was off to another high-scoring night. Toward the end of the first period, he hit on five consecutive one handers, mostly from outside, which had the Knick partisans wildly cheering. Before he could make another basket, coach Carl Braun removed Naulls from the contest. This naturally evoked a loud chorus of boos from the crowd. It lasted for half a minute. However, unknowingly to the fans, Naulls himself had asked Braun to relieve him for a breather.\n\nStill, others claim Naulls is a ball hog. They argue that once the ball goes in to Naulls, it doesn\u2019t come back out. This is unfair as Naulls, or any other player for that matter, wouldn\u2019t deliberately ignore an open teammate underneath the basket. If the shot is there, Naulls will take it. He is conceivably the best shooter on the squad. He is expected to produce 20 or more points a game. He earns his keep as a big scorer. Forwards in the NBA are the big pointmakers. With the exception of Philadelphia\u2019s Wilt Chamberlain and Cincinnati\u2019s Oscar Robertson, the leading scorers last year on the remaining six teams were forwards.\n\nNaulls executes the skills of his body in a smooth fashion. Maybe the ridiculous ease in lofting his one handers towards its target creates the impression that he is loafing more than others. He performs his trade with a skill unmatched by others in his profession. His fluid movements in getting off a shot makes his labor look easy.\n\nThen, too, not being a vociferous individual, Naulls may appear to some to be just standing around while arms and legs are in flight toward the basket. He doesn\u2019t make it a practice to get embroiled in arguments or fights as a result of the body contact some fans relish seeing. He has a placid nature and is not one to vent his anger on anyone. When he is angry, it is at himself. This, too, he fights inside. He\u2019ll walk off the floor looking downward with his hands on his hips and take his place on the bench without any outward flare of temper, not even as much as slamming a towel to the ground.\n\nThis same nature prevents Naulls from imploring any excessive body contact underneath the boards. Because of this, the buffs maintain Naulls is afraid to mix it up. Although he doesn\u2019t flagrantly make use of body jostling, Naulls knows how to implore any hipping movements. You couldn\u2019t lead a team four years running in rebounds without knowing your way in and out of the traffic jams under the backboards.\n\nNaulls\u2019 secret is that he quickly and smoothly makes use of body contact to corral or rebound. His sense of timing, not only in jumping but also in breaking toward the backboard, is his greatest asset. This provides the rebounds for Naulls, while most others resort to the brute-force strength in their massive frames to accomplish what Naulls does so gracefully.\n\nNaulls carries this quiet nature off the floor. Even on roadtrips, he bypasses the card games his teammates use as a diversion to peruse a newspaper or book. He\u2019s almost shy, speaking only when spoken to and then in a soft tone. He dresses conservatively in Ivy League fashion and his boyish grin makes him look younger than his 27 years. He has handsome features, and his bright eyes enable him to observe people and situations in this studious manner. He is known in basketball circles as a class guy.\n\nFor the disbelievers who contend that Naulls doesn\u2019t go all out, he answered back by playing in every Knick game last season. There were times he performed with a weak knee. Toward the campaign\u2019s end, he almost experienced a case of fatigue. He continued playing, nourishing his body with a number of different colored pills when he just as easily could have strengthened himself by abstaining from play for a few games. Others in his profession resorted to rest as a cure for feeling fatigued.\n\nNaulls has grown to shrug off the doubters. It used to bother him. He played the game his way last year, and you can\u2019t dispel his success. It was his greatest year as a pro. And, he did it all in his own quiet manner. That is his way."}]}
