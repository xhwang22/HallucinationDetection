But a practical interest in plants extended far back before recorded times, because plants were not only a source of food but also of medicines. With the dawn of agriculture, interest in plant growth became more focused, as better methods for cultivating crops and protecting them from weather and pest damage were developed. Also, in many ancient civilizations, including those in China, Egypt, Babylonia, and Greece, sophisticated medical practices developed in which plant materials were important medicinals. What Theophrastus brought to such practical interests in plants was an inquiry that was more theoretical. After Theophrastus, botanical science progressed very little until the rediscovery of his writings in the fifteenth century, just as the Renaissance was beginning.\n\nBackground\n\nClose observation is an important key to learning about nature for both practical and theoretical reasons, though most early interest in plant growth was clearly practical. It was related to finding and encouraging the growth of plants that were good sources of foods, medicines, building materials, and other products. Agriculture, which is the systematic growth of plants as opposed to just harvesting plant materials that happen to be available, is thought to have originated in western Asia at least 10,000 years ago.\n\nBy the time written documents came to be important in ancient times, several sophisticated civilizations had developed in different parts of the world, all with advanced agricultural practices based on close observation of geographic, climatic, and biological factors. The Egyptians had learned to harness the flood waters of the Nile River for irrigation, and with this came an interest in plants not only as food but for their use as medicine, as well as for decorative purposes in gardens. The Assyrians in Babylonia discovered sexual reproduction in date palms that allowed them to cultivate these trees, and from remote times the Chinese cultivated citrus fruits such as orange and lemons. Each of these civilizations also recorded information on the use of plant materials in the treatment of diseases. Plants were the primary sources of medicines in ancient times, and while each culture refined its own medical practices, there is also evidence that information from Egyptian and Babylonian medicine was used later by the Greeks.\n\nThe writings that are ascribed to Hippocrates (c. 460-377 b.c.), the greatest of the ancient Greek physicians, include descriptions of over 250 plants that were used either to promote health or cure disease. These documents also contain a great deal on proper diet as well as information on food plants. So it is clear that the Greeks studied plants for the very practical reasons of human health and nutrition. But in the sixth century b.c., an intellectual movement was developing in Greece, a movement leading to the development of Western philosophy, which asked basic questions less for their practical importance than for building a systematic exploration of the natural world.\n\nThe first Greek philosophers came from the island of Ionia. They investigated questions about such things as the origin of the world and its composition, and thus began a tradition that led to the development of scientific ways of thinking. The decline of the Ionian school was followed by such great Greek philosophers as Socrates (469-399 b.c.), Plato (c. 427-347 b.c.), and Aristotle (c. 384-322 b.c.). Of these, it was Aristotle who was most interested in the study of the living world, including plants. But as with many ancient writers, a great deal of what Aristotle wrote has been lost, including most of his botanical works. We can get some idea of his thoughts on plants from the writings of his student, Theophrastus. Theophrastus himself wrote more than 200 works, most of which have been lost. But two of his long works on botany have survived. Inquiry into Plants deals with the description and classification of about 550 plant species, and Causes of Plants discusses plant physiology and reproduction.\n\nImpact\n\nBecause of the wealth of information and analysis found in these works, Theophrastus is called the father of botany. In Inquiry into Plants he describes not only those plants that are native to Greece, but also species that are found on the Atlantic coast, around the Mediterranean Sea, and even as far east as India. In both this work and Causes of Plants, he draws on the writings of earlier philosophers and scientists, including the Greeks Empedocles (c. 495-435 b.c.), Menestor, and Democritus (c. 460-370 b.c.), who had all written about plants. Theophrastus also includes reports from farmers, physicians, and others who had intimate knowledge of plants, so his writings contain a great deal of practical information and accurate observations.\n\nIn attempting to classify plants, Theophrastus argued that this task differed from the classification of animals because plants had less in common with each other than animals did. For example, he noted that while all animals he observed had in common a mouth and stomach, not all plants had leaves, stems, or even roots. For this reason, he thought that while the classification of animals could be based on generalizations, for plants it was specific features that were important. This meant that the essential thing was not reasoning to universals, but direct observation. Theophrastus used generalizations only when he had specific examples with which to support them. So even this early in the history of botany, there was a reliance on careful attention to detail.\n\nIt is not surprising that some of Theophrastus's observations are incomplete or inaccurate, considering that he didn't even have a hand lens with which to observe small plant structures. Still, he made a number of important and lasting contributions to botany. He was the first to distinguish between two basic categories of flowering plants, the monocots (those having a set of characteristics that include leaves with parallel veins) and dicots (those having leaves with branching veins). He also differentiated the flowering plants or angiosperms from the more primitive gymnosperms. In Causes of Plants he presented a great many observations on plant reproduction, including an accurate description of the germination of seeds, a description that was not improved upon until the seventeenth century.\n\nSome historians of science consider Theophrastus to be the founder of the fields of plant geography and ecology because he didn't just describe the structural features of plants, but also wrote on the relationship between plant structure and habitat. He showed an awareness of plant communities, writing that certain groups of species were often found growing together in the same geographic areas or in the same types of environments. He also wrote of the adaptation of plants to particular environmental conditions, showing, for example, that some species were better adapted to dry conditions while others grew more vigorously in damp areas. In writing of plant pathology, he made a distinction between those diseases due to climate or soil conditions and those that were the result of pests.\n\nThe contributions of Theophrastus are particularly outstanding because they were not followed by work of comparable quality. Very little of scientific value was added to botanical knowledge until the Renaissance, which began in the fifteenth century, almost 2,000 years after the time of Theophrastus. Greek science, in general, declined after his time. Athens, which had been the seat of learning, faced political turmoil, and the center of Greek learning shifted to the city of Alexandria in Egypt. While there were a number of writers who produced works on botany, there was little new information in these works, and as the writings of Theophrastus continued to be copied, inaccuracies crept in. So botanical knowledge deteriorated rather than improved.\n\nThere were, however, a few figures who made lasting contributions to botany, though to a much lesser degree than Theophrastus. Two of the most noteworthy lived in the first century a.d. The Roman Pliny the Elder (a.d. 23-79) wrote Natural History, in which 16 of its 37 books were devoted to plants. Much of Pliny's information is based on the work of the Greek Crateuas (c. 120-60 b.c.) who had produced an herbal, a book on plants used in medicine, in the first century b.c. Pliny's botanical books contain a great deal of information on plants, though this material is not as well organized as that of Theophrastus because Pliny had little interest in classification. Pliny's writings are particularly important because they were highly valued during the Middle Ages, when they were copied many times, leading to the introduction of many errors. The works of Crateuas and Theophrastus, on the other hand, were lost, though Theophrastus's work was rediscovered in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe other first-century figure of note in botanical history is Pedanius Dioscorides (c. a.d. 40-90), a Greek born in Sicily. He wrote an herbal that was recopied many times in succeeding centuries, and became the main source of information on the medicinal uses of plants through the Middle Ages. At some point early in its history, Dioscorides's text was combined with illustrations from the herbal of Crateuas, whom Pliny described as the first to use botanical illustrations among the Greeks. It was the illustrated version of Dioscorides's work that was the subject of so much recopying, and this led to errors not only in the text but in the illustrations, which eventually became so simplified that it was impossible to identify the species from the illustrations.\n\nIt was in part because of the reliance of the scholars of the Middle Ages on such flawed documents that botanical science failed to progress very far beyond the contributions of Theophrastus. It was only in the late Middle Ages, with the work of scholars such as Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), that botanical science began to progress again. With the introduction of the printing press in the fifteenth century, accurate reproduction of texts and illustrations greatly spurred further development.\n\nMAURA C.

Nevertheless, it was during that time that botany was developed from the study of plants with healing properties. Because of the interest in medicinal plants, herbs in general began to be described and illustrated in a realistic manner. Although Arabic science was well developed during the period and was far in advance of Latin, Byzantine, and Chinese cultures, it began to show signs of decline.\n\nEuropean learning, on the other hand, was rapidly increasing and best exemplified perhaps by the mid-15th-century German scholar Johannes von Cuba (1430\u20131503) . The Gart der Gesundheit (German, for The Garden of Health) was edited in 1485 and was one of the first printed herbals in German. The Gart der Gesundheit is an important late medieval work concerning the knowledge of natural history, especially that of medicinal plants. 382 plants, 25 drugs from the animal kingdom and 28 minerals, are described. The book was edited by Peter Sch\u00f6ffer in Mainz, an apprendice of Gutenberg. About 100 of the 379 illustrations in the Gart der Gesundheit were done by Erhard Reuwich whose woodcuts depict the character of plants in clear lines.\n\nOver the period 1530\u201340, Germans led the march to publish books about plants, with fresh and vigorous illustrations, contrasted sharply with earlier texts, whose authors had been content merely to copy from old manuscripts. Leonhart Fuchs (1501-1566) published descriptive well-illustrated texts about common wild flowers. He was the author of a large book about plants and their uses as medicines, a herbal, which was reprinted in 1583. It has about 500 accurate and detailed drawings of plants, which were printed from woodcuts. The drawings are the book's most notable advance on its predecessors. Although drawings had been used in other herbal books, Fuchs's herbal book proved and emphasized high-quality drawings as the most telling way to specify what a plant name stands for. Because of his works, he is often referred to as the German father of botany, may be considered the forerunners of modern botanical floras (treatises on or lists of the plants of an area or period)."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-II-Holy-Roman-emperor", "page_content": "son Ferdinand III ...(Show more)\n\nEarly years Ferdinand was born in Graz, the eldest son of the archduke Charles, the ruler of Inner Austria (Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola), and Maria, a daughter of Albrecht V, duke of Bavaria. From 1590 to 1595 he was educated at the University of Ingolstadt by Jesuits whose aim was to make him a strict, rigidly Catholic ruler. In 1596 he took over his hereditary lands and, after a pilgrimage to Loreto and Rome, set about suppressing Protestantism by forcing the great majority of his subjects to adopt the Roman Catholic faith. In 1600 he married Maria Anna of Bavaria, who bore him four children. He avoided committing himself in a quarrel between his cousins, the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II and his brother Matthias, who eventually succeeded Rudolf as emperor. Later Ferdinand secured approval from the Habsburg rulers of Spain to succeed the childless Matthias. In return he promised in a secret treaty (1617) to cede to them Alsace and the imperial fiefs in Italy. In the same year, Ferdinand was recognized by the Bohemian Diet as king of Bohemia and in 1618 was elected king of Hungary. In 1619, however, the largely Protestant diet of Bohemia deposed him, electing Frederick V, elector of the Palatinate, as their king. This was, in effect, the beginning of the Thirty Years\u2019 War. Though elected Holy Roman emperor on August 28, 1619, Ferdinand was able to maintain himself only with support from Spain, Poland, and various German princes. Aided by Maximilian I, duke of Bavaria, his troops annihilated the rebel army on the White Mountain, near Prague, on November 8, 1620. He confiscated the estates of the rebel magnates, reduced the Diet to impotence by a new constituent ordinance (1627), and forcibly catholicized Bohemia. The Protestants of Upper and Lower Austria were subjected to compulsory conversion.\n\nFerdinand and Wallenstein During the first decade of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, Ferdinand strengthened his position by transferring the Palatinate\u2019s electoral office to Maximilian of Bavaria. In addition, with the help of Spain and the league of Catholic princes of Germany, and through the victories of his generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein, he gained important successes over his German opponents and the king of Denmark. Until then the war largely had been confined to Germany, but Swedish and, later on, French intervention turned it into a European conflict. Ferdinand\u2019s Edict of Restitution (1629), which forced Protestants to return to the Roman Catholic church all property seized since 1552, revealed to the German princes the threat of imperial absolutism. Their opposition forced Ferdinand in 1630 to dismiss Wallenstein, the mainstay of his power. The victorious advance of the Swedish army, however, made the emperor recall Wallenstein. Eventually, for reasons of state, Ferdinand reluctantly gave his consent to a second dismissal and the assassination of Wallenstein, who had treacherously entered into negotiations with the enemy (1634). After his victory over the Swedes (September 1634) at N\u00f6rdlingen, Ferdinand reached a compromise with the Protestant princes in the Peace of Prague (1635) and, in 1636, succeeded in having his son Ferdinand elected king of the Romans (successor-designate to the emperor). Ferdinand II, who had been married to his second wife, Eleonora Gonzaga of Mantua, since 1622, died in Vienna in 1637."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/achille-ferdinand.carrier/2545007", "page_content": "Achille-Ferdinand Carrier\n\npolitician Member of the National Assembly\n\nFebruary 15, 1859 (age 71) Saint-Roch, Canada East\n\nHe represented Gasp\u00e9 in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1890 to 1892 as a Liberal.

Though not exactly a commoner, Sophie came from a family of obscure Czech nobles and not from a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty in Europe. As a result, their children were declared ineligible for the throne. Sophie also became the victim of countless petty slights. At imperial banquets, for example, she entered each room last, without an escort, and was then seated far away from her husband at the dinner table.\n\nFerdinand remained Franz Josef\u2019s heir and inspector general of the army. In that capacity, he agreed to attend a series of June 1914 military exercises in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Austria-Hungary had just annexed these provinces a few years earlier against the wishes of neighboring Serbia, which likewise coveted them.\n\nFerdinand believed the Serbs to be \u201cpigs,\u201d \u201cthieves,\u201d \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201cscoundrels.\u201d Yet he had opposed annexation for fear that it would make an already turbulent political situation even worse. Formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire, Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s population was roughly 40 percent Serb, 30 percent Muslim and 20 percent Croat, with various other ethnicities making up the remainder.\n\nUpon learning of Ferdinand\u2019s upcoming visit, the Young Bosnians, a secret revolutionary society of peasant students, began plotting to assassinate him. In May, Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabez and Nedeljko Cabrinovic traveled to the Serbian capital of Belgrade, where they received six handheld bombs, four semi-automatic pistols and cyanide suicide capsules from members of the so-called Black Hand, a terrorist group with close ties to the Serbian army. After practicing with their pistols in a Belgrade park, the three men journeyed back to Bosnia-Herzegovina, receiving help from Black Hand associates to smuggle their weapons across the border. To this day, it remains unclear whether the Serbian government participated in the scheme.\n\nFerdinand and Sophie departed their estate for Bosnia-Herzegovina on June 23. Having received multiple warnings to cancel the trip, the archduke knew that danger potentially awaited them. \u201cOur journey starts with an extremely promising omen,\u201d he purportedly said when the axles on his car overheated. \u201cHere our car burns, and down there they will throw bombs at us.\u201d After arriving at a spa town a few miles outside of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s capital, Ferdinand attended two days of military exercises while Sophie visited schools and orphanages. On a whim, the couple drove in one evening to check out Sarajevo\u2019s bazaars. While there, they attracted a crowd of onlookers, including Princip, but were apparently treated with warmth and politeness.\n\nFollowing a banquet with religious and political leaders, only one day of events remained before Ferdinand and Sophie were to return home. That morning, June 28, the archduke sent a telegram to his eldest son congratulating him on his latest exam results. He and Sophie then boarded a train for the short ride into Sarajevo. For once, Sophie was permitted to walk alongside Ferdinand during a brief troop inspection, after which the couple got in an open-topped car for a motorcade ride to city hall. The car in front of them was supposed to carry six specially trained officers but instead had only one, plus three local policemen. In fact, throughout the trip, Austro-Hungarian officials allegedly focused more attention on dinner menus than security details.\n\nMeanwhile, seven Young Bosnians had fanned out along the Appel Quay, a main avenue in Sarajevo running parallel to the Miljacka River. When the motorcade passed by, its route having been published in advance, Cabrinovic asked which car carried the archduke. He then hurled his bomb at the car, only to watch it bounce off the folded-up roof and roll underneath the wrong vehicle. The subsequent explosion wounded two army officers and several bystanders but left Ferdinand and Sophie essentially unharmed. Cabrinovic jumped into the mostly dry riverbed and made a half-hearted attempt to kill himself before being apprehended. \u201cI am a Serbian hero,\u201d he purportedly shouted as the police led him away. At least two other Young Bosnians also had good looks at the archduke but apparently lost the nerve to attempt an assassination.\n\nRather than immediately flee Sarajevo, Ferdinand decided to continue on to the planned event at city hall. Upon finishing that up, he insisted on visiting the wounded officers in the hospital. In order to dissuade any other bomb throwers, the motorcade zipped down the Appel Quay at high speeds. By mistake, however, the first three cars turned onto a side street right where Princip happened to be standing. As the cars attempted to reverse back onto the Appel Quay, Princip whipped out his pistol and fired two shots at the archduke from point-blank range, piercing him in the neck and also striking Sophie\u2019s abdomen. \u201cSophie, Sophie, don\u2019t die\u2014stay alive for our children,\u201d Ferdinand murmured. Within minutes, though, both had passed away. Princip, a slender, 19-year-old Serbian army reject, later admitted to killing Ferdinand but said he had not meant to hit Sophie. Three weeks too young for the death penalty, Princip was given a 20-year sentence, but contracted tuberculosis and died in jail in April 1918, at the age of just 23.\n\nWith tensions already running high among Europe\u2019s powers, the assassination precipitated a rapid descent into World War I. First, Austria-Hungary gained German support for punitive action against Serbia. It then sent Serbia an ultimatum, worded in a way that made acceptance unlikely. Serbia proposed arbitration to resolve the dispute, but Austria-Hungary instead declared war on July 28, 1914, exactly a month after Ferdinand\u2019s death. By the following week, Germany, Russia, France, Belgium, Montenegro and Great Britain had all been drawn into the conflict, and other countries like the United States would enter later. Overall, more than 16 million people\u2014soldiers and civilians\u2014died in fighting that lasted until 1918."}, {"url": "https://byjus.com/biology/botany/", "page_content": "Botany\n\nBotany Meaning\n\n\u201cBotany is the branch of Biology that deals with the study of plants.\u201d\n\nThe term \u2018botany\u2019 is derived from an adjective \u2018botanic\u2019 that is again derived from the Greek word \u2018botane\u2019.

He is also known as the \u201cFather of Botany\u201d due to his major writings on plants. One of his books called \u201cEnquiry into Plants\u201d classified the plants based on the geographical ranges, sizes, uses and growth patterns. The other work called \u201cOn the Causes of Plants\u201d explained the economics of growing plants.\n\nDioscorides was another Greek physician from 90-40 A.D. who wrote an encyclopedia about herbal medicines known as \u201cDe Materia Medica\u201d. This book was used as an important medicinal guidebook for over 1500 years until the invention of the compound microscope.\n\nThe invention of the compound microscope by Robert Hooke in 1665 marked the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of Botany. It helped in the study of the anatomy and physiology of plants. The discovery of chlorophyll helped in understanding the process of photosynthesis.

He had a clear, strong voice. What is King Ferdinand II best known for? King Ferdinand II is known for uniting the Spanish kingdoms into the nation of Spain, supporting the Spanish Inquisition (1478\u20131834), sponsoring Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages of exploration across the Atlantic Ocean, and commencing Spain\u2019s entry into the modern period of imperial expansion.\n\nFerdinand II, byname Ferdinand the Catholic, Spanish Fernando el Cat\u00f3lico, (born March 10, 1452, Sos, Aragon [Spain]\u2014died January 23, 1516, Madrigalejo, Spain), king of Aragon and king of Castile (as Ferdinand V) from 1479, joint sovereign with Queen Isabella I. (As Spanish ruler of southern Italy, he was also known as Ferdinand III of Naples and Ferdinand II of Sicily.) He united the Spanish kingdoms into the nation of Spain and began Spain\u2019s entry into the modern period of imperial expansion.\n\nEarly life Ferdinand was the son of John II of Aragon and Juana Enr\u00edquez, both of Castilian origin. In 1461, in the midst of a bitterly contested succession, John II named him heir apparent and governor of all his kingdoms and lands. Ferdinand\u2019s future was assured when he came of age, in 1466, and when he was named king of Sicily, in 1468, in order to impress the court of Castile, where his father ultimately wished to place him. In addition to participating in court life, the young prince saw battle during the Catalonian wars. Britannica Quiz History Buff Quiz John II was careful about Ferdinand\u2019s education and took personal charge of it, making sure that Ferdinand learned as much as possible from experience. He also provided him with teachers who taught him humanistic attitudes and wrote him treatises on the art of government. Ferdinand had no apparent bent for formal studies, but he was a patron of the arts and a devotee of vocal and instrumental music. Ferdinand had an imposing personality but was never very genial. From his father he acquired sagacity, integrity, courage, and a calculated reserve; from his mother, an impulsive emotionality, which he generally repressed. Under the responsibility of kingship he had to conceal his stronger passions and adopt a cold, impenetrable mask.\n\nMarriage to Isabella and unification of Spain He married the princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid in October 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. The marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. She quickly bore him children: the infanta Isabella was born in 1470; the heir apparent, Juan, in 1478; and the infantas Juana (called Juana la Loca\u2014Joan the Mad), Catalina (later called\u2014as the first wife of Henry VIII of England\u2014Catherine of Aragon), and Mar\u00eda followed. The marriage began, however, with almost continual separation. Ferdinand, often away in the Castilian towns or on journeys to Aragon, reproached his wife for the comfort of her life. At the same time, the restlessness of his 20 years drove him into other women\u2019s arms, by whom he sired at least two female children, whose birth dates are not recorded. His extramarital affairs caused Isabella jealousy for several years. Between the ages of 20 and 30, Ferdinand performed a series of heroic deeds. These began when Henry IV of Castile died on December 11, 1474, leaving his succession in dispute. Ferdinand rushed from Zaragoza to Segovia, where Isabella had herself proclaimed queen of Castile on December 13. Ferdinand remained there as king consort, an uneasy, marginal figure, until Isabella\u2019s war of succession against Afonso V of Portugal gained his acceptance in 1479 as king in every sense of the word. That same year John II died, and Ferdinand succeeded to the Aragonese throne. This initiated a confederation of kingdoms, which was the institutional basis for modern Spain.

In portraits he appears with soft, well-proportioned features, a small, sensual mouth, and pensive eyes. His literary descriptions are more complicated, although they agree in presenting him as good-looking, of medium height, and a good rider, devoted to games and to the hunt. He had a clear, strong voice.\n\nThe Spanish Inquisition, conquest of Granada, and voyages of Columbus From 1475 to 1479 Ferdinand struggled to take a firm seat in Castile with his young wife and to transform the kingdom politically, using new institutional molds partly inspired by those of Aragon. This policy of modernization included a ban against all religions other than Roman Catholicism. The establishment of the Spanish Inquisition (1478) to enforce religious uniformity and the expulsion of the Jews (1492) were both part of a deliberate policy designed to strengthen the church, which would in turn support the crown. The years 1482\u201392 were frantic for Ferdinand. In the spring months he directed the campaign against the kingdom of Granada, showing his military talent to good effect, and he conquered the kingdom inch by inch, winning its final capitulation on January 2, 1492. During the months of rest from war, he visited his kingdoms, learning their geography and problems firsthand. Christophe Colomb a la cour d'Isabelle I The conquest of Granada made it possible to support Christopher Columbus\u2019 voyages of exploration across the Atlantic. It is not known what Ferdinand thought of Columbus or how he judged his plans, nor can it be stated that the first trip was financed from Aragon; the sum of 1,157,000 maravedis came from the funds of the Santa Hermandad (\u201cHoly Brotherhood\u201d). Nevertheless, Ferdinand was present in the development of plans for the enterprise, in the negotiations to obtain the pope\u2019s backing for it, and in the organization of the resulting American colonies. Ferdinand II At the age of 50 Ferdinand was an incarnation of royalty, and fortune smiled on him. For various reasons, particularly for his intervention in Italy, Pope Alexander VI gave him the honorary title of \u201cthe Catholic\u201d on December 2, 1496. But he also suffered a succession of tragedies: the heir apparent and his eldest daughter both died, and the first symptoms of insanity appeared in his daughter Juana. He was wounded in Barcelona in 1493, but this was unimportant compared with the family injuries he suffered, which culminated in the death of Isabella in 1504, \u201cthe best and most excellent wife king ever had.\u201d In 1505, to secure his position in Castile, Ferdinand signed a contract to marry Germaine de Foix, niece of the king of France. This, too, was a political marriage, although he always showed her the highest regard. A stay in Italy (1506\u201307) demonstrated how badly he was needed by the Spanish kingdoms. Once more in Castile, he managed his European policy so as to obtain a hegemony that would serve his expansionary ends in the Mediterranean and in Africa. In 1512, immediately after the schism in the church in which the kings of Navarre participated, he occupied their kingdom and incorporated it into Castile\u2014one of the most controversial acts of his reign."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/science/botany", "page_content": "Because of the long preoccupation of humans with plants, a large body of folklore, general information, and actual scientific data has accumulated, which has become the basis for the science of botany.\n\nIn time plants were not only collected but also grown by humans. This domestication resulted not only in the development of agriculture but also in a greater stability of human populations that had previously been nomadic. From the settling down of agricultural peoples in places where they could depend upon adequate food supplies came the first villages and the earliest civilizations.\n\nEarliest humans, like the other anthropoid mammals (e.g., apes , monkeys ), depended totally upon the natural resources of the environment , which, until methods were developed for hunting, consisted almost completely of plants. The behaviour of pre-Stone Age humans can be inferred by studying the botany of aboriginal peoples in various parts of the world. Isolated tribal groups in South America , Africa, and New Guinea , for example, have extensive knowledge about plants and distinguish hundreds of kinds according to their utility, as edible, poisonous, or otherwise important in their culture . They have developed sophisticated systems of nomenclature and classification , which approximate the binomial system (i.e., generic and specific names) found in modern biology. The urge to recognize different kinds of plants and to give them names thus seems to be as old as the human race .\n\nAlthough the many steps in the process of photosynthesis have become fully understood only in recent years, even in prehistoric times humans somehow recognized intuitively that some important relation existed between the Sun and plants. Such recognition is suggested by the fact that worship of the Sun was often combined with the worship of plants by early tribes and civilizations.\n\nPlants were of paramount importance to early humans, who depended upon them as sources of food, shelter, clothing, medicine , ornament, tools, and magic. Today it is known that, in addition to their practical and economic values, green plants are indispensable to all life on Earth: through the process of photosynthesis , plants transform energy from the Sun into the chemical energy of food, which makes all life possible. A second unique and important capacity of green plants is the formation and release of oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. The oxygen of the atmosphere, so absolutely essential to many forms of life, represents the accumulation of over 3,500,000,000 years of photosynthesis by green plants and algae .\n\nbotany , branch of biology that deals with the study of plants , including their structure, properties, and biochemical processes. Also included are plant classification and the study of plant diseases and of interactions with the environment . The principles and findings of botany have provided the base for such applied sciences as agriculture , horticulture , and forestry .\n\nHistorical background\n\nTheophrastus, a Greek philosopher who first studied with Plato and then became a disciple of Aristotle, is credited with founding botany. Only two of an estimated 200 botanical treatises written by him are known to science: originally written in Greek about 300 bce, they have survived in the form of Latin manuscripts, De causis plantarum and De historia plantarum. His basic concepts of morphology, classification, and the natural history of plants, accepted without question for many centuries, are now of interest primarily because of Theophrastus\u2019s independent and philosophical viewpoint.\n\nPedanius Dioscorides, a Greek botanist of the 1st century ce, was the most important botanical writer after Theophrastus. In his major work, an herbal in Greek, he described some 600 kinds of plants, with comments on their habit of growth and form as well as on their medicinal properties. Unlike Theophrastus, who classified plants as trees, shrubs, and herbs, Dioscorides grouped his plants under three headings: as aromatic, culinary, and medicinal. His herbal, unique in that it was the first treatment of medicinal plants to be illustrated, remained for about 15 centuries the last word on medical botany in Europe.\n\nFrom the 2nd century bce to the 1st century ce, a succession of Roman writers\u2014Cato the Elder, Varro, Virgil, and Columella\u2014prepared Latin manuscripts on farming, gardening, and fruit growing but showed little evidence of the spirit of scientific inquiry for its own sake that was so characteristic of Theophrastus. In the 1st century ce, Pliny the Elder, though no more original than his Roman predecessors, seemed more industrious as a compiler. His Historia naturalis\u2014an encyclopaedia of 37 volumes, compiled from some 2,000 works representing 146 Roman and 327 Greek authors\u2014has 16 volumes devoted to plants. Although uncritical and containing much misinformation, this work contains much information otherwise unavailable, since most of the volumes to which he referred have been destroyed.\n\nThe printing press revolutionized the availability of all types of literature, including that of plants. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many herbals were published with the purpose of describing plants useful in medicine. Written by physicians and medically oriented botanists, the earliest herbals were based largely on the work of Dioscorides and to a lesser extent on Theophrastus, but gradually they became the product of original observation. The increasing objectivity and originality of herbals through the decades is clearly reflected in the improved quality of the woodcuts prepared to illustrate these books.\n\nIn 1552 an illustrated manuscript on Mexican plants, written in Aztec, was translated into Latin by Badianus; other similar manuscripts known to have existed seem to have disappeared. Whereas herbals in China date back much further than those in Europe, they have become known only recently and so have contributed little to the progress of Western botany.\n\nThe invention of the optical lens during the 16th century and the development of the compound microscope about 1590 opened an era of rich discovery about plants; prior to that time, all observations by necessity had been made with the unaided eye. The botanists of the 17th century turned away from the earlier emphasis on medical botany and began to describe all plants, including the many new ones that were being introduced in large numbers from Asia, Africa, and America. Among the most prominent botanists of this era was Gaspard Bauhin, who for the first time developed, in a tentative way, many botanical concepts still held as valid.\n\nIn 1665 Robert Hooke published, under the title Micrographia, the results of his microscopic observations on several plant tissues. He is remembered as the coiner of the word \u201ccell,\u201d referring to the cavities he observed in thin slices of cork; his observation that living cells contain sap and other materials too often has been forgotten. In the following decade, Nehemiah Grew and Marcello Malpighi founded plant anatomy; in 1671 they communicated the results of microscopic studies simultaneously to the Royal Society of London, and both later published major treatises.\n\nExperimental plant physiology began with the brilliant work of Stephen Hales, who published his observations on the movements of water in plants under the title Vegetable Staticks (1727). His conclusions on the mechanics of water transpiration in plants are still valid, as is his discovery\u2014at the time a startling one\u2014that air contributes something to the materials produced by plants. In 1774, Joseph Priestley showed that plants exposed to sunlight give off oxygen, and Jan Ingenhousz demonstrated, in 1779, that plants in the dark give off carbon dioxide. In 1804 Nicolas de Saussure demonstrated convincingly that plants in sunlight absorb water and carbon dioxide and increase in weight, as had been reported by Hales nearly a century earlier.\n\nThe widespread use of the microscope by plant morphologists provided a turning point in the 18th century\u2014botany became largely a laboratory science. Until the invention of simple lenses and the compound microscope, the recognition and classification of plants were, for the most part, based on such large morphological aspects of the plant as size, shape, and external structure of leaves, roots, and stems. Such information was also supplemented by observations on more subjective qualities of plants, such as edibility and medicinal uses.\n\nIn 1753 Linnaeus published his master work, Species Plantarum, which contains careful descriptions of 6,000 species of plants from all of the parts of the world known at the time. In this work, which is still the basic reference work for modern plant taxonomy, Linnaeus established the practice of binomial nomenclature\u2014that is, the denomination of each kind of plant by two words, the genus name and the specific name, as Rosa canina, the dog rose. Binomial nomenclature had been introduced much earlier by some of the herbalists, but it was not generally accepted; most botanists continued to use cumbersome formal descriptions, consisting of many words, to name a plant. Linnaeus for the first time put the contemporary knowledge of plants into an orderly system, with full acknowledgment to past authors, and produced a nomenclatural methodology so useful that it has not been greatly improved upon. Linnaeus also introduced a \u201csexual system\u201d of plants, by which the numbers of flower parts\u2014especially stamens, which produce male sex cells, and styles, which are prolongations of plant ovaries that receive pollen grains\u2014became useful tools for easy identification of plants. This simple system, though effective, had many imperfections. Other classification systems, in which as many characters as possible were considered in order to determine the degree of relationship, were developed by other botanists; indeed, some appeared before the time of Linnaeus. The application of the concepts of Charles Darwin (on evolution) and Gregor Mendel (on genetics) to plant taxonomy has provided insights into the process of evolution and the production of new species.\n\nSystematic botany now uses information and techniques from all the subdisciplines of botany, incorporating them into one body of knowledge. Phytogeography (the biogeography of plants), plant ecology, population genetics, and various techniques applicable to cells\u2014cytotaxonomy and cytogenetics\u2014have contributed greatly to the current status of systematic botany and have to some degree become part of it. More recently, phytochemistry, computerized statistics, and fine-structure morphology have been added to the activities of systematic botany.\n\nThe 20th century saw an enormous increase in the rate of growth of research in botany and the results derived therefrom. The combination of more botanists, better facilities, and new technologies, all with the benefit of experience from the past, resulted in a series of new discoveries, new concepts, and new fields of botanical endeavour. Some important examples are mentioned below.\n\nNew and more precise information is being accumulated concerning the process of photosynthesis, especially with reference to energy-transfer mechanisms.\n\nThe discovery of the pigment phytochrome, which constitutes a previously unknown light-detecting system in plants, has greatly increased knowledge of the influence of both internal and external environment on the germination of seeds and the time of flowering.\n\nSeveral types of plant hormones (internal regulatory substances) have been discovered\u2014among them auxin, gibberellin, and kinetin\u2014whose interactions provide a new concept of the way in which the plant functions as a unit.\n\nThe discovery that plants need certain trace elements usually found in the soil has made it possible to cultivate areas lacking some essential element by adding it to the deficient soil.\n\nThe development of genetical methods for the control of plant heredity has made possible the generation of improved and enormously productive crop plants.\n\nThe development of radioactive-carbon dating of plant materials as old as 50,000 years is useful to the paleobotanist, the ecologist, the archaeologist, and especially to the climatologist, who now has a better basis on which to predict climates of future centuries.\n\nThe discovery of alga-like and bacteria-like fossils in Precambrian rocks has pushed the estimated origin of plants on Earth to 3,500,000,000 years ago.\n\nThe isolation of antibiotic substances from fungi and bacteria-like organisms has provided control over many bacterial diseases and has contributed biochemical information of basic scientific importance as well.\n\nThe use of phylogenetic data to establish a consensus on the taxonomy and evolutionary lineages of angiosperms (flowering plants) is coordinated through an international effort known as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group."}]}
