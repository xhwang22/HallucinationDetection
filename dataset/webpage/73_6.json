Years after her screen career ended, she achieved recognition as a noted inventor of a radio communications device.\n\nThe daughter of a prosperous Viennese banker, Lamarr was privately tutored from age 4; by the time she was 10, she was a proficient pianist and dancer and could speak four languages. At age 16 she enrolled in Max Reinhardt\u2019s Berlin-based dramatic school, and within a year she made her motion picture debut in Geld auf der Strasse (1930; Money on the Street). She achieved both stardom and notoriety in the Czech film Extase (1932; Ecstasy), in which she briefly but tastefully appeared in the nude. Her burgeoning career was halted by her 1933 marriage to Austrian munitions manufacturer Fritz Mandl, who not only prohibited her from further stage and screen appearances but also tried unsuccessfully to destroy all existing prints of Extase. After leaving the possessive Mandl, she went to Hollywood in 1937, where she appeared in her first English-language film, the classic romantic drama Algiers (1938). Lamarr became a U.S. citizen in 1953.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Culture Quiz\n\nUnder contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1938 to 1945, she displayed her acting skills in such films as H.M. Pulham, Esq. (1941) and Tortilla Flat (1942). For the most part, however, she was confined to mostly decorative roles, such as that of Tondelayo in White Cargo (1942). Hoping to secure more substantial parts, she set up her own production company in 1946, but within three years she returned to her exotic stock-in-trade in Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s Samson and Delilah (1949), her most commercially successful film.\n\nLamarr once insisted, \u201cAny girl can be glamorous; all you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\u201d That she herself was anything but stupid was unequivocally proved during World War II when, in collaboration with the avant-garde composer George Antheil, she invented an electronic device that minimized the jamming of radio signals. Though it was never used in wartime, this device is a component of present-day satellite and cellular phone technology.\n\nRetiring from movies in 1958 (except for a cameo appearance in Instant Karma, 1990), Lamarr subsequently resurfaced in 1966 and 1991 when she was arrested on, and later cleared of, shoplifting charges; when she sued the collaborators on her 1966 autobiography Ecstasy and Me for misrepresentation; and when she took director Mel Brooks to court for including a character named Hedley Lamarr in his western spoof Blazing Saddles (1974). She was married six times (her husbands included screenwriter Gene Markey and actor John Loder) but was living alone at the time of her death."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/obituaries/john-loder-90-british-actor.html", "page_content": "John Loder, an actor whose tenure of more than 30 years in British and American movies was credited largely to his good looks and his imposing physique, has died in England.

He was on an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met him he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a common interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz Stockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and Bach backwards.\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an avant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he was using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive, but it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an innovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious avant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit disbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording studio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising jingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed thoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the band\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad and so was the money, but it was fun.\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and John's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and, despite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would lose us 3p, we made money.\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not well pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his philosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and never considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had no effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every aspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their engineer of choice.\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract was ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a principle that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial, production and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork, Chumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In Toyland into the public domain,\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied electrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief because he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who appears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's ideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the chance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he created several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market. Aided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international force that it is today.\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents collapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly bland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big for their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go elsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people before profit.\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence which extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were aware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which finally killed him.\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of product should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\u00b7 John Loder, record producer, born April 7 1946; died August 12 2005."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20151219-hedy-lamarr-racy-actor-and-technology-pioneer", "page_content": "Kiesler played a young bride named Eva.
