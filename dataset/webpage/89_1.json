{"Bert Deacon was a key member of Collingwood's famous 'Machine' teams of the 1950s.": [{"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/712053/moment-24-deacons-brownlow-medal", "page_content": "24. 1947 - Bert Deacon's Brownlow Medal\n\nVIEW THE 25 GREATEST MOMENTS HUB HERE\n\nThe man who would be Carlton\u2019s first Brownlow Medallist deftly adjusted the dial of his trusty bakelite radio. Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/club/history/hall-of-fame", "page_content": "The Carlton Hall of Fame was established in 1987 and recognises contributions made to the Club by individuals.\n\nInductees are to be considered from three different eras \u2013 1864 to 1938, 1939 to 1970 and 1971 to present.\n\n\n\nThe Nomination Panel considers a candidate\u2019s outstanding service and overall contribution to the Carlton Football Club.\n\nThey may also consider a candidates individual record, ability, integrity, sportsmanship, and character.\n\nThe number of games played or coached or years of administration and years of service is only a guide and not a determining factor.\n\nIn 1997, the Club also introduced 'Legend' status to coincide with the opening of the 'Legends Stand' and newly-introduced Legend status component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

A champion player whose falling-out with coach Jack Worrall in 1910 had ramifications for both men, he played a vital role in each of the Blues\u2019 first five Premierships.\n\n\n\nBruce Comben - 1950-1961\n\n\n\nBruce \u201cBugsy\u201d Comben was a hugely popular and loyal servant of the Carlton Football Club for more than fifty years. After earning a wide appreciation for his courage, honesty, and reliability on the field in his 188 games between 1950 and 1961, he went on to further serve the Blues in many other administrative roles, as diverse as a committeeman, selector, player\u2019s representative, recruiting officer and team manager.\n\n\n\nSergio Silvagni - 1958-1971\n\n\n\nAfter 239 games and 136 goals, two Premierships, one year as captain, two Best & Fairest awards and two Big V appearances, he went on to further serve the Blues as a committeeman, selector, and even a caretaker coach.\n\nInducted in 1990:\n\nGeorge Coulthard - 1876-1882\n\n\n\nPerhaps the first superstar of Australian Football (or Victorian Rules as it was then known), George Coulthard joined the fledgling Carlton Football Club as a 19-year-old in 1876. A local farmer, Coulthard had already established himself as a brilliant cricketer. But when he donned the blue cap of Carlton and ran out to join in the game that had gripped the colony like no other, Coulthard was a sensation.\n\n\n\nCreswell \"Mick\" Crisp - 1931-1941\n\n\n\nAt first, a dangerous flanker who combined brilliantly with Carlton\u2019s champion full-forward Harry 'Soapy' Vallence, he later moved into the centre, where his tenacity and outstanding foot skills helped drive the Blues to the 1938 Premiership.\n\n\n\nRobert Walls - 1967-1978\n\n\n\nHe was just sixteen years old when he played his first game for Carlton, and goaled with his first kick.

His father was a Premiership player with South Melbourne in 1918, and Chooka himself won a flag with Carlton in 1947. When Chooka's son Scott Howell played in the Blues\u2019 1981 Premiership team, the Howells became the only family to have produced VFL Premiership footballers in three successive generations.\n\n\n\nWayne Johnston - 1979-1990\n\n\n\nA brilliant, hard-running, aggressive mid-fielder in four Carlton Premiership teams, Wayne Johnston was a player ahead of his time. Years before athletic endurance and absolute intensity became prime requirements of a league footballer, Johnston; \u2018The Dominator\u2019 carved his name with capitals into the history of the Carlton Football Club.\n\n\n\nInducted in 1992:\n\nJim Clark - 1943-1951\n\n\n\nInvariably described as loyal, brave and determined, James Robinson (Jim) Clark was a star for the Blues through the uncertain years of World War II, and the youngest member of Carlton\u2019s 1945 Premiership team.\n\n\n\nErn Henfry - 1944, 1947-1952\n\n\n\nAt 182 cms and 82 kg he was big for a centreman, but his wonderful foot skills, his pace and his evasiveness made him a matchwinner. A Premiership Captain in 1947, Henfry won the Club Best & Fairest twice in his 84-game career with the Blues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdrian Gallagher - 1964-1972\n\n\n\nOver eight seasons, Gallagher was an integral part of the greatest first ruck of all. He developed an instinctive, almost telepathic combination with champion ruckman John Nicholls and ruck-rover Serge Silvagni in an era when this trio were the platform for two Carlton Premierships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Fitzpatrick - 1975-1983\n\n\n\nAt 191 cm and 91 kg he gave away height and weight to many opponents, but he was clever, athletic and an outstanding mark. Adept at assessing his opponents' strengths and weaknesses, he was a fierce competitor who hated being beaten. Three-time Premiership player, including two as Captain.\n\nInducted in 1993:\n\nFrank Gill - 1929-1942\n\n\n\nRegarded as one of the very best in an era of star full-backs, Frank Gill was a Carlton stalwart for 14 seasons.

Twice Best & Fairest, two-time Premiership player and regular State representative, in 268 games he kicked 31 goals in his rare forays forward.\n\nInducted in 1995:\n\nMark Maclure - 1974-1986\n\n\n\nIn a long and successful career with the Blues between 1974 and 1986, \u201cSellers\u201d Maclure wore his number 36 guernsey in 243 games, including solid contributions in each of the 1979, 1981, and 1982 Carlton Premierships.\n\nCraig Bradley - 1986-2002\n\n\n\nA consummate professional whose outstanding ball-winning ability, accurate disposal, punishing non-stop running and longevity in the game made him one of the all-time greats. \u201cBraddles\u201d captained the Blues for three years, won two AFL Premierships, and picked up almost every possible honour in a stellar career that spanned 17 seasons and a record 375 games for the Carlton Football Club.\n\nJustin Madden - 1983-1997\n\n\n\nMadden was one of Carlton\u2019s great ruckmen; a 206-centimetre beanpole with outstanding tap skills, strong hands, and reliable left foot when shooting for goal. In a marathon 18-year AFL career that began at Essendon and flourished at Carlton, Harry played 332 senior games and kicked 190 goals between 1980 and 1996.\n\nInducted in 1996:\n\nJim Francis - 1934-1943\n\n\n\nFrancis was barely tall enough for a key position at 183 cm and 80 kg, but he was athletic, extraordinarily versatile, and a booming right foot kick.

With his spindly frame, his socks down around his ankles and his trademark mop of unruly hair, Hunter ran into, and flew over packs from all angles to take spectacular marks week after week. Absolutely fearless in his pursuit of the football, he never shirked the fiercest of physical clashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dean - 1984-1998\n\n\n\nThroughout his 248 games with the Navy Blues \u2013 including the '87 and '95 Premierships \u2013 \u2018Deanie\u2019 (later also dubbed \u2018Helmet\u2019 for his mullet haircut, or \u2018The General\u2019 for his on-field leadership) was one of the most popular Carlton players of his era.\n\nInducted in 1999:\n\nLaurie Kerr - 1950-1959\n\n\n\nIf three words were needed to sum up Laurie Kerr as a footballer, then they would surely be speed, aggression and courage. A blisteringly-quick winger, centreman or half-forward flanker, Kerr was a star player in a bleak period for the Blues from 1950 to \u201959, and later, an influential figure in the Carlton Football Club for more than thirty years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Hall - 1963-1973\n\n\n\nKevin \"Racehorse\" Hall was a solid, reliable, often inspirational member of three Premiership teams for the Blues, and later, a valuable and long-serving committee and board member.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Alvin - 1984-1994\n\n\n\nEasily distinguished on the field by his long, shoulder-length hair, Alvin played 218 games and kicked 95 goals. A member of the 1987 Premiership side, he represented Victoria on six occasions.\n\nBrett Ratten - 1990-2003\n\n\n\nBrett Ratten\u2019s career at the Carlton Football Club is a story of talent, determination, courage, and loyalty.

Nevertheless, he went on to carve his name into AFL history as a champion centreman at Geelong and Sydney, before returning to Princes Park and Premiership glory with the Blues. For sheer ball-getting ability, tenacity, and pin-point disposal by hand or by foot, Diesel Williams had few peers.\n\nInducted in 2000:\n\nGarry Crane - 1964-1976\n\n\n\nRenowned for his boundless courage, perseverance, and sheer ball-getting ability, Garry Crane was an outstanding big-occasion player for the Navy Blues in a celebrated 13-year career between 1964 and 1976.\n\n\n\nJim Buckley - 1976-1990\n\n\n\nJimmy Buckley played his first senior game in guernsey number 16 at the tender age of 16 years, 6 months and 18 days, making him the equal-youngest Blue of all. In a career stretching 15 seasons, Buckley would play in three Premiership teams and won the Best & Fairest award in 1982.\n\n\n\nWayne Harmes - 1977-1988\n\n\n\nA true utility, he was perhaps at his best in a back pocket, yet never failed to produce wherever he was asked to play. Just 177 cm tall, his barrel chest and solid legs meant he tipped the scales at 85 kg. He was surprisingly quick for his build, a safe mark, and a dangerous near goal, and he loved bursting through packs to set up play at both ends of the ground.\n\n\n\nMichael Sexton - 1990-2000\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton\u2019s brightest stars in the last decade of the 20th century was Michael Sexton; a skilled, resolute defender who was born in New Guinea and grew up in Bendigo.\n\nInducted in 2001:\n\nIan Collins - 1961-1969 & 1971\n\n\n\nA courageous, uncompromising back pocket in the Blues' 1968 Premiership team, Ian Collins went on to serve as Secretary-Manager and President through some of Carlton Football Club's most successful, and later, most turbulent times.\n\n\n\nDavid Glascott - 1981-1991\n\n\n\nWith his slender build, his longish blonde hair and his baby face, he seemed anything but a star VFL footballer. But looks are often deceiving, and in Glascott\u2019s case, the fresh face and spindly legs belonged to a determined and skillful midfielder who was a valuable member of three Carlton Premiership teams.\n\n\n\nAndrew McKay - 1993-2003\n\n\n\nA warrior at half-back for the Blues for 11 seasons, he was resolute, reliable and most of the time, utterly impassable. His career began with a Grand Final defeat in his debut year, then soared to redemption only two seasons later. From then on, through the near-misses of 1999 and 2000, and into the looming catastrophe of the first decade of this troubled century, Andrew Ian McKay stood \u2013 and still stands \u2013 as an all-time great of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nInducted in 2006:\n\nJack Worrall - 1902-1909\n\n\n\nThe first-ever coach of a VFL club. He was a brilliant leader, coaching the Old Dark Navy Blues in 144 games for 100 wins, 1 draw and 43 losses, including the 1906, 1907 and 1908 Premierships.\n\n\n\nGeorge Bruce - 1903-1913\n\n\n\nA pacey winger with flair and impeccable ground skills, he was almost unstoppable throughout Carlton\u2019s historic hat-trick of Premierships in 1906 to 1908, and was regarded as one of the game\u2019s first great big-occasion players.\n\n\n\nPaddy O'Brien - 1913-1925\n\n\n\nPatrick Joseph \u201cPaddy\u201d O\u2019Brien was almost the perfect footballer for his era. Highly skilled, athletic and as tough as teak, he played 167 games and kicked 7 goals for Carlton in a celebrated career that stretched over 13 seasons between 1913 and 1925. Two of those matches were Grand Final victories; in 1914 over South Melbourne and in 1915 over Collingwood.\n\n\n\nJim Baird - 1941-1943 & 1945-1951\n\n\n\nJim Baird was a two-time VFL Premiership player for the Carlton Football Club, and one of the great all-round sportsmen of the post-World War II era.\n\n\n\nBryan Quirk - 1965-1975\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton's greats, Bryan Quirk was the football equivalent of a champion greyhound. A tall, beautifully balanced, long-kicking winger or half-forward, he arrived at Carlton at the dawn of the Barassi era, and carved out a celebrated, if unlucky career.\n\n\n\nSyd Jackson - 1969-1976\n\n\n\nA gifted, courageous aboriginal footballer who was a star in two Carlton Premiership teams. In 2005 he was named in the AFL Players Association Indigenous Team of the Century, and in 2006 he became the Carlton Heroes\u2019 inaugural inductee into the Carlton Hall of Fame - an honour that everyone who saw him play would agree, was richly deserved.\n\n\n\nPeter McConville - 1978-1985\n\n\n\nWidely regarded for his consistency and his versatility, the powerful barrel-chested utility was a key factor in Carlton's golden run of three Premierships in four years from 1979 to 1982.\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou - 1979-1986\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou was a member of Carlton\u2019s fabled mosquito fleet of brilliant small men of the 1970\u2019s and \u201880\u2019s, and a three-time Premiership rover for the Blues.\n\n\n\nFraser Brown - 1989-2000\n\n\n\nThe shaggy-haired Brown, who wore #20 in 177 games for the Blues, was a tough and fair midfielder with the occasional stint forward. He was a solid 'inside' midfielder with creative disposal, but lacked a yard in pace. And when we say 'solid' we mean 'brick solid' given his 90 kilo, 181 cm frame. He formed an amazing engine room with other Legends Greg Williams and Brett Ratten, providing considerable ball winning ability to the Carlton teams of the 1990's.\n\n\n\nKen Sheldon - 1977-1986\n\n\n\n\u201cBomba\u201d Sheldon was an important member of Carlton\u2019s famed mosquito fleet of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Just 178 cm and 76 kg, he was a nippy, courageous rover who became a versatile utility as his career progressed.\n\nInducted in 2011:\n\nRon Barassi - 1965-1971\n\n\n\nIn a VFL career in which he played 254 games and kicked 329 goals, he wore our Navy Blue guernsey in 50 games, kicked 35 goals, and coached six seasons for two memorable Premierships. More importantly, he had swept away the complacent attitudes that existed before his arrival, and built the platform for Carlton's dominance in the next decade.\n\n\n\nVin Gardiner - 1907-1917\n\n\n\nMore than 90 years after he played his last match for the Blues, Gardiner still ranks tenth overall in our club\u2019s list of all-time career goals. Described as the \u2018biggest kick, inch for inch\u2019 of his era, Gardiner led Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking in seven of his eleven seasons, and was also the VFL\u2019s leading scorer in 1911.\n\n\n\nJohn Goold - 1963-1970\n\n\n\nA brilliant, flamboyant, two-time Premiership player for Carlton during the Barassi years in the \u2018swingin\u2019 sixties,\u2019 John William Crosbie Goold became almost as famous for his dapper appearance off the field, as for his exploits on it.\n\n\n\nAnthony Koutoufides - 1992-2007\n\n\n\nThroughout the history of VFL/AFL football, few individual players have actually changed the game. However, such was the impact of Anthony Koutoufides - \u201cKouta\u201d to the masses of Blues supporters he thrilled during his celebrated 15-season career at Princes Park between 1992 and 2007 \u2013 that today he is recognised as the prototype of the 21st-century footballer.\n\nDavid Parkin - 1981-1985 & 1991-2000\n\n\n\nAmong the most respected figures in the long history of the Carlton Football Club, David Parkin was already a household name at Hawthorn when he arrived at Princes Park in 1981 to coach the Blues to three Premierships in fifteen interrupted seasons.\n\nInducted in 2013:\n\nDavid Rhys-Jones - 1985-1992\n\n\n\nRhys-Jones' rare football talents were sometimes lost in his all-too-frequent Tribunal visits. Not so at Carlton, the club to which the 1987 premiership player and Norm Smith Medallist committed in 108 matches (after 76 with the Swans).\n\nInducted in 2016:\n\nScott Camporeale - 1995-2005\n\nA member of Carlton's 1995 premiership team in his debut season, the man endearingly known as 'Campo' went on to play 233 games in the navy blue, earning All-Australian selection and a club best-and-fairest award in 2000.\n\nMil Hanna - 1986-1997\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Hanna quickly became a cult figure among the Carlton faithful in a celebrated 11-season career which included the famous 1995 premiership. The curtain came down on Mil\u2019s 190-game Carlton career in 1997, but the boy from East Brunswick still maintains his love for the club with which he shares a deep-rooted territorial link.\n\nIan Robertson - 1966-1974\n\nRenowned for his running capacity and prodigious, penetrating kicking, Robertson was a fixture in a famed centreline comprising Bryan Quirk and Garry Crane through what was arguably Carlton\u2019s greatest era. The grand final triumphs of 1968, \u201970 and \u201972 would crown a 125-game Carlton career for Robertson, whose later football life involved gamecalling for the Seven Network.\n\nJack Wrout (dec.) - 1936-1944\n\nThe late Wrout first embarked on a senior League career at North Melbourne in 1931, but after 53 games in six seasons with the Shinboners, became increasingly frustrated with a lack of opportunity. In 1936, Wrout crossed to Carlton and emerged as a star forward in the Blues\u2019 1938 grand final team, which broke the Club\u2019s record 22-year premiership drought. Five years later, he took the honors as his club\u2019s leading goalkicker.\n\nInducted in 2018:\n\nBrent Crosswell - 1968-1975\n\nRecruited to the club from the Tasmanian convict locale of Campbell Town, Brent Crosswell is remembered as a prodigious if enigmatic football talent \u2013 a genuine star in the star-studded Barassi-coached Carlton teams of the late 1960s/early \u201970s.\n\nThough his career would fall two games adrift of 100 in dark Navy, \u2018Tiger\u2019 impacted tremendously on football\u2019s grandest stage, as a member of the Blues\u2019 drought-breaking Grand Final victory of 1968 and perhaps their most famous of all Grand Final triumphs in 1970.\n\nLance Whitnall - 1997-2007\n\nThe son of Carlton\u2019s 66-game player Graeme, Lance Whitnall was considered the heir apparent to Stephen Kernahan as the club\u2019s pre-eminent tall forward \u2013 a lofty task to be sure, but one to which Whitnall committed with purpose from the outset.\n\nIn 216 games through 11 seasons from 1997, Whitnall - or \u2018Big Red\u2019 as he was endearingly dubbed \u2013 capably served in Carlton\u2019s front half, until a persistent knee problem at just 28 brought premature end to his on-field tenure.\n\nInducted in 2023:\n\nPercy Bentley - 1941-1955\n\nSince the formation of the VFL in 1897, only David Parkin has coached the Carlton Football Club more times than Percy Bentley - and few have served the Blues longer and with greater distinction than the former Richmond champion.\n\nBentley commandeered Carlton to the famous Premierships of 1945 and 1947 Premierships, then dedicated most of the remaining years of his life to the football club as Vice-President.\n\nFor Bentley, Carlton was everything.\n\nAdrian Gleeson - 1986-1996\n\nHailing from the rolling green fields of Koroit in Victoria's western districts, Gleeson fast earned a reputation as one of Carlton's truly durable small men, and a more than handy successor to the retiring Rod Ashman.\n\nIn tandem with the Blues' runners - the likes of Craig Bradley, Mark Naley and Fraser Murphy, Gleeson savoured Premiership success in 1987 and would capably serve his club through 176 games as a player before committing his time and substantial energies at board level.\n\nChris Judd - 2008-2015\n\nChris Judd joined Carlton from West Coast in a hail of publicity - and from the outset validated the club's greatest recruiting coup since Ron Barassi.\n\nNamed captain in his maiden season with the Blues, Judd reinforced his status as one of League football's truly great players of the early 20th century - landing the John Nicholls Medal for Carlton's Best & Fairest on three occasions, as well as the Brownlow Medal for the competition's preeminent player, through 145 quality games - before giving back at board level as a Carlton director.\n\nCarlton Football Club Hall of Fame Legends:\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the opening of the Legends Stand at Princes Park and the newly-introduced Legend component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Carlton elevated nine of its own Hall of Fame Inductees to Legend status for the first time.\n\nAccordingly, Craig Bradley, Bert Deacon, Bruce Doull, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Johnston, Stephen Kernahan, John Nicholls, Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence were elevated following a vote of Club supporters.\n\nToday, a total of 14 Carlton Inductees are recognized as Legends, with Ken Hands having been elevated in 2006, Robert Walls in 2011, Geoff Southby in 2013, Sergio Silvagni in 2016 and David McKay in 2021.\n\nElevated in 1997:\n\nCraig Bradley\n\nBert Deacon\n\nAlex Jesaulenko\n\nBruce Doull\n\nWayne Johnston\n\nStephen Kernahan\n\nJohn Nicholls\n\nStephen Silvagni\n\nHarry Vallence\n\nElevated in 2006:\n\nKen Hands\n\nElevated in 2011:\n\nRobert Walls\n\nElevated in 2013:\n\nGeoff Southby\n\nElevated in 2016:\n\nSergio Silvagni\n\nElevated in 2021:\n\nDavid McKay\n\nElevated in 2023:\n\nHorrie Clover\n\nIan Collins"}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/764340/the-story-of-dudley-drew-and-the-lost-painting-of-bert-deacon", "page_content": "\n\nDudley Drew talks to CFC TV about his memories of his friend Bert Deacon, and about the painting he has just completed of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road.\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nBack in 1948, a budding Melbourne artist named Dudley Drew was trying to eke out an existence in his adopted profession when, on the advice of his dear mother, he resolved to paint somebody famous.\n\nDudley\u2019s Mum volunteered the name of Carlton centre half-back the late great Bert Deacon. After all, Deacon had just come off a stellar season, having taken out the 1947 Brownlow Medal, represented Carlton in its eighth premiership and earned Victorian and All-Australian selection.\n\nHow well Dudley remembers the moment. \u201cMy mother was blind, and when Bert won the Brownlow I was sitting with Mum in the bedroom talking to her one night and she said, \u2018You should paint a portrait of Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Dudley explained.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 and she said \u2018I think it will be wonderful for you\u2019. I then said \u2018How do I do this?\u2019 and she said \u2018Go and see him\u2019.\u201d\n\nDudley made his way to 2 Hawker Avenue, Preston, where Bert and Jean then lived. \u201cWhen I got there this particular night, around about seven o\u2019clock, Bert was already in bed because he was injured - he\u2019d injured his leg playing football, but he and Jean just welcomed me so much. It was great and I felt so proud,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI then asked Bert if he would pose for the big portrait and he said \u2018I\u2019d be very happy to do that\u2019. He sat for the portrait about eight times and I remember in one sitting he began to smile, exposing this toothless gap. He was painted sporting grey trousers and navy blue blazer with the white V on the pocket and included in the painting is a trophy Bert also won for best afield for Victoria.\n\n\u201cTowards the end Bert said, \u2018You know I really love this painting and I\u2019m going to tell everybody about the greatest artist in the world\u2019, and he did. He sent many people to me to have their portraits painted. He was just great. No wonder I cried when he went to heaven.\n\nThough Bert and his wife Jean were thrilled with Dudley\u2019s gift, they had nowhere in their small home to hang the sizeable canvas. For a brief period the portrait found a wall in the city sports store of the former Collingwood footballer Ron Todd, but at some point in 1948 it was returned to Dudley\u2019s home and stored in a shed \u2013 which is where the work unfortunately came to grief.\n\nAs the artist explained, the painting toppled on to a steel table which pierced the canvas beyond repair.\n\nThe story might have ended then and there, were it not for this reporter\u2019s chance viewing of a photograph of the original portrait in a scrapbook in Jean\u2019s keep. Jean revealed that Dudley, now in his 80s, was the artist responsible and was alive and well in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs.\n\nThe question then begged. Sixty years on, would Dudley be up for the job of repainting the portrait from the photograph of the original? Remarkably, Dudley explained that the very thought had recently crossed his mind and that yes, he would commit to the task of recreating the image of Deacon, who died suddenly while serving Carlton as club secretary back in 1974.\n\nAnd so it was that the new version of the old Bert Deacon was this week unveiled by Dudley in the presence of Bert\u2019s widow, Jean and son Robert. The portrait is basically true to the original, but boasts one slight embellishment - Dudley has painted in Bert\u2019s \u201947 Brownlow, which can be seen dangling from the trophy.\n\n\u201cTo think that 60 years on I\u2019ve brought that painting back to life,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a great story?\u201d\n\nDudley has also just completed a work of Deacon completing a high mark over Richmond\u2019s Roy Smeaton at Punt Road, based on a press photograph Bert handed him years before.\n\n\u201cBert had given me a copy of this photograph, which carried a handwritten message in the top left hand corner \u2013 \u2018To my friend Dud - regards, Bert Deacon\u2019,\u201d Drew said.\n\nRegrettably the photograph was later stolen and all was thought lost . . . until early last year when Jean again came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cI went out to Jean\u2019s house and sat down with her, during which time she showed me the family photo album . . . that\u2019s where I came across another copy of this photograph,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Jean, you must let me borrow this. I want to paint this picture\u2019. That happened about a year and a half ago\u2019.\u201d\n\nFor the past nine months, Drew, now in his early 80s, has put brush to canvas to recreate the Deacon image. The paint was still drying when he recently unveiled the canvas.\n\n\u201cBert actually told me that the Richmond fellow in front of the marking contest is George Smeaton and Jack Wrout is sandwiched between them,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\u201cRon Savage is the Carlton player watching on, but I\u2019m not sure of the identity of the other Richmond player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Drew is somewhat circumspect when asked what will become of the Bert Deacon artworks. Perhaps a Carlton-friendly benefactor might see fit to purchase the paintings and make them available on permanent loan to the Club.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the life of a painting,\u201d said the man who has also painted the portraits of such luminaries as Archbishop Daniel Mannix, King O\u2019Malley and \u201cWeary\u201d Dunlop.\n\nBut there can be no doubting the strength of the lifelong bond Dudley and Bert forged from the moment they met at the house in Hawker Avenue back in \u201948.\n\n\u201cI had a friendship with and a great admiration for this fellow, and his wife Jean,\u201d Dudley said.\n\n\u201cBert and I became great friends and I could tell you many stories about him. He was a wonderful man. The day he died I remember picking up a paper. It was all over the front page and I just cried.\n\n\u201cOne night we met in the city and we were on our way to my parents place in Albert Park for dinner. We caught the tram here as he didn\u2019t have a car then, nor did I. And I remember saying to him, I should have been as tall as you Bert, and he said to me \u2018Dud, diamonds were never made as big as bricks\u2019. So that made me feel good and every time I see someone bigger than me I think of the diamond.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://blueseum.org/Bert+Deacon", "page_content": "Milestones\n\nVideo\n\nBert Deacon holds a special place among the legends of the Carlton Football Club. Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old.

In An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he attacked the neo-empiricist assumptions prevalent in early analytic philosophy and advocated a logical transformation of metaphysics from a study of being or ontology to a study of the absolute presuppositions or heuristic principles which govern different forms of enquiry. Collingwood thus occupies a distinctive position in the history of British philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century. He rejects equally the neo-empiricist assumptions that prevailed in early analytic philosophy and the kind of metaphysics that the analytical school sought to overthrow. His logical reform of metaphysics also ensures a distinctive role and subject matter for philosophical enquiry and is thus far from advocating a merely therapeutic conception of philosophy or the dissolution of philosophical into linguistic analysis in the manner of ordinary language philosophy.\n\nHe is often described as one of the British Idealists, although the label fails to capture his distinctive kind of idealism, which is conceptual rather than metaphysical. In his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle, Collingwood himself explicitly rejected the label \u201cidealist\u201d because he did not endorse the arch-rationalist assumptions that shaped much British idealism at the end of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth century and consequently did not wish to be identified with it.\n\nCollingwood is the author of two of the most important treatises in meta-philosophy written in the first half of the twentieth century, An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). They both contain a sustained discussion of the role and character of philosophical analysis and why the method of philosophy is distinct from and irreducible to the methods of the natural and the exact sciences.\n\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) was a British philosopher and practising archaeologist best known for his work in aesthetics and the philosophy of history. During the 1950s and 1960s his philosophy of history, in particular, occupied centre stage in the debate concerning the nature of explanation in the social sciences and whether or not they are ultimately reducible to explanations in the natural sciences. Primarily through the interpretative efforts of W. H. Dray, Collingwood\u2019s work in the philosophy of history came to be seen as providing a powerful antidote against Carl Hempel\u2019s claim for methodological unity.\n\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nR.G. Collingwood was born in 1889 at Cartmel Fell, Lancashire, at the southern tip of Windermere. His father, W.G. Collingwood, was an archaeologist, artist, and acted as John Ruskin\u2019s private secretary in the final years of Ruskin\u2019s life; his mother was also an artist and a talented pianist. When he was two years old the family moved to Lanehead, on the shore of Coniston Water, close to Ruskin\u2019s house at Brantwood.\n\nCollingwood was taught at home until the age of thirteen when he went to preparatory school and the following year to Rugby School. In 1908 he went up to University College, Oxford, to read Literae Humaniores. He was elected as a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, while still taking his final examinations.\n\nOn beginning his philosophical studies in 1910 he came under the influence of the Oxford realists, especially E.F. Carritt and John Cook Wilson. Until around 1916 he was a professed realist; however, his realism was progressively undermined by his close engagement with continental philosophy, especially the work of Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile. This was partly the result of his friendship with J.A. Smith, Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy from 1910 to 1935. In 1913 he published an English translation of Croce\u2019s The Philosophy of Giambattista Vico; he was later to translate many other works by both Croce and Guido de Ruggiero. Both Croce and de Ruggiero were personal as well as philosophical friends, although his relationship with de Ruggiero was closer.\n\nMuch of Collingwood\u2019s early work was in theology and the philosophy of religion, under the influence of \u201cThe Group\u201d or \u201cCumnor Circle\u201d, a gathering of Church of England modernists. In 1916 he published an essay on \u201cThe Devil\u201d in a collection produced by this group, and also his first book Religion and Philosophy.\n\nAt the same time Collingwood was engaged in practical archaeological work, spending his summers from 1912 onwards directing excavations of Roman sites in the north of England. Although he sometimes described his archaeology as a hobby, he nonetheless became an authority on the history and archaeology of Roman Britain, conducting many excavations, writing hundreds of papers, and systematically working his way around the country recording and transcribing Roman inscriptions.\n\nDuring the First World War Collingwood applied for a commission in the army but was rejected because of his poor eyesight. Having been a keen cadet at Rugby School and an enthusiast for the National Service League, this came as a blow. From January 1916 onwards Collingwood spent most of his time living and working in London in the Intelligence Section of the Admiralty; although he continued to see pupils in Oxford weekly, he gave no lectures between 1916 and 1919. He left the Admiralty in June 1919 and resumed lecturing in January 1920. During his time at the Admiralty he was the main author of two book length reports: A Manual of Belgium and the Adjoining Territories (1918); and A Manual of Alsace-Lorraine (1919). A spin off from this work was his entry on Luxemburg in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (12th ed., 1921).\n\nIn late 1919 Collingwood wrote an extensive survey of the history of the ontological proof, together with an analysis of the argument. This survey was given as a series of lectures in the early 1920s. He drew on this material in some of his later work, especially in Faith and Reason (1928), An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933) and An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). In 1924 Collingwood wrote Speculum Mentis. This was a dialectic of what he termed \u201cforms of experience\u201d: art, religion, science, history, and philosophy. During this period he was also lecturing on ethics, Roman history, the philosophy of history, and aesthetics: his Outlines of a Philosophy of Art (based on his lectures) was published in 1925.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and early 1930s Collingwood was also heavily engaged in historical and archaeological work, publishing The Archaeology of Roman Britain in 1930 and several editions of Roman Britain. The culmination of this work was his survey of Roman Britain in Roman Britain and the English Settlements (1936) and his contribution to Tenney Frank\u2019s Economic Survey of Ancient Rome (1937). To add to his self-imposed burden of overwork, his abilities as a linguistically versatile polymath (he was able to read scholarly work in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Latin, and Greek) were in great demand from 1928 onwards in his capacity as a Delegate to the Clarendon Press.\n\nPartly as a result of serious overwork coupled with insomnia, Collingwood\u2019s health went into decline from the early 1930s. In April 1931 he suffered complications arising from chicken pox and began to suffer from high blood pressure. He was granted leave of absence by the university; following his return, in the autumn of 1932, he began writing an important new book, regarded by many as the pinnacle of his philosophical achievement\u2014An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933). This had its origins in the methodological introduction to the lectures on moral philosophy he had delivered annually throughout the preceding decade. The Essay was a sustained investigation of the nature of philosophical reasoning through an examination of the distinctive character of philosophical concepts. Following publication of the Essay, Collingwood focused his philosophical energies on the philosophy of history and the philosophy of nature. The lectures he delivered at this time later formed the basis of the posthumously published The Idea of History (1946) and The Idea of Nature (1945).\n\nIn 1935 Collingwood succeeded J.A. Smith as Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy and moved from Pembroke to Magdalen College. He delivered his inaugural lecture on The Historical Imagination in October of that year. He had been elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1934 and delivered a lecture on Human Nature and Human History to the Academy in May 1936. These two lectures were later incorporated into The Idea of History.\n\nIn 1937 Collingwood wrote The Principles of Art (1938); whilst correcting the proofs he suffered a stroke, the first of many to come. From this time onwards he was conscious that he was writing on borrowed time. His An Autobiography (1939) records his determination to put on record an account of the work he hoped to do but might not live to complete. During a recuperative voyage to the Dutch East Indies in 1938\u20139 he wrote An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) and began work on what he regarded as his magnum opus, The Principles of History (not published until 1995). In 1939 he sailed around the Greek islands with a group of Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford\u2014a journey memorably recollected and evoked in The First Mate\u2019s Log (1940). On his return to Oxford Collingwood lectured on moral and political philosophy and worked at The New Leviathan (1942) which he saw as his contribution to the war effort. He wrote the book against a background of increasingly debilitating strokes.\n\nR.G. Collingwood died in Coniston on 9 January 1943; he was nearly 54. He is buried in Coniston churchyard in an unassuming grave between his parents and John Ruskin. He was succeeded in the Waynflete Chair by Gilbert Ryle.\n\n2.1 Philosophical distinctions and the overlap of classes\n\nCollingwood\u2019s first mature work, An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), is a substantial treatise in metaphilosophy which seeks to delineate the subject matter and method of philosophical analysis. Here Collingwood says that the true work of philosophy is \u201cthe distinguishing of concepts \u2026coexisting in their instances\u201d (EPM 2005: 51). The moral philosopher, for example, distinguishes between different kinds of good: the pleasant, the expedient, and the right (EPM 2005: 41). When philosophers distinguish between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right as species of the good they are not sorting things into mutually exclusive classes. If this were their goal then the philosophical distinction between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right would imply that\n\nwhatever is pleasant must therefore be both inexpedient and wrong; that whatever is expedient must be both wrong and unpleasant, and that whatever is right must be both unpleasant and inexpedient. (EPM 2005: 41)\n\nBut this is clearly not the case because philosophers allow that one and the same action may be brought under different descriptions depending on whether it is motivated by desire (the pursuit of pleasure), by self-interest (expediency) or by duty (the right). Because philosophical distinctions bring objects under different descriptions rather than sorting them into classes, they defy the rules which apply to the relation between genera and species in the traditional theory of classification (EPM: 31). In the traditional theory of classification, the adjacent species of a genus tend to be mutually exclusive. Natural history, for example, classifies organisms into animals and vegetables, animals into vertebrates and invertebrates, vertebrates into mammals, birds, reptiles, and so on. These adjacent species tend to capture mutually exclusive classes (the class of vertebrates is different from the class of invertebrates; the class of animals is different from the class of vegetables). While there may be some overlap between adjacent species in this type of classification (the platypus is an animal that suckles its young like a mammal and lies eggs like a bird) these cases are \u201cexceptional and limited\u201d (EPM: 30). Overlap of classes, on the other hand, is a \u201cregular\u201d feature of philosophical distinctions. (EPM: 36). Philosophical distinctions allow for complete not merely partial overlap. It is not merely the case, for example, that some actions may exemplify both the concept of expediency and that of the right (in the way in which the platypus is both a mammal and a bird or amphibians are both aquatic and terrestrial animals), but that in principle any action which falls under one species of a philosophical genus could also fall under its adjacent concept: the class of actions which instantiate the principle of expediency could therefore in principle be the very same as the class of actions which instantiate the principle of duty. Collingwood\u2019s point when claiming that the concepts of expediency and duty overlap goes beyond the epistemic consideration that it is difficult to know a person\u2019s motive in acting, whether they were motivated by duty or by expediency; his point is rather that a philosophical distinction is \u201ca distinction without a difference, that is, a distinction in the concepts without a difference in the instances\u201d (EPM: 50). To say that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a difference\u201d is not derogatively to dismiss them as insignificant pedantic distinctions, but to point out that philosophically to disambiguate concepts is not the same activity as sorting things into classes. To disambiguate the concept of love from that of jealousy, (not Collingwood\u2019s example) is not the same as sorting partners into the separate classes of loving and jealous ones. By the same token to disambiguate the conception of the good into the pleasant, the expedient, and the right is not the same as sorting actions into those performed in the pursuit of pleasure, self-interest, or duty. The distinction between the pleasant, the expedient, and the right, (as with the distinction between love and jealousy) is a distinction that philosophers would want to make even if the world were such that actions motivated by duty necessarily benefitted the agent so that the class of actions motivated by self-interest or by duty would contain the very same members. Philosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions to which there may correspond no difference in the class of objects falling under the concepts that philosophical analysis disambiguates.\n\nConcepts, Collingwood says, may be viewed from two perspectives, their extension and their intension. From the point of view of their extension a concept is \u201cgeneral\u201d in so far as it gathers under itself \u201cthe plurality of its individual instances\u201d. From the point of view of their intension a concept is generic in so far as it gathers \u201cthe plurality of its specific differentiations\u201d:\n\nThus the concept of colour unites all the individual colours of all individual coloured things into a class of which they are members; but it also unites the specific colours red, orange, yellow, green, and so forth into a genus of which they are the species. It may be convenient to refer to the former unification by saying that the concept is general, to the latter by saying that it is generic. (EPM 2005: 28\u201329)\n\nIn the traditional doctrine of classification intensional distinctions piggyback on extensional ones:\n\nThe logical doctrine of classification, as it stands in the ordinary text-books, implies a certain definite connexion between these two characteristics of the concept: namely that if a genus is distinguished into a certain number of species, the class of its instances can be correspondingly divided into an equal number of sub-classes. Each sub-class will comprise the instances of one specific concept; the totality of the sub-classes will comprise that of the generic concept\u2026 (EPM 2005: 29)\n\nPhilosophical distinctions do not follow this logic because they do not presuppose that the concepts the philosopher disambiguates capture a specific set or class. The task of philosophical analysis precisely is to distinguish concepts which coincide in their instances. When two philosophical concepts coincide in their instances the thing which exemplifies them is not a hybrid, as amphibians or the platypus are. It is one thing seen from different perspective or brought under different descriptions. So, for example, a song exemplifies the concepts of music and poetry, but to say this is not the same as saying that it is part music and part poetry in the way in which a centaur is part man and part horse or the platypus is part mammal and part oviparous. Aesthetic distinctions between poetry and music, like moral ones, are distinctions which bring the whole of the object, not a part of it, under a different description. Philosophical distinctions are purely intensional distinctions between distinct concepts or genera. But they are not for this reason inconsequential. Just as those who fail to disambiguate the concept of love from that of jealousy will be not be able to comprehend how a loving partner need not be jealous so those who fail to disambiguate the concept of the good will not be able to comprehend how the pursuit of what is morally right may not be in one\u2019s self-interest.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the nature of overlap of classes in philosophical distinctions informs his philosophy of mind and his approach to the question concerning the nature of the relation holding between the mind and the body. The distinction between the concept of mind and the concept of body (or matter) is a philosophical distinction. The task of the philosopher of mind is to distinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances and to disambiguate what one means, for example, when speaking about the human being qua biological being and qua person. When philosophers so distinguish between mind and body, they do not do this in the manner of natural scientists who sort animals into the classes of mammals and oviparous. Minded beings are not hybrids who are part mind and part body in the way in which the minotaur is part man and part horse:\n\nMan\u2019s body and man\u2019s mind are not two different things, but the same thing\u2026 as known in two different ways. Not a part of man, but the whole of man is body in so far as he approaches the problem of self-knowledge by the methods of natural science. Not a part of man, but the whole of man is mind, in so far as he approaches the problem of self-knowledge by expanding and clarifying the data of reflection. (NL 1992: 11)\n\nThe philosophical distinction between the concepts of mind and body is not to be confused with a real or metaphysical distinction as argued by Descartes. The claim that mind is a sui generis concept or category that is distinct from that of the body does not entail that it could exist apart from the body. Philosophical distinctions are intensional distinctions with no deep ontological implications. But the fact that they are not meant to cut reality at the joints does not mean that they do not carry any weight: those who fail to make the distinction between the concepts of mind and body are bound to fail to see a distinction between the normative/rationalizing explanations of actions and the descriptive/nomological explanation of events and espouse the view that the mind can be studied and understood in the same way as matter, by invoking causal laws. It is no surprise, therefore, that much of Collingwood\u2019s later philosophy, his philosophy of history in particular, is devoted to defending the autonomy of the explanatory practices of history (which he took to be the science of mind) from those of natural science. Distinguishing the explanandum of history, i.e., (mind), from that of science (matter/nature) is the true task of philosophy, a task that, for Collingwood, has to be distinguished from what he takes to be the pseudo problem of an enquiry into the causal relation holding between the mind and the body. The true question concerning the relation between the mind and the body\n\n\u2026 is the relation between the sciences of the body, or natural sciences, and the sciences of the mind; that is the relation enquiry into which ought to be substituted for the make-believe inquiry into the make-believe problem of \u201cthe relation between body and mind\u201d. (NL 1992: 2.49/11)\n\nAn implication of the ubiquitous nature of the overlap of classes is that the justification for the employment of philosophical concepts cannot be based on empirical observation because philosophical distinctions cannot be empirically verified. A geologist\u2019s classification of rocks into sedimentary and crystalline, for example, is based on the observable features of the two types of rocks and is empirically verifiable; by contrast philosophical distinctions such as those between the expedient and the right, mind and body, cannot be similarly justified precisely because they are distinctions in the concepts without differentiation in the instances. The justification for the deployment of philosophical concepts and distinctions lies in the fact that they enable us to bring reality under different descriptions and view it from different angles, that they enable one, for example, to judge a work of art to be aesthetically beautiful and yet morally reprehensible.\n\nIn his later philosophy Collingwood will abandon the terminology of the overlap of classes, but the commitment to the view that philosophical distinctions are \u201cdistinctions without a difference\u201d, and that the task of philosophical analysis is to distinguish between concepts which coincide in their instances remains even after this terminology is left behind. In his second metaphilosophical treatise An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he sets out to disambiguate the different senses of the term \u201ccause\u201d. The term cause can be used, in what he refers to as sense I to mean \u201creason\u201d or \u201cmotive\u201d. In sense I\n\nthat which is caused is the free and deliberate act of a conscious and responsible agent, and causing him to do it means affording him a motive for so doing. (EM 1998: 285)\n\nThis is the way in which the term is used in the historical sciences or sciences of the mind. The term \u201ccause\u201d is also used in what he refers to as sense II to denote an antecedent condition that agents have the power to produce or prevent. In this sense a cause is\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998: 296\u20137)\n\nThe term cause is used in sense II in the practical sciences of nature, sciences such as medicine and engineering. Finally, the term cause is also employed in sense III in the theoretical sciences of nature where\n\nthat which is caused is an event or state of things and its cause is another event or state of things such that (a) if the cause happens or exists, the effect must happen or exist even if no further conditions are fulfilled (b) the effect cannot happen or exist unless the cause happens or exists. (EM 1998: 285\u201386)\n\nThe main difference between sense II and sense III of the term is that whereas in the practical sciences of nature the cause of an event is an antecedent state of affairs considered from the point of view of an interest in controlling and manipulating the natural environment, in the theoretical sciences of nature the causes of natural events are viewed independently of any impact that agents can have on the natural environment: a cause in sense III is unconditional. The key difference between sense I, on the one hand, and sense II and III on the other, is that in sense II and III a cause is an antecedent condition, whereas in sense I it is a logical ground. When one explains an agent\u2019s intention in acting by ascribing the agent a motive or reason, the action is explained not by invoking something that went on before (an antecedent condition in the form of an inner psychological process) but the motive which rationalises it. Conflating sense I with either sense II or III is to conflate normative/rationalizing with causal explanations thereby also failing to grasp the distinction between their respective explananda: actions and events. The distinction between the different senses of causation, like the distinction between the expedient and the right, is not a distinction between separate classes of things; it is a distinction between concepts that may coincide in their instances.\n\n2.2 Presuppositional analysis\n\nCollingwood returned to the question of the role of philosophical analysis in his second metaphilosophical treatise, An Essay on Metaphysics (1940). While the commitment to the view that philosophy disambiguates concepts that coincide in their instances persists, Collingwood presents the role of philosophical analysis in a different way, by saying that philosophy\u2019s task is to uncover the presuppositions of thought. This change of emphasis, as we shall see, is at least in part motivated by an attempt to present his metaphilosophical views in a language to which the emerging school of analytic philosophy would have been more receptive and to engage in a dialogue with A.J. Ayer\u2019s logical positivist critique of metaphysics.\n\nThe task of philosophy, Collingwood claims in An Essay on Metaphysics, is not to assert propositions in answers to questions but to uncover presuppositions. Philosophy is therefore concerned not with propositions but with presuppositions. Propositions are answers to questions. For example, the proposition \u201cThis is a clothes line\u201d answers the question \u201cWhat is that thing for?\u201d (EM 1998: 24). Presuppositions, on the other hand give rise to questions. When one asks, \u201cWhat is that thing for?\u201d one must presuppose \u201cthat it is \u2018for\u2019 something\u201d (EM 1998: 26). Without any presuppositions the question would not arise.\n\nPresuppositions differ from propositions in one fundamental respect: propositions have truth-values. They are asserted as either true or false. Presuppositions, on the other hand lack truth values; they are neither true nor false. This is because they do not fulfil their role (that of giving rise to questions) in virtue of being true or false. Just as the validity of an inference does not depend on whether the premises from which the inference is drawn are true or false, so the \u201clogical efficacy\u201d (EM 1998: 27) of a presupposition, i.e., its power to give rise to a question, does not depend on the presupposition being either true or false, or even on being believed to be true or false. This consideration, Collingwood says,\n\nis a matter of common knowledge in scientific thinking; where it is common and even profitable to argue from suppositions we know to be false, or which we believe to be false, or concerning which we have neither knowledge nor belief as to whether we are false or true. These doubts or negations in no way affect the validity of the argument. (EM 1998: 28)\n\nWhether a statement is a \u201cproposition\u201d or a \u201cpresupposition\u201d is determined not by its content but by the role that the statement plays in the logic of question and answer. If its role is to answer a question, then it is a proposition and it has a truth-value. If its role is to give rise to a question, then it is a presupposition and it does not have a truth-value. Some statements can play different roles. They may be both propositional answers to questions and presuppositions which give rise to questions. For example, that an object is for something, that it has a function may be a presupposition which gives rise to the question \u201cwhat is that thing for?\u201d, but it may also be an answer to a question if the statement has the role of an assertion. Philosophical analysis is concerned with a special kind of presupposition, one which has only one role in the logic of question and answer, namely that of giving rise to questions. Collingwood calls these presuppositions \u201cabsolute\u201d. Absolute presuppositions are foundational assumptions that enable certain lines of questioning but are not themselves open to scrutiny. The three senses of causation discussed above are examples of absolute presuppositions which structure different forms of inquiry. A physician, for example, absolutely presupposes sense II of causation, according which a cause is\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998: 296\u20137)\n\nQua practical scientist of nature, the physician absolutely presupposes a handle or manipulability conception of causation which makes it possible to intervene in nature to achieve certain intended results, i.e., to restore health. This sense of causation is at work in statement such as \u201cThe cause of malaria is the bite of a mosquito\u201d (EM 1998: 299) or \u201cthe cause of a man\u2019s sweating is a dose of aspirin\u201d (EM 1998: 299). The presupposition is absolute because it could not be questioned without at the same time undermining the kind of inquiry it makes possible. Absolute presuppositions in this respect differ from relative presuppositions. A physician prescribes a dose of aspirin on the assumption it will cause a patient to break into a sweat. This presupposition is relative because it could potentially be overthrown by future research. But the underlying conception of causation is a condition sine qua non for practising medicine. It is these absolute presuppositions that philosophy seeks to uncover by regressing from propositional answers to the questions they are answers to, and from the questions to the presuppositions which must be made for the questions to arise.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s denial that absolute presuppositions have truth values informs a commitment to a kind of explanatory pluralism according to which the choice between different kinds of explanation does not depend on whether they capture pure being but on whether they are fit for purpose. He illustrates this explanatory pluralism by imagining a scenario in which a car stops while driving up a steep hill. As the driver stands by the side of the road a passerby, who happens to be a theoretical physicist offers his help. The car, he explains, has stopped because\n\nthe top of a hill is farther removed from the earth\u2019s centre than its bottom and \u2026 consequently more power is needed to take the car uphill than to take her along the level. (EM 1998: 302)\n\nA second passerby (who happens to be an Automobile Association man) proffers a different explanation: he holds up a loose cable and says \u201cLook here, Sir, you are running on three cylinders\u201d (EM 1998: 303). The first explanation invokes the sense of causation that belongs to the theoretical sciences of nature, sense III. The second explanation invokes the sense of causation that belongs to the practical sciences of nature, sense II. The choice between these explanations, for Collingwood is determined by the nature of the question asked. As he puts it:\n\nIf I had been a person who could flatten out hills by stamping on them the passerby would have been right to call my attention to the hill as the cause of the stoppage; not because the hill was a hill but because I was able to flatten it out. (EM 1998: 303)\n\nThis scenario illustrates that there are different explanations, corresponding to different senses of causation, each answering a different kind of question. When the different senses of causation are disambiguated, then it becomes clear that there is no conflict between the explanation of the theoretical physicist and that of the car mechanic, because they answer different kinds of questions, questions which differ because they are entailed by different absolute presuppositions. Explanations genuinely conflict with one another only if they provide answers to the same question, but they do not if they are answering different questions. The task of presuppositional analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which our thoughts get tangled when we mix and match answers of one kind with questions of another by failing to see the entailment relations which hold between presuppositions, the question to which they give rise, and the sort of propositional answers which address those questions:\n\nIn unscientific thinking our thoughts are coagulated into knots and tangles; we fish up a thought out of our minds like an anchor foul of its own cable, hanging upside-down and draped in seaweed with shellfish sticking to it and dump the whole thing on deck quite pleased with ourselves for having got it up at all. Thinking scientifically means disentangling all this mess, and reducing a knot of thoughts in which everything sticks together anyhow to a system or series of thoughts in which thinking the thoughts is at the same time thinking the connexions between them. (EM 1998: 22\u201323)\n\nThe logical inquiry into the connections holding between presuppositions, questions and answers is the true task of conceptual analysis in metaphysics, a task that must replace metaphysics traditionally understood as the study of pure being. There is no such thing as knowledge of pure being because there can be no presuppositionless knowledge and there can be no presuppositionless knowledge because all knowledge is pursued in answer to questions and no question could arise if no presuppositions were made. The study of reality under the different aspects enabled by the adoption of different presuppositions is not an ontological but a logical enquiry and metaphysics, so understood is, a \u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d (EM 1998: 18).\n\nFailure to recognise that knowledge rests on presuppositions encourages the belief that pure being is a possible object of knowledge. Traditionally it was metaphysics that was deemed to be the science of pure being. In the aftermath of the scientific revolution this role was increasingly claimed by the most fundamental of the sciences: physics. If Collingwood\u2019s claim that metaphysics should take the form of a logical enquiry into presuppositions is right, then there is no contest between metaphysics and physics or more generally between philosophy and (natural) science because no form of knowledge can claim the title of science of pure being. Philosophy does not conflict with natural science because it does not advance claims about the nature of reality but about the presuppositions under which all sciences, including natural science, operate. Nor is there conflict between (natural) science and other forms of knowledge because different forms of knowledge answer different kinds of questions, questions which arise from different presuppositions. In reminding philosophers that all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, rests on presuppositions, Collingwood rehabilitates the older, Latin sense of the term scientia which is not synonymous with natural science but with \u201ca body of systematic or orderly thinking about a determinate subject-matter\u201d (EM 1998: 4). The use of \u201cscience\u201d to mean \u201cnatural science\u201d is a slang use of the term (EM 1998: 4) that has that is symptomatic of the prevalence of scientism, the belief that only scientific knowledge is a form of knowledge and that science can answer all questions.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of absolute presuppositions generates an interesting angle on the question of scepticism concerning induction. Hume had argued that inductive inferences rely on the principle of the uniformity of nature. If it is true that the future resembles the past, then inferences such as \u201cthe sun will rise tomorrow\u201d are inductively justified. However, since the principle is neither a proposition about matters of fact nor one about relations of ideas the proposition \u201cnature is uniform\u201d is an illegitimate metaphysical proposition and inductive inferences lack justification. The principle of the uniformity of nature, Collingwood argues, is not a proposition, but an absolute presupposition, one which cannot be denied without undermining empirical science. As it is an absolute presupposition the notion of verifiability does not apply to it because it does its job not in so far as it is true, or even believed to be true, but in so far as it is presupposed. The demand that it should be verified is nonsensical and the question that Hume ask does not therefore arise:\n\n\u2026any question involving the presupposition that an absolute presupposition is a proposition, such as the question \u201cIs it true?\u201d \u201cWhat evidence is there for it?\u201d \u201cHow can it be demonstrated?\u201d \u201cWhat right have we to presuppose it if it can\u2019t?\u201d, is a nonsense question. (EM 1998: 33)\n\nSimilar considerations, as we shall see later, are invoked by Collingwood against Ayer\u2019s principle of verifiability.\n\n2.3 The \u201cradical conversion\u201d hypothesis\n\nThere is clearly continuity between Collingwood\u2019s account of the nature of philosophical distinctions, as developed in An Essay on Philosophical Method and his later claim in An Essay on Metaphysics that the role of presuppositional analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which unsystematic thinking gets tangled. His attempt to disambiguate the different senses of causation in An Essay on Metaphysics seems to be engaging in a task akin to what in An Essay on Philosophical Method he described as the distinguishing of concepts that coincide in their instances. Yet a major issue of contention in Collingwood scholarship concerns whether Collingwood\u2019s later work, beginning with An Essay on Metaphysics, historicized his earlier conception of the role of philosophical analysis. This is because An Essay on Metaphysics contains a fundamental ambiguity. On the one hand it presents presuppositional analysis as the task of regressing from propositional answers to questions and from questions to presuppositions. This is a logical task aimed at putting order in our thoughts and getting rid of conceptual confusions. On the other hand, it presents presuppositions as historical beliefs thereby suggesting that the goal of presuppositional analysis is not so much to get rid of conceptual confusion as to describe what certain people believed in different periods of time. Metaphysics, Collingwood says\n\nis the attempt to find out what absolute presuppositions have been made by this or that person or group of persons, on this or that occasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that occasion or group of occasions, in the course of this or that piece of thinking. (EM 1998: 47)\n\nStatements such as these have a strong historicist flavour. This ambiguity exposes a tension between two different conceptions of the role of philosophical analysis. On the first conception the task of philosophy is to delineate the subject matters of different forms of knowledge and denounce the encroachment of one form of knowledge on the subject matter of another. The emphasis is on explanatory pluralism, not historical relativism. The defence of the autonomy of historical explanation in The Idea of History, for example, implies that the role of philosophical analysis is to identify the distinctive presuppositions of history and to distinguish them from those of natural science with a view to combating scientism. The second conception, by contrast, places the emphasis on historical relativism rather than explanatory pluralism. It is this second conception of the role of philosophical analysis in An Essay on Metaphysics that has led to the view that Collingwood\u2019s later metaphilosophy differs substantially from his earlier view of the role of philosophical analysis, a view sometimes referred to as \u201cthe radical conversion hypothesis\u201d. The hypothesis of a historicist turn was first advanced by Malcolm Knox in the editorial introduction to the posthumously published The Idea of History. It was also endorsed by early commentators such as A. Donagan (1962 and 1972), Toulmin (1972) and N. Rotenstreich (1972). The expression \u201cradical conversion hypothesis\u201d, however, was actually coined by Rubinoff (1966) who alongside Mink (1969) rejected it as an inadequate description of Collingwood\u2019s position. This is still a live debate in Collingwood scholarship, although more recent studies (Martin 1989; Modood 1989; Connelly 1990; Oldfield 1995; Beaney 2005; D\u2019Oro 2002, 2010) tend to emphasise the unity rather than discontinuity in Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical approach.\n\n2.4 The ontological argument and the correspondence with Ryle\n\nThe question concerning the relation between Collingwood\u2019s two metaphilosophical treatises and whether the conception of the role of philosophical analysis articulated in An Essay on Metaphysics is continuous with that described in An Essay on Philosophical Method is further complicated by the fact that An Essay on Philosophical Method contains a defence of the ontological argument that appears to be at odds with Collingwood\u2019s later claim that metaphysics is a logical, not an ontological inquiry and with the assertion that presuppositional analysis is a form of \u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d. The ontological proof is normally regarded as the pinnacle of metaphysical knowledge, knowledge that is both necessary (as a priori knowledge) and has existential import (as empirical knowledge). Collingwood\u2019s allegiance to the ontological proof in An Essay on Philosophical Method would therefore seem to provide further evidence for the hypothesis of a rift between Collingwood\u2019s earlier and later conception of philosophical analysis because it seems to be advancing the sort of robust metaphysical claims which Collingwood\u2019s later conception of metaphysics is keen to leave behind. However, the detail of Collingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological proof suggests that he had a rather unorthodox understanding of what the ontological proof establishes (D\u2019Oro 2002). Paradoxical as this might sound, he did not seem to think that the ontological proof establishes any substantive ontological conclusions and that it yields the sort of metaphysical knowledge he later explicitly claimed to be impossible. His concern with the ontological proof was intricately connected with an attempt to delineate the subject matter of philosophical analysis, not the existence of metaphysical entities. God, for Collingwood, is \u201cthat which we are thinking about when we are thinking philosophically\u201d (Collingwood\u2019s 1935 private letter to Ryle, published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical Method, EPM 2005: 257). This claim may be clarified by saying that philosophical concepts are not contingently instantiated in an empirical class of objects (as we have seen, they do not sort things into classes); they are necessarily instantiated in the forms of judgement or inference which they make possible. For example, the concept of the good, qua expediency, is necessarily instantiated in hypothetical or instrumental imperatives and the concept of mind is necessarily instantiated in judgements which explain actions qua expression of thought. This is the kernel of truth that, according to Collingwood, is worth restating in the ontological argument.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological argument in An Essay on Philosophical Method gave rise to a lively epistolary exchange with Ryle (the exchange is published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical Method). The correspondence was triggered by the publication of an article in Mind by Ryle (1935) which attacked Collingwood\u2019s sympathetic appraisal of the ontological proof on the grounds that there are no such things as propositions which are both necessary and existential, i.e., no such things as metaphysical propositions, like the one asserting the necessary existence of God. Collingwood replied to Ryle in a private letter by claiming that that there is a third kind of proposition, philosophical propositions, which feature philosophical concepts, propositions such as \u201cMind exists\u201d or \u201cMatter exists\u201d. Such propositions are necessary but not merely hypothetical because the philosophical concepts whose existence they assert are necessarily instantiated in the judgements employed by the practitioners of a given science. \u201cMind exists\u201d in so far as one explains actions by means of rationalisations, rather than nomological explanations; the concept of mind is embedded in the kind of judgement or inference that it makes possible. The main bone of contention in the correspondence between Ryle and Collingwood was therefore not the ontological argument in its traditional form, but whether or not philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry, i.e., whether there are distinctive philosophical concepts, (concepts which allow for complete extensional overlap). As we have seen Collingwood later revisited the claim that philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry in An Essay on Metaphysics, where he reformulated it by saying that philosophy is not an ontological but a logical enquiry into the presuppositions which govern thought.\n\nIn spite of Collingwood\u2019s attempts to qualify his commitment to the ontological argument Ryle continued to read Collingwood\u2019s defence of the ontological proof at face value refusing to accept that the ontological proof could properly be interpreted as anything other than what it states on the label, i.e., an argument for the existence of God. Collingwood, for his part, insisted on illustrating what the subject matter of philosophy is, by defending a highly controversial interpretation of what the ontological proof establishes. Be this as it may, the misunderstandings between Collingwood and Ryle show how very difficult it must have been for Collingwood to translate his insights in the language of the burgeoning school of analytic philosophy. In spite of the misunderstandings it involves, the Collingwood-Ryle correspondence reveals some of the issues which truly troubled philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century and offers a fascinating window onto the origins of analytic philosophy (D\u2019Oro 2000; Vrijen 2006).\n\n2.5 The metaphilosophical battle with Ayer\n\nIn the debate with Ryle which unfolded on the pages of Mind and in the private correspondence Collingwood had tried to defend the claim that there is a distinctive kind of proposition which captures the subject matter of philosophy, but his attempt to capture the distinctive subject matter of philosophical analysis was dismissed by Ryle as being of a piece with a dusty old metaphysics. The drastic change of terminology in An Essay on Metaphysics is at least in part an attempt to defend the claim that philosophy has a distinctive subject matter different from both that of the exact and the natural sciences, but to do so in a way that would not lend itself to the kind of misunderstanding that led Ryle to dismiss Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical vision as belonging to an idealist metaphysics of the sort that analytic philosophy wanted to leave behind. This terminological change put Collingwood in a better position to engage with the revival of empiricism at the hands of A.J. Ayer. In Language Truth and Logic (1936) Ayer revitalised Hume\u2019s critique of metaphysics by invoking the principle of verifiability, according to which propositions are meaningful insofar as they are empirically verifiable. Propositions which are not empirically verifiable are nonsense unless they are tautologies. As far as Collingwood was concerned Ayer\u2019s revival of the Humean fork had unpalatable metaphilosophical implications because it entailed that to be meaningful the claims of philosophy must be either empirically verifiable, as the propositions of natural science, or analytic truths, as the propositions of exact science. An Essay on Metaphysics is a pointed attack on the metaphilosophical implications of this claim. Ayer\u2019s commitment to the view that there are only two types of legitimate propositions, empirical and analytic, was, for Collingwood, based on a failure to acknowledge that statements can play different roles in the logic of question and answer. Some statements are answers to questions and, in so far as their role is to answer questions, they are truth evaluable. But some statements have a different role, namely, to give rise to questions and they perform this role not in so far as they are true or false, but in so far as they are presupposed. As such they are not truth evaluable, because they are not asserted as propositional answers to questions. Statements such as \u201ca cause is an event by producing or preventing which one can produce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be\u201d (sense II of causation) is not asserted by the philosopher as a proposition. What the philosopher asserts is not \u201ccauses in sense II exist or are true of an inquiry independent reality\u201d (which would be an illegitimate metaphysical proposition) but rather \u201ccauses in sense II are absolutely presupposed in the practical sciences of nature\u201d. Philosophy yields not first order knowledge but second order knowledge or understanding of the presuppositions on which knowledge rests. Ayer\u2019s classification of propositions along the lines of the Human fork conflates presuppositions with propositions and, as a result, fails to acknowledge that philosophy has a distinctive subject matter, namely absolute presuppositions, and a distinctive role, to detect presuppositions. Absolute presuppositions are not reducible either to the propositions of the exact or those of the natural sciences. Nor are they ruled out as meaningless propositions by the principle of verifiability because, since they are not propositions, the notion of verifiability does not apply to them.\n\n2.6 Realism and idealism\n\nCollingwood is often referred to as a British idealist, but his allegiance to idealism was in large measure a response to the Oxford realism he had imbibed as a student and continued to profess until around 1916. Hence he tended to be rather wary of the label \u201cidealist\u201d, and in his correspondence with Gilbert Ryle he explicitly rejected it (EPM 2005: 256). However, in his lectures on Central Problems of Metaphysics (1935) he tentatively propounded a form of what he termed \u201cobjective idealism.\u201d But, nonetheless, as in his response to Ryle, he continued to rail against those who sought to pin his position down to an \u201cism\u201d, once remarking that \"I am not going to be pigeon-holed into one of your neat categories. Philosophy is a process of inquiry, not dogmatic positions\" (Hector 2000).\n\nThis reluctance is probably due to the fact that idealism is most often identified with immaterialism and he would not have wished his criticism of realism to be interpreted as resting on a commitment to the claim that the real is ideal or that mind is causally responsible for the existence of reality. If the contrast between idealism and realism is understood as one between two metaphysical views concerning the ontological constitution of reality (is it mental? Is it material?) Collingwood had nothing to contribute to the debate between realists and idealists; he would have regarded it as belonging to metaphysics as the study of pure being, not as metaphysics understood as a form of presuppositional analysis. In An Autobiography (1939) he contrasted realism not with immaterialism but with the commitment to presuppositionless knowledge or the realist view propounded by Cook Wilson and Prichard that \u201cknowing makes no difference to what is known\u201d (AA 2013: 44). Denying realism, so understood, is to deny that there can be any such thing as knowledge of pure being. Since all knowledge takes the form of answers to questions, and all questions rest on presuppositions, knowledge necessarily has presuppositions. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism therefore takes Kant\u2019s criticism of the possibility of knowing things as they are in themselves a step further. Kant did not deny that talk about knowledge of things as they are in themselves is coherent; he simply claimed that this sort of knowledge is unavailable to us. Collingwood\u2019s critique of realism, by contrast, denies that there is any such thing as presuppositionless knowledge. Presuppositionless knowledge is not a kind of knowledge that it is not possible for us to acquire but may be available to another being, such as God: the idea of presuppositionless knowledge involves an oxymoron because all knowing involves presuppositions.\n\n3. History and Science\n\n3.1 The historical past and the presuppositions of historical inquiry\n\nAn Essay on Metaphysics contains a general statement of Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy and his view that metaphysics is not an ontological inquiry into pure being but a logical inquiry that takes the form of presuppositional analysis. While An Essay on Metaphysics explained, in the most general terms, what presuppositional analysis is, The Idea of History (1946) and The Principles of History (1999) seek to uncover the presuppositions governing historical inquiry into the past. Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history asks the question: \u201cwhat are the presuppositions that govern the historical understanding of the past?\u201d and \u201cwhat does it mean to understand the past historically?\u201d The nature of Collingwood\u2019s concern with the past is not metaphysical. He is not advancing a theory concerning the nature of time, whether, for example, it is ever-present or a growing block. Nor is it primarily an epistemological concern with the question of how one acquires knowledge of the past, given that it is not available for observation, although he does address some epistemological questions. The nature of his concern with the nature of the past is first and foremost a conceptual concern with the question \u201cWhat is the historical past? What does it mean to understand the past historically?\u201d\n\nThe historical past is the past understood historically, i.e., from the perspective of certain presuppositions, presuppositions that give rise to certain kinds of questions, questions that are distinctive of historical inquiry and differ from those of natural science. The past in so far as it is understood historically (the historical past) is therefore not the same thing as the past as it is studied by a natural scientist. Just as the term \u201ccause\u201d needs to be disambiguated to avoid conceptual confusion, so does the term \u201cpast\u201d because it means different things to the humanistically oriented historiographer as it does, for example, to a geologist:\n\nThere is a certain analogy between the archaeologist\u2019s interpretation of a stratified site and a geologist\u2019s interpretation of rock-horizons with their associated fossils; but the difference is no less clear than the similarity. The archaeologist\u2019s use of his stratified relics depends on his conceiving them as artifacts serving human purposes and thus expressing a particular way in which men have thought of their own life; and from his point of view the palaeontologist, arranging his fossils in a time-series, is not working as an historian, but only as a scientist thinking in a way which can at most be described as quasi-historical. (IH 1993: 212)\n\nWhile both the geologist and the historian are concerned with the past, the questions that they ask and the presuppositions which give rise to those questions are different. Scientific inquiry rests on the presupposition of the uniformity of nature. This principle is required to formulate the inductive hypotheses which enable empirical scientists to predict what will happen in the future and retrodict what happened in the past. Empirically minded scientists presuppose that everything that happens is subject to natural laws which are invariant over time, for example, that water freezes at 0\u00b0 Celsius under the reign of Queen Victoria as well as the time of Henry VIII. But while this presupposition is well suited to serve the explanatory goals of natural science, it is of limited use to historians who are concerned not with what is invariant throughout history, but with what is distinctive about different periods of time. It would not help an Egyptologist to understand the rituals of the ancient Egyptian to ascribe them the mindset of a medieval feudal baron. As Collingwood puts it:\n\nTypes of behaviour do, no doubt, recur, so long as minds of the same kind are placed in the same kind of situations. The behaviour-patterns characteristic of a feudal baron were no doubt fairly constant so long as there were feudal barons living in a feudal society. But they will be sought in vain (except by an inquirer content with the loosest and most fanciful analogies) in a world whose social structure is of another kind. In order that behaviour-patterns may be constant, there must be in existence a social order which recurrently produces situations of a certain kind. But social orders are historical facts, and subject to inevitable change, fast or slow. A positive science of mind will, no doubt, be able to establish uniformities and recurrences, but it can have no guarantee that the laws it establishes will hold good beyond the historical period from which its facts are drawn. (IH 1993: 223\u2013224)\n\nCollingwood is critical of those philosophers who, like Bradley (1874), bring the presuppositions of natural science to bear upon the study of the historical past. It is not the role of historians to dismiss as false the testimony of historical agents who attest to the occurrence of miracles on the grounds that since nature is uniform and its laws do not change, the miracles past agents attested to could not have happened because their occurrence contravenes the laws of nature. This \u201cpositivistic spirit\u201d (IH 1993: 135\u201336) encourages a judgmental attitude towards the historical sources rather than an attempt to understand their meaning. This is not to say that historians need to believe that miracles happened in order to understand the sources, but rather that understanding the role that belief in the supernatural had for the agents who witnessed to them is more important for the historian than assessing whether belief in the supernatural is true or false:\n\nIf the reasons why it is hard for a man to cross the mountains is because he is frightened of the devils in them, it is folly for the historian, preaching at him across a gulf of centuries, to say \u201cThis is sheer superstition, there are no devils at all. Face facts, and realize there are no dangers in the mountains except rocks and water and snow, wolves perhaps, and bad men perhaps, but no devils.\u201d The historian says that these are the facts because that is the way in which he has been taught to think. But the devil-fearer says that the presence of devils is a fact, because that is the way in which he has been taught to think. The historian thinks it a wrong way; but wrong ways of thinking are just as much historical facts as right ones, and, no less than they, determine the situation (always a thought-situation) in which the man who shares them is placed. (IH 1993: 317)\n\nThe important question concerning any statement contained in an historical source \u201cis not whether it is true or false, but what it means\u201d (IH 1993: 260). Ignoring this advice leads to writing \u201cscissors-and-paste\u201d histories where the sources are treated as worthwhile historical material and admitted into the historian\u2019s narrative only if they are deemed to be believable by the historian\u2019s own standards of evidence. To understand the past historically is to understand the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d (IH 1993: 299) of past agents, their frame of mind. What makes an investigation historical, therefore, is not simply the fact that it is focused on the past, but the kind of concerns by which it is guided when investigating the past. To understand past agents is to understand the way in which they reasoned, the inferences that they drew, the conceptual connections which they made, the symbolic significance they attached to certain events. Understanding a past occurrence, such as Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon historically, for example, is to understand the significance that it had for a contemporary Roman who knew what Roman law permitted and proscribed. This is what differentiates a concern with the historical past from a concern with the natural past:\n\nThe historian, investigating an event in the past, makes a distinction between what may be called the outside and the inside of an event. By the outside of the event I mean everything belonging to it which can be described in terms of bodies and their movements: the passage of Caesar, accompanied by certain men, across a river called the Rubicon at one date, or the spilling of his blood across the floor of the senate-house at another. By the inside of the event I mean that in it which can only be described in terms of thought: Caesar\u2019s defiance of Republican law, or the clash of constitutional policy between himself and his assassins. The historian is never concerned with either of these to the exclusion of the other. He is investigating not mere events (where by a mere event I mean one which has only an outside and no inside) but actions, and an action is the unity of the outside and the inside of an event. He is interested in the crossing of the Rubicon only in its relation to Republican law, and in the spilling of Caesar\u2019s blood only in relation to a constitutional conflict. (IH 1993: 213)\n\nTo understand Caesar\u2019s crossing of the Rubicon against the background of Republican law is to understand the crossing as transgressing not a law of nature (natural laws apply uniformly to the present, past, and future), but a military norm which banned armed generals from crossing a border (norms, unlike natural laws, change from time to time). Understanding actions historically requires understanding them more like responses to commands that may be followed or disregarded, than as instances (or counter instances) of empirical laws. When understood historically, therefore, the actions of past agents are explained more in the manner in which one understands the action of a motorist who stops at a traffic light (i.e., as abiding by a traffic regulation) than they are in the way in which an astronomer retrodicts the death of a star. The mindset of past agents cannot be investigated under the presupposition which governs empirical science, i.e., the uniformity of nature, because the study of mind, is a \u201cnormative or criteriological enquiry\u201d (PA: 171, footnote).\n\nThe distinction between the historical past and the natural past corresponds to the distinction between the subject matters of the sciences of mind and nature: the former study actions, in so far as they explain what happens as an expression of thought, the latter study events insofar as they approach their subject matter as instantiating certain observable patterns. As such \u201cactions\u201d and \u201cevents\u201d are the correlatives of different kinds inferences. Collingwood captured the distinction between actions and events by claiming that the former have an inside which the latter lack (IH 1993: 118). The point of this claim was to draw attention to the fact that the meaning or significance of an action eludes nomological explanations which account for what happens by subsuming their explanandum under general laws. A historian might, for example, observe certain empirical regularities (in the past every time that white smoke emanated from the Sistine chapel in Rome, large crowds of people cheered), without understanding \u201cwhy\u201d in a particular sense of \u201cwhy\u201d the crowds cheered. If a social scientist suggested that the crowds cheered because white smoke emanated from the Sistine Chapel, this kind of \u201cbecause\u201d would singularly fail to address the question that the historian wants answered. The kind of explanation that would satisfy the curiosity of the historian is one which states something along the lines of \u201cthe crowds cheered because a new pope was elected\u201d but such an explanation would not be possible without invoking the \u201ccontext of thought\u201d within which alone one can understand the symbolic significance of the white smoke. Words like \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d, Collingwood claims, are not necessarily\n\nout of place in reference to history; it only means that they are used there in a special sense. When a scientist asks: \u201cWhy did that piece of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d he means \u201cOn what kinds of occasions do pieces of litmus paper turn pink?\u201d When an historian asks \u201cWhy did Brutus stab Caesar?\u201d he means \u201cWhat did Brutus think, which made him decide to stab Caesar?\u201d The cause of the event, for him, means the thought in the mind of the person by whose agency the event came about: and this is not something other than the event, it is the inside of the event itself. (IH 1993: 214\u2013215)\n\nThe inside/outside distinction that Collingwood often invokes to explicate the differences between the subject matters of history and science is a highly metaphorical way of defending a commitment to explanatory pluralism and the irreducibility of historical to scientific explanations. This metaphor has unfortunately sometimes been read literally, leading to Collingwood being unfairly attacked for defending the view that the subject matter of history is an internal, unobservable psychological process and for putting forward an equally implausible method for accessing it: re-enactment.\n\n3.2 Re-enactment\n\nOne of the most discussed aspects of Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is his claim that the historical past is not retrodicted but re-enacted. The task of historians is not to establish that a past event had to happen in the past, in a way analogous to that in which a scientist predicts that a solar eclipse will happen in the future, but to re-enact the thoughts of historical agents. Collingwood claims that when historians re-enact the thought of an historical agent, they do not re-enact a thought of a similar kind but the very same thought as the agent. This claim has often been regarded as counterintuitive because to say that the thought of the agent and that of the historian are one and the same appears to presuppose that there is only one rather than two numerically distinct acts of thought: that of the historian and that of the agent. Collingwood\u2019s point, however, is that, since what the historian re-enacts, i.e., the propositional content of thought (he refers to this simply as thought) is distinct from the acts of thinking (he refers to these as sensations/feelings), the criterion of identity that is normally applied to individuate acts of thinking does not apply to thought (IH 1993: 287). Acts of thinking are individuated and distinguished from one another by adopting spatial criteria. By contrast thoughts (i.e., propositional contents) are individuated on the basis of purely qualitative criteria, so that if there are two people entertaining the (qualitatively) same thought, there is (numerically) only one thought since there is only one propositional content. For Collingwood, if Jane and Jim recite the practical syllogism \u201cAll men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal\u201d they entertain one and the same thought. By the same token, a historian who re-enacts the thought of a past agent entertains the very same thought as the historical agent:\n\n\u2026 in its immediacy, as an actual experience of his own, Plato\u2019s argument must undoubtedly have grown up out of a discussion of some sort, though I do not know what it was, and been closely connected to such a discussion. Yet if I not only read his argument but understand it, follow it in my own mind re-enacting it with and for myself, the process of argument which I go through is not a process resembling Plato\u2019s, it is actually Plato\u2019s so far as I understand him correctly. (IH 1993: 301)\n\nAs the last clause in the quotation makes clear, Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment aims to establish a conceptual point about what exactly it is that historians re-enact (the thought as opposed to the acts of thinking) and what the criteria for identifying and distinguishing thoughts are. It is not meant to prescribe to historians an empathetic method for the recovery of inner psychological processes which are not accessible from a third person perspective (Saari 1984 and 1989; Van der Dussen 1981 and 1995; D\u2019Oro 2000). Unfortunately the doctrine of re-enactment has been widely read not as attempting to identify the subject matter of history (thought, rather than acts of thinking), but as seeking to articulate a method by which historian can recover hidden psychological processes that are not accessible from the third person perspective. In the aftermath of the publication of The Idea of History, the re-enactment doctrine was widely associated with Dilthey\u2019s account of empathetic understanding and accused of ascribing to the historian implausible telepathic powers of access to other minds (Gardiner 1952a and 1952b).\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment could be criticised for over-rationalizing the subject matter of history. His identification of the object of re-enactment with \u201cthought\u201d, and of history as a criteriological or normative inquiry into thought, to the exclusion of \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csensations\u201d, might seem too restrictive since a great deal of action is not rational, and irrationality has been the driving force behind much that has happened in history. When considering this objection, one must bear in mind that \u201chistory\u201d understood as a form of inquiry distinct from natural science should not be conflated with \u201chistory\u201d as an academic discipline practised in university departments. Practising historians will inevitably be concerned with much more than \u201cthought\u201d and the specific norms by which past agents led their lives. They will inevitably mention irrational factors, just as they mention arational natural forces (earthquakes, floods and other natural phenomena that impact on historical agents). Collingwood\u2019s goal was not to tell historians what they can and cannot say about what happened in the past, but to distinguish between two very different ways in which the past can be approached: under the assumption of the uniformity of nature and under the assumption that the deeds of historical agents are responses to norms rather than instances of natural laws.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment certainly implies that the historical past is in principle knowable, that it is possible to mediate reality through the conceptual framework, for example, of the ancient Egyptians or the ancient Greeks. This is not to say that the past can be known in itself, or independently of any conceptual mediation, but that it can be seen from the perspective of past agents, through the categorial framework that mediated their conception of reality. While there are additional epistemic obstacles in the way of understanding agents from a distant past, agents who we cannot engage in a live conversation, knowledge of the past is in principle achievable because understanding past agents is not a radically different task from that of understanding the thoughts of our contemporaries. Historical knowledge, Collingwood says\n\nis not concerned only with a remote past. It is by historical thinking that we re-think and so rediscover the thoughts of Hammurabi or Solon, it is in the same way that we discover the thought of a friend who writes us a letter, or a friend who crosses the street. (IH 1993: 219)\n\nIn so far as Collingwood\u2019s account of re-enactment defends the possibility of knowing the past as it always was for historical agents (the historian, as we have seen, seeks to establish what crossing the Rubicon meant to a Roman cognizant of Republican law) it goes against a view that became dominant in the latter part of the twentieth century, according to which the past cannot be known as it always was because it is constantly and necessarily revised from the perspective of the present. This view was endorsed with varying degrees of emphasis in the philosophical hermeneutics of H-G. Gadamer, in the philosophy of history, and the philosophy of language. Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics claimed that the past \u201cis understood only if it is understood in a different way every time\u201d (1960 [1975: 275]) because the meaning of a text is the result of a fusion of the horizons of the text to be interpreted and the horizon of the interpreter. In the philosophy of history narrativists such as Hayden White (1973), Frank Ankersmit (1983) and Keith Jenkins (1991) emphasised the cultural endowment of the historian as the lens through which the past is accessed. Even the philosophy of language was not immune from this trend. Quine (1960) famously denied that it is possible to achieve determinacy in translation in direct opposition to Collingwood\u2019s claim that it is at least in principle possible to re-enact the very same thought as the historical agent. This revisionary view of the past goes against Collingwood\u2019s conception of what it means to understand the past historically. The task of the historian, as he saw it, is to transport us to another world by immersing oneself in the historical agent\u2019s own context of thought.\n\n3.3 The argument against methodological unity\n\nCollingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is a sustained attempt to delineate the subject matter of history and why this subject matter cannot be captured by adopting the methods of natural science. He is critical of the argument, advanced by John Stuart Mill that the distinction between the human and the natural sciences is merely a distinction in the degree of accuracy that can be reached in their respective domains of inquiry. In his System of Logic (1843), Mill argued that the subject matter of psychology differs from that of the natural sciences because psychology studies human actions. Yet the method by which the psychologist studies human actions is the same (inductive) method that is operative in natural science. Psychologists predict human behaviour in the same way in which natural scientists predict natural events, by inferring it from certain antecedent conditions and empirical generalisations. While the generalisations of psychologists invoke psychological rather than natural laws, the method is the same. The difference between psychology and natural science lies in the fact that the predictions of psychologists unlike, say, those of astronomers are imprecise. Such a difference, for Mill, is insufficiently robust to support the claim for disunity in the sciences. The most accurate way of drawing the distinction between psychology and astronomy is not to deny that psychology is a (natural) science, but to acknowledge that there are two kinds of natural sciences, those which are precise (like astronomy) and those which are imprecise (like psychology). According to Mill\u2019s way of drawing the distinction psychology is, like tidology and meteorology, an inexact (natural) science. The contrast (for Mill) is therefore not between two kinds of sciences in the Latin sense of scientia, meaning two distinct kinds of knowledge, but between different kinds of natural sciences: exact and inexact. Collingwood rejected Mill\u2019s suggestion that the reconstruction of the thoughts of historical agents is a past-directed empirical psychology. The study of mind is, as we saw earlier, a normative or criteriological endeavour because to understand past agents historically is to understand the conceptual connections they made by reconstructing their thought-context. The subject matter of history, Collingwood claims, is not merely human actions but res gestae. These\n\nare not the actions, in the widest sense of that word, which are done by animals of the species called human; they are actions in another sense of the same word, equally familiar but narrower, actions done by reasonable agents in pursuit of ends determined by their reason. (PH: 46)\n\nPsychology, as understood by Mill, is what in An Essay on Metaphysics Collingwood calls a \u201cpseudo-science of thought\u201d (EM 1998: 142) because it fails to acknowledge that the concept of mind is, in the words of Gallie (1956), an essentially contested concept that (like \u201ccause\u201d, \u201caction\u201d, \u201cscience\u201d, and \u201cthe past\u201d) needs to be disambiguated. This is not to say that empirical psychology is not a legitimate scientific pursuit, but that the subject matter of empirical psychology and that of history are not the same and that the attempt to capture the mind by the methods of empirical science should be denounced as the attempt by one form of knowledge to trespass on the territory of another.\n\nThe distinction between the method of history and that of science is not a distinction between the explanations of psychology understood as an empirical science of the mind and those of physics or astronomy. It is a distinction between two different forms of knowing with distinctive explananda: actions and events. The action/event distinction designates therefore not a distinction between inner/private psychological processes and outward/observable phenomena, but between two different ways of knowing the past: qua actions or qua events. The description of the past qua actions is the correlative of a certain kind of (historical) explanation; the description of the past qua events is the correlative of a certain kind of scientific/nomological explanation. The action/event distinction is, in the vocabulary of An Essay on Philosophical Method a philosophical distinction which does not capture two separate classes of things, but brings the past under different descriptions, qua natural and qua historical past.\n\nThe relevance of Collingwood\u2019s defence of the autonomy of history to debates concerning the unity/disunity of science was brought to the attention of a wider audience by W. H. Dray during the 1950s and 60s. Dray (1958, 1963) located Collingwood\u2019s action/event distinction within the context of contemporary debates in the philosophy of social science and drew on the work of Collingwood to reject the claim for methodological unity advanced by Hempel in his influential 1942 article: \u201cThe Function of General Laws in History\u201d. Hempel claimed that explanations in history are covertly nomological explanations because historians, just as natural scientists, rely upon general laws, even if they do not explicitly mention them. Dray argued that Hempel failed to see that what distinguishes action from event explanations is the nature of the connection between the explanans and the explanandum. In naturalistic explanations the explanans is an antecedent condition, a state of affairs which precedes in time the event whose cause it is said to be; in the historical explanation of action the explanans is the logical ground of an action, the thought that renders the action intelligible. Whilst in the 1950s and 60s Collingwood played an important role in the debate concerning the logical form of action explanation and how it differs from the causal explanation of events, his work became less influential in the second half of the twentieth century. The neglect into which Collingwood\u2019s account of action and its explanation has fallen is linked to a change in metaphilosophical assumptions and the return of the kind of metaphysics which he had sought to replace with the presuppositional analysis described in An Essay on Metaphysics.\n\nAs we saw, according to Collingwood the distinction between the explanation of action and of events was a distinction between different forms of inferences or, as he put it in An Essay on Metaphysics, between the different senses that the term \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d has in different explanatory contexts. Collingwood\u2019s metaphysics of absolute presuppositions committed him to a form of explanatory pluralism in which different kinds of explanations do not compete because they answer different questions, which arise because of different presuppositions; the choice between one kind of explanation and another depends on whether they are fit for purpose, i.e., whether they satisfy the curiosity of the person who is asking the question. With the return of a more robust form of metaphysics, the suggestion that the choice between one type of explanation and another could be resolved by disambiguating which sense of causation needs to be invoked in order to satisfy the curiosity of the questioner came to be dismissed as an attempt to get away with ontologically light weight solutions to the problem of the relation between the science of mind and nature. The predominant problem in the philosophy of mind and action became that of how the mind can fit in the natural world, a question which presupposes the kind of metaphysics that Collingwood sought to leave behind.\n\nMuch philosophy of history tends to be governed by an epistemological concern with how historical knowledge is possible beginning from the assumption that historical knowledge is knowledge of the past. The primary task of a philosophy of history is consequently taken to be that of explaining how the past can be known given that, unlike the present, it is not available for observation, nor can it be reproduced under experimental conditions. Collingwood\u2019s approach to the philosophy of history is quite different. He denied that a mere concern with the past is sufficient to identify a distinctive subject matter for historical inquiry, one which justifies considering history as a science, in the Latin sense of scientia, i.e., a form of knowing. The past after all is studied by geologists, as well as historians so if history is a distinctive form of knowing it must do more than merely study the past. He therefore took the primary task of a philosophy of history to be that of articulating not an epistemological theory accounting for how the past can be known, but that of disambiguating the subject matter of history from that of natural science by applying the presuppositional analysis that he had expounded in An Essay on Metaphysics to historical knowledge. The application of this presuppositional analysis yields the claim that the presuppositions of history are different from those of natural science because reenacting the thoughts of past agents involves re-thinking conceptual connections. Historians presuppose that past agents are responsive to norms, not that their behaviour conforms to natural laws. The task of philosophical analysis is to uncover these different presuppositions with a view to showing that there is no conflict between the claims of history and those of science, not because historical explanations are incomplete nomological explanations, but because they are complete explanations of a different kind, which answer different kinds of questions. This of course is not to deny that there are important epistemological questions concerning the past but rather that the distinctive epistemology of historical knowing can be articulated only once the kind of past with which history is concerned is clearly identified:\n\n\u2026 a great many things which deeply concern human beings are not, and never have been, traditionally included in the subject-matter of history. People are born, eat and breathe and sleep, and beget children and become ill and recover again, and die; and these things interest them, most of them at any rate, far more than art and science, industry and politics and war. Yet none of these things have been traditionally regarded as possessing historical interest. Most of them have given rise to institutions like dining and marrying and the various rituals that surround birth and death, sickness and recovery; and of these rituals and institutions people write histories; but the history of dining is not the history of eating, and the history of death-rituals is not the history of death. (PH: 46).\n\nIf Collingwood\u2019s philosophy of history is an attempt to identify the distinctive subject matter of history and the logical form of historical judgements, then his metaphilosophy should be understood as defending a form of explanatory pluralism, not a form of historical relativism (D\u2019Oro 2018b). The latter claims that belief systems are beyond criticism because truth and falsity are relative to what certain people, at certain times, believe to be true. The former, by contrast, claims that different kinds of explanations are answers to different kinds of questions and that the task of philosophical analysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which we get tangled when we fail to order our thoughts with due care. This of course is an interpretative claim that advocates of the radical conversion hypothesis (see section 2.3 above) are likely to deny insofar as they tend to read Collingwood\u2019s metaphilosophy as articulating not a defence of the autonomy of philosophy, but as dissolving philosophy into a descriptive study of the belief systems that different people had through time."}, {"url": "https://australianfootball.com/Players/player/bert%20deacon/6771", "page_content": "Pre 1965 stats are for selected matches only\n\nAFL: 5,074th player to appear, 2,223rd most games played, 5,597th most goals kickedCarlton: 574th player to appear, 160th most games played, 497th most goals kicked\n\nSomewhat surprisingly for a club with such an illustrious pedigree, it took Carlton 27 years to come up with its first Brownlow Medallist in the shape of virtuoso centre half back Bert Deacon.\n\nAs fair as he was talented, Deacon began and finished his senior career with VFA side Preston.

But even before he took the field for Carlton, Clover had to conquer the odds on the battlefields of France in World War 1. From Maryborough in central Victoria, Horrie enlisted in the 1st AIF in September 1915. After basic training, he embarked for France with reinforcements for the 7th Battalion in January of 1916. Soon pitched into the horrors of trench warfare, he fought and survived until September of that year, when he was transferred to a machine gun company and promoted to the rank of Corporal. On Christmas day, 1916, Horrie was struck down with acute appendicitis. He was evacuated to a field hospital for emergency surgery, where the doctors discovered that his appendix was gangrenous and that his life was in danger. He was immediately transferred to London for specialist treatment, and months of recuperation. Pronounced unfit for further front-line service, he was repatriated back to Australia in August 1917, and honourably discharged in May of the following year \u2013 six months before the Armistice. Having recovered, and keen to have a crack at senior football, Clover trained with Richmond and Melbourne before Carlton gave him an opportunity at VFL level. And how he delivered! In his first match in 1920 \u2013 ironically, against Richmond - he kicked four goals from centre half-forward, and hit the post three times! By the end of his first season at Princes Park, Clover was one of Carlton\u2019s drawcards. Former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was just one of the many Carlton fans who were captivated; \u201che was the most artistic of high marks, unforgettable at half-forward,\u201d said Menzies. Horrie could kick a football, too. A balanced, deceptively quick mover, he was a glorious running drop-kick for goal. Playing against Richmond again at Princes Park in July, 1921, he let fly with a monster kick that was later measured at 86.26 metres \u2013 that\u2019s 94 yards, 2 feet in imperial terms! And there are numerous other instances where he roosted the ball more than 70 metres. In round 12 of 1921, he slotted 13 goals in a game against St Kilda; a club record which still stands today. The Blues made the finals in third place in 1921 and battled through to meet Richmond for the Premiership. Then the heavens above the MCG opened up on the day before the decider, turning the ground into a quagmire. In what was to be Clover\u2019s only Grand Final appearance, Richmond won a slogging, mauling contest by four points. While Premiership glory eluded him, Horrie was Carlton\u2019s top goalkicker in three of his first four seasons, including 1922, where his total of 58 was the competition\u2019s best. He was appointed captain of the Blues that same year, and in 1923 took on the dual role of captain-coach. Over 1924 / 1925, he suffered more debilitating illness that prevented him from playing all season. Unable to pull on his football boots, he took on the job of Club Secretary, and continued in that position even after returning to the field in 1926. When he did eventually resume, he formed a new, powerful Carlton forward set-up with a young Harry \u201cSoapy\u201d Vallence at full-forward. Twice more \u2013 in 1926 and 1928, Clover\u2019s brilliance and accuracy in front of goal saw him at the top of Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking, and in 1929 \u2013 aged 34, he was honoured with the captaincy of Victoria against WA in his ninth and final game in the Big Vee. show_image.php?id=205 Horrie Clover retired as a player in 1931 after 147 games. His total of 396 goals is still ranked fifth best in Carlton\u2019s proud history (only displaced for fourth when Brendan Fevola broke through in 2007/2008) \u2013 and it should be remembered that all but a handful of his games were played at centre half-forward, not in the goal square. In 1932 he was elected Vice-President of the Carlton Football Club, but retired after one year. In February 1935 on learning of Terry Ogden's the serious illness, Clover and Newton Chandler offered their services for a blood transfusion for the club's wing man. After a blood test Chandler's blood was accepted. However, Ogden passed away the next month. Clover stood again in 1935, was elected \u2013 and spent twenty unbroken years serving his beloved Blues. He even took on the Presidency in 1956, aged 60, and was as vigorous and determined as ever in his two years in the job. Carlton Football Club mourned deeply when Horrie Clover passed away on the first day of January, 1984. Three years later, he was among the first to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. Testament to his stature in the game as a whole, he was elected to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996; and May 2000 saw him named as one of four emergencies in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century. A champion in every sense of the word, he spent 37 years of his remarkable life at Princes Park. Footnote The Argus published an article on Maryborough, April 12 1930, it said; \"Clover has been the leading half-forward in League ranks for some time. It takes a specialist to fill the position capably, and the Carisbrook man does this admirably.

Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year. Bill's widow, Maisie has had the honour of the Preston and now Northern Bullant No. 1 membership for many years50 Games : Round 15, 1947 Vs Footscray100 Games : Round 2, 1951 Vs Footscray"}, {"url": "https://australianfootball.com/Players/player/bert%20deacon/6771", "page_content": "Pre 1965 stats are for selected matches only\n\nAFL: 5,074th player to appear, 2,223rd most games played, 5,597th most goals kickedCarlton: 574th player to appear, 160th most games played, 497th most goals kicked\n\nSomewhat surprisingly for a club with such an illustrious pedigree, it took Carlton 27 years to come up with its first Brownlow Medallist in the shape of virtuoso centre half back Bert Deacon.\n\nAs fair as he was talented, Deacon began and finished his senior career with VFA side Preston. He joined the Blues in 1942, and was a key member of premiership teams in both 1945 and his Brownlow year of 1947. Strong overhead and brilliant at ground level, he effectively constituted the first line of attack for the Blues, with his superb anticipation frequently enabling him to intercept the ball and return it with interest, almost invariably to his team's advantage.\n\nIn 1952, Deacon returned to his original club Preston as captain-coach. He was regarded as having \"an excellent rapport with his players\",\u00b9 but it was not until he began to coach the team from the sidelines that this began to bear fruit. In 1955 the Bullants qualified for the finals for the first time since the war, and although they would not win a premiership for another eight seasons there is little doubt that Deacon was instrumental in laying a foundation of professionalism on which his successors were able to build.\n\nIn 1958, Bert Deacon returned to Carlton as vice-president, and later served as club secretary.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney"}, {"url": "https://www.theroar.com.au/2020/05/14/the-afl-all-time-great-alphabet-teams-letter-d/", "page_content": "After a controversial selection for the C team, we come to the D outfit.\n\nI have to acknowledge Peter the Scribe, who reminded me of a very obvious D that I had missed when first drafting this team. You\u2019ll find him on the half forward flank.\n\nBack line\n\nFacebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share\n\nRoger Dean (Richmond 1957-73)\n\n245 games, 204 goals\n\nThe epitome of Richmond spirit for much of his career, Roger Dean was most noted as a back pocket but was thrown forward often enough and with enough positive results that he was named on the half forward flank of the club\u2019s Team of the Century. Resolute and determined, he played in two Tigers flags (1967 and captaining 1969), missing the 1973 flag through loss of form. He responded by captaining the reserves team to the premiership instead before retiring. Dean was a bridge between the old and the new Tigers, being the last active player to have played a game at the old Punt Road Oval before the team relocated in 1965.\n\nDavid Dench (North Melbourne 1969-84)\n\n275 games, 29 goals\n\nDench was one of the first attacking fullbacks, using his judgment to make forays down the field and push the Roos into attack. From being appointed captain in 1972 (at 21, he was one of the youngest in club history) to his retirement in 1984 he was a mainstay in defence, playing in both of the club\u2019s premierships in the 1970s, captaining 1977. Dench won four club best-and-fairest awards, and would go on to be named fullback in North\u2019s Team of the Century.\n\nWally Donald (Footscray 1946-58)\n\n205 games, one goal\n\nRecruited in 1946, Wally Donald played in the midfield to start his career, but shifted back as his career progressed. Forming a famous partnership with fullback Herb Henderson, Donald was a big part of Footscray\u2019s rise to prominence in the early 1950s. Indeed, the team\u2019s 1953 defence was the best to date since Footscray entered the league in 1925 \u2013 not just for Footscray, but the league as a whole! He won a club best-and-fairest in 1949 and finished second in three straight years. Donald played in the club\u2019s breakthrough 1954 premiership and captained the club in 1956 after Charlie Sutton\u2019s retirement. Despite playing the majority of his career as a back pocket, Donald was oddly named on the halfback flank in Footscray\u2019s Team of the Century. Interestingly, he is also the only player with two separate streaks of over 100 games without a goal \u2013 his solitary major came in game 102.\n\nHalfback line\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Doull (Carlton 1969-86)\n\n356 games, 22 goals\n\nFor the Flying Doormat, it was just as often what he didn\u2019t do as well as what he did that made him a legend. What he didn\u2019t do: promote himself, lose his temper, make mistakes, have a bad game, let his team down. What he did do: win four club best-and-fairest awards, win four premierships, win a Norm Smith Medal in 1981, be named on the halfback flank of both the Carlton and AFL Teams of the Century, take part in the Toyota Memorable Moments commercials being accosted by Helen d\u2019Amico again. Doull was simply a consistent and premier defender in an era covering two great Carlton teams at the start and end of the 1970s.\n\nBert Deacon (Carlton 1942-51)\n\n106 games, seven goals\n\nAlongside Doull in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century sits centre halfback Bert Deacon, who owns a place in history as the first Brownlow Medallist for the Blues, having won it in 1947. Scrupulously fair and with great anticipation, Deacon would often intercept opponents\u2019 attacks and launch the ball Carlton\u2019s way. He played in the club\u2019s 1945 and 1947 premierships, being noted as one of the few in the former grand final to not get caught up in the atmosphere of the day, preventing opponent Ron Clegg from joining the fracas as well as ensuring he faced the right way for a free kick. After a few years struggling with injury, Deacon played with Preston for a few years before serving as Carlton\u2019s club secretary.\n\nBarry Davis (Essendon 1961-72, North Melbourne 1973-75)\n\n289 games, 119 goals\n\nA fabled name for two clubs, Barry Davis spent over a decade at Essendon as a star on the halfback flank before transferring to North as a result of the ill-fated ten-year rule. Winning premierships in 1962 and 1965, Davis won best-and-fairest awards in 1968-69 and 1971, while at North he won the best-and-fairest in 1973 and 1975 to go with captaining the 1975 premiership. Rarely beaten and often picking up well over 20 touches a game, Davis was named as number 15 on the list of Champions of Essendon, and on the halfback flank of their Team of the Century. He was also named on the bench of North\u2019s Team of the Century. Notably, he was also the coach that made way for Kevin Sheedy at Essendon in 1980.\n\nCentre line\n\nRobert DiPierdomenico (Hawthorn 1975-91)\n\n240 games, 130 goals\n\nDipper was one of the most popular Hawks on the field, and a larger-than-life character off it, serving as Channel Seven\u2019s boundary rider for a decade after retiring. His on-field record of five premierships, a best-on-ground performance in the 1978 grand final (the year before the Norm Smith Medal was introduced), and a Brownlow Medal in 1986 all serve to show his genuine quality as a player. In the 1989 grand final, he punctured his lung in a collision with Gary Ablett in the first quarter, and still played the game out before spending over a week in hospital. Dipper is a wingman in Hawthorn\u2019s Team of the Century.\n\nMitch Duncan (Geelong 2010-)\n\n204 games, 149 goals\n\nMitch Duncan has been a consistent ball-winner for the Cats since being drafted in 2009. Able to push forward and kick the odd handy goal, Duncan hasn\u2019t had the pure individual plaudits that could be expected besides the 2011 premiership (he was the first substitute player to win a medal), but has consistently featured as one of Geelong\u2019s best players over the past decade. For each year since 2013 (besides 2015 when he was injured), Duncan has racked up over 500 possessions and has stepped ably into the hole left by the retirement of Geelong\u2019s great players from the premiership teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Dixon (Melbourne 1954-68)\n\n252 games, 41 goals\n\nOne of the most prominent members of the great Melbourne sides of the 1950s and 1960s, the only reason Dixon did not join Bluey Adams and Ron Barassi as six-time premiership-winners was that he was dropped for the 1955 flag as a disciplinary measure after playing a University match against the wishes of coach Norm Smith. Dixon was fearless and forever going after the football to deliver forward, not always accurately! He was the first Demon to play 250 games and retired at the end of the season as injuries got the best of him. Interestingly, Dixon spent five years in parliament during his playing career and continued to serve until 1982, when the Liberal Party were voted out of office. He was named on the wing in Melbourne\u2019s Team of the Century.\n\nRuck line\n\nJack Dyer (Richmond 1931-49)\n\n312 games, 443 goals\n\nCaptain Blood. An inaugural Hall of Fame Legend, Dyer embodied Richmond for two decades as a tough ruckman who was never afraid to put his body on the line to assist his team, and was especially noted for his bruising manner of play. Winning premierships in 1932, 1934 and 1943, Dyer was appointed captain-coach in 1941 and held the position for the rest of his career. Despite his ruthless reputation, he was only suspended once in 19 years. He also won six club best-and-fairests (including four in a row) and eventually the award was named after him. Dyer \u2018ere, as his newspaper column was titled, also became well known as a gaffe-prone commentator and columnist. Dyer was named on the interchange bench of the AFL Team of the Century.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield (Adelaide 2008-15, Geelong 2016-)\n\n249 games, 284 goals\n\nDangerfield was already a star during his time at Adelaide, but since returning home to Geelong has lifted his game to even greater heights. Noted for his burst through the middle when collecting the ball, Dangerfield would either slot goals from the 50-metre arc or deliver to a forward in a greater position. He is also capable of shifting forward to impact the scoreboard, using his strong marking skills to provide another target for the team. Named All Australian on seven occasions this decade, Dangerfield won one best-and-fairest with Adelaide and has won three with Geelong as well as the Brownlow Medal in 2016 \u2013 he has finished in the top ten of Brownlow counting every year since 2012. Dangerfield still has several years left in his career and should easily add to his list of accolades.\n\nBrett Deledio (Richmond 2005-16, Greater Western Sydney 2017-19)\n\n275 games, 197 goals\n\nDeledio was a pacy midfielder for Richmond, and could shift to the halfback or half forward lines as needed. He won the Rising Star award in his first year, and during Richmond\u2019s poorer years at the turn of the decade he was a consistent star, winning club best-and-fairests in 2008 and 2009. His standing was reinforced when he was appointed vice-captain in 2013, finally playing his first final after 194 games. After the 2016 season, he was traded to GWS in a bid for that elusive premiership, but his body started to catch up with him and he retired at the conclusion of the 2019 season having seen his old team defeat his new one in the grand final. Deledio was also All Australian in 2012 and 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalf forward line\n\nBob Davis (Geelong 1948-58)\n\n189 games, 149 goals\n\nThe Geelong Flyer was one of the fastest players in the league throughout the 1950s, and Davis was a regular on the half forward flank not just for the Cats but for the Big V. Davis played in the club\u2019s 1951 and 1952 premierships, and captained the club from 1955 to 1958. He won only one club best-and-fairest award, but was an automatic selection in Geelong\u2019s Team of the Century on the forward flank. Of course, Davis went on to bigger things in the media, just like his fellow D teammate Jack Dyer, being fair dinkum unbelievable for several decades.\n\nTerry Daniher (South Melbourne 1976-77, Essendon 1978-92)\n\n313 games, 469 goals\n\nThe only Daniher to make it into this team out of the four brothers and Joe, Terry started his career at South Melbourne before being traded for Neville Fields. Daniher was ever present for the Bombers, winning the 1984 and 1985 premierships as captain and leading the club goal-kicking twice. One of the most popular clubmen for Essendon, Daniher retired after the 1992 season and was named on the half forward flank of the club\u2019s Team of the Century. He was named as the 11th greatest Bomber in club history in 2002.\n\nSports opinion delivered daily\n\nAlan Didak (Collingwood 2001-13)\n\n218 games, 274 goals\n\nAlan Didak\u2019s outrageous talent and ability to kick goals from anywhere saw him anointed as the successor to Peter Daicos among the Magpies faithful, and he endured as one of the most popular Collingwood players through most of the past decade. Although sometimes slowed by injury, Didak was able to win a club best-and-fairest in 2006, as well as play in Collingwood\u2019s 2010 flag, leading the club goal-kicking in that year as well. After the premiership injuries started to build and Didak left the club after playing only five games in 2013. Didak was named All Australian twice, in 2006 and 2010.\n\nForward line\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Daicos (Collingwood 1979-93)\n\n250 games, 549 goals\n\nAnd speak of the devil! Daicos would attempt kicks for goal that other players wouldn\u2019t dare dream of, and more often than not they would come off. From his debut as a centreman in 1979 to his retirement in 1993, Daicos was one of the most talented players on the field, and won two club best-and-fairests in 1982 and 1988 before Collingwood\u2019s drought-breaking flag in 1990. He led Collingwood\u2019s goal-kicking on five occasions and was named in the Magpies\u2019 Team of the Century as a forward pocket.\n\nJason Dunstall (Hawthorn 1985-98)\n\n269 games, 1254 goals\n\nIn keeping with the efficiency that Hawthorn operated with through the \u201980s and \u201990s, Dunstall was a consistent and efficient full forward, finishing off the good work his teammates up the field had done. Not a spectacular high flyer, Dunstall was able to find space to lead into and slot home another major. Six times he kicked over 100 goals in a season, including the incredible 1992 season when he managed 145.84. Forward pocket in Hawthorn\u2019s Team of the Century, Dunstall won four Hawthorn best-and-fairests and retired with the third most goals in league history.\n\nAllan Davis (St Kilda 1966-75, Melbourne 1976-77, Essendon 1978-79, Collingwood 1980)\n\n250 games, 372 goals\n\nCapable of the spectacular during his career with St Kilda in particular, Allan Davis found his spot in history in his first year, when he was the youngest player in St Kilda\u2019s 1966 flag. Davis could kick the mercurial goal, and twice led St Kilda\u2019s goal-kicking. Later stints at Melbourne, Essendon and Collingwood kept him in the league through to 1980, although he never recaptured his St Kilda glory. Perhaps the most memorable moment of Davis\u2019 career was when he couldn\u2019t be found on the bench at St Kilda\u2026 he was chatting to a spectator and eating a Violet Crumble!\n\nInterchange\n\nPeter Dean (Carlton 1984-98)\n\n248 games, 41 goals\n\nCourageous to a fault, Peter Dean was an important part of two premiership sides for the Blues in 1987 and 1995 (although almost as important were his celebrations on the podium!). Never one to say die, he started his career up forward before making his name as a hard-nosed and close-checking defender who never lost sight of his man. Although he never got the external plaudits, he was very well regarded at Princes Park and inducted into the club\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nNick Dal Santo (St Kilda 2002-13, North Melbourne 2014-16)\n\n322 games, 156 goals\n\nDal Santo was a hard-running and tough midfielder for the Saints, and would often find himself on the wings, delivering quality ball to the likes of Nick Riewoldt and Fraser Gehrig. As part of one of the strongest midfields of the era, Dal Santo was often overshadowed but rarely put a foot wrong. After leaving St Kilda as a free agent, he gave North good service for three years before retiring once his contract was not renewed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGary Dempsey (Footscray 1967-78, North Melbourne 1979-84)\n\n329 games, 144 goals\n\nAfter only two years in the VFL, Gary Dempsey\u2019s career looked over after he sustained burns to over 50 per cent of his body while fighting bushfires. That he came back is remarkable in itself \u2013 that he won a Brownlow Medal in 1975 and spent nearly two decades as one of the best ruckmen in the league is incredible. A brilliant tap ruck who often dropped back to take saving marks in defence, Dempsey won six best-and-fairests at Footscray before leaving to chase a premiership with North. The premiership eluded him, but one more best-and-fairest was won, and Dempsey was named in both clubs\u2019 Teams of the Century as ruck (Footscray) and emergency (North). When he retired in 1984, Dempsey had been awarded the most Brownlow votes of any player in history.\n\nLaurie Dwyer (North Melbourne 1956-70)\n\n201 games, 34 goals\n\nLaurie Dwyer was synonymous with North for half a century \u2013 first as a dashing and tough winger who almost won the Brownlow on three occasions as well as winning two club best-and-fairests, then as a runner, recruiter and administrator. Named Twinkle Toes for his ballroom-dancing experience, Dwyer twice recovered from season-missing injuries in 1959 and 1965 with no ill effects the next year. Named on the wing in North\u2019s Team of the Century, Dwyer was part of a Roos family \u2013 his father Leo and sons Anthony and David also played for North Melbourne.\n\nEmergencies\n\nCharlie Dibbs (Collingwood 1924-35, Geelong 1936)\n\n223 games, one goal\n\nDibbs was a fine fullback for Collingwood, taking part in the club\u2019s famous four-peat of 1927-30. Although he started as a rover and was tried up forward (kicking his only goal in his fourth match \u2013 his 219 straight goalless games is a record), his anticipation and spoiling ability saving many a Collingwood goal. Towards the end of his career he shifted to the back pocket on the arrival of Jack Regan and played in one last premiership in 1935. Spending one year at Geelong as captain coach, Dibbs is best remembered as a member of the Collingwood machine.\n\nStuart Dew (Port Adelaide 1997-2006, Hawthorn 2008-09)\n\n206 games, 265 goals\n\nSurprisingly nimble, Stuart Dew developed a reputation as one of the most precise kickers in the league over his time at Port Adelaide. His influence was not often reflected in accolades, but he played an important role in the Power\u2019s 2004 flag and led their goal-kicking in 2002. Dew initially retired in 2006 before being lured back to play by Alastair Clarkson. His role in the 2008 premiership showed that he had lost none of his incredible skill after the year out of the game. After injuries ended his career in 2009, Dew went into coaching and is now in charge at Gold Coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarl Ditterich (St Kilda 1963-72, 1976-78, Melbourne 1973-75, 1979-80)\n\n285 games, 199 goals\n\nDitterich made one of the most explosive debuts in league history as a 17-year-old, with blonde hair flying everywhere. His high marking and bundles of energy distinguished him from the start. Over the next 18 years, he evolved into one of the toughest and most feared players in the league, making regular appearances before the tribunal. Indeed, he missed St Kilda\u2019s 1966 premiership through suspension. Ditterich left St Kilda as part of the ten-year rule, serving Melbourne for three years before returning to St Kilda as captain (incidentally, Allan Davis\u2019 transfer to Melbourne was part of this transaction). Finishing his career as captain-coach of Melbourne for two years, Ditterich won best-and-fairests at both St Kilda and Melbourne during his career.\n\nThe E team will be next, with a few all-time greats and a couple of current stars in the mix as well."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/club/history/hall-of-fame", "page_content": "The Carlton Hall of Fame was established in 1987 and recognises contributions made to the Club by individuals.\n\nInductees are to be considered from three different eras \u2013 1864 to 1938, 1939 to 1970 and 1971 to present.\n\n\n\nThe Nomination Panel considers a candidate\u2019s outstanding service and overall contribution to the Carlton Football Club.\n\nThey may also consider a candidates individual record, ability, integrity, sportsmanship, and character.\n\nThe number of games played or coached or years of administration and years of service is only a guide and not a determining factor.\n\nIn 1997, the Club also introduced 'Legend' status to coincide with the opening of the 'Legends Stand' and newly-introduced Legend status component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

After earning a wide appreciation for his courage, honesty, and reliability on the field in his 188 games between 1950 and 1961, he went on to further serve the Blues in many other administrative roles, as diverse as a committeeman, selector, player\u2019s representative, recruiting officer and team manager.\n\n\n\nSergio Silvagni - 1958-1971\n\n\n\nAfter 239 games and 136 goals, two Premierships, one year as captain, two Best & Fairest awards and two Big V appearances, he went on to further serve the Blues as a committeeman, selector, and even a caretaker coach.\n\nInducted in 1990:\n\nGeorge Coulthard - 1876-1882\n\n\n\nPerhaps the first superstar of Australian Football (or Victorian Rules as it was then known), George Coulthard joined the fledgling Carlton Football Club as a 19-year-old in 1876. A local farmer, Coulthard had already established himself as a brilliant cricketer. But when he donned the blue cap of Carlton and ran out to join in the game that had gripped the colony like no other, Coulthard was a sensation.\n\n\n\nCreswell \"Mick\" Crisp - 1931-1941\n\n\n\nAt first, a dangerous flanker who combined brilliantly with Carlton\u2019s champion full-forward Harry 'Soapy' Vallence, he later moved into the centre, where his tenacity and outstanding foot skills helped drive the Blues to the 1938 Premiership.\n\n\n\nRobert Walls - 1967-1978\n\n\n\nHe was just sixteen years old when he played his first game for Carlton, and goaled with his first kick.

Years before athletic endurance and absolute intensity became prime requirements of a league footballer, Johnston; \u2018The Dominator\u2019 carved his name with capitals into the history of the Carlton Football Club.\n\n\n\nInducted in 1992:\n\nJim Clark - 1943-1951\n\n\n\nInvariably described as loyal, brave and determined, James Robinson (Jim) Clark was a star for the Blues through the uncertain years of World War II, and the youngest member of Carlton\u2019s 1945 Premiership team.\n\n\n\nErn Henfry - 1944, 1947-1952\n\n\n\nAt 182 cms and 82 kg he was big for a centreman, but his wonderful foot skills, his pace and his evasiveness made him a matchwinner.

He developed an instinctive, almost telepathic combination with champion ruckman John Nicholls and ruck-rover Serge Silvagni in an era when this trio were the platform for two Carlton Premierships.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Fitzpatrick - 1975-1983\n\n\n\nAt 191 cm and 91 kg he gave away height and weight to many opponents, but he was clever, athletic and an outstanding mark.

With his spindly frame, his socks down around his ankles and his trademark mop of unruly hair, Hunter ran into, and flew over packs from all angles to take spectacular marks week after week. Absolutely fearless in his pursuit of the football, he never shirked the fiercest of physical clashes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dean - 1984-1998\n\n\n\nThroughout his 248 games with the Navy Blues \u2013 including the '87 and '95 Premierships \u2013 \u2018Deanie\u2019 (later also dubbed \u2018Helmet\u2019 for his mullet haircut, or \u2018The General\u2019 for his on-field leadership) was one of the most popular Carlton players of his era.\n\nInducted in 1999:\n\nLaurie Kerr - 1950-1959\n\n\n\nIf three words were needed to sum up Laurie Kerr as a footballer, then they would surely be speed, aggression and courage. A blisteringly-quick winger, centreman or half-forward flanker, Kerr was a star player in a bleak period for the Blues from 1950 to \u201959, and later, an influential figure in the Carlton Football Club for more than thirty years.\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Hall - 1963-1973\n\n\n\nKevin \"Racehorse\" Hall was a solid, reliable, often inspirational member of three Premiership teams for the Blues, and later, a valuable and long-serving committee and board member.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Alvin - 1984-1994\n\n\n\nEasily distinguished on the field by his long, shoulder-length hair, Alvin played 218 games and kicked 95 goals.

Destined to be a champion of the club and of the game, he joined Carlton\u2019s Under-19 squad as a 16-year-old schoolboy in 1988 and retired after 255 games for the Navy Blues, including the 1995 Premiership.\n\nGreg Williams - 1992-1997\n\n\n\nOne of the most brilliant and controversial players of all time, Greg \"Diesel\" Williams was twice rejected by Carlton as a youngster because he lacked natural leg speed. Nevertheless, he went on to carve his name into AFL history as a champion centreman at Geelong and Sydney, before returning to Princes Park and Premiership glory with the Blues. For sheer ball-getting ability, tenacity, and pin-point disposal by hand or by foot, Diesel Williams had few peers.\n\nInducted in 2000:\n\nGarry Crane - 1964-1976\n\n\n\nRenowned for his boundless courage, perseverance, and sheer ball-getting ability, Garry Crane was an outstanding big-occasion player for the Navy Blues in a celebrated 13-year career between 1964 and 1976.\n\n\n\nJim Buckley - 1976-1990\n\n\n\nJimmy Buckley played his first senior game in guernsey number 16 at the tender age of 16 years, 6 months and 18 days, making him the equal-youngest Blue of all. In a career stretching 15 seasons, Buckley would play in three Premiership teams and won the Best & Fairest award in 1982.\n\n\n\nWayne Harmes - 1977-1988\n\n\n\nA true utility, he was perhaps at his best in a back pocket, yet never failed to produce wherever he was asked to play. Just 177 cm tall, his barrel chest and solid legs meant he tipped the scales at 85 kg. He was surprisingly quick for his build, a safe mark, and a dangerous near goal, and he loved bursting through packs to set up play at both ends of the ground.\n\n\n\nMichael Sexton - 1990-2000\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton\u2019s brightest stars in the last decade of the 20th century was Michael Sexton; a skilled, resolute defender who was born in New Guinea and grew up in Bendigo.\n\nInducted in 2001:\n\nIan Collins - 1961-1969 & 1971\n\n\n\nA courageous, uncompromising back pocket in the Blues' 1968 Premiership team, Ian Collins went on to serve as Secretary-Manager and President through some of Carlton Football Club's most successful, and later, most turbulent times.\n\n\n\nDavid Glascott - 1981-1991\n\n\n\nWith his slender build, his longish blonde hair and his baby face, he seemed anything but a star VFL footballer. But looks are often deceiving, and in Glascott\u2019s case, the fresh face and spindly legs belonged to a determined and skillful midfielder who was a valuable member of three Carlton Premiership teams.\n\n\n\nAndrew McKay - 1993-2003\n\n\n\nA warrior at half-back for the Blues for 11 seasons, he was resolute, reliable and most of the time, utterly impassable. His career began with a Grand Final defeat in his debut year, then soared to redemption only two seasons later. From then on, through the near-misses of 1999 and 2000, and into the looming catastrophe of the first decade of this troubled century, Andrew Ian McKay stood \u2013 and still stands \u2013 as an all-time great of the Carlton Football Club.\n\nInducted in 2006:\n\nJack Worrall - 1902-1909\n\n\n\nThe first-ever coach of a VFL club.

Highly skilled, athletic and as tough as teak, he played 167 games and kicked 7 goals for Carlton in a celebrated career that stretched over 13 seasons between 1913 and 1925. Two of those matches were Grand Final victories; in 1914 over South Melbourne and in 1915 over Collingwood.\n\n\n\nJim Baird - 1941-1943 & 1945-1951\n\n\n\nJim Baird was a two-time VFL Premiership player for the Carlton Football Club, and one of the great all-round sportsmen of the post-World War II era.\n\n\n\nBryan Quirk - 1965-1975\n\n\n\nOne of Carlton's greats, Bryan Quirk was the football equivalent of a champion greyhound. A tall, beautifully balanced, long-kicking winger or half-forward, he arrived at Carlton at the dawn of the Barassi era, and carved out a celebrated, if unlucky career.\n\n\n\nSyd Jackson - 1969-1976\n\n\n\nA gifted, courageous aboriginal footballer who was a star in two Carlton Premiership teams. In 2005 he was named in the AFL Players Association Indigenous Team of the Century, and in 2006 he became the Carlton Heroes\u2019 inaugural inductee into the Carlton Hall of Fame - an honour that everyone who saw him play would agree, was richly deserved.\n\n\n\nPeter McConville - 1978-1985\n\n\n\nWidely regarded for his consistency and his versatility, the powerful barrel-chested utility was a key factor in Carlton's golden run of three Premierships in four years from 1979 to 1982.\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou - 1979-1986\n\n\n\nAlex Marcou was a member of Carlton\u2019s fabled mosquito fleet of brilliant small men of the 1970\u2019s and \u201880\u2019s, and a three-time Premiership rover for the Blues.\n\n\n\nFraser Brown - 1989-2000\n\n\n\nThe shaggy-haired Brown, who wore #20 in 177 games for the Blues, was a tough and fair midfielder with the occasional stint forward. He was a solid 'inside' midfielder with creative disposal, but lacked a yard in pace. And when we say 'solid' we mean 'brick solid' given his 90 kilo, 181 cm frame. He formed an amazing engine room with other Legends Greg Williams and Brett Ratten, providing considerable ball winning ability to the Carlton teams of the 1990's.\n\n\n\nKen Sheldon - 1977-1986\n\n\n\n\u201cBomba\u201d Sheldon was an important member of Carlton\u2019s famed mosquito fleet of the nineteen-seventies and eighties. Just 178 cm and 76 kg, he was a nippy, courageous rover who became a versatile utility as his career progressed.\n\nInducted in 2011:\n\nRon Barassi - 1965-1971\n\n\n\nIn a VFL career in which he played 254 games and kicked 329 goals, he wore our Navy Blue guernsey in 50 games, kicked 35 goals, and coached six seasons for two memorable Premierships. More importantly, he had swept away the complacent attitudes that existed before his arrival, and built the platform for Carlton's dominance in the next decade.\n\n\n\nVin Gardiner - 1907-1917\n\n\n\nMore than 90 years after he played his last match for the Blues, Gardiner still ranks tenth overall in our club\u2019s list of all-time career goals. Described as the \u2018biggest kick, inch for inch\u2019 of his era, Gardiner led Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking in seven of his eleven seasons, and was also the VFL\u2019s leading scorer in 1911.\n\n\n\nJohn Goold - 1963-1970\n\n\n\nA brilliant, flamboyant, two-time Premiership player for Carlton during the Barassi years in the \u2018swingin\u2019 sixties,\u2019 John William Crosbie Goold became almost as famous for his dapper appearance off the field, as for his exploits on it.\n\n\n\nAnthony Koutoufides - 1992-2007\n\n\n\nThroughout the history of VFL/AFL football, few individual players have actually changed the game. However, such was the impact of Anthony Koutoufides - \u201cKouta\u201d to the masses of Blues supporters he thrilled during his celebrated 15-season career at Princes Park between 1992 and 2007 \u2013 that today he is recognised as the prototype of the 21st-century footballer.\n\nDavid Parkin - 1981-1985 & 1991-2000\n\n\n\nAmong the most respected figures in the long history of the Carlton Football Club, David Parkin was already a household name at Hawthorn when he arrived at Princes Park in 1981 to coach the Blues to three Premierships in fifteen interrupted seasons.\n\nInducted in 2013:\n\nDavid Rhys-Jones - 1985-1992\n\n\n\nRhys-Jones' rare football talents were sometimes lost in his all-too-frequent Tribunal visits. Not so at Carlton, the club to which the 1987 premiership player and Norm Smith Medallist committed in 108 matches (after 76 with the Swans).\n\nInducted in 2016:\n\nScott Camporeale - 1995-2005\n\nA member of Carlton's 1995 premiership team in his debut season, the man endearingly known as 'Campo' went on to play 233 games in the navy blue, earning All-Australian selection and a club best-and-fairest award in 2000.\n\nMil Hanna - 1986-1997\n\nBorn in Lebanon, Hanna quickly became a cult figure among the Carlton faithful in a celebrated 11-season career which included the famous 1995 premiership. The curtain came down on Mil\u2019s 190-game Carlton career in 1997, but the boy from East Brunswick still maintains his love for the club with which he shares a deep-rooted territorial link.\n\nIan Robertson - 1966-1974\n\nRenowned for his running capacity and prodigious, penetrating kicking, Robertson was a fixture in a famed centreline comprising Bryan Quirk and Garry Crane through what was arguably Carlton\u2019s greatest era. The grand final triumphs of 1968, \u201970 and \u201972 would crown a 125-game Carlton career for Robertson, whose later football life involved gamecalling for the Seven Network.\n\nJack Wrout (dec.) - 1936-1944\n\nThe late Wrout first embarked on a senior League career at North Melbourne in 1931, but after 53 games in six seasons with the Shinboners, became increasingly frustrated with a lack of opportunity. In 1936, Wrout crossed to Carlton and emerged as a star forward in the Blues\u2019 1938 grand final team, which broke the Club\u2019s record 22-year premiership drought. Five years later, he took the honors as his club\u2019s leading goalkicker.\n\nInducted in 2018:\n\nBrent Crosswell - 1968-1975\n\nRecruited to the club from the Tasmanian convict locale of Campbell Town, Brent Crosswell is remembered as a prodigious if enigmatic football talent \u2013 a genuine star in the star-studded Barassi-coached Carlton teams of the late 1960s/early \u201970s.\n\nThough his career would fall two games adrift of 100 in dark Navy, \u2018Tiger\u2019 impacted tremendously on football\u2019s grandest stage, as a member of the Blues\u2019 drought-breaking Grand Final victory of 1968 and perhaps their most famous of all Grand Final triumphs in 1970.\n\nLance Whitnall - 1997-2007\n\nThe son of Carlton\u2019s 66-game player Graeme, Lance Whitnall was considered the heir apparent to Stephen Kernahan as the club\u2019s pre-eminent tall forward \u2013 a lofty task to be sure, but one to which Whitnall committed with purpose from the outset.\n\nIn 216 games through 11 seasons from 1997, Whitnall - or \u2018Big Red\u2019 as he was endearingly dubbed \u2013 capably served in Carlton\u2019s front half, until a persistent knee problem at just 28 brought premature end to his on-field tenure.\n\nInducted in 2023:\n\nPercy Bentley - 1941-1955\n\nSince the formation of the VFL in 1897, only David Parkin has coached the Carlton Football Club more times than Percy Bentley - and few have served the Blues longer and with greater distinction than the former Richmond champion.\n\nBentley commandeered Carlton to the famous Premierships of 1945 and 1947 Premierships, then dedicated most of the remaining years of his life to the football club as Vice-President.\n\nFor Bentley, Carlton was everything.\n\nAdrian Gleeson - 1986-1996\n\nHailing from the rolling green fields of Koroit in Victoria's western districts, Gleeson fast earned a reputation as one of Carlton's truly durable small men, and a more than handy successor to the retiring Rod Ashman.\n\nIn tandem with the Blues' runners - the likes of Craig Bradley, Mark Naley and Fraser Murphy, Gleeson savoured Premiership success in 1987 and would capably serve his club through 176 games as a player before committing his time and substantial energies at board level.\n\nChris Judd - 2008-2015\n\nChris Judd joined Carlton from West Coast in a hail of publicity - and from the outset validated the club's greatest recruiting coup since Ron Barassi.\n\nNamed captain in his maiden season with the Blues, Judd reinforced his status as one of League football's truly great players of the early 20th century - landing the John Nicholls Medal for Carlton's Best & Fairest on three occasions, as well as the Brownlow Medal for the competition's preeminent player, through 145 quality games - before giving back at board level as a Carlton director.\n\nCarlton Football Club Hall of Fame Legends:\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the opening of the Legends Stand at Princes Park and the newly-introduced Legend component of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Carlton elevated nine of its own Hall of Fame Inductees to Legend status for the first time.\n\nAccordingly, Craig Bradley, Bert Deacon, Bruce Doull, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Johnston, Stephen Kernahan, John Nicholls, Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence were elevated following a vote of Club supporters.\n\nToday, a total of 14 Carlton Inductees are recognized as Legends, with Ken Hands having been elevated in 2006, Robert Walls in 2011, Geoff Southby in 2013, Sergio Silvagni in 2016 and David McKay in 2021.\n\nElevated in 1997:\n\nCraig Bradley\n\nBert Deacon\n\nAlex Jesaulenko\n\nBruce Doull\n\nWayne Johnston\n\nStephen Kernahan\n\nJohn Nicholls\n\nStephen Silvagni\n\nHarry Vallence\n\nElevated in 2006:\n\nKen Hands\n\nElevated in 2011:\n\nRobert Walls\n\nElevated in 2013:\n\nGeoff Southby\n\nElevated in 2016:\n\nSergio Silvagni\n\nElevated in 2021:\n\nDavid McKay\n\nElevated in 2023:\n\nHorrie Clover\n\nIan Collins"}, {"url": "https://www.afltables.com/afl/stats/players/B/Bert_Deacon.html", "page_content": "Abbreviations key #=Jumper\n\nGM=Games played\n\nKI=Kicks\n\nMK=Marks\n\nHB=Handballs\n\nDI=Disposals\n\nDA=Disposal average\n\nGL=Goals\n\nBH=Behinds\n\nHO=Hit outs\n\nTK=Tackles\n\nRB=Rebound 50s\n\nIF=Inside 50s\n\nCL=Clearances\n\nCG=Clangers\n\nFF=Free kicks for\n\nFA=Free kicks against\n\nBR=Brownlow votes\n\nCP=Contested possessions\n\nUP=Uncontested possessions\n\nCM=Contested marks\n\nMI=Marks inside 50\n\n1%=One percenters\n\nBO=Bounces\n\nGA=Goal assist\n\n%P=Percentage of game played\n\nSU=Sub (On/Off)\n\n\u2191=subbed on\n\n\u2193=subbed off"}, {"url": "https://victoriancollections.net.au/items/5d5229e121ea6c157ceeb51e", "page_content": "Carlton Football Club\n\nDinner to Mr H R Clover player Career : 1920-24, 1926-31 Debut : Round 2, 1920 vs. Richmond, aged 25 years, 46 days Carlton Player No. 346 Games : 147 Goals : 396 Guernsey No. 1 Last Game : Semi Final, 1931 vs. Collingwood, aged 36 years, 180 days Height : 185 cm (6 ft. 1 in.)

But even before he took the field for Carlton, Clover had to conquer the odds on the battlefields of France in World War 1. From Maryborough in central Victoria, Horrie enlisted in the 1st AIF in September 1915. After basic training, he embarked for France with reinforcements for the 7th Battalion in January of 1916. Soon pitched into the horrors of trench warfare, he fought and survived until September of that year, when he was transferred to a machine gun company and promoted to the rank of Corporal. On Christmas day, 1916, Horrie was struck down with acute appendicitis. He was evacuated to a field hospital for emergency surgery, where the doctors discovered that his appendix was gangrenous and that his life was in danger. He was immediately transferred to London for specialist treatment, and months of recuperation. Pronounced unfit for further front-line service, he was repatriated back to Australia in August 1917, and honourably discharged in May of the following year \u2013 six months before the Armistice. Having recovered, and keen to have a crack at senior football, Clover trained with Richmond and Melbourne before Carlton gave him an opportunity at VFL level. And how he delivered! In his first match in 1920 \u2013 ironically, against Richmond - he kicked four goals from centre half-forward, and hit the post three times! By the end of his first season at Princes Park, Clover was one of Carlton\u2019s drawcards. Former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was just one of the many Carlton fans who were captivated; \u201che was the most artistic of high marks, unforgettable at half-forward,\u201d said Menzies. Horrie could kick a football, too. A balanced, deceptively quick mover, he was a glorious running drop-kick for goal. Playing against Richmond again at Princes Park in July, 1921, he let fly with a monster kick that was later measured at 86.26 metres \u2013 that\u2019s 94 yards, 2 feet in imperial terms! And there are numerous other instances where he roosted the ball more than 70 metres. In round 12 of 1921, he slotted 13 goals in a game against St Kilda; a club record which still stands today. The Blues made the finals in third place in 1921 and battled through to meet Richmond for the Premiership. Then the heavens above the MCG opened up on the day before the decider, turning the ground into a quagmire. In what was to be Clover\u2019s only Grand Final appearance, Richmond won a slogging, mauling contest by four points. While Premiership glory eluded him, Horrie was Carlton\u2019s top goalkicker in three of his first four seasons, including 1922, where his total of 58 was the competition\u2019s best. He was appointed captain of the Blues that same year, and in 1923 took on the dual role of captain-coach. Over 1924 / 1925, he suffered more debilitating illness that prevented him from playing all season. Unable to pull on his football boots, he took on the job of Club Secretary, and continued in that position even after returning to the field in 1926. When he did eventually resume, he formed a new, powerful Carlton forward set-up with a young Harry \u201cSoapy\u201d Vallence at full-forward. Twice more \u2013 in 1926 and 1928, Clover\u2019s brilliance and accuracy in front of goal saw him at the top of Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking, and in 1929 \u2013 aged 34, he was honoured with the captaincy of Victoria against WA in his ninth and final game in the Big Vee. show_image.php?id=205 Horrie Clover retired as a player in 1931 after 147 games. His total of 396 goals is still ranked fifth best in Carlton\u2019s proud history (only displaced for fourth when Brendan Fevola broke through in 2007/2008) \u2013 and it should be remembered that all but a handful of his games were played at centre half-forward, not in the goal square. In 1932 he was elected Vice-President of the Carlton Football Club, but retired after one year. In February 1935 on learning of Terry Ogden's the serious illness, Clover and Newton Chandler offered their services for a blood transfusion for the club's wing man. After a blood test Chandler's blood was accepted. However, Ogden passed away the next month. Clover stood again in 1935, was elected \u2013 and spent twenty unbroken years serving his beloved Blues. He even took on the Presidency in 1956, aged 60, and was as vigorous and determined as ever in his two years in the job. Carlton Football Club mourned deeply when Horrie Clover passed away on the first day of January, 1984. Three years later, he was among the first to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. Testament to his stature in the game as a whole, he was elected to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996; and May 2000 saw him named as one of four emergencies in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century. A champion in every sense of the word, he spent 37 years of his remarkable life at Princes Park. Footnote The Argus published an article on Maryborough, April 12 1930, it said; \"Clover has been the leading half-forward in League ranks for some time. It takes a specialist to fill the position capably, and the Carisbrook man does this admirably. Like good wine he has improved with age, and besides being one of the greatest half forwards that has ever appeared on a football field, he is about the best all round kicker that has ever played the game. He excells in punting, drop, and place kicking. He is a great marksman and a splendid exponent, one of the greatest the district has produced, besides being a fair cricketer also.\" When Clover returned to football in 1926, The Argus mentioned that they thought it was the first time a member of the Permit and Umpire Committee had played in a League game. 13 GOAL AWARD Round 12, 1921 At the Carlton AGM held on Monday 27 February 1922, Horrie Clover \"was presented with ball used on the occasion, the St.Kilda club having generously donated it to the Carlton officials, who had it mounted for the purpose.\" (Age February 22 1922) 1922 The Art Of Forward Play Horrie wrote an article for the Sporting Globe August 30 p7 To read click here> http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article184798404 1928 Idol of Carlton Crowds - Australia's Best Centre Half Forward The Sporting Globe's football writer W.

Daily Pictorial (Sydney) article about Horrie. http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246129350 1932 Jack Worrall on Clover Writing for the Australasian September 03 p7; \"Take Horrie Clover as an example, a real specialist, one of the best forwards the game has seen, and the best all-round kick that has ever come under my purview. For that reason he deserves a line to himself. He played the game like a sportsman, was a glorious high mark, and could cover a great distance by either drop, punt, or place kick - a remarkable accomplishment. Many players have been notable kicks in two aspects of the game, yet none have equalled Clover in the three branches. His nearest rival as an all-round kick, though not quite as certain in his efforts, was Frank Caine, of Carlton, who, like Clover, also hailed from the country.\" 1933 Coming Football Champion Melbourne, Saturday A special warning was issued to the Victorian Football League delegates last night by Mr. D. H. Crone, a Carlton delegate, not to angle for a certain \"coming\" champion that the Carlton Club had signed up that day. At first delegates were a little puzzled at the statement, but when it was explained that Horrie Clover, former champion half-forward, had that day become the father of of a son they burst into sustained laughter. It was only by persistent ringing of the bell by the chairman that order was restored. (News (Adelaide) May 20 1933 p3) 1933 - The Place Kick A letter to The Argus via the Huon Times about the lack of place kicking expertise in the VFL. The writer mentions that he got Horrie to play football in Maryborough after he saw the then 15 y.o. place kick a ball 63 yards, and later with Carlton, Clover place kicked 8 goals in one match.

Amongst the players recruited from Sydney is a player who kicked the winning goal in a VFL grand final, a Norm Smith medallist, eleven premiership players and a couple of record-holding goal kickers. It is a record of achievement that deserves more kudos.\n\nIn comparison, although one must preface this by stating I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of rugby league recruiting, this figure of 80 players from Sydney to the VFL/AFL would presumably be larger than the combined number of rugby league players recruited from Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin rugby league clubs to the NRL.\n\nDecade by decade- number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL/AFL\n\n1897-1909 \u2013 4 players\n\n1910s \u2013 6 players\n\n1920s \u2013 12 players\n\n1930s \u2013 10 players\n\n1940s \u2013 2 players\n\n1950s \u2013 7 players\n\n1960s \u2013 1 player\n\n1970s \u2013 5 players\n\n1980s \u2013 11 players\n\n1990s \u2013 9 players\n\n2000s \u2013 11 players\n\n2010-11 \u2013 2 players\n\nIn 2012, there are 20 players who have been recruited from Sydney who are on AFL lists. Eight of these twenty have debuted in league football.\n\n1897-1910\n\nSydney\u2019s first player: Bob Kenny\n\nBob Kenny was the first player recruited from a Sydney club to play in the VFL. He debuted in 1899 and played just two games for St Kilda. He was followed soon after by John Stephenson, who was recruited from the Balmain football club and played 10 games for Essendon in 1907. Marshall Herbert, a recruit from Redfern, was the most successful of these early Sydney recruits, as he played 51 games with the Pies from 1908 to 1910. At this stage it should be noted that the only major football code that competed with Australian football in Sydney for players was rugby union, as rugby league was not played in Sydney until 1908.\n\n1910s\n\nThe 1910s was a decade that resulted in the recruitment of two Sydneysiders who had a significant impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYERS: Bob Merrick and Chris Laird. Recruited from East Sydney, Merrick established a goal-kicking record for his adopted Victorian team of Fitzroy in 1919 when he kicked a total of 12 goals in a match. This feat of 12 goals in a match was never bettered by any other Fitzroy player in the history of that club. Bob headed Fitzroy\u2019s goalkicking list each year between 1919-22.\n\nThe other Sydneysider to have an impact in the big league during this decade was Chris Laird. He was recruited from the eastern suburbs club of Paddington and is one of the few players in the history of the game to live the dream of kicking a clutch goal in a grand final with just vital seconds remaining in the match. Laird changed the fortune of the 1918 VFL grand final when he kicked the winning goal for South Melbourne with less than a minute remaining in the match.\n\n1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw a twofold increase over the previous decade in the number of players from Sydney making the transition to the best Australian football competition in the land. Six Sydneysiders played in the VFL in the 1910s and as many as twelve Sydneysiders were recruited in the 1920s.\n\nFred Davies, who was another recruit from Sydney\u2019s Eastern Suburbs, was the pick of the\n\nSydney recruits in this decade. His most notable achievement was being named as the captain of Fitzroy in 1934. Nevertheless, few of the other Sydney players had a large impact during this decade.\n\n1930s\n\nTen players from Sydney made the transition to the VFL in the 1930s. The pick of the players was Newtown\u2019s Reg Garvin.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Reg Garvin\n\nBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,\n\nReg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in\n\n1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club. Reg GarvinBefore he played football for the Sydney club of Newtown,Reg Garvin had played soccer and rugby. Garvin was recruited from Sydney by St Kilda and he was a star player for that club, as he won the Saint\u2019s best and fairest award in1941 & 1944 and also captain-coached the club.\n\n1940s\n\nThe 1940s was a decade in which there was a noticeable drop-off in the numbers of high quality players making their way from Sydney clubs to the VFL, obviously due to WWII. Ron Hall, from St George, was one of only two players recruited from Sydney to the VFL in the 1940s. The other player was Arthur Richardson, who played just five games for the Swans.\n\n1950s\n\nThe 1950s was another decade in which only a small number of Sydney players were recruited to the top league. One of the recruits, however, had a large impact in the VFL.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Roger Duffy \u2013\n\nAnother Newtown player. Duffy played his junior football for the South Sydney Australian football club and then for the nearby rivals Newtown.\n\nHe was an exceptional player in the Sydney league, and was a Newtown premiership player as well as the leading goal kicking for the Sydney football league in 1950 and 1951.\n\nDuffy achieved the premiership and goal-kicking double\u009d by being a premiership player and a goal-kicking leader in two states.\n\nHis premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952).

His premiership wins were with Newtown (NSW)and Footscray (Vic) and he was the leading goal kicker with Newtown (1950-51) and with Footscray (1952). 1960s\n\nThe 1960s was Sydney footballs lowest point in terms of the number of players recruited from Sydney clubs to the VFL. Barry Fitzgerald was the only player recruited directly from a Sydney club to the VFL during this decade. And he played just 35 games for Fitzroy. 1970s\n\nThe 1970s can be viewed as a decade of revival for football recruiting from Sydney. Whilst the 1960s was a low point in terms of player recruitment, the 1970s saw the recruitment of two stars of the game \u2013 Mark Marclure and Michael Byrne. STAR PLAYER:Mark Maclure\n\nMaclure played junior football for East Sydney and also won the Sanders Medal as the best player in Sydney\u2019s reserve grade competition as a 17 year old. From there he tried out with Carlton\u2019s under 19s team and was eventually lured to Carlton by their master recruiter Bert Deacon. Of all the players to have been recruited from Sydney, Mark Maclure is the player who can boast as having the greatest CV. On top of his list of achievements is being a member of three premiership teams (1979, 1981 and 1982). Maclure is the only player recruited from a Sydney football club to have played in as many as three VFL/AFL premiership teams. On top of this, he was the captain of his AFL club (in 1986), won his club\u2019s goal kicking award (1979 and 1985) and played over 200 games for his beloved Blues. STAR PLAYER: Michael Byrne\n\nMichael Byrne is Sydney born and raised, having come through the ranks of local Sydney football on the northern beaches and then playing for the Sydney club of North Shore. Byrne\u2019s induction into football was a tough one, as he played in the ruck for North Shore in the bloodbath Sydney grand final of 1976 at Trumper Park. This match was infamous in Sydney football for being punctuated by rolling brawls involving almost every player on the ground. After he left Sydney, Byrne became a premiership player with Hawthorn in 1983 and he produced on the big day, as he was the 2nd highest goal kicker for Hawthorn in the grand final after the legendary Leigh Matthews. Playing during Hawthorn\u2019s greatest era. Byrne also had the honour of being runner up for the club\u2019s best and fairest in 1984. 1980s\n\nThe 1980s saw the introduction of the Sydney Swans into the VFL competition and it was a decade in which there was a large upswing in the numbers of players recruited from Sydney. Only one player (1960s) and five players (1970s) made the transition to the top league in the two previous decades, but 11 players made the transition in the 1980s. Amongst these players was St George\u2019s Mark Roberts, who was a premiership player with North Melbourne in 1996. 1990s\n\nThe 1990s was a remarkable decade in terms of the contribution of Sydney footballers to the AFL. It was the starting point for the careers of three Sydneysiders who played over 200 games of AFL football. The three players from Sydney who pulled on the guernsey in over 200 games of AFL football were Mark McVeigh [pictured left] (Essendon), Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) and Greg Stafford (Sydney and Richmond). McVeigh and Hayes were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club and Greg Stafford was recruited from Western Suburbs. STAR PLAYER: Lenny Hayes\n\nHayes became the first player from Sydney to win the Norm Smith medal. His last quarter performance in the 2010 grand final for the Saints was one for the record books, as he willed his team back into the contest by obtaining 11 possessions as well as kicking an inspiring goal from 50 metres out.\n\nSTAR PLAYER: Nick Davis\n\nNick Davis, recruited from Ramsgate juniors, didn\u2019t have the longevity of career that Hayes, McVeigh or Stafford had, but he produced one of the defining moments in finals history and arguably the Swan\u2019s greatest moment outside the 2005 grand final when he kicked four goals in the last quarter of the 2005 semi-final against Geelong. That blitz of goal turned the match around and secured the Swans a vital 3-point victory and the passage to a grand final victory. 2000s\n\nTwo exceptional footballers were recruited from the Pennant Hills football club in the 1990s (Lenny Hayes and Mark McVeigh), and the feat was replicated in the noughties, as two further Pennant Hills juniors of exceptional talent, Jarrad McVeigh and Kieran Jack, made their transition to the AFL. STAR PLAYER: Jarrad McVeigh\n\nMcVeigh won the Sydney Swan\u2019s best and fairest award in 2008. This was a noticeable feat as McVeigh became the first player to be recruited from a local Sydney football club to win the award. It took 26 years after the club started in Sydney for a Sydney local to win the award, yet it only took a further two years for the next Sydney local to win the award when Kieran Jack was deemed Sydney\u2019s best and fairest player in 2010. STAR PLAYER: Kieran Jack\n\nJack started his career for the Swans as a dogged tagger in 2007, yet it was only three years later that he won the club best and fairest award. Displaying unbridled determination, Kieran Jack won the award in 2010 largely because he had become a vital attacking option for the Swans. In his best and fairest year of 2010, Jack kicked 21 goals whilst still largely working in the midfield. In 2012, he is in contention for All-Australian selection as he continues to combine attacking flair with an ability to win the contested ball. Many may question if the introduction of the Swans has been a success, yet from a recruiting viewpoint for Sydneysiders it has been. Only one player from Sydney in the 80 years prior to the Swans introduction into the Sydney sporting landscape played over 200 games of top grade football. Since the Swans moved to Sydney there have been three 200 game players from Sydney . The players recruited from Sydney clubs in the years ahead will be following in the footsteps of exceptional footballers such as Roger Duffy, Michael Byrne, Lenny Hayes and the McVeigh brothers amongst others. Over the journey, the record of Sydneysiders at the top level is far better than what many would presume is the case\u201c there have been premiership players, club captains, club coaches, and best and fairest winners. Sydneysiders have achieved at the highest level of the Australian game, but just not with all the fanfare of players from other cities.

He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nInitially a centreman, Deacon began his senior career at Preston in the Victorian Football Association. Carlton signed Deacon in March 1941, one day before his residential address in Preston, which had previously been unallotted, became part of Fitzroy's zone. He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne.\n\nDeacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award.\n\nDeacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash. Deacon was also noted as a very fair player, and one of the few remembered for gentlemanly behaviour in the notoriously violent 1945 VFL Grand Final \u2013 when he helped his 17-year-old opponent Ron Clegg, who had been concussed in a behind-the-play incident, first to face the right direction to take a free kick, then to protect him from joining the outbreaking violence.\n\nDeacon struggled with injuries in his last couple of years with Carlton. He left Carlton after the 1951 season, Deacon returned to Preston as captain-coach. He retired as a player after 1953, and continued as non-playing coach until the end of 1956. He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary.\n\nHe is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century', and was one of the inaugural players elevated to Legend status in the Carlton Football Club Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nOff the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke.\n\nDeacon died of a heart attack at age 51 on 3 January 1974 while on holiday at Balnarring despite the desperate efforts of his Preston team-mate, Pat Foley, to revive him.\n\nReferences\n\nBert Deacon's playing statistics from AFL Tables\n\nBert Deacon at Blueseum\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/712053/moment-24-deacons-brownlow-medal", "page_content": "24. 1947 - Bert Deacon's Brownlow Medal\n\nVIEW THE 25 GREATEST MOMENTS HUB HERE\n\nThe man who would be Carlton\u2019s first Brownlow Medallist deftly adjusted the dial of his trusty bakelite radio. Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}]}
