Dolphins kicker Pete Stoyanovich lines up for a game-winning 41-yard field goal, down 14-13 and just a few seconds on the clock. The Cowboys block the kick. The ball goes spinning into the freshly fallen snow, and a gaggle of players on both teams encircle the pigskin. All the Cowboys need to do is not touch the ball. All the Dolphins need is a miracle.\n\nAs The New York Times aptly wrote: \"This was a crazy, crazy game with a fitting finish.\"\n\nEnter Dallas defensive lineman Leon Lett, who had become infamous 10 months earlier for his goal line fumble in the Super Bowl, thanks mostly to the closing speed of Buffalo's Don Beebe. And now Lett's snowy slide into further infamy had allowed the Dolphins to recover on the 3-yard line and kick a (much easier) 19-yard field goal to win the game.\n\nThe last-second script change changed both team's fortunes that day in ways that no one could predict. It also didn't go down the way anyone really remembers, so let's go back to that historic moment when we all dropped our turkey legs in stunned disbelief.\n\n1. Miami's best player didn't even suit up\n\nDallas was ahead 14-7 at halftime, thanks to two Kevin Williams touchdowns \u2014 one on a 64-yard punt return for a touchdown and another on a 4-yard score from Troy Aikman \u2014 but the Dolphins clawed back throughout the second half. Their defense didn't allow Dallas to score again, and the offense moved the ball just enough for Stoyanovich to chip through three field goals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut it wasn't Dan Marino behind center for Miami. The legendary Dolphins quarterback had torn his Achilles\u2019 the month before \u2014 after starting the year 4-1, throwing eight scores and compiling a 95.9 passer rating \u2014 and would miss the rest of the 1993 season.\n\nThe Dolphins' playcaller that fateful day? Steve DeBerg, who was playing for his sixth career team and about to turn 40. DeBerg did pass for 284 yards, but he threw two picks and no touchdowns, so while you can say he technically won the game for Miami, it was more a case where he did just enough to not lose.\n\n2. That was the last game Miami won that season\n\n\"This is as big as any win I've ever played in, and it looks like the games are going to get bigger and bigger,\" DeBerg said after the game. \"This really became a man's game, a big man's game because all we could do was go straight ahead.\"\n\nAlas, the Dolphins' season took a desultory turn after Stoyanovich's game-winning chip shot. Incredibly, 9-2 Miami had its next three games at home \u2014 New York Giants, Pittsburgh and Buffalo \u2014 and lost all of them. A Week 16 drubbing at San Diego dropped the Fins to 9-6, but a final-week win against the pitiful 4-11 New England Patriots would've sealed a wild-card playoff berth.\n\nIt was not to be. A 36-yard TD pass in overtime from Drew Bledsoe to Michael Timpson nailed down a 33-27 win for New England and the Dolphins were left playing golf in January and wondering just what the heck had happened after that win in Dallas.\n\n3. There was no instant replay back then\n\nOne of the weirder subplots of the NFL in the 1990s is how the game's owners summarily voted to remove instant replay for a period of seven seasons. After a March 1992 vote stripped replay review from on-field officials, the technology didn't return until 1999. In the interim, there were plays like the end of this 1993 game in Dallas, which the refs had to get right using nothing but the always-appreciated human element.\n\nReferee Ed Hochuli, in only his fourth season as a working NFL official, was the one who delivered the decision in one of his now-trademark, long-winded explanations. Back then, he didn't have the benefit of replay review, but he and his crew still nailed the intricacies of what went down on that play.\n\n\"I didn't see anything after the block,\" Hochuli told the Cowboys' official team magazine last year. \"That's common in terms of what our specific areas of responsibility are. My eyes are trained to be on the kicker, the holder, the snap, not where the ball landed downfield. So the crew came together, and there was a little input from everyone, and we put the pieces together. I have so much confidence in my crew. We have complete trust and confidence in each other. And we got the call right.\"\n\n4. Leon Lett has rebounded nicely from his infamous past\n\n\"I knew the rule,\" Lett recalled last year. \"I had blocked field goals in the past. It's not like it was my first time on the field goal block team. Maybe it was that season, but not in my career. I have been trying to think back for, what, 20 years now, and I don't know what happened. It was a brain freeze.\"\n\nBut to his enduring credit, Lett never let his two high-profile oopsies on two of the game's biggest stages \u2014 the Super Bowl fumble and the Thanksgiving snow slide \u2014 define him or his career.\n\nAfter that 1993 season, Lett played in 89 more games for the Cowboys through the 2001 season. He made two Pro Bowls and recorded 19 sacks, and Lett is now in his third season under head coach Jason Garrett as the team's assistant defensive line coach.\n\n5. That was the last game Dallas lost that season\n\nWhat, you thought this game only altered one team's campaign? In the same way you'd be shocked that first-place Miami never won again the rest of the year, this devastating loss for the Cowboys proved to be, well, not at all devastating!\n\n\"We've lost two in a row to start the season, and we've lost two in a row now,\" Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson said after the game. \"There is no reason we can't put another streak together. This was a very disappointing loss. In fact, I don't know whether I've ever had a loss that hurts like this one right now.\"\n\nIn fact, the Cowboys did put together another streak \u2014 one made entirely of wins. They won their next eight straight games to not only finish the season at 12-4 but win their second-straight Super Bowl \u2014 and are still the last team to have done so.\n\nYou can follow Erik Malinowski, who has never had a field goal blocked, on Twitter at @erikmal and email him at erik.malinowski@fox.com.\n\nshare"}, {"url": "https://www.football365.com/news/premier-league-xis-the-1993-94-headliners", "page_content": "We\u2019ve re-lived the 1992/93 season, now read all about the stories of 1993/94\u2026\n\nGoalkeeper: Tim Flowers\n\nAfter spending big on Alan Shearer in the inaugural Premier League season, Blackburn Rovers broke another transfer record the following year by signing Tim Flowers from Southampton for \u00a32.4m, an English record for a goalkeeper. Shearer had proved to be a fantastic buy as he helped Rovers to a fourth-place finish in 1993 and Flowers became another inspired purchase with Rovers finishing as runners-up and conceding fewer goals than champions Manchester United.

They went into a Monday night game against the infuriatingly inconsistent Coventry City needing a good result to keep their title dreams alive. Greater Manchester-born Julian Darby proved to be a Manchester United hero that day, scoring both goals for Coventry in a 2-1. Darby\u2019s title-clinching second goal meant it was the second successive year that United won the league on a day they didn\u2019t actually play.\n\nCentre-half: Steve Bruce\n\nBruce jointly lifted the Premier League title in May 1994 with departing club legend Bryan Robson after another fine season at the heart of Manchester United\u2019s defence. The uncapped Bruce went on to captain Manchester United in the FA Cup final, with his side winning 4-0 to complete a historic league and cup double. He almost led them to a then unprecedented domestic treble, with the team losing out to Aston Villa in the 1994 League Cup final.\n\nMeanwhile, the England national team were in disarray after missing out on qualification for the World Cup; Graham Taylor was sacked and Terry Venables came in. The new boss called up Arsenal defender Steve Bould \u2013 making him one of England\u2019s oldest debutants \u2013 but Bruce still couldn\u2019t get a game.\n\nCentre-half: Ken Monkou\n\nDutch defender Monkou scored a dramatic 90th-minute winner as Southampton beat Norwich 5-4 in the highest-scoring game of the season, with the three points proving precious for a club battling relegation. Monkou almost went from hero to zero on the last day of the campaign, this time scoring an own goal in the final minute of a game against West Ham with the Saints needing a positive result to stay in the division.\n\nNorwich 4 Southampton 5 .. we were down that season bottom at Easter if I remember correctly \u2026 I loved Ken Monkou forever \u2014 taxiguru (@taxiguru2010) February 11, 2019\n\nLeft-back: Paul Bodin\n\nWelsh defender Paul Bodin provided Swindon Town with some rare moments of cheer in the 1993/94 season. He was part of a side that conceded 100 goals in their first ever top-flight season, finishing bottom and recording just five wins all season. Bodin scored an impressive seven times in the season, including an equaliser at Highbury in a 1-1 draw with Arsenal, a result that all but ended the Gunners\u2019 slim title hopes. Swindon had gained promotion from the play-offs the previous season, but lost manager Glenn Hoddle to Chelsea before they\u2019d kicked a ball in the Premier League. Hoddle\u2019s assistant John Gorman took over, but the side didn\u2019t win a game until November and suffered some heavy defeats on the way.\n\nRight midfield: Graham Stuart\n\nTwo-time First Division champions in the eighties, the nineties hadn\u2019t started well for Everton. Still in relegation trouble on the last day of the 1993/94 season, they needed a win against Wimbledon to secure survival. The Dons had enjoyed a fantastic season, competing in the top half of the table, and took a 2-0 lead against the Toffees. Graham Stuart\u2019s Everton career had just begun after signing from Chelsea and he became an instant hero at Goodison Park as he pulled one back with a penalty in the first half and went to score an 81st-minute winner to extend Everton\u2019s 40-year spell in the top flight.\n\nOn this day in 1994 Everton complete a last day survival mission thanks to this famous Graeme Stuart winner against Wimbledon #Keepit90s pic.twitter.com/96ePbDR9Cg \u2014 The 90s Football Podcast (@AK90s) May 7, 2019\n\nCentral midfield: Roy Keane\n\nManchester United broke the English transfer record (not for the last time) to sign young midfielder Roy Keane from Nottingham Forest. The \u00a33.75m fee seemed a lot at the time but the future Irish legend immediately justified his fee by scoring twice on his home debut against Sheffield United. Keane formed a formidable midfield partnership with London-born Paul Ince and won a Premier League title in his first season at the club, just a year after he suffered relegation with Forest. Keane had been close to signing for big-spending Blackburn Rovers, where he would have lined-up alongside best pal Alan Shearer, who continued his impressive form by scoring 31 goals in the 1993/94 season.\n\nLeft midfield: Steve McManaman\n\nLiverpool\u2019s poor season in 1993/94 was summed up by local lad Steve McManaman and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar coming to blows after the side conceded a goal against Merseyside rivals Everton. Liverpool legend Graeme Souness left his position as club manager mid-season (hopefully a ten-month-old Paul Pogba was taking note) after a difficult three-year stint in charge. Long-standing coach and former player Roy Evans took over, with the fans hoping he could mount a title challenge the following season. Grobbelaar would leave for Southampton at the end of the campaign, whilst McManaman and emerging teenage talent Robbie Fowler would become the key players in a new era at Anfield.\n\nIt\u2019s Steve McManaman\u2019s birthday today. You remember him. Bruce Grobbelaar wasn\u2019t a fan of his defending from corners.pic.twitter.com/HK0zCus9v8 \u2014 Proper Football (@sid_lambert) February 11, 2020\n\nAttacking midfield: Matt Le Tissier\n\nAfter being linked with a move away from Southampton, Matt Le Tissier\u2019s two-goal heroics in a 3-3 draw with West Ham in the side\u2019s final game of the 1993/94 season helped the Saints stay up by one point as Sheffield United\u2019s four-year spell in the top flight came to an end instead. The woefully undercapped Le Tissier ended the season with a career-best 25 goals and credited his good form to England\u2019s World Cup winning hero Alan Ball, who took the manager\u2019s job at The Dell in early \u201994.\n\nStriker: Eric Cantona\n\nAfter becoming the first Frenchman to win the Premier League the season before, Eric Cantona continued his good form and won the PFA Player of the Year award in 1994. His 18 league goals and 12 assists helped Manchester United to the title and he went on to score two goals in the FA Cup final as the club won its first ever double. But Cantona\u2019s 80th-minute equaliser in the second round of the Champions League wasn\u2019t enough for the Premier League champions to progress as they lost out to Galatasaray on away goals.\n\nStriker: Andy Cole\n\nOn their return to the top flight in the 1993/94 season Newcastle scored an incredible 82 goals, the highest total in the division. Kevin Keegan\u2019s side developed a reputation as an exciting attacking outfit and with several high-scoring wins the Premier League was introduced to one of its most entertaining teams of all time. C-Team striker Andy Cole topped the scoring charts with 34 goals and secured the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Cole was Arsenal\u2019s one who got away and he showed the Gunners what they were missing, scoring in a 2-0 win against them on the final weekend of the season to ensure Newcastle finished in third, one place above his former side. His partnership with returning club legend Peter Beardsley also grabbed the headlines, with the Geordie hero scoring 21 times himself.\n\nFive players in Premier League history would have won a Golden Boot and Playermaker Award in their career: Andy Cole\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\n\nThierry Henry\n\nDidier Drogba\n\nRobin Van Persie Andy Cole is the only player who would have won both in the same season (1993/1994). \ud83c\udf1f pic.twitter.com/wqZZkc1V8G \u2014 Squawka Football (@Squawka) April 18, 2018\n\nJames Wiles \u2013 whose Instagram has a whole load more XIs"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/blog/colleges/nebraska/post/_/id/1264/20-years-later-a-november-to-remember", "page_content": "Twenty years ago, we had one of the wildest months in college football history. Over the span of four weeks, seven top-10 teams lost, including the No. 1 team twice. Florida State entered the month as No. 1, fell out of that spot and still ended the month atop the polls.\n\nBy the end of November, three teams would finish the regular season unbeaten (Nebraska, West Virginia and Auburn), but only two were eligible to play for the national title, and only one would wind up playing for it. The debate simmered for years.\n\nNotre Dame fans were upset that Florida State was playing for the national title with one loss, since that one loss came against the Fighting Irish. West Virginia fans were also upset that FSU was playing for the national title with one loss, with the Mountaineers finishing the season undefeated.\n\nTom Osborne was denied his first national title when the Cornhuskers lost to the Seminoles in the Orange Bowl. Ronald C. Modra/Sports Imagery/Getty Images\n\nIn addition, WVU argued that it should be included in the national title game since it had a higher ranking in the coaches poll (No. 2) than Nebraska (No. 3). In the AP poll, Nebraska finished the regular season No. 2 and WVU No. 3. Meanwhile, Auburn fans claimed the Tigers were actually the best team in college football, finishing the season 11-0 and with a win over the eventual SEC champion Florida Gators. The Tigers, however, were on NCAA probation and ineligible for postseason play.\n\nAs we begin another month of potential unbeaten controversy in college football, here's a look at 20 things to remember from November 1993.\n\n1. Florida State was the No. 1 team in the AP poll every week of the season prior to November. Entering the month, the Seminoles were 8-0 and had outscored their opponents by a combined total of 350-38.\n\n2. Three of the teams that garnered a lot of attention in November were still not even ranked in the top 5 by the beginning of the month. Nebraska (8-0) was No. 6, Auburn (8-0) was No. 8 and West Virginia (7-0) was No. 11.\n\n3. Ohio State also entered November 8-0, its best start since 1979. Two decades later, the Buckeyes enter November again undefeated.\n\n4. The Miami-WVU game on Nov. 20, 1993, drew a crowd of 70,222 at Mountaineer Field (now called Milan Puskar Stadium). It\u2019s still the largest home crowd in the history of the stadium, which opened in 1980. Capacity for that stadium at that time was 63,000, meaning it was 7,000 over capacity for that game.\n\n5. Notre Dame was ranked No. 7 in the preseason AP poll, the lowest preseason rank for the Irish since 1988, when they were ranked 13th and went on to win the national title.\n\n6. No. 1 Florida State was a 6 1/2-point favorite for its Nov. 13 matchup at No. 2 Notre Dame on Nov. 13, 1993.\n\n7. ESPN's College GameDay staged its first live remote show at the FSU-ND showdown in South Bend.\n\n8. The \u201cGame of the Century\u201d matchup with Florida State was the ninth 1 versus 2 game in Notre Dame history, and the second for FSU. Overall, it was the 14th regular-season 1 versus 2 matchup in AP poll history.\n\n9. The Irish beat the favored Seminoles 31-24 to improve to 10-0, the third time in the previous six seasons the Fighting Irish started a season 10-0 or better (1988, 1989).\n\n10. In a wild month, the following Saturday (Nov. 20) was easily the biggest day. Consider what occurred:\n\nNo. 1 Notre Dame was upset at home by No. 17 Boston College, 41-39, on a last-second 41-yard field goal by David Gordon.\n\nNo. 9 West Virginia upset No. 4 Miami, 17-14, keeping WVU's undefeated season alive.\n\nNo. 5 Ohio State suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of its rival, Michigan, losing 28-0.\n\nNo. 6 Auburn won the Iron Bowl, beating No. 11 Alabama 22-14 and completing a perfect regular season.\n\n11. That Boston College could come in and beat a No. 1 Notre Dame team was surprising enough -- especially considering the Irish had won that matchup by 47 the year before. But it was more of a shocker when you consider the Eagles started the 1993 season 0-2, including a loss at Northwestern, a team that finished just 2-9.\n\n12. A lot was made about how West Virginia did not deserve to play for the national championship over Florida State or Nebraska, because the Mountaineers played a weaker schedule. Mountaineer fans did not want to hear it, but the numbers appear to back up that argument. FSU\u2019s opponents finished 81-61 (.570), Nebraska\u2019s 59-54-1 (.522) and WVU\u2019s 59-64-2 (.480).\n\n13. West Virginia's argument about deserving a shot at the national championship was always the following: WVU beat the team (Boston College, in the regular-season finale) that beat the team (Notre Dame) that beat the team (Florida State).\n\n14. To understand how wacky the month of November was, look at how the AP poll played out since the middle of October:\n\nOct. 18 poll: FSU received all 62 first-place votes\n\nOct. 25: FSU received all 62 first-place votes\n\nNov. 1: FSU received all 62 first-place votes\n\nNov. 8: FSU received all 62 first-place votes\n\nNov. 15: Notre Dame received all 62 first-place votes\n\nNov. 22: Five different teams received at least one first-place vote\n\nNov. 29: Three different teams received at least one first-place vote\n\nDec. 6: Five different teams received at least one first-place vote.\n\nNotre Dame fans are probably still upset about being kept out of the 1993 national championship game despite having beaten FSU. Cal Sport Media/AP Images\n\n15. Prior to the Bowl Championship Series, college football's championship game matchups were determined by an organization called the Bowl Coalition. It was made up of five conferences: Big East, ACC, SEC, Big 8 and Southwest -- and Notre Dame. The group had six bowl tie-ins: Orange, Fiesta, Cotton, Sugar, Gator and John Hancock (now Sun Bowl). But it did not include the Pac-10 and Big Ten, because those teams had the tie-in to the Rose Bowl. After the wackiness of November, the top five heading the bowls was:\n\n1. Florida State\n\n2. Nebraska\n\n3. West Virginia\n\n4. Auburn\n\n5. Notre Dame\n\n16. West Virginia was actually invited to play No. 7 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl, but instead decided to play in the more lucrative Sugar Bowl against No. 8 Florida. The Sugar Bowl was worth approximately $1.1 million more than the Cotton, which elected to invite Notre Dame instead (which beat the Aggies 24-21). The move obviously backfired on the Mountaineers, as they were soundly beaten by the Gators in the Sugar Bowl, 41-7.\n\n17. After losing to Miami on missed field goals in the final seconds in 1991 and 1992, Florida State recruited the top high school kicking prospect, Scott Bentley. Bentley struggled early in his FSU career (seven missed extra-point attempts in the first five games), but eventually was a difference-maker in the Seminoles' run to the national title, kicking the game-winning field goal in a 18-16 Orange Bowl victory against No. 2 Nebraska and giving Bobby Bowden his first national title (and denying Tom Osborne his).\n\n18. Florida State became the first preseason AP No. 1 team to go on to win the national title since Oklahoma in 1985.\n\n19. Auburn's win streak, which began in 1993 as the lone unbeaten, would eventually reach 20 straight before a tie against Georgia on the next-to-last game of the 1994 season. The Tigers lost the following game to Alabama in the Iron Bowl.\n\n20. The matchup that many Mountaineers fans wanted (WVU versus Nebraska) eventually took place \u2026 in 1994. The Cornhuskers slammed the Mountaineers in the 1994 Kickoff Classic in the Meadowlands, 31-0."}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/292039.html", "page_content": "Obituary, 2007\n\nGeoff Griffin\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Griffin: \"he threw virtually every ball\". \u00a9 The Cricketer International\n\nEnlarge\n\nGRIFFIN, GEOFFREY MERTON, collapsed and died while speaking at a dinner at his old school, Durban High, on November 16, 2006, aged 67. A central character in the \"chucking\" controversy that gripped cricket nearly half a century ago, Geoff Griffin made two indelible marks on Test history. During the Second Test of the 1960 tour of England, he took the first (and so far only) Test hat-trick at Lord's, and for South Africa anywhere. Far less happily, he also became the first bowler to be no-balled for throwing in a Test there. >\n\nGriffin's problems stemmed from an accident at school - where he had been an outstanding all-round athlete, holding Natal titles in all four jumping events - which had left him unable to straighten his right arm fully. This, allied to an open-chested action, with front foot splayed towards gully, made him look more like a baseball pitcher than a conventional bowler. His methods were ungainly but effective: he booked his tour place by topping the South African averages in 1959-60, with 35 wickets at 12.22, including a career-best seven for 11 in the second innings of the freak match when Natal bowled out Border for 16 and 18. Griffin, only 20 when the tour started, was unfortunate in the sense that his arrival coincided with one of cricket's periodic frenzies about suspect actions, sparked off by the 1958-59 Ashes. Some in South Africa claimed he had been singled out in an attempt to clean up the game before Australia came to England in 1961. (If so, it worked: none of Australia's alleged chuckers was picked.) But Griffin's action was considered suspect even at school, and he was called in two domestic matches in 1958-59. The South African commentator Charles Fortune had no doubt that his bowling was illegal: \"The South African authorities who sent Griffin to England chanced their arm,\" he wrote. John Waite, the wicketkeeper throughout the drama, felt the same: \"Before that tour I'd played for Transvaal against Natal, and because I got cramp I had a runner. So I was standing at square leg when Griffin bowled. I said to the umpire, 'This chap is throwing,' and he said: 'You concentrate on batting, and leave the umpiring to me.' \" Waite also recalled Ted Dexter's anger when he was bowled by Griffin in the MCC match at Lord's early in the 1960 tour: \"He threw his bat down and grumbled that he'd been thrown out.\" Both umpires, Frank Lee and John Langridge, called him that day, and there were further incidents against Nottinghamshire, after which Griffin was sent to Alf Gover's indoor school for remedial treatment. When he returned, some thought his arm was a little straighter - but his direction certainly was not, and he had a notably wild spell during the Edgbaston Test, which he got through without problems from the umpires. In the lead-up to Lord's, he apparently reverted to his old style in a bid to regain his rhythm: he was called again at Southampton, yet was named in the Test team. At Lord's, Peter Walker, who put on 120 with Mike Smith, was unequivocal: \"There was absolutely no doubt in either Mike's or my mind that he threw virtually every ball.\"\n\nFrank Lee seemed in little doubt either. He no-balled Griffin 11 times but let go the deliveries that dismissed Smith for 99, and then Walker and Fred Trueman to the first two balls of his next over. Griffin's trauma was not over, though. England won the Test by an innings early on the fourth day and, with the Queen due to visit later on, the South Africans were persuaded to play an exhibition game to entertain the crowd. The \"entertainment\" that ensued was grim stuff: Griffin came on to bowl, this time with the fearless Syd Buller at square leg. Buller no-balled four of Griffin's first six deliveries, whereupon, in desperation, he tried bowling underarm, only to be called again by Lee, at the bowler's end, for failing to inform the batsman of the change of delivery mode - a heavyhanded act in a match of no consequence.\n\nGriffin's international career was over: he did not bowl again on the tour, playing against the counties as a specialist No. 8 or 9 batsman. He attempted a comeback for Rhodesia, but another bout of no-balling finished his career for good. In retirement he did some coaching, and ran a couple of hotels. Still that right elbow troubled him: he once challenged some of his hotel guests to arm-wrestle, only for his first opponent to break his arm. South Africans talk, without exception, about his cheerful disposition and kindness. \"He had no malice at all,\" said a Durban High School contemporary, Esmond Caro. \"He accepted his no-balling and bore no resentment.

Webber helped the Warriors to a 50-win season \u2014 a 16 win increase \u2014 and a playoff berth in his first year with the club.\n\nThe Bulls, who at the time didn't know Jordan would be retiring, drafted Corie Blount in the first round and Anthony Reed in the second round. Reed never played in an NBA game.\n\nOther notable picks from the '93 NBA Draft included Nick Van Exel, Sam Cassell, Allan Houston, Jamal Mashburn and Vin Baker. Spurs legend Bruce Bowen went undrafted and would start his pro career in France before eventually finding his way to the NBA.\n\nPreseason title Odds\n\nWith Jordan out of the picture, the path to an NBA title looked all-clear for Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks. The Knicks had been eliminated by Jordan and the Bulls each of the three prior seasons but held the best odds at +200 to win the 1993-94 title.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns, who just came off the heartbreaking defeat to Chicago in the Finals, had the second-best odds at +300.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers, who also suffered at the hands of Michael Jordan, thought their time had come in 1993-94 and Vegas agreed by giving them the third-best odds at +500.\n\nThe Houston Rockets \u2014 the team that eventually won the NBA title \u2014 came into the season tied for the fifth-best odds with the Charlotte Hornets, San Antonio Spurs and Portland Trail Blazers at +1200.\n\nGoing for the four-peat, the Jordan-less Bulls were given the seventh-best odds at +1500.\n\nStandings/Playoffs\n\nThe loaded Seattle SuperSonics would win a franchise-record 63 games and claim home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. They would eventually eclipse that win total by one game in 1995-96. Six SuperSonics averaged double-digits in scoring that season, led by Shawn Kemp at 18.1 points per game.\n\nWith a league-best 37-4 record at the Seattle Center Coliseum, the Sonics looked poised for a deep playoff run, but Dikembe Mutombo and the Denver Nuggets had other plans. The Nuggets would upset the Sonics, winning the fifth and deciding game in Seattle to become the first eighth seed in NBA history to eliminate a one seed.\n\nMutombo and the Nuggets would come back from down 3-0 to force a game seven in the following round before losing to Karl Malone, John Stockton and the Utah Jazz in the seventh game. The Nuggets '94 playoff run is still one of the most improbable in NBA history.\n\nOver in the East, the New York Knicks \u2014 who finished tied with Atlanta for the best record in the conference \u2014 would play 18 of a possible 19 playoff games before punching their ticket to the NBA Finals for the first time since their 1973 championship.\n\nWaiting for them was the reigning league MVP, Hakeem Olajuwon, and a Houston Rockets team who disposed of the Jazz in just five games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe Knicks, who couldn't get over the hump with Jordan in the league, came one win away from winning their franchise's third title. After taking a 3-2 series lead, New York lost back-to-back games in Houston to give the Rockets their first NBA championship.\n\nOlajuwon averaged 26.9 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.9 blocks while shooting 50 percent from the field in the Finals. He joined Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan as the only players to win both league and Finals MVP in the same season.\n\nShaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan and LeBron James would later join that list.\n\nSeason Notes\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks shocked the NBA world when they traded Dominque Wilkins mid-season to the L.A. Clippers for Danny Manning. Wilkins played 49 games with the Hawks that year, leading the team in scoring while averaging 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds. Atlanta sat in first place in the Eastern Conference with a 36-16 record at the time of the trade. It's still the only time in league history that a team has traded its leading scorer while sitting at first place in their conference prior to the All-Star break.\n\nWilkins was in a contract year, and many believed Atlanta did not want to commit long term money to him. Wilkins was in his 12th season at age 34.\n\nDavid Robinson would record the league's fourth quadruple-double, going for 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 blocks in a game against the Pistons. No one has had a quadruple-double since. Robinson would later score 71 points on the final day of the regular season to secure the league's scoring title. He finished the year averaging 29.8 points per game, edging out Shaquille O'Neal who averaged 29.3. It was the first time since Dominique Wilkins led the league in 1985-86 that someone other than Michael Jordan won the scoring title. Jordan famously broke his foot and only played in 18 games that season.\n\nWith the Lakers struggling at 28-38, Magic Johnson agreed to take over as head coach of the team. He got Los Angeles off to a good start, winning five of his first six games, but the hype faded and the team finished on a 10-game losing streak. Johnson resigned after the season with a 5-11 coaching record.\n\nHall of Famer Isiah Thomas would suffer a torn Achilles tendon in April of '94 which led to his retirement. His Bad Boys teammate Bill Laimbeer would also announce his retirement at the end of the '94 season.\n\nDenver's Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf finished the season shooting 95.6 percent from the foul line. He was 0.2 percent away from breaking Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy's record (95.8%) set back in the 1980-81 season. Toronto Raptors' standout Jose Calderon would later break the record in 2008-09, shooting 98.1 percent from the line.\n\nThe Bulls played their final season at Chicago Stadium which had been open since 1929. They would play at the United Center to start the 1994-95 season.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs played their first season at the Alamodome, a place they would call home for nine seasons.\n\nThe views expressed here do not reflect those of the NBA or its clubs."}, {"url": "https://www.cricketweb.net/geoff-griffin-guilty-or-not-guilty/", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin \u2013 Guilty or Not Guilty?\n\nMartin Chandler | 8:07pm BST 09 April 2015\n\nA decade after Cuan McCarthy another ill-starred blond Natalian fast bowler was born. Geoff Griffin maintained to the end of his days that he was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful chucking conspiracy. Like that of McCarthy Griffin\u2019s cricket career did not last very long, and again in common with his predecessor he was undoubtedly treated badly. There was however one big difference between the two, in that unlike McCarthy Griffin almost certainly did throw.\n\nWhy should there have been a conspiracy is the first question that needs to be looked at. The flippant response to that is to point to conspiracy theories emerging in most situations of great controversy, but to be fair to Griffin when the ground opened up before him the game, in England at least, needed a scapegoat.\n\nA 19 year old Griffin had made his First Class debut in the 1957/58 season without tearing up any trees. His second campaign was much better and, at the same time, Peter May\u2019s England were touring Australia. Having started the season as favourites to retain The Ashes England had been soundly beaten, and blamed the defeat on the quartet who inspired Jack Fingleton to title his book on the series Four Chukkas to Australia. The alleged offenders were Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke.\n\nThe next Ashes series was due to be played in England in 1961, and the authorities did not want Australia bringing with them a group of illegal bowlers thus, so Griffin\u2019s argument would go, they resolved to adopt a zero tolerance attitude against South Africa in 1960. The reasoning was that by making it clear to Australia that, unlike on their own soil, offenders would be ruthlessly exposed, the selectors would be dissuaded from picking those with suspect actions. At this time the four mentioned in the preceding paragraph were by no means the only offenders in the Australian game.\n\nReturning to the 1958/59 South African domestic season it should not be forgotten that during that season Griffin was called for throwing twice by his own umpires. Des Fell called him in the match between Natal and Transvaal, and a couple of weeks later in an end of season trial Arthur Kidson called him as well.\n\nAnother Kidson, Hayward, as far as I can see unrelated to Arthur, was a South African umpire who went on to be one of that nation\u2019s very best and who later wrote an autobiography. Prior to the selection of the 1960 touring party Hayward Kidson had never stood in a game in which Griffin played. But in making that point he did add a telling observation; Bearing in mind the lack of a suitable definition, I would most likely have gone along with the majority of umpires in this country and done nothing anyway. Men more senior than I had passed him, but there were warnings which the South African Board should perhaps not have ignored.\n\nThe side to tour England was to be selected at the end of the 1959/60 domestic season and if the Board were in any way reluctant to select him Griffin spent the summer piling on the pressure. He ended the campaign with the remarkable tally of 35 wickets at 12.22, including 7-11 in the second innings of a bizarre match in which Border were dismissed for 16 and 18. The Board could not ignore form like that, so Griffin was picked. It should also be borne in mind that throughout that momentous season no umpire called him. He didn\u2019t encounter Arthur Kidson, but Fell was not troubled by Griffin\u2019s action in the 41 overs he bowled in a match against Rhodesia.\n\nLike a number of bowlers, Muttiah Muralitharan the foremost of them, Griffin did start out with a \u201cproblem\u201d, in that as a result of a bad break to his right arm in a childhood accident he could not straighten his elbow fully. Thus any square leg umpire would see a bent arm throughout his delivery. There was another factor with Griffin that exacerbated his difficulties. He had the classic open chested action of the thrower, with a front foot splayed outwards at the point of delivery.\n\nGriffin was left out of the side for the tour\u2019s opening First Class fixture against Worcestershire. There was some speculation that the identity of the umpires dictated that decision. One was a known hardliner, Syd Buller, and the other, Jack Crapp, had recently called Worcestershire\u2019s John Aldridge. To add fuel to that particular theory Aldridge was rested by the home side.\n\nThe South Africans next outing was against Derbyshire. Paul Gibb was not afraid to call a throw a throw but Griffin couldn\u2019t be hidden forever so he played. There were six calls from Gibb at square leg, but none of them directed at Griffin who seemed to satisfy most of the travelling press pack that his action was fair. The man called on this occasion, wholly unjustly in this writer\u2019s opinion, was Derbyshire\u2019s Harold Rhodes.\n\nThe next appearance against a county for Griffin was the game against Essex. This time the press did get on his case although the umpires did not. One newspaper, The People, was particularly trenchant in its criticism of Griffin\u2019s \u201cjerk\u201d. The only problem with that argument however was that on an experimental basis the word jerk had been removed from what was then Law 26 for the 1960 season.\n\nNearly all cricketers reminisce fondly about their first appearance at Lord\u2019s, although it was not to prove a happy hunting ground for Geoff Griffin after he was selected to play against the MCC in late May. The day was cold and damp and the start of play, before a disappointing crowd, was considerably delayed. Skipper Jackie McGlew won the toss and invited the home side to bat. There were four uneventful overs from Griffin. His fifth began with a call from John Langridge for dragging, and then half way through the over Frank Lee crossed to point. He immediately called Griffin. It was the first time a visiting cricketer had ever been called for throwing in England. McGlew immediately took his man out of the attack.\n\nShortly before tea Griffin was reintroduced to the attack from the other end. He then guaranteed his place at the forefront of the next day\u2019s Sunday Newspapers by being called by both umpires for the same delivery, by Lee for dragging and John Langridge for throwing. Langridge must have seen something different, because he had allowed Griffin to bowl unhindered in the game against Essex. Langridge called him again later in the game. One of the complaints that Griffin had, supported by many irrespective of their views on his basic action, was that all his deliveries were identical. Thus it should have been a case of all or nothing. Either everything he bowled was a no ball, or all were legal deliveries.\n\nThere was a meeting after the MCC match attended by South African manager Dudley Nourse, the umpires and MCC representatives. Nourse made a statement afterwards to the effect that he was entirely happy with the outcome of the meeting and that he believed that from then on English umpires would not have any further difficulty with Griffin. The press were critical and accused the MCC of condoning throwing. It may be that adverse reaction influenced what happened next, but Nourse\u2019s view proved to be well wide of the mark. Griffin was left out of the next game at Northampton, but was selected to play against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. He was called five times for throwing in the first innings, and three times in the second innings.\n\nIt was clear that by the end of the game Griffin, still not yet 21 and the baby of the South African team had, unsurprisingly, lost his direction and much of his pace. One thing he had however done, on McGlew\u2019s instructions, was bowled his fastest delivery immediately after being called. For many with dubious actions it is their quicker ball that offends. As all of Griffin\u2019s fastest got past the umpires that is something else that distinguishes his case from those of others who, at first glance, might appear similar.\n\nVery sensibly in the circumstances Griffin was packed off to Alf Gover\u2019s indoor school for help in sorting out his action. Gover thought the basic action was fine, and sought to modify it in such a way that at the point of delivery Griffin was in a position where he couldn\u2019t throw. He was back to join his teammates for the game against Glamorgan in which he bowled 18 overs without falling foul of the umpires. South African journalist Charles Fortune described his action as distinctly smoother.\n\nThe first Test followed the Glamorgan encounter and, in a 100 run defeat, Griffin took four wickets altogether and once more avoided censure. Langridge was one of the umpires on duty so, presumably, he too saw a difference. The second Test was, as usual, to be played at Lord\u2019s. In the meantime there were two more county games, against Somerset at Taunton and Hampshire at Southampton.\n\nThere was no Griffin at Taunton, but he did play at Southampton and, if he thought his troubles were over he was to be sorely disappointed. He was called once each by Jim Parks Snr and Harry Elliott in the first innings, and three times by Parks in the second innings as well as once more by Elliott. He had now been called by six different umpires and the South Africans had a difficult decision to make about whether he should be selected for the Lord\u2019s Test. The battle of wills was primarily between Nourse and Gubby Allen, the man who wanted to use Griffin as a stick with which to beat the Australian selectors.\n\nThe simple truth was that without Griffin there was no adequate foil for the South African spearhead Neil Adcock. So Griffin played at Lord\u2019s and South Africa bowled first. Griffin\u2019s first over was uneventful, and in the second he claimed the prized scalp of Colin Cowdrey. Just as he must have started to feel better about himself he then heard Lee call him twice from square leg in his third over. Never before had a bowler been called for throwing in a Test in England. At the close of a truncated day\u2019s play England were 114-2, and Griffin had been called five times altogether.\n\nPlay began on time next morning and England moved serenely on to 210-3 by lunch, losing only Kenny Barrington to Trevor Goddard\u2019s miserly left arm medium pace. Griffin did his share of bowling, and was not called at all, umpire Lee seeming to take less and less interest in him as the session wore on. His interest did however rise considerably after lunch when the new ball was taken and there were two more calls in Griffin\u2019s very first over with it.\n\nThis is another basis for the conspiracy theory. As ever there was nothing different about the way that Griffin bowled after lunch, other than having a new cherry in his hand, but there was a very substantial change in the way that Lee went about his duties. It is difficult to dismiss the idea that Allen had had words with him during the interval. There was a rain break during the afternoon session, and after it Lee called Griffin twice more. By 6.15 pm in the final session Griffin had been called six times in all by Lee for throwing and once by Buller for dragging. He had not taken a wicket all day and when, with England cruising as 347-5, Mike Smith on 99 edged the last ball of an over into the gloves of \u2018keeper John Waite most of the crowd did not know whether to feel sympathy for Smith or delight that the young bowler had finally got something to take from the game.\n\nThere was however much more for Griffin. With the first delivery of his next over he got through Peter Walker\u2019s defences and just clipped the bails. The new batsman was Fred Trueman and his reaction to the hat trick delivery was to take a mighty swing at it and lose his leg stump. It was the first ever Test hat trick at Lord\u2019s and the first by a South African anywhere. The crowd rose to applaud a young man they were growing to like. England reached the close at 362-8 and at that point Cowdrey declared. There was little play on the Saturday, which saw South Africa move to 34-1 in reply, but they then collapsed twice on the fourth day to lose by an innings before mid-afternoon. This committed the two sides to playing an exhibition match as a royal visit was due later so there had to be some cricket in play. The game involved no more than 20 overs per side and two overs per bowler, so it was a game that\u2019s only purpose was to entertain the crowd.\n\nEngland batted first and Griffin took the second over. For the first time on the tour Buller was at square leg for Griffin. The youngster ran in off five yards to deliver the first of his dozen deliveries. For the second Buller crossed to point and then back again to square leg for the third. He called that as well as the next two despite Griffin having cut his \u201crun up\u201d down to a couple of paces and the delivery itself to a gentle loosener. There was a discussion between McGlew and Buller as a result of which McGlew instructed Griffin, following an indication from Buller that it would be the only way he could complete the over, to bowl underarm. Even then Lee chose to no ball the first such delivery on the basis that Griffin, unsurprisingly, had forgotten to inform the batsman he would be changing his mode of delivery. With commendable restraint McGlew wrote later; My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce. Former England and Middlesex leg spinner turned writer Ian Peebles, who published an interesting book on the throwing controversy a few years later, said of the episode, this was the saddest moment I have ever experienced in cricket.\n\nFollowing that particular debacle there was to be no more bowling for Griffin on the tour. He played occasionally as a batsman, and indeed in his first game in that role he scored an unbeaten 65 against Lancashire, but that effort apart there were not too many more runs for him.\n\nThe tour was just about the end of Griffin\u2019s career, but not quite. An International Cavaliers XI arrived in South Africa for a month long tour a few days after the tourists got back. Griffin played twice against them, first for Natal and then for an invitation eleven. After the controversy in England Griffin was a big draw and the umpires, who included Fell, were firmly requested not call him. Howard Kidson stood in the second match and was content to follow orders. What would he have done if there were no such instructions? The answer to that one is as clear as mud. He first wrote I still had no clear definition of a throw although I knew a throw when I saw it, before adding cryptically, with Griffin I was left with a lingering impression that I had been observing something that certainly looked* like a throw.\n\nOne of the Cavaliers on that trip was Trueman who, interestingly, commented; On a dead wicket which wasn\u2019t helping anyone Griffin let one go faster than anything I\u2019ve ever bowled \u2013 it ripped the thumb clean off Norm O\u2019Neill\u2019s brand new batting glove. After the Cavaliers games Griffin moved to Rhodesia were he played a few matches over the next couple of seasons, but he stepped off a First Class cricket ground for the last time at the age of just 23 after being no balled seven times. He only bowled nine overs in what was a sad end to an unfulfilled career.\n\nSo did Griffin throw? In 1960 Richie Benaud wrote; He has a very strong wrist flick in the last moment of delivery but this is quite permissible under the new interpretation of law 26, Benaud was in a tricky position as a man who might have found himself skippering Meckiff, Rorke and Slater the following summer, and he made similar comments about Charlie Griffith before later doing a volte face with him.\n\nDenis Compton wrote; I am sure the umpires have been too severe on this boy. Certainly he has a bent elbow, but he cannot straighten it because of physical disability. I have seen bowlers with far more suspect actions get away with it. And I will say definitely that Griffin does not throw. On the other hand Fortune believed that Griffin threw as, more tellingly, did Adcock and Waite. But for all that no one ever suggested that there was any malice in Griffin. For a fast bowler he was certainly a man with an equable temperament. His reaction to his hat trick was not significantly different to the outwardly phlegmatic response to being called. Trueman summed him up by saying; I would like to say what a really good sport Griffin has been about the whole throwing business. Geoff is a very nice lad, I think we were all sorry for him on that tour.\n\nFurther evidence to support Griffin\u2019s theory came the following year when none of the controversial Australian bowlers were chosen, despite all of them putting forward a decent case for selection in the previous domestic season. It may well be that Geoff Griffin\u2019s action did infringe the laws of the game, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that the treatment that he received at the hands of English umpires was truly appalling. His ordeal should never have been played out in the public eye in the manner that it was and the whole episode is one from which only Griffin himself emerges with any credit.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, when he might have been leading South Africa\u2019s attack with Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, Geoff Griffin was building an alternative career for himself as a hotelier in Rhodesia and was lost to the game of cricket. In due course he moved back to Natal where, at the age of 67, he died from a heart attack in 2006.\n\n*the emphasis is Kidson\u2019s, not that of the writer."}, {"url": "http://www.geoffgriffin.com/reviews.html", "page_content": "\"Brooklyn Bat Boy, by Geoff Griffin, is a fabulous historical fiction book about a boy named Bobby Kelly.

The terms \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201ccolored\u201d are used in the book because they were terms that would have commonly been used in 1947. These terms are considered offensive today.\u2019\n\nAnd so we have a well-written novel, a thoughtful examination of a major event in racial relations, and a flavor of a time that transports us in many ways.\"\n\n\n\n-Grady Harp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b \"Brooklyn Bat Boy: A Story of the 1947 Season that Changed Baseball Forever by Geoff Griffin is about a 12 year old boy named Bobby Kelly who loves baseball and the Dodgers.\n\nWhen he gets the ultimate chance of a lifetime to be their bat boy, he is thrilled but along comes Jackie Robinson who is set to play with the Dodgers. Not everyone is so happy about this monumental moment in history so what will Bobby do?\n\nThis was an interesting book that not only told a story but also one set in history. The only issue I have at all is that it is very short. It's still a good story but some people who have liked to have read more. With that being said, it was good and I enjoyed this quick read.\"\n\n\n\n\u200b -Shauna Klein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Written with a true Brooklyn \u201cvibe\u201d, the story of a 1947 Brooklyn Bat Boy as he encounters Jackie Robinson and comes to terms with the fact that a African American will now be playing in the Major Leagues; is a great tale, chock full of history, grit, humor and an inner struggle to accept changes in the way life was back then.\n\nBobby, a 12 year old boy and life long Dodgers fan, sneaks into the Baseball stadium with two of his friends. When they are caught, he takes responsibility for their conduct and thusly impresses the Dodgers Owner who offers him a job as a Bat Boy for the upcoming Season.\n\nI think this book is extremely well written, I was recently watching the movie about Robinson, so I had a comparison fresh in my mind. The pacing, writing style and plot were well fleshed out and extremely well put together. Even though I was already familiar with this topic, I did not feel like the story was rehashing known history, the author truly did a good job of viewing this time period from a fresh new perspective. A great story.\"\n\n\n\n-JA Armstrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBrooklyn Bat Boy: A Story of the 1947 Season that Changed Baseball Forever\u201d is Geoff Griffin\u2019s novel that is entirely immersed in baseball and has some historical aspects added in as well. Baseball isn\u2019t the first sport I would pick to read a book about, but the passion was something that drew me in. I am not entirely familiar with all of the slang that was from the 1940s time period, so I was a little slow at first, but everything starts to slide in to place as you keep on reading. The story revolves around Bobby who is able to get a front line view point of the chaos and drama that is involved with Jackie Robinson being added to the Dodgers roster. Even if you aren\u2019t into baseball, this book has more incorporated into the storyline than just that, so it is great for all readers. I enjoyed reading it and I truly enjoyed the passion that Bobby had for the game and the people he interacted with.\"\n\n\n\n-Renee Spicuzza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Truly a wonderful book for a middle elementary reader. I am a classroom teacher, and this will be a book that I share with my students each year. It does well to address pertinent racial issue in a healthy manner for discussion with children in a classroom setting. The author also clearly did his research to give the historical context and accurate picture. Students will love and benefit from having the opportunity to interact and engage with this text.\"\n\n\n\n-Alicia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/geoff-griffin-dies-aged-67-268860", "page_content": "Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler who was effectively no-balled out of Test cricket, has died in Durban aged 67\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff Griffin in action during the 1960 tour of England which was the start and end of his international career \u00a9 Cricketer International\n\nGeoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67. Geoff Griffin, the former South African pace bowler, has died in Durban aged 67.\n\nAlthough he played two Tests and was the first South African to take a hat-trick in a Test, Griffin will best be remembered as the man who was no-balled out of international cricket at Lord's in 1960.\n\nA tall, blond, quick bowler who topped the national averages during the 1959-60 domestic season with 35 wickets at 12.23, his action had been the subject of debate from the moment the South Africans landed. In his defence, he had suffered an accident as a schoolboy which meant he couldn't straighten his arm, but he was playing at a time that there was considerable debate over suspect actions, mainly of Australian fast bowlers.\n\nNo-balled in warm-up matches, he underwent remedial work at Alf Gover's famous indoor school before returning to action, but a number of people were not satisfied.\n\nAt Lord's he took a hat-trick, the first by a South African, but that was completely overshadowed by him being repeatedly no-balled. His career was almost finished when, in an exhibition match played as the Test ended early, he was again called for throwing. Attempting to finish an over by bowling underarm, he was then rather cruelly called for not informing the umpire of a change of action. \"We didn't take the warning seriously,\" he was to recall many years later. \"It sounded so preposterous to use an exhibition match to do the dirty on me. He remained on the tour playing as a specialist batsman.\"\n\nA good-natured and popular player, he was widely praised for the way he took this massive setback. Griffin was contacted by a lawyer who offered to take the matter to court, free of charge. \"You'll win hands down and end up a wealthy young man,\" he said. But he declined. \"I loved cricket too much to sully the great game further.\"\n\nMany felt that the relatively unknown Griffin had been singled out by the authorities, who were desperate to send a message to the world that chuckers would not be tolerated. The fear was that a major row would erupt if Australia brought their batch of suspect bowlers in 1961, and so Griffin was used to show that umpires were prepared, if necessary, to act. If so, it worked. Australia omitted all their fast bowlers whose actions had caused such rancour in 1958-59.\n\n\"I was the victim of a thoroughly distasteful 'chucking' conspiracy,\" Griffin said earlier this year. \"I was the fall guy. I attribute the blame to the SA cricket authorities and the MCC who should never have allowed things to develop as they did.\"\n\nHe returned home and moved from Natal to Rhodesia, but within two years - and still only 23 years old - his career was over after he was repeatedly no-balled against North-Eastern Transvaal at Salisbury."}, {"url": "https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/greatest-nba-executives-c8c6135b0e8944fe", "page_content": "The Greatest NBA GMs of All Time The best basketball executives build championship teams. Lots of them.\n\nThe Greatest NBA GMs of All Time Red Auerbach was the Boston Celtics' general manager from 1950 to 1984 and built 15 NBA championship teams. They're not players, coaches or owners. But in the NBA, front-office executives have an important role. The executives who make player personnel decisions \u2014 also known as the general manager \u2014 are the architects of the team. They decide who to draft, sign in free agency and trade to construct rosters that are built for winning championships. Entering the 2019-20 season, 283 executives have been in charge of player personnel decisions in NBA history. These are the best.\n\nHonorable Mention: Jon Horst Milwaukee Bucks general manager Jon Horst in 2017. Teams: Milwaukee Bucks GM experience: 2 seasons (2017-present) Record as GM: 104-60 (.634) Playoff appearances: 2 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Jon Horst is young, smart and hungry. In his first two seasons running the Bucks, the team has won 60 games in a season, finished with the best record in the league and got within two games of beating the NBA-champion Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference finals. Most importantly, the 36-year-old Horst has created a winning culture in Milwaukee. He fired Jason Kidd and hired Mike Budenholzer (a former Spurs assistant on Gregg Popovich's staff) and surrounded the team's star, Giannis Antetokounmpo, with shooters and long, athletic players. It's too soon to christen Horst a great, but the reigning NBA executive of the year might not be too far away from greatness.\n\n30. Geoff Petrie Sacramento Kings president of basketball operations Geoff Petrie in 2006. Teams: Sacramento Kings GM experience: 20 seasons (1994-2013) Record as GM: 721-789 (.477) Playoff appearances: 9 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Being an NBA executive is a tough job, but the job can bring added stress for former players, who are used to controlling the outcome of games with moves on the court. Geoff Petrie learned how to make an impact off it. The 1971 co-rookie of the year out of Princeton and a two-time All-Star, Petrie joined the Kings in 1994 and turned the struggling franchise into a contender in the early 2000s. If not for the Shaq-Kobe Lakers and some questionable officiating in 2002, the Kings might have been the actual kings of the NBA. Though Petrie was unable to get Sacramento to the promised land, he was executive of the year twice (1999, 2001) and achieved a lot in a small market.\n\n29. Sam Presti Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti in 2019. Teams: Oklahoma City Thunder GM experience: 12 seasons (2007-present) Record as GM: 538-348 (.607) Playoff appearances: 9 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Good thing Sam Presti has a strong constitution. Presti drafted Kevin Durant (2007), Russell Westbrook (2008) and James Harden (2009). Now all three former NBA MVPs are no longer on the Thunder, and neither is Paul George. But Presti \u2014 whose teams have lost in the Western Conference finals twice and NBA Finals once \u2014 still has a playoff-caliber roster. Can he build a champion in a win-now league?\n\n28. Wayne Embry Wayne Embry announces his resignation as general manager of the Milwaukee Bucks in 1976. Teams: Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Toronto Raptors GM experience: 20 seasons, Milwaukee (1972-77), Cleveland (1986-99), Toronto (2006) Record as GM: Milwaukee (225-185, .549), Cleveland (564-470, .545), Toronto (27-55, .329) Playoff appearances: 12 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Wayne Embry was a pioneer. After a solid 11-year NBA career as a player, Wayne Embry became the first black general manager and team president in professional sports history. The closest he got to winning a championship as a GM was in 1974, when the Bucks lost to the Celtics in seven games, but he helped turn the Cavaliers into perennial contenders in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, and his Cavs teams finished above .500 in 10 of his 13 seasons in the front office. In 1999, the two-time executive of the year was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game.\n\n27. Larry Bird Indiana Pacers team president Larry Bird in 2016. Teams: Indiana Pacers GM experience: 13 seasons (2003-12, 2013-17) Record as GM: 642-571 (.529) Playoff appearances: 8 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Just as Larry Legend worked hard to master his craft as a Hall of Fame player, he put in work to master his job running an NBA team. But the former Celtic great had an up-and-down tenure as an executive for his hometown Indiana Pacers. Despite some hits (drafting Danny Granger and Paul George), he had one big miss: trading Kawhi Leonard (along with Davis Bertans and Erazem Lorbek) to the Spurs for George Hill on draft day in 2011. We'll never know how devastating a George-Leonard combination would have been. Oh, wait. On the flip side, Bird is the only person in league history to be voted MVP, coach of the year and executive of the year.\n\n26. Daryl Morey Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in 2011. Teams: Houston Rockets GM experience: 12 seasons (2007-present) Record as GM: 596-372 (.616) Playoff appearances: 10 NBA Titles: 0 Bottom line: Numbers don't lie. But they don't guarantee NBA titles, either. Daryl Morey, who went to MIT Sloan School of Management and co-founded the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in 2007, was ahead of the curve in using analytics in the NBA. He has won big deals. And his basketball philosophy, or \"Moreyball,\" which is predicated on shooting 3's and layups over midrange jumpers, has produced some big wins. Just not the biggest. At least not yet.\n\n25. Bob Weinhauer Former Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks general manager Bob Weinhauer. Teams: Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks GM experience: 4 seasons, Houston (1994-96), Milwaukee (1997-99) Record as GM: Houston (153-93, .622), Milwaukee (97-117, .453) Playoff appearances: 3 NBA Titles: 1 (1995) Bottom line: A good GM knows when to gamble and when to not mess with a good thing. Bob Weinhauer took over as the Rockets' general manager in 1994, the season after Houston won its first NBA title, and he rolled the dice to make the team better. Weinhauer traded Otis Thorpe for Clyde Drexler, left Hakeem Olajuwon and the core of the team intact, and the Rockets won back-to-back championships. The honeymoon for the Rockets did not last long, and the team lost in the Western Conference semifinals the following season. Before Weinhauer left town, he made one more blockbuster, acquiring Charles Barkley from the Suns for Charles Chucky Brown, Mark Bryant, Sam Cassell and Robert Horry. In Milwaukee, Weinhauer kept wheeling and dealing, but he didn't find much success and has the dubious distinction of trading Dirk Nowitzki for Robert Traylor.\n\n24. Dick Vertlieb Golden State Warriors general manager Dick Vertlieb in 1974. Teams: Seattle SuperSonics, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers GM experience: 4 seasons, SuperSonics (1968-69), Warriors (1974-76), Pacers (1980-81) Record as GM: SuperSonics (30-52, .366), Warriors (107-57, .652), Pacers (44-38, .537) Playoff appearances: 3 NBA titles: 1 (1975) Bottom line: Dick Vertlieb made his time as a general manager count. In four NBA seasons, he ran three teams, hired Lenny Wilkens to coach the Sonic and won an NBA title with the Warriors. Wilkens won 1,332 games in his NBA coaching career, and the Dubs didn't win another title for another 40 years. In 1977, Vertlieb also was the first GM of the Seattle Mariners in Major League Baseball. Not too bad a legacy.\n\n23. Don Nelson Dallas Mavericks general manager Don Nelson in 1997. Teams: Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks GM experience: 23 seasons, Milwaukee (1977-87), Golden State (1987-95), Dallas (1997-2002) Record as GM: Milwaukee (513-307, .626), Golden State (309-347, .471), Dallas (189-189, .500) Playoff appearances: 16 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Marques Johnson. Sidney Moncrief. Mitch Richmond. Tim Hardaway. Tyrone Hill. Chris Gatling. Latrell Sprewell. Chris Webber. Dirk Nowitzki. Josh Howard. Those are all players Don Nelson drafted or acquired via trade. And they all became All-Stars. Nellie, who won five NBA rings as a player, knew the game as well as anybody. While his teams could put up points, they never played enough defense to put up NBA championship banners in Milwaukee, Golden State or Dallas. Don't worry about Nelson signing the blues, though. Now, he has a weed farm on Maui to grow his own green for medicinal purposes.\n\n22. Jack Ramsay Jack Ramsay coaching the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977. Teams: Philadelphia 76ers GM experience: 4 seasons, (1966-1970) Record as GM: 227-100 (.694) Playoff appearances: 4 NBA titles: 1 (1967) Bottom line: Dr. Jack is a basketball legend, but even legends aren't perfect. After winning the NBA title in his first season with the Sixers and getting to the division finals in his second, Jack Ramsay was forced to trade Wilt Chamberlain for a bag of balls and some peanuts. Ramsay then took over as Philly's head coach, and pulled double duty in the front office and on the sidelines for two seasons, before focusing full-time on coaching for the rest of his career. That decision was one of the best moves Ramsay, one of the game's greatest visionaries and teachers, ever made on his way to the Hall of Fame.\n\n21. Jerry Colangelo Jerry Colangelo in 1997. Teams: Phoenix Suns GM experience: 27 seasons (1968-1995) Record as GM: 1205-1009 (.544) Playoff appearances: 17 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Jerry Colangelo was the youngest general manager in professional sports when he became the first GM of the expansion Suns in 1968 at the age of 28. Although he lost a 1969 coin flip with the Milwaukee Bucks for the right to draft UCLA star center Lew Alcindor (who became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Colangelo bounced back and steered the Suns to success. Under his watch, Phoenix finished .500 or better in 17 seasons and reached the NBA Finals twice \u2014 losing in six games both times, to the Boston Celtics in 1976 and the Chicago Bulls in 1993. Along the way, he won four NBA executive of the year awards (1977, 1982, 1990, 1994) and became one of the most powerful men in the NBA. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n20. Eddie Gottlieb Philadelphia Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb with Wilt Chamberlain in 1960. Teams: Philadelphia Warriors/San Francisco Warriors GM experience: 11 seasons (1952-63) Record as GM: 400-415 (.491) Playoff appearances: 7 NBA titles: 1 (1956) Bottom line: Wilt Chamberlain isn't the only Hall of Fame player Eddie Gottlieb drafted. He also picked star players Tom Gola, Guy Rodgers and Nate Thurmond. In fact, Gottlieb, who also coached and owned the team, built an NBA champion three years before Chamberlain, one of the most dominant players in NBA history, joined the roster. In 1956, the Warriors toppled the Fort Wayne Pistons with Gola and Paul Arizin running the show. Not sure if that's more a credit to Gottlieb's skills as a team builder or an indictment against Chamberlain's ability to make those around him better. What's indisputable is Gottlieb's influence on the game \u2014 for over decades, he was chairman of the league's rules committee and made the league's schedule until 1978.\n\n19. Harry Glickman Harry Glickman in 1970. Teams: Portland Trail Blazers GM Experience: 11 seasons (1970-81) Record as GM: 405-497 (.449) Playoff appearances: 5 NBA Titles: 1 (1977) Bottom Line: Harry Glickman was the founder of the Portland Trail Blazers and ran the team for its first 11 seasons. After some growing pains, Glickman put all of the pieces together, and the Blazers won a championship in 1977 in their first postseason. Glickman proved that a small market like Portland could support an NBA franchise and was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\n18. Ray Patterson Houston Rockets general manager Ray Patterson in 1983. Teams: Milwaukee Bucks, Houston Rockets Executive experience: 19 seasons, Milwaukee (1970-72), Houston (1972-89) Record as executive: Milwaukee (116-29, .800), Houston (682-732, .482) Playoff appearances: 12 NBA Titles: 1 (1971) Bottom line: A little luck never hurt an NBA executive, and good fortune smiled on Ray Patterson, the Bucks' first president. In 1969, Patterson worked with then-general manager John Erickson to draft and sign Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), a coup for Milwaukee and the NBA since the upstart ABA wanted the once-in-a-lifetime franchise player. After the Bucks acquired Oscar Robertson from the Cincinnati Royals, Erickson left the team for politics, and Milwaukee won its first NBA title in 1971 with Patterson steering the ship. He then moved on to Houston and created a home for basketball in a football state. The Rockets made the playoffs in 11 of Patterson's 17 seasons as GM, including two NBA Finals appearances in 1981 and 1986, as he drafted, traded or signed multiple Hall of Famers, including Moses Malone, Elvis Hayes and Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\n17. Pat Williams Orlando Magic senior vice president Pat Williams in 2004. Teams: Chicago Bulls, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Orlando Magic GM experience: 24 seasons, Chicago (1969-73), Atlanta (1973-74), Philadelphia (1974-86), Orlando (1987-96) Record as GM: Chicago (231-179, .563), Atlanta (35-47, .427), Philadelphia (640-381, .627), Orlando (278-296, .484) Playoff appearances: 18 NBA titles: 1 (1983) Bottom line: It's a thin line between winning everything and being relegated to the dustbin of runner-up history. Ask Pat Williams. The longtime executive took teams to the NBA Finals five times (four with the 76ers, once with the Magic) in three different decades but won only one title, in 1983 with the 76ers. Nevertheless, he accomplished a lot in his GM career. Three of his biggest league-altering moves were purchasing Julius Erving from the New York Nets for the Sixers, drafting Shaquille O'Neal and trading for Penny Hardaway.\n\n16. Danny Ainge Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge in 2017. Teams: Boston Celtics GM experience: 16 seasons (2003-present) Record as GM: 722-573 (.558) Playoff appearances: 16 NBA titles: 1 (2008) Bottom line: Only one person has run the Boston Celtics as long as Danny Ainge \u2014 Red Auerbach. While Ainge is not in the same executive class as Auerbach (not too many people are), the former Celtic has made some big moves that would make Auerbach proud. Most famous are the trades for Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, the fleecing of the Brooklyn Nets, and the hirings of Doc Rivers and Brad Stevens as head coaches. But the NBA is a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business, and the Celtics haven't won a title since 2008, so the natives are getting restless.\n\n15. Rod Thorn Philadelphia 76ers president Rod Thorn in 2011. Teams: Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, GM experience: 15 seasons, Chicago (1978-85), New Jersey (2000-04, 2007-08, 2010), Philadelphia (2010-12) Record as GM: Chicago (206-341, .377), New Jersey (208-202, .507), Philadelphia (76-72, .514) Playoff appearances: 7 NBA titles: 0 Bottom line: Rod Thorn drafted an athletic shooting guard out of North Carolina named Michael Jordan as the third pick in the 1984 draft. Though Thorn never won an NBA title as an NBA executive, he gets credit for choosing the chosen one. Thorn saw his most NBA front-office success with the Nets as Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin and a young Richard Jefferson led teams to back-to-back NBA Finals in the early 2000s. Thorn ended his career with Sixers, but none of his moves in Philly could top the ones he made in Chicago and New Jersey. In 2018, Thorn was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n14. David Griffin New Orleans Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin. Teams: Cleveland Cavaliers, New Orleans Pelicans GM experience: 3 seasons, Cavaliers (2014-17), New Orleans (2019-present) Record as GM: Cleveland (194-134, .591) New Orleans N/A Playoff appearances: 3 NBAtitles: 1 (2016) Bottom line: David Griffin is just getting started. After getting LeBron James back to the Cavaliers, Griffin traded for Kevin Love and made the all other necessary roster moves to give the King everything he needed to fulfill his championship promise to Cleveland. Now, Griffin has an opportunity to build an NBA champion in New Orleans with Zion Williamson, another generational talent. The Anthony Davis deal with the Lakers proves Griffin is up to the challenge.\n\n13. Joe Dumars Detroit Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars in 2012. Teams: Detroit Pistons GM experience: 14 seasons (2000-2014) Record as GM: 595-537 (.526) Playoff appearances: 8 NBA titles: 1 (2004) Bottom line: Joe Dumars was an underrated shark with the Pistons \u2014 on the court as the player and in the front office as an executive. After becoming the GM of his old team, Dumars showed the same quiet efficiency and killer instinct that made him a two-time NBA champion in Detroit. Under Dumars, the Pistons reached the Eastern Conference finals five times (winning twice) and won 50 or more games in seven straight seasons. His crowning achievement was the 2004 championship team that shocked the Lakers, which was built by trading for Ben Wallace, drafting Tayshaun Prince, signing Chauncey Billups as a free agent and trading for Richard Hamilton. The Pistons never soared to those heights again with Dumars. But before his tenure ended, he selected Andre Drummond as a lottery pick in 2012.\n\n12. Jack McCloskey Former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey in 2008. Teams: Detroit Pistons, Minnesota Timberwolves, Toronto Raptors GM experience: 17 seasons, Detroit (1979-92), Minnesota (1992-95), Toronto (2004) Record as GM: Detroit (580-486, .544), Minnesota (60-186, .244), Toronto (33-49, .402) Playoff appearances: 9 NBA titles: 2 (1989, 1990) Bottom line: Jack McCloskey had some lean early years in Detroit, but he identified talent others did not. After hiring Chuck Daly to be the team's head coach in 1983, the Pistons won 46 or more games in nine straight seasons, and McCloskey's trade acquisitions (Vinnie Johnson, Bill Laimbeer, Adrian Dantley, Mark Aguirre) and draft picks (Joe Dumars, John Salley, Dennis Rodman) formed the core of the back-to-back championship teams in Detroit. The same success did not follow McCloskey in Minnesota and Toronto, but the \"Bad Boys\" era in Motown was as bad (meaning good) as basketball gets.\n\n11. Donnie Nelson Dallas Mavericks president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson in 2008. Teams: Dallas Mavericks GM experience: 17 seasons, (2002-present) Record as GM: 818-560 (.594) Playoff appearances: 13 NBA Titles: 1 (2011) Bottom Line: Donnie Nelson, the son of Don Nelson, succeeded his father in the general manager role with the Mavericks and built teams that won 50 or more games in nine straight seasons. Donnie helped the Mavericks get to their first NBA Finals in 2006. Then, he upped the ante, hiring Rick Carlisle as head coach and acquiring Shawn Marion and Jason Kidd in trades. The result in 2011 \u2014 an NBA title over the heavily favored Miami Heat \u2014 was something even his father never did while running basketball operations for a team. It was the first NBA title for Dallas, but it may not be the last for Donnie and crew. With Dirk Nowitzki retiring, a new crop of stars headlined by Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis could make some noise in the crowded Western Conference.\n\n10. Gregg Popovich Gregg Popovich coaching the San Antonio Spurs in 2001. Teams: San Antonio Spurs GM experience: 8 seasons, (1994-2002) Record as GM: 403-221 (.646) Playoff appearances: 7 NBA titles: 1 Bottom line: One of the greatest NBA coaches of all time also is one of the game's greatest executives. Gregg Popovich selected Tim Duncan as the first pick in the 1997 draft, and \"The Big Fundamental\" became the heir apparent to David Robinson and a foundational piece for a Spurs dynasty. Popovich selected Manu Ginobili with the 57th pick in the 1999 draft, and he turned out to be a future Hall of Famer. Popovich also signed Bruce Bowen and Stephen Jackson, key contributors for future Spurs championship teams. But Popovich's all-time greatest move was installing himself as head coach to replace Bob Hill after only 18 games in the 1996-97 season. Twenty-plus years later, Pop hasn't left the bench, and the Spurs have five NBA titles and average close to 50 wins every season.\n\n9. Masai Ujiri Masai Ujiri in 2011. Teams: Denver Nuggets, Toronto Raptors GM experience: 9 seasons, Denver (2010-13), Toronto (2013-present) Record as GM: Denver (145-85, .630), Toronto (321-171, .652) Playoff appearances: 9 NBA titles: 1 (2019) Bottom line: Masai Ujiri did not waste any time making a name for himself in the NBA. After proving himself as a scout with the Nuggets and Raptors, Ujiri was hired as Denver's general manager in 2010 and developed a reputation as a smart, bold dealmaker. In 2013, the Nigerian who was born in England became the first non-American to win the NBA executive of the year award and signed a five-year, $15 million deal to lead the Raptors' front office. He did such a good job that Toronto gave him an extension with two years on his contract to keep him off the open market. His boldest (and best) move was trading the team's top player and a fan favorite, DeMar DeRozan, for Kawhi Leonard in a blockbuster that delivered the Raptors' first title. Now, Ujiri gets to experience the difficulty of staying on top without Leonard, who left town after one season.\n\n8. Red Holzman New York Knicks coach and general manager Red Holzman, right, with captain Willis Reed and the world championship trophy in 1970. Teams: New York Knicks GM experience: 5 seasons (1970-75) Record as GM: 306-186 (.622) Playoff appearances: 6 NBA titles: 2 (1970, 1973) Bottom line: The Knicks are one of nine NBA franchises that have won two or more NBA titles. Red Holzman is a big reason why. Holzman coached the team for 14 seasons (1967-77, 1978-82) and was the mastermind behind the Knicks' two titles as the general manager. Holzman took over at GM for Eddie Donovan at the end of the 1970 season, and the Knicks got to the Eastern Conference finals in five straight seasons. Holzman's biggest move was trading for Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe in the early part of the 1971 season, making Madison Square Garden the place to be in the early 1970s. MSG remains the \"Mecca of Basketball,\" but those Knicks glory days are a long way from today.\n\n7. Pat Riley Miami Heat president Pat Riley in 2010. Teams: Miami Heat GM experience: 11 seasons (2008-present) Record as GM: 523-363 (.590) Playoff appearances: 8 NBA Titles: 2 (2012, 2013) Bottom line: Pat Riley has seen everything in the NBA \u2014 from winning a ring as a player with the Lakers (1972) to leading a dynasty with the \"Showtime\" Lakers (1980s) to coaching the Knicks (mid-1990s) to joining the Heat as president and coach (1995) and winning another title in Miami (2006). All that experience prepared Riley for his final act as a championship architect. Since 2008, his sole focus has been running the Heat's basketball operations, and in that time, he introduced the NBA to superteams and won back-to-back titles. Now with Dwyane Wade retired, it's a new era in Miami, and time will tell if Riley has another title run in him.\n\n6. Max Winter Max Winter in 1960. Teams: Minneapolis Lakers GM experience: 6 seasons (1948-54) Record as GM: 273-131 (.675) Playoff appearances: 6 NBA titles: 5 (1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954) Bottom Line: Max Winter was the first general manager of the Lakers (and a part-owner) when the team started playing in Minneapolis in 1948. The successful businessman also had the Midas touch in basketball and built the NBA's first dynasty. Under his guidance, the Lakers won the league championship in five of his six seasons as GM. After his success in basketball, he helped bring pro football to Minnesota with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n5. Bob Myers Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers in 2012. Teams: Golden State Warriors GM experience: 7 seasons (2012-present) Record as GM: 420-154 (.732) Playoff appearances: 7 NBA titles: 3 (2015, 2017, 2018) Bottom line: Bob Myers took an uncommon route to run basketball operations for the Warriors, starting his career as a sports agent under Arn Tellem. But the path has led to three championships and a near dynasty. Myers has used his mastery of contract negotiation and player recruitment to draft, sign and trade some big names (see: Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Leandro Barbosa, Shaun Livingston and Kevin Durant). However, his biggest move was firing Mark Jackson and bringing in former TNT analyst Steve Kerr to take over as head coach in 2014. Put everything together, and Myers is a huge part of the Warriors' success. If not for a historic comeback by the Cavaliers and a KD injury, we might be talking about the reigning champion Warriors with five straight titles.\n\n4. R.C. Buford San Antonio Spurs general manager R.C. Buford in 2014. Teams: San Antonio Spurs GM experience: 17 seasons, (2002-19) Record as GM: 966-432 (.691) Playoff appearances: 17 NBA titles: 4 Bottom line: All R.C. Buford does is win. In his 17 seasons as general manager in San Antonio, the Spurs won 50 or more games in 15 straight seasons. Some notable moves include his trade of George Hill in the 2015 draft for the 15th pick, which became Kawhi Leonard and another draft pick. Leonard turned out to be pretty good before he was traded to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard DeMar DeRozan. Buford also signed Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan to contract extensions, added Robert Horry as a free agent, and signed key role players like Danny Green and Patty Mills. Buford earned a promotion to Spurs CEO for his work. New GM Brian Wright will have big shoes to fill.\n\n3. Jerry Krause Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause in 1993. Teams: Chicago Bulls GM experience: 19 seasons (1976, 1985-2003) Record as GM: 832-694 (.545) Playoff appearances: 13 NBA Titles: 6 (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998) Bottomline: Having the greatest player in basketball history is one thing. Maximizing that potential is another. Jerry Krause figured out to get every drop of greatness out of Michael Jordan. Although Krause didn\u2019t draft Jordan, he found the right players to fit with Jordan and help the team succeed. Some of those players include Scottie Pippen, John Paxson, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoc, B.J. Armstrong, Steve Kerr and Dennis Rodman. Hiring Phil Jackson, an untraditional choice to be an NBA coach, was a stroke of genius, and the perfect yin to Jordan's yang. Krause could not keep the train on the championship track forever, but for one brilliant decade in the 1990s, we witnessed near sports perfection.\n\n2. Red Auerbach Boston Celtics general manager Red Auerbach, center, with Bill Russell, left, and John Havlicek in 1968. Teams: Boston Celtics GM Experience: 34 seasons, (1950-84) Record as GM: 1,738-949 (.647) Playoff appearances: 30 NBA titles: 15 Bottom line: Red Auerbach was way ahead of his time as a basketball innovator and pioneer. His signature move was getting Bill Russell to the Celtics for his defense, despite the widespread shadow of racism in Boston, in a 1956 deal that involved the Ice Capades and Ed Macauley. But that was just one of the countless moves Auerbach made. The Celtics employed a long list of legends \u2014 Bob Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, John Havlicek, Larry Bird, Robert Parish and Kevin McHale \u2014 that dominated the NBA over four decades. Of course, the NBA in those early days had fewer teams than the 30 now. That doesn't take away from Auerbach's staggering body of work. While the rest of the league was playing checkers, Auerbach played chess. That's why the Celtics won 15 NBA titles under his watch (including eight in a row and 10 out of 11) and have the most championships in NBA history with 17."}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/game-of-thrones-original-story-2017-8", "page_content": "Warning: There are possible spoilers ahead for the \"Game of Thrones\" series.\n\nIn 1993, author George R.R.

However, author George R.R. Martin's original plan was for the series to be a trilogy.\n\nRedditor TheNextRobin noticed a tweet from UK bookseller Waterstones which contained three photos of a 1993 letter Martin wrote outlining the entire series. The tweet has since been deleted, but not before the images made it to the internet.\n\nVariety first picked up on the Reddit post in 2015.\n\nWhile the letters detail many differences that never ended up occurring in the books and show, the biggest reveal is the five characters who survive at the end of the entire book series.\n\nOf course, this could have changed by now, but back in '93 Martin listed Daenerys Targaryen, Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Bran Stark, and Tyrion Lannister as surviving \"Game of Thrones.\" It's worth noting that all of these characters are still alive in the show, which has long passed the events of the book series.\n\nThe outline also contains an unsettling romantic thread between brother and sister, Jon and Arya.\n\nHere are the letters below.

When completed, this will be the first volume in what I see as an epic trilogy with the overall title, 'A Song of Ice and Fire.'\n\nAs you know, I don't outline my novels. I find that if I know exactly where a book is going, I lose all interest in writing it. I do, however, have some strong notions as to the overall structure of the story I'm telling, and the eventual fate of many of the principle characters in the drama. Roughly speaking, there are three major conflicts set in motion in the chapters enclosed. These will form the major plot threads of the trilogy, [unclear] each other in what should be a complex but exciting (I hope [unclear] tapestry. Each of the [unclear] presents a major threat [unclear] of my imaginary realm, the Seven Kingdoms, and to the live [unclear] principal characters.\n\nThe first threat grows from the emnity between the great houses of Lannister and Stark as it plays out in a cycle of plot, counterplot, ambition, murder, and revenge, with the iron throne of the Seven Kingdoms as the ultimate prize. This will form the backbone of the first volume of the trilogy, A Game of Thrones.\n\nWhile the lion of Lannister and the direwolf of Stark snarl and scrap, however, a second and greater threat takes shape across the narrow sea, where the Dothraki horselords mass their barbarian hordes for a great invasion of the Seven Kingdoms, led by the fierce and beautiful Daenerys Stormborn, the last of the Targaryen dragonlords. The Dothraki invasion will be the central story of my second volume, A Dance with Dragons.\n\nThe greatest danger of all, however, comes from the north, from the icy wastes beyond the Wall, where half-forgotten demons out of legend, the inhuman others, raise cold legions of the undead and the neverborn and prepare to ride down on the winds of winter to extinguish everything that we would call \"life.\" The only thing that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and an endless night is the Wall, and a handful of men in black called the Night's Watch. Their story will be [sic] heart of my third volume, The Winds of Winter. The final battle will also draw together characters and plot threads left from the first two books and resolve all in one huge climax.\n\nThe thirteen chapters on hand should give you a notion as to my narrative strategy. All three books will feature a complex mosaic of intercutting points-of-view among various of my large and diverse cast of players. The cast will not always remain the same. Old characters will die, and new ones will be introduced. Some of the fatalities will include sympathetic viewpoint characters. I want the reader to feel that no one is ever completely safe, not even the characters who seem to be the heroes. The suspense always ratchets up a notch when you know that any character can die at any time.\n\n--\n\nFive central characters will make it through all three volumes, however, growing from children to adults and changing the world and themselves in the process. In a sense, my trilogy is almost a generational saga, telling the life stories of these five characters, three men and two women. The five key players are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and three of the children of Winterfell, Arya, Bran, and the bastard Jon Snow. All of them are introduced at some length in the chapters you have to hand.\n\nThis is going to be (I hope) quite an epic. Epic in its scale, epic in its action, and epic in its length. I see all three volumes as big books, running about 700 to 800 manuscript pages, so things are just barely getting underway in the thirteen chapters I've sent you.\n\nI have quite a clear notion of how the story is going to unfold in the first volume, A Game of Thrones. Things will get a lot worse for the poor Starks before they get better, I'm afraid. Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Catelyn Tully are both doomed, and will perish at the hands of their enemies. Ned will discover what happened to his friend Jon Arryn, [unclear] can act on his knowledge [unclear] will have an unfortunate accident, and the throne will [unclear] to [unclear] and brutal [unclear] Joffrey [unclear] still a minor. Joffrey will not be sympathetic and Ned [what appears to say] will be accused of treason, but before he is taken he will help his wife and his daughter Arya escape back to Winterfell.\n\nEach of the contending families will learn it has a member of dubious loyalty in its midst. Sansa Stark, wed to Joffrey Baratheon, will bear him a son, the heir to the throne, and when the crunch comes she will choose her husband and child over her parents and siblings, a choice she will later bitterly rue. Tyrion Lannister, meanwhile, will befriend both Sansa and her sister Arya, while growing more and more disenchanted with his own family.\n\nYoung Bran will come out of his coma, after a strange prophetic dream, only to discover that he will never walk again. He will turn to magic, at first in the hope of restoring his legs, but later for its own sake. When his father Eddard Stark is executed, Bran will see the shape of doom descending on all of them, but nothing he can say will stop his brother Robb from calling the banners in rebellion. All the north will be inflamed by war. Robb will win several splendid victories, and maim Joffrey Baratheon on the battlefield, but in the end he will not be able to stand against Jaime and Tyrion Lannister and their allies. Robb Stark will die in battle, and Tyrion Lannister will besiege and burn Winterfell.\n\nJon Snow, the bastard, will remain in the far north. He will mature into a ranger of great daring, and ultimately will succeed his uncle as the commander of the Night's Watch. When Winterfell burns, Catelyn Stark will be forced to flee north with her son Bran and her daughter Arya. Wounded by Lannister riders, they will seek refuge at the Wall, but the men of the Night's Watch give up their families when they take the black, and Jon and Benjen will not be able to help, to Jon's anguish. It will lead to a bitter estrangement between Jon and Bran. Arya will be more forgiving ... until she realizes, with terror, that she has fallen in love with Jon, who is not only her half-brother but a man of the Night's Watch, sworn to celibacy. Their passion will continue to torment Jon and Arya throughout the trilogy, until the secret of Jon's true parentage is finally revealed in the last book.\n\n--\n\nAbandoned by the Night's Watch, Catelyn and her children will find their only hope of safety lies even further north, beyond the Wall, where they fall into the hands of Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall, and get a dreadful glimpse of the inhuman others as they attack the wilding encampment. Bran's magic, Arya's sword Needle, and the savagery of their direwolves will help them survive, but their mother Catelyn will die at the hands of the others.\n\nOver across the narrow sea, Daenerys Targaryen will discover that her new husband, the Dothraki Khal Drogo, has little interest in invading the Seven Kingdoms, much to her brother's frustration. When Viserys presses his claims past the point of tact or wisdom, Khal Drogo will finally grow annoyed and kill him out of hand, eliminating the Targaryen pretender and leaving Daenerys as the last of her line. Danerys [sic] will bide her time, but she will not forget. When the moment is right, she will kill her husband to avenge her brother, and then flee with a trusted friend into the wilderness beyond Vaes Dothrak. There, hunted by [unclear] of her life, she stumbles on a [something about dragon eggs] a young dragon will give Daenerys [unclear] bend [unclear] to her will. Then she begins to plan for her invasion of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nTyrion Lannister will continue to travel, to plot, and to play the game of thrones, finally removing his nephew Joffrey in disgust at the boy king's brutality. Jaime Lannister will follow Joffrey on the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, by the simple expedient of killing everyone ahead of him in the line of succession and blaming his brother Tyrion for the murders. Exiled, Tyrion will change sides, making common cause with the surviving Starks to bring his brother down, and falling helplessly in love with Arya Stark while he's at it. His passion is, alas, unreciprocated, but no less intense for that, and it will lead to a deadly rivalry between Tyrion and Jon Snow.\n\n[The next graph is blocked out.]\n\nBut that's the second book ...\n\nI hope you will find some editors who are as excited about all of this as I am. Feel free to share this letter with anyone who wants to know how the story will go.\n\nAll best,\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin"}]}
