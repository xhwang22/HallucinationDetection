{"Philip of France's father was Louis VII.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip II , byname Philip Augustus, French Philippe Auguste , (born August 21, 1165, Paris , France\u2014died July 14, 1223, Mantes), the first of the great Capetian kings of medieval France (reigned 1180\u20131223), who gradually reconquered the French territories held by the kings of England and also furthered the royal domains northward into Flanders and southward into Languedoc. He was a major figure in the Third Crusade to the Holy Land in 1191.\n\nWhen the count of Flanders allied himself with the Champagne faction , there followed a serious revolt against the king. In the Peace of Boves, in July 1185 (confirmed by the Treaty of Gisors in May 1186), the king and the count of Flanders composed their differences (which had been chiefly over possession of Vermandois, in Picardy) so that the disputed territory was partitioned, Amiens and numerous other places passing to the king and the remainder, with the county of Vermandois proper, being left provisionally to Philip of Alsace. Thenceforward the king was free to run against Henry II of England.\n\nWhen Henry II of England arrived in Normandy, perhaps with the intention of responding to an appeal by the house of Champagne, Philip II entered into negotiations with him and, at Gisors on June 28, 1180, renewed an understanding that Louis VII had reached with him in 1177. As a result, the house of Champagne was politically isolated, and Philip II was making all decisions for himself and acting as he saw fit when his father died, on September 18, 1180, leaving him sole king in name as well as in fact.\n\nPhilip was the son of Louis VII of France and Adela of Champagne. In order to be associated as king with his father, who had fallen mortally ill, he was crowned at Reims on November 1, 1179. His uncles of the house of Champagne\u2014Henry I, count of Champagne; Guillaume, archbishop of Reims; and Thibaut V, count of Blois and Chartres\u2014hoped to use the youthful king to control France. To escape from their tutelage , Philip on April 28, 1180, married Isabella, the daughter of Baldwin V of Hainaut and the niece (through her mother) of Philip of Alsace, the count of Flanders, who promised to give the king the territory of Artois as her dowry.\n\nTerritorial expansion\n\nHenry\u2019s French possessions\u2014the so-called Angevin empire, consisting of Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, with Aquitaine in the hands of his son, the future Richard I the Lion-Heart of England, and Brittany ruled by another son, Geoffrey (died 1186)\u2014all were a constant menace to the French royal domain. Furthermore, there were long-standing disputes over the Vexin (between Normandy and the \u00cele-de-France), Berry, and Auvergne.\n\nPhilip II launched an attack on Berry in the summer of 1187 but then in June made a truce with Henry, which left Issoudun in his hands and also granted him Fr\u00e9teval, in Vend\u00f4mois. Though the truce was for two years, Philip found grounds for resuming hostilities in the summer of 1188. He skillfully exploited the estrangement between Henry and Richard, and Richard did homage to him voluntarily at Bonmoulins in November 1188. Finally, by the Treaty of Azay-le-Rideau, or of Colombi\u00e8res (July 4, 1189), Henry was forced to renew his own homage, to confirm the cession of Issoudun, with Gra\u00e7ay also, to Philip, and to renounce his claim to suzerainty over Auvergne. Henry died two days later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Before his departure, he made the so-called Testament of 1190 to provide for the government of his kingdom in his absence. On his way to Palestine, he met Richard in Sicily, where they promptly found themselves at variance, though they made a treaty at Messina in March 1191. Arriving in Palestine, they cooperated against the Muslims at Acre, until Philip fell ill and made his illness a pretext for returning to France, quite determined to settle the succession to Flanders (Philip of Alsace had just died on the Crusade) while Richard was still absent. Thus, by the end of 1191, Philip II was back in France.\n\nIn spite of promises he had made in the Holy Land, Philip at once prepared to attack the Plantagenet possessions in France. Informed of this, Richard also left the Crusade but was taken prisoner while on his way back by the duke of Austria, Leopold V of Babenberg. Philip did everything he could to prolong his rival\u2019s captivity, but Richard was at last set free (1194) and went to war against Philip. The French king suffered a number of defeats (from that at Fr\u00e9teval in July 1194 to that at Courcelles in September 1198) in a series of campaigns that were occasionally punctuated by negotiations. It was fortuitous for Philip, however, when Richard was killed in April 1199.\n\nRichard\u2019s brother John was by no means as formidable a fighter. Moreover, his right to Richard\u2019s succession could be contested by Arthur of Brittany, whose father had been senior to John. To secure the succession, therefore, John came to terms with Philip: by the Treaty of Le Goulet (May 22, 1200), in return for Philip\u2019s recognition of him as Richard\u2019s heir, he ceded \u00c9vreux and the Norman Vexin to Philip; agreed that Issoudun and Gra\u00e7ay should be the dowry of his niece Blanche of Castile, who was to marry the future Louis VIII (Philip\u2019s son by Isabella of Hainaut); and renounced any claim to suzerainty over Berry and Auvergne.\n\nShortly afterward, however, John entered into conflict with the Lusignan family of Poitou (in Aquitaine), who appealed to Philip as overlord. When he was summoned to appear before the royal court as a vassal of the French crown, John did not present himself, and Philip, in April 1202, pronounced John\u2019s French fiefs forfeit and undertook to carry out the sentence himself. He invaded Normandy, overran the northeast, and laid siege to Arques, while Arthur of Brittany, the son of Geoffrey, who died some years before, campaigned against John\u2019s supporters in Poitou; but John, marching south from Maine, captured Arthur at Mirebeau (August 1). In fury, Philip abandoned the siege of Arques and marched southwestward to Tours, ravaging John\u2019s territory on his way before returning to Paris. Guillaume des Roches, the powerful seneschal of Anjou, who had taken John\u2019s side, came to terms with Philip in March 1203.\n\nResuming operations against Normandy, Philip occupied the towns around the great fortress of Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard, to which he laid siege in September 1203, having overruled Pope Innocent III\u2019s attempts to mediate. John, who is reported to have murdered Arthur of Brittany in April, retired to England in December, and Ch\u00e2teau-Gaillard fell to Philip in March 1204. Rouen, the Norman capital, surrendered in June, after 40 days\u2019 resistance.\n\nAfter his conquest of Normandy, Philip subdued Maine, Touraine, Anjou, and most of Poitou with less difficulty (1204\u201305), though the castles of Loches and Chinon held out for a year. He sought to secure his conquests by lavishing privileges on the towns and on the religious houses but otherwise left the local barons in power. Unrest, however, was endemic in Poitou, and in June 1206 John landed at La Rochelle. After a campaign in the south, he turned north toward the Loire. At Thouars in October 1206, he and Philip made a two-year truce, leaving John in possession of the reconquered Poitevin lands. In the following year, however, Philip invaded Poitou again; and, after a further campaign in 1208, only the south and part of the west of Poitou remained loyal to John (with Saintonge, Guyenne, and Gascony).\n\nPhilip next hoped to exploit the dispute between John and Pope Innocent III. While Innocent was threatening to declare John unfit to reign (1212), plans were being made for a French landing in England and for the accession of Philip\u2019s son Louis to the English throne. The plans had to be dropped when John made his submission to the pope (1213). Throwing himself into schemes for revenge, John formed a coalition against France: the Holy Roman emperor Otto IV, the count of Flanders (Ferrand, or Ferdinand, of Portugal), and the count of Boulogne (Raynald, or Renaud, of Dammartin) were to invade the Capetian territory from the northeast while John attacked from the west, with the help of his Poitevin barons.\n\nJohn landed at La Rochelle in February 1214 and advanced into Anjou but was put to flight by Louis at La Roche-aux-Moines on July 2; his confederates were completely defeated by Philip in the decisive Battle of Bouvines on July 27. The Anglo-Angevin power in France and the coalition had both been broken in one month. Thus Philip, who, in 1213, had transferred Brittany to his cousin Peter of Dreux, was left without any significant opposition to his rule in France.\n\nIt was not only at the Plantagenets\u2019 expense that Philip enlarged the royal domain. His claim to Artois through his first marriage and his gains by the settlement of 1185\u201386 have been mentioned above, and he subsequently proceeded, step by step, to acquire the rest of Vermandois and Valois. His insistence on his suzerainty over vacant fiefs and on his tutelage over minors and heiresses was particularly effective with regard to Flanders, where two successive Flemish counts, Philip of Alsace (died 1191) and Baldwin IX (died c. 1205) had left no male issue.\n\nThough he did not personally take part in the Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III against a Cathari religious sect in Languedoc, Philip allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out. Simon de Montfort\u2019s capture of B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne (1209) and his victory at Muret over Raymond VI of Toulouse and Peter II of Aragon (1213) prepared the way for the eventual annexation of eastern Languedoc to the royal domain six years after Philip\u2019s death and for the union of northern and southern France under Capetian rule."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-VII", "page_content": "Louis VII, byname Louis The Younger, French Louis Le Jeune, (born c. 1120\u2014died Sept. 18, 1180, Paris), Capetian king of France who pursued a long rivalry, marked by recurrent warfare and continuous intrigue, with Henry II of England.\n\nIn 1131 Louis was anointed as successor to his father, Louis VI, and in 1137 he became the sole ruler at his father\u2019s death. Louis married Eleanor, daughter of William X, duke of Aquitaine, in 1137, a few days before his effective rule began, and he thus temporarily extended the Capetian lands to the Pyrenees. Louis continued his father\u2019s pacification program by building the prestige of the kingship through an administrative government based on trustworthy men of humble origin and by consolidating his rule over his royal domains rather than by adding new acquisitions. From 1141 to 1143 he was involved in a fruitless conflict with Count Thibaut of Champagne and the papacy. But thereafter his relations with the popes were good; Alexander II, whom he supported against Frederick Barbarossa, took refuge in France. But the major threat to his reign came from Geoffrey, count of Anjou and, briefly, of Normandy, and Geoffrey\u2019s son Henry, who later (1154) became King Henry II of England as well as ruler of both Anjou and Normandy. After Louis repudiated his wife Eleanor for misconduct on March 21, 1152, she married Henry, who then took over control of Aquitaine. Ironically, this act was probably to Capetian advantage because Aquitaine might have drained the resources of Louis\u2019s kingdom while bringing him little revenue. After the death of Louis\u2019s second wife, he married Alix of Champagne, whose Carolingian blood brought added prestige to the monarchy (1160); their son became Philip II Augustus.\n\nLouis might have defeated Henry if he had made concerted attacks rather than weak assaults on Normandy in 1152. Anglo-Norman family disputes saved Louis\u2019s kingdom from severe incursions during the many conflicts that Louis had with Henry between 1152 and 1174. Louis was helped by the quarrel (1164\u201370) between Henry and Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and a revolt (1173\u201374) of Henry\u2019s sons. Suger, abbot of Saint-Denis, who acted as regent in 1147\u201349 while Louis was away on the Second Crusade, is the primary historian for Louis\u2019s reign."}, {"url": "https://theeuropeanmiddleages.com/france/louis-vii-of-france/", "page_content": "Louis VII of France was born around 1120 as the son of King Louis VI of France. As the king\u2019s second son, Prince Louis was initially destined for a church career. However, after his elder brother, Philip, died in 1131, Louis became his father\u2019s new heir. Before Louis VI\u2019s death in 1137, the king had his son marry the wealthy heiress Eleanor of Aquitaine. Upon their marriage, the kingdom\u2019s territory extended south to the Pyrenees mountains.\n\nKing of France\n\nDuring his reign, Louis VII continued the policies of his father. Like Louis VI, the king improved his government by promoting competent men from the lower classes. Louis also focused on securing his current territory rather than expanding. To show his Christian devotion, the king strove to maintain a good relationship with the pope. When Pope Alexander III came into conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, the king offered the pope protection in France. Despite his support of the church, Louis didn\u2019t hesitate to disagree with the pope if he felt his royal authority was being challenged.\n\nAs king, Louis VII demonstrated traits associated with clergymen. Due to his upbringing, the king tended to be very pious and lived simply. As a result, Louis\u2019 piety caused friction in his marriage to Eleanor. The queen complained that she married a monk rather than a king. In contrast to her modest husband, the queen was vibrant and outgoing. Louis adored Eleanor, but she grew frustrated with their marriage.\n\nAlthough a successful administrator, Louis VII proved to be less adept in military affairs. In 1143, Louis decided to participate in a disastrous military campaign. In Vitry, French soldiers mercilessly killed the town\u2019s citizens. When the surviving citizens retreated to a local church, the king\u2019s soldiers ruthlessly burned the structure down. As a result of the massacre, Louis would be condemned throughout Europe.\n\nThe Second Crusade\n\nIn 1145, the pope announced the Second Crusade to the Holy Land. Plagued with guilt over Vitry, Louis VII of France sought redemption for the massacre. Upon learning of the crusade, the French king readily joined. During 1147, Louis and Eleanor departed France and journeyed to Jerusalem. As the couple traveled though, their relationship began to sour.\n\nBy the time Louis VII and Eleanor arrived in Antioch, a rumor arose that the queen had become romantically involved with her uncle. Although the rumor had little evidence to support it, the king became enraged upon hearing it. Afterward, Louis started to distrust Eleanor, and their relationship became more strained.\n\nEventually, Louis VII and Eleanor arrived in the Holy Land. Unfortunately for the king, his military efforts proved to be disastrous. Discouraged by his lack of success, Louis decided to abandon the crusade in 1148. Eleanor disagreed with the king\u2019s decision but left with Louis regardless. The stress of their journey, the king\u2019s military failures, and their lack of male heirs caused a breakdown in the couple\u2019s marriage.\n\nAnnulment\n\nAfter returning to France, Louis VII and Eleanor mutually sought an annulment. On March 21, 1152, the pope granted their request. As part of their separation, Eleanor regained her territory, while Louis gained custody of their two daughters. The former queen returned to Aquitaine as the most eligible woman in Europe. In response, many French nobles sought to marry her. However, Eleanor successfully avoided being captured on her way to Aquitaine.\n\nIn May 1152, Eleanor decided to marry Henry, Duke of Normandy. Despite requiring Louis VII\u2019s permission to re-marry, the couple ignored this and married in a small ceremony. Upon their marriage, Eleanor and Henry\u2019s territory joined together, forming a formidable union against Louis. However, the king was about to face a more significant threat to his kingdom.\n\nHenry II of England\n\nIn 1154, matters became even worse for Louis VII of France. After King Stephen\u2019s death, Henry inherited the English throne. As a result, the newly crowned Henry II now controlled both England and Western France. The joining of these vast territories formed the English Angevin Empire. Louis\u2019s kingdom had now become dwarfed by his French vassal\u2019s. This event sparked a bitter rivalry between both men that would continue with their descendants.\n\nAfter the formation of the Angevin Empire, Louis VII focused his efforts on undermining it. The king engaged in a series of skirmishes with Henry II from 1154 to 1174. During this period, Louis supported Henry\u2019s former friend, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As Thomas sought to protect the church\u2019s rights in England, he came into conflict with the English king. After angering Henry in 1164, Thomas fled to France for protection. From 1164-1170, Louis protected Thomas from the English king\u2019s wrath.\n\nIn 1173, Henry II\u2019s heir, Prince Henry, revolted against his father. Frustrated with the king\u2019s refusal to give him power, the prince sought to overthrow Henry. Since Prince Henry was married to his daughter, Louis VII offered his son-in-law aid. When King Henry overcame the revolt in 1174, the French king finally admitted defeat. In 1177, Louis and Henry signed a peace treaty.\n\nFinal Years\n\nDuring the last three years of his life, Louis VII focused on securing his kingdom for his heir. After the death of his second wife, the king had married again to Adele of Champagne. Finally, after fathering four daughters with his former wives, Louis had a son, Philip, in August 1165. When the prince became ill in August 1179, the king was worried.\n\nAs he had done throughout his reign, Louis VII turned to God. To save his only son\u2019s life, the king went on a pilgrimage to Thomas Becket\u2019s tomb. After praying for divine intervention, Prince Philip made a full recovery. However, the stressful experience had taken its toll on Louis\u2019 health. On September 18, 1180, the old king succumbed to a stroke.\n\nConclusion\n\nLouis VII of France experienced much misfortune during his reign. As king, he failed as a crusader, saw his first marriage crumble, and witnessed the rise of the powerful Angevin Empire. Despite his efforts, Louis proved incapable of riding France of English control. Although unable to best Henry II, Louis managed to secure his kingdom for his heir. After his death, Philip II completed his father\u2019s work and oversaw the downfall of the Angevin Empire in 1214.\n\nSources\n\nBradbury, J. (2010). The Capetians: Kings of France, 987-1328.

The second son of louis vi and Adelaide of Maurienne, Louis's education at the cathedral school in Paris prepared him for an ecclesiastical career; however, upon the death of his brother, Philip, in 1131, he became heir to the French throne to which he succeeded in 1137. Following their return from the Second Crusade (1147\u20131149), Louis procured an annulment for his marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine on the grounds of consanguinity. He then married Constance of Castile and later Adela of Champagne, who produced a long-awaited male heir, philip ii augustus, in 1165. In May 1152, Eleanor subsequently married the future henry ii of England (r. 1154\u20131189), whose possessions in France and powerful ambition became a source of rivalry and conflict for Louis. His contemporaries, including Odo de Deuil, Stephen of Paris, John of Salisbury, and Walter Map praised Louis VII for his piety and his favorable disposition toward the church. He undertook pilgrimages to santiago de compostela (1154\u201355), the Grande Chartreuse (1162\u201363), and to canterbury (1179). Because of a disputed papal election, Alexander III sought refuge in France in 1162, where he received Louis's welcome. Louis's protection of Thomas becket, who had fled to France in 1164 to escape the wrath of Henry II, received widespread approval. Louis asserted his rights over the French church, especially regarding episcopal elections in his realm and control over royal churches. To provide continual support for his royal policies, elections to royal bishoprics often went to members of the king's own household or to families loyal to Capetian interests. As a benefactor to the templars, Louis gave them the land for their commandery at Savigny, along with sizable rents and privileges. He also made generous grants to smaller monastic houses\n\nand created several small perpetual chapels. A patron of the cistercian order, Louis supported clairvaux through an annual gift, he founded La B\u00e9nisson-Dieu in the 1140s, and he established the major Cistercian abbey at Barbeaux, where he was interred in a magnificent tomb.\n\nBibliography: odo of deuil, De prefectione Ludovici VII in Orientem, ed. and tr. v. r. berry (New York 1948). r. fawtier, The Capetian Kings of France, tr. l. butler and r. j. adam (New York 1960). e. hallam, Capetian France (London 1980).\n\n[p. d. watkins]"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/french-history-biographies/louis-vii", "page_content": "Louis VII\n\nLouis VII (ca. 1120-1180) was king of France from 1137 to 1180. He strengthened the authority of the royal court, went on the Second Crusade, and repelled the aggressions of Henry II of England.\n\nSixth Capetian king of France, Louis VII succeeded his father, Louis VI, in 1137. Louis VII was a devout king with a passion for justice, but for many years one lacking in political good sense. By maintaining order in the royal domain and assuring justice, his court received on appeal many cases and earned respect for the Crown. Thanks to his trusted adviser, Suger, Abbot of St-Denis, the administration of the kingdom became more efficient and stronger and won increasing loyalty. Much of Louis's trouble arose from his marriage in 1137 to Eleanor, the heiress of unruly Aquitaine, which she brought to the King as her dowry.\n\nA year after the fall of Edessa in 1144, Pope Eugenius III asked the King to organize a new crusade. To overcome the widespread lack of enthusiasm, Louis invited Bernard of Clairvaux to preach the crusade, and the eloquent Cistercian awakened fervor for the project. Louis also won the support of the German Conrad III, who led a German army\u2014the first time the French and Germans had undertaken an enterprise in common. The Second Crusade failed before the walls of Damascus in 1148.\n\nDuring the crusade Queen Eleanor aroused the jealousy of Louis by her questionable conduct with her uncle, Raymond of Poitiers. Pope Eugenius III tried to repair the broken marriage on their return from the East and forbade its dissolution. After Eleanor gave birth to a second child, another girl, and after the death in 1151 of Suger, who had managed to save the marriage as long as he was alive, in March 1152 a council of bishops declared the marriage annulled for reasons of kinship. Less than 2 months later Eleanor married the Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, Henry Plantagenet, who thereby acquired Aquitaine. Louis thus found himself confronted by a shrewd and aggressive vassal who ruled western France from the English Channel to the Pyrenees. Two years later Henry became King Henry II of England.\n\nExperience and the events of 1151-1154 made Louis wiser. He limited his objectives to the possible, never risked serious losses in battle, and resorted to alliances and the support of the Church to strengthen his position against Henry II. Thanks to the rebellions of Henry's sons, egged on by their mother, Eleanor, against their father, and the great difficulty Henry had in controlling his unruly vassals, Louis was able to survive this seemingly one-sided contest and to maintain his authority and orderly government in his kingdom. Louis became partially paralyzed the year before he died and lived out his life as an invalid.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe best study of Louis is in French.

He defeated (1079) Duke William of Normandy (the Conqueror) and steadily supported Robert Curthose, William\u2019s son, against Anglo-Norman pressure. His reign was characterized by systematic expansion of the resources of his house and regular annexations to its domains in the face of stubborn feudal resistance. The growth of feudalism tended to diminish anarchy and to improve the general security of life, and ultimately led to decisive economic recovery in western Europe, a trend toward urban economy, and the emergence of a bourgeoisie that was beginning to accumulate capital. This development was a determining factor in the economic, social, and monarchical evolution of the 13th century. The Peace of God and the Truce of God. A period in which the Capetians reduced the great feudatories north of the Loire and began the transformation of the vague ecclesiastical, judicial, and military rights derived from Carolingian tradition into royal powers.\n\nLOUIS VI (the Fat)\n\nA brave soldier of tremendous physique, intelligent, affable; liked by the peasantry, commercial class, and clergy; the first popular Capetian. Consolidation of his Norman frontier (wars with Henry I of England: 1109\u201312; 1116\u201320), and steady reduction of his lesser vassals as far as the Loire. His charters to colonizers (h\u00f4tes) of waste lands, and frequent if inconsistent support of the communes, especially on the lands of the Church and the baronage, began the long alliance of the Capetians with bourgeois interests; Louis\u2019s charter of Lorris, widely copied in town charters, was a significant sign of the great urban development setting in all over Europe in this period. As protector of the Church, Louis gained a foothold in the lands of his vassals. Careers at court were opened to talented clergy and bourgeois. Louis\u2019s compromise with the Church over feudal patronage and investiture initiated the king of France\u2019s effective role as eldest son of the Church. He was the first Capetian to intervene effectively outside his own feudal lands. He defeated the alliance of Henry I of England with the Emperor Henry V, and stopped a German invasion (1124). The marriage (1137) of his son Louis to Eleanor, heiress of William X of Aquitaine (i.e., Guienne (Aquitania Secunda) and Gascony), marked the Capetian effort to balance the Anglo-Norman menace in the north with additions of territory south of the Loire. The Anglo-Norman danger had appeared in aggravated form when, in 1129, Geoffrey became count of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. He had married Matilda (daughter of Henry I of England) in 1128 and proceeded (1135) to conquer Normandy.\n\nDevelopment of royal administration under the early Capetians\n\nThe court of the king, usually known as the curia regis, consisting as it did of magnates, royal vassals, and court officials (mainly chosen from the baronage), was essentially feudal in spirit and tradition. Meeting on royal summons and relatively frequently, its early duties were undifferentiated, its functions judicial, advisory, legislative. The royal administration was in control of the great officers of the crown, whose aim was to concentrate power in their own hands, a process that culminated in a virtual monopoly of such power by the Garlande family early in the 12th century. Louis VI, after a struggle (1128\u201330), terminated their dominance, and thenceforth the Capetians relied increasingly on lesser and more docile nobles, clerics, and bourgeois men of affairs. These career men were devoted to the crown rather than to feudal ambitions, and their presence in the curia regis began the differentiation of its functions and its subjection to royal rather than feudal influences. Most notable of these careerists was Suger, Louis\u2019s old tutor, a cleric of peasant origin, who became abbot of St. Denis (1122). An able statesman, his influence was decisive in the reigns of Louis and his son Louis VII. Suger began (c. 1136) the new abbey church of St. Denis, the first edifice Gothic in design.\n\nRise of towns\n\nThe economic revival of western Europe was paralleled by a resumption of town life and development throughout the west, which was most notable in France, where the movement reached its apogee in the 12th century, before the consistent advance of the Capetian monarchy began to retard its progress. Types of town development were by no means uniform, but important general categories can be distinguished. The commune proper, a collective person endowed with legal rights and powers (e.g., financial, judicial), able to hold property. As a feudal person, the commune could have vassals, render and exact homage, establish courts for its tenants, and even declare war and make treaties. Symbols of its independence were the belfry, town hall, and seal. Typical communes of northern France and Flanders were the communes jur\u00e9es (e.g., Beauvais, St. Quentin (chartered before 1080), Rouen (chartered 1145), and Amiens (chartered in the 12th century)); in southern France the corresponding communes were called consulates, which enjoyed even greater rights than in the north, especially in Roussillon, Provence, Languedoc, Gascony, and Guienne. In the south the nobles took an active part in the formation of consulates and shared in their government. Villes de bourgeoisie (or communes surveill\u00e9es) had elements of communal powers in varying degrees, but lacked full political independence (i.e., they were privileged but unfree). They were found all over France, but especially in the center, and were the prevailing type in the royal domain. Citizens enjoyed specific privileges, but the crown retained judicial and other powers in varying degrees. Villes neuves (characteristic of the commercial north) and bastides (typical of the south, and usually strongholds) were small rural creations of kings or feudal lords, given a charter from the first that established their status. Peasant associations and village federations (influential in the north), which sought to define and guarantee the rights of their citizens. Governmentally, town development seems to have been hardly the result of conscious effort to introduce a new political dispensation. It was, rather, an attempt to establish and define the rights of nonfeudal groups, and aimed at economic prosperity and personal security. The movement constantly enjoyed royal support, but royal policy toward it was governed by immediate political or financial considerations, and the crown always strove to reduce or control town independence in the interest of its own power. Ultimately monarchy triumphed, but not before the bourgeois groups and the serfs had gained substantial advantages.\n\nLOUIS VII\n\nLOUIS VII (the Young). Pious and therefore popular with the clergy. He remained\n\nunder the influence of Suger until the latter\u2019s death in 1151. A papal interdict on the\n\nroyal lands, resulting from Louis\u2019s insistence on his feudal rights, led to intervention by\n\nBernard of Clairvaux. Louis inspired the Second Crusade (See 1147\u201349). He induced the German king, Conrad III, and Bernard of Clairvaux to join him, and, leaving the kingdom in the hands of Suger, he set out for the east. He returned (1149) beaten, humiliated, and estranged from his wife, Eleanor, who had accompanied him. The marriage was annulled (1152), probably due to lack of a male heir. This step cost the Capetians the territories of Poitou, Guienne, and Gascony, for Eleanor at once married Henry, duke of Normandy, who in 1151 had succeeded his father as count of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. The acquisition of Eleanor\u2019s domains made Henry master of more than half of France and put him in a position to bring pressure on the holdings of the king of France both from the north and the south. When Henry in 1154 became king of England, the so-called Angevin Empire\n\nextended roughly from the Tweed to the Pyrenees.\n\nRelated"}, {"url": "http://socialstudiesforkids.com/articles/worldhistory/france-kinglouisvii.htm", "page_content": "The French King Louis VII\n\nLouis VII was King of the Franks in the 12th Century. He is most well-known for leading the Second Crusade and for being the first husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nHe was born in 1120, the second child of the King of the Franks, Louis VI. The king's oldest child, Philip, died in 1131; by that time, however, Louis, as the second son, had embarked on a regimen of religious education and had, by age 11, become quite devout. He made the acquaintance of Abbot Suger, one of his father's advisors, and would count on Suger's counsel during his own reign a few years later.\n\nThe king crowned his oldest surviving son junior king in 1131; seven years later, when the king died, Louis the Younger became king in his own right. This happened just six days after the king-in-waiting married Eleanor of Aquitaine. Louis and Eleanor had two daughters together.\n\nThe latest King Louis inherited his father's struggles against Thibaud IV, count of Blois. King and vassal came to blows in 1142. Louis also was at odds with the papacy. He mended fences somewhat by leading one contingent of the Second Crusade, which aimed to punish Muslim armies for retaking Edessa. A lack of cooperation between the French force and that led by King Conrad III of Germany\u2013along with a lack of men, money, and weapons\u2013contributed heavily to the relative failure of that Crusade. Louis, distrusting of his wife, ordered her to accompany him on campaign to the Holy Land. Despite the failure of the Crusader armies, Louis stayed in the Holy Land, returning to France in 1149.\n\nLouis and Eleanor had disliked each other for some time. They had their marriage annulled in March 1152. Mere weeks later, Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, who two years later became England's King Henry II.\n\nThe English and French kings maintained an enmity for the rest of the latter's life. Louis successfully encouraged Henry's sons to rebel against him in 1173. The Great Revolt, as it was known, ended with peace talks in 1174. Louis had also given shelter to Thomas Becket during his dispute with Henry II.\n\nLouis married again, in 1154, to Constance of Castile. They together had two daughters. At the encouragement of Becket, who had previously been Henry II's chancellor and friend, Louis agreed to have his oldest daughter with Constance, Margaret, marry Henry's oldest son, Henry. Constance died in childbirth in 1160, and Louis married again, to Adela of Champagne, just five weeks later. This third wife finally gave the king a son, whom he named Philip and had crowned as king-in-waiting in 1179. By that time, Louis had suffered paralysis. He died a year later. His son became Philip II."}, {"url": "https://drjimsebt.com/2020/04/03/louis-vii-king-of-france/", "page_content": "For those who care about the triangle of Louis \u2013 Eleanor of Aquitaine \u2013 Henry of Anjou (later King Henry II of England), this post is for those readers. Yet Louis had to depend on the church to annul (divorce) his wife Eleanor.\n\nNicknamed Louis le jeune (the Younger) and born in 1120-21, he reigned from 1131 to his death in 1180, the sixth Capetian. He married and divorced Eleanor of Aquitaine, who then married King Henry II of England. That marriage affected French history for centuries.\n\nHere is a genealogical table from the encyclopedia Medieval France:\n\nAnd here is W. L. Warren\u2019s genealogical table from his excellent biography Henry II:\n\nHenry I is the same as Henri I. Robert the Pious is Robert II. It lays out the Capetians (left) and Normans (right), who transition to become the Angevins and then the Plantagenets. Henry of Anjou is the same as King Henry II of England, the first Plantagenet.\n\nRobert the Pious is Robert II. It lays out the Capetians (left) and Normans (right). Henry of Anjou is the same as Henry II, King of France, the first Plantagenet.\n\nThis is also from Warren\u2019s biography:\n\nSee below for the basics of his marriage and children.\n\nEarly Life and Personal Characteristics\n\nHe was born in about 1120-21. His eldest brother by Adelaide of Savoy and Maurienne was Philip, whom their father Louis VI associated (made joint- or junior-king) in 1129, when he was just thirteen. But Philip was killed in 1131 when his horse was spooked by boar in a Paris suburb. The horse rolled on his, and the boy was carried to a nearby house, but died in the night. He was buried at St. Denis.\n\nLouis\u2019s second son, Louis le Jeune or the Young, was destined for church service, but at eleven years young he was associated in kingship at Reims by Pope Innocent II on 25 Oct 1131. He was taken in a procession to the abbey of St. Remy and then to the Cathedral, and the pope consecrated him with the oil that was used to baptize Clovis.\n\nHow did young Louis transition to become Louis VII? When Louis VI thought he was dying, he said, \u201cI Louis who am a sinner believe in the one true God.\u201d Suger was tearful, and the king told him, \u201cDo not weep for me, my dearest friend; be glad that I have been able to prepare myself.\u201d He handed a ring to Prince Louis and made him promise to watch over the church and orphans, and guard the rights of his subjects, relying on God \u201cthrough whom kings reign.\u201d (Bradbury 148). Quite a word to receive from his royal father.\n\nHis father arranged his son\u2019s marriage to Duke William X\u2019s daughter and heiress Eleanor. She brought with her a large and rich duchy that would add to the king\u2019s small domain. Louis organized an escort for his son, including Abbot Suger, the genius architect and reliable administrator, Theobald of Blois (another rich county) and cousin Ralph of Vermandois (yet another rich county). The marriage was solemnized in the cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9 in Bordeaux in 1137. He was seventeen, and she was fifteen. Her father recently died, and his father recently fell ill again\u2014and died soon afterwards.\n\nThe Church\n\nOf course Louis supported the church: 177 charters were donations or concessions to the church; 275 charters confirm gifts by others. In 1031 there were 16 sees that were effectively royal, but under Louis VII, the number increased to 26.\n\nHe patronized buildings, including work on Notre Dame.\n\nHowever, he sometimes came into conflict with church leaders. One example: In a vacancy at Bourges, he favored his household official Cadurc, but the canons chose Peter de la Chatre, archbishop of Agen, but did not notify the king, and he refused to confirm their election. Innocent II intervened, and rejected Cadurc, which was simply not done. Louis reacted by shaking with anger and declaring that as long as he lived Peter would never be allowed to fill the post. The pope put an interdict on all royal residence. The pope and Bernard blamed the fight on hasty action by a young and rash king, a \u201cchild,\u201d wrote the pope.\n\nLouis\u2019s cousin Ralph of Vermandois was at court and fell for Eleanor\u2019s sister Petronilla. He was older and had lost his sight in one eye, but she consented to the match. Ralph was close to the king, but some in the church said Ralph and Eleanor were too closely related. The worse problem was that he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Odo III of Troyes and niece of Theobald of Blois. Nonetheless Ralph repudiated his wife, and he and Petronilla eloped. Certain bishops and Ralph\u2019s brother Simon, bishop of Noyon, declared the old marriage invalid on grounds of consanguinity. Theobald protested and Pope Innocent II sent a representative who condemned the repudiation. Ralph was ordered to leave Petronilla and take Eleanor back. The second marriage was declared illicit and Ralph was excommunicated. Only the deaths of the pope and Ralph\u2019s first wife resolved the situation.\n\nLouis decided to take his revenge on Theobald of Blois. He recognized the rights to wealthy territories to Hugh\u2019s son Odo, but Theobald claimed them for himself. Louis attacked Vitry, held by one of Theobald\u2019s vassals, and his men fired the church where 1300 people had taken shelter. The pope condemned the act, and when Louis realized what had happened, he burst out in tears and regretted their deaths. It may be here that he decided to go on the Second Crusade, as penance\u2014or maybe it was a pilgrimage.\n\nAt an assembly at Vezelay, Bernard (later proclaimed saint) preached the crusade to a crowd so huge that they had to meet outside the town. He ran out of prepared crosses, so he tore his own clothes to make more. Louis took the cross there on 31 Mar 1146. Then he went to a leper colony outside Paris, which he entered with only two men and stayed a long time.\n\nAfter prostrating himself before Pope Eugenius III and the altar of St. Denis, the pope gave him the pilgrim\u2019s scrip or wallet and the oriflamme, the standard of the abbey of St. Denis. Louis and Eleanor departed on that same day, 11 June 1147.\n\nThey decided to go overland, and the Turks harassed them, trapping and destroying part of the French army on 7 Jan 1148. The survivors crossed the mountains. In one skirmish the king had to climb a rock by grabbing tree roots to escape and fight off the attackers. He and his army went on, but had little hope of success.\n\nIn the principality of Antioch, Eleanor\u2019s uncle was there\u2014Raymond of Poitiers, younger brother of William X, Duke of Aquitaine. Raymond wanted to attack a Muslim leader, but Louis refused to let him. Raymond tried to get Louis to change his mind by talking to his wife Eleanor. Raymond and Eleanor had long conversations alone. John of Salisbury reported \u201cfamiliarity\u201d between the two. Louis was annoyed and decided to move on to Jerusalem, his main goal. Eleanor refused, which was not to be done in her day. Rumors about her and Raymond continued, and Louis carried her away at night.\n\nThey wanted to besiege Damascus, possibly a foolish plan since the city may have been an ally, but on the other hand it was easy picking for Muslims, and the French wanted to prevent this. The long and short of it was the most of the imperial and French leaders went home, while Louis stayed to visit the holy sites. Louis and Eleanor left, Eleanor in a separate ship, which was captured by the Byzantines, but she was rescued to the Sicilians. Louis arrived in Calabria on 29 July 1149, and Eleanor later in Palermo. They travelled through Italy, and Pope Eugenius persuaded them to share a large bed. They returned to France together, but it wouldn\u2019t last.\n\nTheir Marriage\n\nIn sixteen years of marriage Eleanor provided him with no son, just two daughters. He had to let Eleanor go, or so he believed. He did not realize that Henry Plantagenet would rise to the throne. In fact, he was crowned on 19 Dec 1154 when the divorce\u2014annulment\u2014happened on 21 Mar 1152. But couldn\u2019t Louis realize that Henry, a Plantagenet and Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy, grandson of Henry I, was an eligible bachelor? In any case, Eleanor had to bravely escape two forced, would-be marriages. She wrote young Henry a letter to rescue her. He did. They saw no reason to delay and got married at Poitiers on 18 May 1152. She gave him five sons (the first, William, lived only three years); Henry the Younger (joint-king, d. 1183); Geoffrey (d. 1186); King Richard the Lion-heart; and King John. And they had three daughters: Matilda or Maud, Eleanor, and Joan.\n\nSo Louis had to make the best of it. He played one son against the other sons. They often ran to Louis\u2019s court when their powerful father Henry did not do as they asked. Eleanor even encouraged their rebellion, especially her favorite Richard, who took over Aquitaine. At one time she even allied herself with Louis\u2014ironically. Eventually, Henry captured her and placed her under comfortable \u201ccastle arrest.\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nHere\u2019s is Bradbury\u2019s general overview of Louis VII and his spirit and piety:\n\nLouis VII on his seal of 1137 appears as a young man with hair to his shoulders. He was educated in the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. He was genuinely pious and organized the first royal crusade. Despite its military failure, he insisted on staying to see the Holy Places. During the crusade he never forgot mass or the hours, whtever the military conditions or the weather. His first wife famously declared that being wedded to him was like marriage to a monk. Later when ill at the siege of Nonette, Louis was offered a young girl to enter his bed and speed his recovery. He primly refused, \u201cif nothing else will cure me, let the Lord do his will by me, since it is better to die ill and chaste than live as an adulterer.\u201d He was unusual in his age for showing tolerance to the Jews, appointing a Praepositus Judaeorum [Provost of the Jews] to protect them. His reign saw a significant increase in the freeing of serfs, encouraged by the church and the king. In a charter [legal document granting special privileges] he declared \u201call men having a common origin were endowed from birth with a kind of natural liberty. It is given to our royal majesty to raise them anew to this liberty.\u201d He was a gentle and modest man, noted for his \u201ckindness and simple mildness.\u201d Walter Map described an occasion when Theobald of Blois found the king sleeping in the forest, guarded only by two knights. He scolded him for risking his life. Louis replied, \u201cI sleep alone and safe because no one envies me.\u201d Walter Map recorded Louis\u2019 comment on the wealth of England, remarking that \u201cwe in France have only bread, wine and the enjoyment of life.\u201d\n\nFamily Facts\n\nHe married (1) Eleanor of Aquitaine, daughter of the Duke William X of Aquitaine. They had two daughters Marie and Alix (Alice), but no son. He inherited the prosperous duchy of Aquitaine, but he had no resources to suppress the unruly lords there. So he calculated that he could divorce Eleanor, no great loss since his control over Aquitaine was slim. He needed a son. So Louis and Eleanor were divorced on 21 Mar 1152, on the (fake) grounds of consanguinity.\n\nHe married (2) Constance of Castile, daughter of Alphonse (Alphonso) VII, King of Castile and Leon. They had two daughters (1) Margaret (or Marguerite), who married Henry of England, the Young King and joint-King of England, Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Maine; and (2) Alix (Alice), who was born 4 Oct 1160. She married William Talvas III, Count of Ponthieu and Montreuil. Alice was living 18 July 1218. He died 6 Oct 1221. They had Marie of Ponthieu and Montreuil who married (1) Simon de Dammartin, Count of Dammartin and Aumale; and (2) Mathieu de Montmorcy, Constable of France. Constance died in childbirth with their second daughter on 4 Oct 1160.\n\nLouis married (3) Adele (Adela), a member of the powerful family, the Counts of Champagne and also of Blois, and Troyes. Adele gave him Philip (II Augustus). However, he got sick and was at death\u2019s door, but Louis pleaded and prayed to God, night and day. He even had a vision or some kind of encounter with the deceased Thomas Becket, who told him to visit his remains at Canterbury. Louis went to England, and King Henry welcomed him. He went to Canterbury Cathedral and offered his payers. Philip recovered.\n\nThe journey to England took a lot out of Louis. He suffered a stroke, and his right side was paralyzed. He was unable to speak. Philip\u2019s association as joint-king went ahead at Reims on 1 Nov 1179, but without his father. Philip assumed the reins of power, but he also needed guidance.\n\nLouis\u2019s widow Adele died at Paris 4 June 1204 and was buried in the Abbey of Pontigny (Yonne) in Burgundy.\n\nLouis died at Paris 18 (or 19) Sep 1180 and was buried in the Cistercian Abbey of Notre Dame de Barbeaux, near Fontainebleau.\n\nInscription:\n\nYou who survive him are successors to his dignity; You diminish his line if you diminish his renown.\n\nHis tomb was opened by Charles IX in 1566.

Royal authority was greatly strengthened by Louis VII\u2019s successor, Philip II (Augustus; reigned 1180\u20131223), who could claim descent from Charlemagne through his mother. Philip proved to be the ablest Capetian yet to reign. He was practical and clear-sighted in his political objectives; the extension of territorial power and the improvement of mechanisms with which to govern an expanded realm were his consistent policies. Perhaps it was not accidental that royal documents began to refer to the \u201cking of France\u201d (rex Franciae) instead of using the customary formula \u201cking of the Franks\u201d (rex Francorum) within a year or two of Philip\u2019s accession.\n\nPhilip Augustus\n\nPhilip\u2019s outstanding achievement was to wrest control from the Plantagenets of most of the domains they held in France. Intervening in struggles between Henry II of England and his sons, Philip won preliminary concessions in 1187 and 1189. He acquired strategic lands on the Norman borders following wars with Henry\u2019s sons, King Richard and King John (1196 and 1200). And, when in 1202 John failed to answer a summons to the vassalic court of his lord, Philip Augustus confiscated his fiefs. Normandy fell to the Capetian in 1204. Maine, Anjou, and Touraine fell rapidly (1204\u201306), leaving only Aquitaine and a few peripheral domains in the contested possession of England. By the Truce of Chinon (September 18, 1214), John recognized the conquests of Philip Augustus and renounced the suzerainty of Brittany, although the complete submission of Poitou and Saintonge was to take another generation.\n\nPhilip\u2019s other acquisitions of territory, if less spectacular, were no less important for consolidating the realm. In the north he pressed the royal authority to the border of Flanders. Artois, which came under his control as a dowry with his first wife, was fully secured in 1212. Vermandois and Valois (1213) and the counties of Beaumont-sur-Oise and Clermont-en-Beauvais were annexed during his last years. On the southern limits of the \u00cele-de-France Philip rounded out prior possessions in G\u00e2tinais and Berry. Much of Auvergne, whose suzerainty had been ceded by Henry II in 1189, passed to royal control in 1214, while in the more distant south Philip extended his influence by gaining lordship over Tournon, Cahors, Gourdon, and Montlaur in Vivarais. As the reign ended, only Brittany, Flanders, Champagne, Burgundy, and Toulouse, among principalities later annexed, lay outside the royal domain. At the end of Philip\u2019s reign, rising concern about the heretical stance of the Albigenses set the stage for the Albigensian Crusade and later conquest of southern lands.\n\nBecause the territorial expansion was accomplished through traditional means\u2014dynastic, feudal, and military\u2014the curial administration was, outwardly, little changed. Household officers such as the butler and the constable continued to function as in the past. But Philip Augustus was even more suspicious of the seneschalship and chancellorship than his father had been; he allowed both offices to fall vacant early in his reign, entrusting their operations to lesser nobles or to clerics of the entourage. Although their activity is obscure, some of these men were beginning to specialize in justice or finance. The curia as such, however, remained undifferentiated; characteristically, the committee of regents, appointed in 1190 to hold three courts yearly while the king was absent on Crusade, was expected to concern itself with both justice and the administration of the kingdom on those occasions. Prelates and nobles of the curia also served as counselors; enlarged councils convened, at the king\u2019s summons, on festivals or when major political or military issues were contemplated.\n\nPhilip Augustus acted vigorously to improve the efficiency of his lordship. He was, indeed, practically the founder of royal administration in France. His chancery began to keep better records of royal activities. Documents were copied into registers before being sent out, and lists of churches, vassals, and towns were drawn up to inform the king of his military and fiscal rights. These lists replaced others lost on the battlefield of Fr\u00e9teval (1194), a disaster that may have hastened the adoption of a new form of fiscal accountancy. One may draw this conclusion because it is unlikely that the Capetians had previously troubled to record the balances of revenues and expenses in the form first revealed by a record of the year 1202. Its central audit was connected with other efforts to improve control of the domains dominated directly by the king. From early in his reign Philip appointed members of his court to hold periodic local sessions, to collect extraordinary revenues, to lead military contingents, and to supervise the provosts. The new officers, called bailiffs (baillis), at first had no determined districts in which to serve (they resembled the circuit commissioners of Angevin government, whose office may have been the model for the Capetian institution). From the outset the bailiffs were paid salaries; they were more reliable than the provosts, who by the later 12th century generally farmed the revenues. In the newly acquired lands of the west and south, Philip and his successors instituted seneschals\u2014functionaries similar to the bailiffs but with recognized territorial jurisdiction from the start.\n\nPhilip Augustus\u2019s policy toward his conquered domains was shrewd. He retained the deep-rooted customs and administrative institutions of such flourishing provinces as Anjou and Normandy; indeed, the superior fiscal procedures of Normandy soon exercised perceptible influence on Capetian accounting elsewhere. On the other hand, to secure the loyal operation of provincial institutions, Philip appointed men of his own court, typically natives of the \u00cele-de-France. It was a compromise that was to work well for generations to come.\n\nThe character of Philip\u2019s rule may likewise be deduced from his relations with the main classes of the population. A devoted son of the church, if not unswervingly faithful, he favoured the higher clergy in many of their interests. He opposed the infidels, heretics, and blasphemers; he supported the bishops of Laon, Beauvais, Sens, and Le Puy (among others) in their disputes with townspeople; and he granted and confirmed charters to monasteries and churches. Yet he was more insistent on his rights over the clergy than his predecessors had been. He required professions of fidelity and military service from bishops and abbots, summoned prelates to his court, and sought to limit the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts. He supported papal policies or submitted to papal directives only to the extent that these were consistent with his temporal interests. Cases in point were his reserved support of Crusades and his notorious rejection of Queen Ingeborg, whom he married, abandoned, and then, in response to the pope\u2019s censure, feigned to reconcile.\n\nToward the lay aristocracy, Philip Augustus acted energetically as suzerain and protector. Indeed, no Capetian was more fully the \u201cfeudal monarch.\u201d His war with John resulted from John\u2019s refusal to appear at court as a vassal of the French king to answer for his mistreatment of the count of La Marche. He regarded Flanders and Toulouse as well as Normandy as fiefs held by the crown. As with ecclesiastical vassals, Philip insisted upon the service due from fiefs, and he required his vassals to reserve their fealty for him alone. He extended his influence by entering into treaties (pariages) with minor lords, often distant ones; and, by confirming the acts of nobles in unprecedented numbers, he recovered the force of the royal guarantee.\n\nThe policy toward the lesser rural and urban populations was to increase their loyalty and contribution to the crown without significantly reducing their dependence on the king and other lords. Philip offered his protection to exploited villages, and, especially during his early years, he confirmed existing \u201cnew towns,\u201d extended their privileges to other villages, and otherwise favoured peasant communities. Townsmen, notably those in semiautonomous communes, gained confirmation of their charters; and the king created some new communes. Most of the latter were located in strategic proximity to the northern frontiers of the expanded royal domain; this fact, together with the obligations of service and payment specified in the charters, suggests that military motives were paramount in these foundations. More generally evident in these charters, as in others, was the desire to gain the political fidelity of a prospering class.

That marriage was already shaky when Eleanor gave birth to a second daughter, Alix, in 1151, and the pair realized that they were not likely to have a son. Salic Law was interpreted to mean that a daughter or daughter's husband could not inherit the crown of France. Eleanor and Louis had their marriage annulled in 1152, Eleanor left first for Aquitaine and then married the heir to England's crown, Henry Fitzempress. Alix and Marie were left in France with their father and, later, stepmothers.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1160, when Louis married his third wife, Ad\u00e8le of Champagne, Louis betrothed his daughters Alix and Marie to brothers of his new wife. Marie and Henry, Count of Champagne, were married in 1164.\n\nHenry went to fight in the Holy Land, leaving Marie as his regent. While Henry was away, Marie's half-brother, Philip, succeeded their father as king, and seized the dower lands of his mother, Ad\u00e8le of Champagne, who was also Marie's sister-iin-law. Marie and others joined Ad\u00e8le in opposing Philip's action; by the time Henry returned from the Holy Land, Marie and Philip had settled their conflict.\n\nWidowhood\n\nWhen Henry died in 1181, Marie served as regent for their son, Henry II, until 1187. When Henry II went to the Holy Land to fight in a crusade, Marie again served as regent. Henry died in 1197, and Marie's younger son Theobold succeeded him. Marie entered a convent and died in 1198.\n\nCourts of Love\n\nMarie may have been a patron of Andr\u00e9 le Chapelain (Andreas Capellanus), author of one of the works on courtly love, as a chaplain who served Marie was named Andreas (and Chapelain or Capellanus means \"chaplain\"). In the book, he attributes judgments to Marie and to her mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, among others. Some sources accept the claim that the book, De Amore and known in English as The Art of Courtly Love, was written at the request of Marie. There is no solid historical evidence that Marie of France -- with or without her mother -- presided at courts of love in France, though some writers have made that claim.\n\nAlso known as: Marie Capet; Marie de France; Marie, Countess of Champagne\n\nBackground, Family:\n\nMother: Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nFather: Louis VII of France Stepmothers: Constance of Castile, then Ad\u00e8le of Champagne\n\nFull siblings: sister Alix, Countess of Blois; half siblings (father Louis VII): Marguerite of France, Alys of France, Philip II of France, Agnes of France.

He seems to have had little regard for his wives and in some ways, he reminds me of the oft-married King Henry VIII of England. In this article, we will take a look at his first wife, Isabelle of Hainault, the mother of Philip\u2019s successor, King Louis VIII.\n\nIsabelle was born in Valenciennes in April of 1170. She was the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainault and Marguerite I, Countess of Flanders. Little is known of Isabelle\u2019s early life and education. When she was one year old, her father agreed to her betrothal to Henry the future Count of Champagne. Henry was the nephew of Ad\u00e8le of Champagne, the Queen of France and mother of the future King Philip II. In 1179, both Isabelle\u2019s father and Henry\u2019s father swore an oath that the marriage would take place. But Baldwin later reneged on this oath.\n\nIsabelle\u2019s maternal uncle, Count Philippe of Alsace had great influence at the French court of Philip\u2019s father King Louis VII and arranged the marriage between her and Philip. Baldwin could truthfully claim to be a descendant of Charlemagne. Chroniclers at the time saw the marriage as a union of the Carolingian and Capetian dynasties. It was the hope of the Flanders relatives that having a family member who was Queen of France would give them influence at court. This did not make Queen Ad\u00e8le happy as it was seen as a rejection of her nephew Henry and signaled a decline in influence for her and her family. Isabelle\u2019s dowry included the county of Artois along with the cities of Arras, Bapaume and Saint-Omer. The transfer of Artois was dependent on Isabelle having an heir.\n\nThe ten year old Isabelle and fourteen year old Philip were married on April 28, 1180 at Bapaume with the ceremony being performed by the bishops of Senlis and Laon. There were very few French nobles in attendance despite the fact that a royal wedding should have been a state occasion. Then for some inexplicable reason, Philip insisted Isabelle\u2019s coronation on May 28 take place at Sens instead of Amiens, the traditional place for this ceremony.\n\nCanonical age for marriage at the time was fourteen for boys and twelve for girls. So Isabelle was not old enough for consummation of the marriage for another two years. Five months after the marriage, King Louis VII died and Philip became king. Isabelle\u2019s parents were stalwart backers of Philip\u2019s policies in Flanders at first. Isabelle was highly praised by the chroniclers and the marriage was peaceful until the political climate changed in 1183.\n\nBy that time, Philip was more than ready to have an heir. He had quarreled with Count Philippe of Alsace and was waging war against Flanders and was angry that Isabelle\u2019s father was supporting his enemies. Also, her uncle Philip was looking to marry Theresia, daughter of King Alfonso I of Portugal and to seal the deal, he promised her a widow\u2019s portion that included land in the dowry of Isabelle. King Philip was rightly incensed. In March of 1184, Philip convened a council at Sens to announce his intention to repudiate Isabelle. Although he refused to give his reasons for the separation, it was widely believed he wanted to break with Isabelle\u2019s Flemish relations at court.\n\nIsabelle wasn\u2019t going to allow this to happen. She dressed in the robes of a penitent beggar and walked barefoot through the streets of Sens appearing in the churches in an effort to gain the people\u2019s sympathy. She mobilized a huge crowd and they all made their way to the castle where the anger of the people was so loud, Philip couldn\u2019t fail to hear it. It was clear to him that Isabelle had the support of the people. This and the intercession of Philip\u2019s uncle Robert led him to drop the repudiation. The fact that he would have lost Artois along with his wife also may have been a factor in staying married to Isabelle.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what Isabelle\u2019s role was in Philip\u2019s life after this but she did maintain her title and honor as queen. She also gave birth at last to a son named Louis on September 5, 1187. Artois was now fully in Philip\u2019s possession. It was another three years before Isabelle became pregnant again and she experienced great difficulties. On March 14, 1190, she gave birth to twin boys but sadly she died a day later. The twins only lived for four days. Isabelle was buried in the Cathedral of Notre Dame and greatly mourned by the city of Paris as she had become a well-liked and admired queen. In 1858, her tomb was opened and her body exhumed and measured. She would have stood at 5\u20198\u201d to 5\u20199\u201d, extremely tall for the time.\n\nPhilip was deep into preparations for the Third Crusade along with Richard the Lionheart of England when Isabelle died. Despite her death, he did leave for the Holy Land where he quarreled with Richard and the crusade turned into a great disappointment. Philip returned to Paris on December 27, 1191 and soon began looking for another wife.\n\nFurther reading: \u201cParis 1200\u201d by John W.
