He became a lieutenant in 1791 and a captain in 1794. In 1798 he participated in an abortive British raid on Ostend (Belgium), was captured, and spent six months in a French prison. He won high praise from his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Brock*, for his role in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee (more properly Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1799. Two years later he rose to the rank of major in the 85th Foot, and in 1802 to lieutenant-colonel; however, he was then placed on half pay until June 1803 when he joined the Coldstream Foot Guards. On 25 July 1810 he became a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the king and on 4 June 1813 a major-general. He served as the assistant \u2013 and then from January 1812 as the deputy \u2013 adjutant general to Lord Wellington\u2019s army and commanded a brigade in several major battles of the Peninsular War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross with one clasp. He was given a kcb on 2 Jan. 1815 and knighted on 6 June. In 1814 he had been appointed adjutant general of the British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. From 1823 to 1830 he was without employment and spent much of his time wandering across Switzerland and Italy. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825 and that year, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl of Whitworth, he changed his family name to Whitworth-Aylmer. He was made colonel of the 56th Foot in 1827 and transferred to the 18th Foot five years later.\n\nAylmer\u2019s enforced idleness ended when Sir James Kempt* resigned the administration of Lower Canada. In June 1830 the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, who had also served with Wellington in the Peninsular War, offered the position to Aylmer. On 11 August Aylmer was appointed commander of the forces in North America, and on 13 October he landed at Quebec; he assumed control of the administration one week later. His commission as governor-in-chief was dated 24 Nov. 1830, but it was not formally registered at Quebec until 12 Feb. 1831. Aylmer had few obvious qualifications for his position; he had never served as a civil administrator, he had no political experience, and he came to Lower Canada, by his own admission, \u201ca perfect stranger to all that relates to the country.\u201d Yet Murray\u2019s choice was based on more than friendship. Aylmer was one of the more distinguished and capable officers of his rank, he was a francophile, and, as Louis-Joseph Papineau* noted, he spoke French \u201cwith the greatest ease and elegance.\u201d Although leaning to the conservative side in British politics, he was not a partisan, and the reformers in the Canadas, reassured by their contacts in Britain, received him as \u201can able and clever man conciliatory in his disposition, liberal in his principles, and cincerely [sic] anxious to do good.\u201d\n\nRecognizing his lack of knowledge, Aylmer none the less predicted that he would soon \u201cbe out of the Awkward Squad.\u201d He embarked on a series of tours which eventually took him to every part of Lower Canada, and he pronounced himself pleased with \u201cthe country, the people and the Climate.\u201d He and Lady Aylmer took their viceregal responsibilities seriously, contributing generously to a variety of causes, such as an emigrant fund, the Female Orphan Asylum, and the Quebec Driving Club (one of a number of organizations of which Lady Aylmer became patroness). They sought to foster the arts and culture, and attended many community activities, from ploughing matches to annual races in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res where Aylmer donated a silver cup to be awarded for a horse bred within the province. A wealthy man, Aylmer entertained frequently and lavishly at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Louis, the governor\u2019s residence; yet he avoided the error \u201cinto which most of our Governors have fallen . . . ,\u201d noted the Montreal reform newspaper, the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser, \u201cof attempting to impress on the minds of the \u2018natives\u2019 a something transatlantically superior pertaining to themselves.\u201d During a visit to the Indian reserve at Lac des Deux Montagnes he joined in the dancing when \u201cobliged\u201d to do so.\n\nAylmer wished particularly to convince French Canadians of his benevolence. Shortly after his arrival he donated money for a tablet over the spot \u201cwhere lay the remains of brave Montcalm [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm*].\u201d He disagreed vehemently with those who advocated a policy of assimilation, arguing that there were not British subjects \u201cmore loyal and true \u2013 than the People of Lower Canada\u201d and that assimilation would weaken their loyalty and drive them into the arms of the United States. He defended the seigneurial system and sought permission to grant seigneurial lands under crown control to French Canadians who could not afford to purchase on freehold tenure. He exhibited a genuine desire to distribute government patronage with the utmost impartiality, reintegrating militia officers whom a predecessor, Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay], had dismissed for opposition to the administration, increasing the number of French Canadians on the bench, ensuring a balance between francophones and anglophones on the commission of the peace, and making 8 of his first 14 appointees to the Legislative Council French Canadians. In 1831, to prove that he was \u201cfree of all party connections,\u201d he offered seats on the Executive Council to Patriote leaders Papineau and John Neilson. Although both refused, Aylmer successively appointed the francophone reform members of the House of Assembly Philippe Panet*, Dominique Mondelet*, and Hugues Heney. Undeniably, he did not go far enough; the Legislative and Executive councils and the high echelons of the civil service continued to be dominated by anglophones unsympathetic to the demands of the assembly. None the less, he went as far as, and at times farther than, his superiors in London wanted and, at least initially, he convinced Papineau that \u201che likes and desires the good of the province.\u201d\n\nThe legislature met for the first time under Aylmer in January 1831 when, labouring under \u201ca severe indisposition,\u201d he delivered his speech from the throne \u201cliterally from my bed.\u201d Throughout the session he worked diligently to remedy the grievances of the assembly, many of which, he admitted, were \u201cwell founded.\u201d He introduced economies in the civil service, presented nearly all the executive documents requested by the assembly, protested to the British government delays in examining reserved colonial legislation, refused to bend regulations for interested parties, demanded more rigorous standards in accounting for public funds, launched an investigation of abuses in the land-grant system, and induced the judges (with the exception of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell) not to attend the Legislative Council while the Colonial Office deliberated on a long-standing demand for their exclusion from that body. In proroguing the legislature in March, he enquired for \u201cany stray complaint\u201d which the assembly had neglected.\n\nAylmer\u2019s most controversial effort to appease came after the assembly petitioned for the dismissal of Attorney General James Stuart*, an outspoken opponent of the Patriote party, at the end of the session. Under pressure from the assembly, in September Aylmer suspended Stuart pending adjudication of its charges in Britain. Reprimanded by the Colonial Office for suspending Stuart before he was given the opportunity to defend himself in the assembly, Aylmer rightly pointed out that not to have acted would have provoked \u201cthe utmost degree of ferment and agitation.\u201d In November 1832 the Colonial Office dismissed Stuart, who unsuccessfully challenged Aylmer to a duel. He was hailed as a martyr by those among the British minority in the colony who believed that Aylmer \u201cdare not displease Mr. Citoyen Papineau by whom . . . he is held completely under cow.\u201d Aylmer\u2019s decision had enhanced his reputation with the reformers, however, and particularly with Papineau, who had earlier entertained the Aylmers at his country estate in June 1831. But though \u201con good (I may say cordial) terms\u201d with Papineau, Aylmer was aware that a great gulf existed between them on a number of questions.\n\nFor more than a decade the main preoccupation of the assembly had been to obtain control of the provincial revenues, including those reserved to the crown by the Quebec Revenue Act of 1774 [see Sir Francis Nathaniel Burton*]. Murray\u2019s Whig successor at the Colonial Office, Lord Goderich, instructed Aylmer to submit a pared-down list of estimates to the assembly and to request a permanent civil list preparatory to a surrender of the crown revenues. The assembly paid little attention to Goderich\u2019s estimates and none to his request for a civil list, although it did vote supplies for one year. Ignoring Aylmer\u2019s advice to the contrary and influenced by his parliamentary under-secretary, Lord Howick, Goderich introduced a bill into parliament in the summer of 1831 surrendering the crown revenues unconditionally, and in September he ordered Aylmer to reconvene the legislature and again request a comparatively modest civil list. The assembly, however, refused salaries to several officials on Goderich\u2019s list and, when Aylmer foolishly tried to coerce it by hinting that he would reserve any bill deviating from Goderich\u2019s intentions, it refused permanent salaries to any officials. It seems unlikely that Goderich\u2019s proposals, which were rejected by 42 to 9, would have been accepted by the assembly even had Aylmer been more astute, and the disappointed governor closed the session in late February 1832, acknowledging that his friendly relations with the leaders of the Patriote party had been sorely strained.\n\nIn 1832 deterioration of those relations accelerated after three French-speaking Canadians were shot by British troops on 21 May during a turbulent by-election in Montreal [see Daniel Tracey*]. Aylmer\u2019s sympathies lay with the soldiers, and although he wrote to Papineau regretting the deaths, he refused to intervene in the subsequent judicial process, even when Papineau requested a military inquiry. He encouraged Solicitor General Charles Richard Ogden* to bring the case before a grand jury but later publicly praised the jury\u2019s exoneration of the military. Thereafter Papineau pointedly declined to attend receptions at the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nThe anger of the Patriote party was fuelled by a cholera epidemic which in 1832 killed more than 7,000 people in the colony. Aylmer had prepared for the outbreak by persuading the legislature to establish a quarantine station at Grosse \u00cele and a board of health at Quebec and to authorize such facilities elsewhere when necessary. Although Aylmer conscientiously enforced the quarantine regulations and issued money to the boards of health and the Montreal Emigrant Society, the measures proved wholly inadequate. Moreover, by insisting that only the law officers of the crown should prosecute he hindered the work of the boards, and by encouraging flight to reduce the incidence of cholera in the cities he contributed to the spread of the disease. Yet, on balance, he did not deserve the censure of the assembly, which also criticized him for issuing funds without its approval and for failing to control the influx of immigrants. In fact, Aylmer did wish to limit immigration and proposed to raise money by a tax on immigrants. When the assembly met in November 1832, it was in an angry mood; it declared Mondelet\u2019s seat vacant on his appointment to the Executive Council, passed a supply bill making no provision for a civil list, which the Legislative Council felt compelled to reject, and adopted an address, similar to one it had itself rejected in the previous session, demanding an elective legislative council.\n\nTo Aylmer these actions demonstrated intransigence, and he requested authorization from London to use the unappropriated funds surrendered to the legislature by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act of 1831. Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, later Lord Stanley, who replaced Goderich at the Colonial Office in April 1833, sympathized but would not act until the assembly had been given an opportunity to reconsider. Consequently, when Aylmer reconvened the legislature in January 1834 he virtually invited a confrontation. He refused to grant the assembly contingency funds of \u00a37,000 and reserved 11 of the 12 bills passed by the legislature, disallowing the 12th. In return the assembly refused to vote supplies and passed 92 resolutions of grievance, including one demanding the governor\u2019s recall. Asserting that the resolutions were tantamount to a \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\u201d Aylmer sent to Stanley a draft bill restoring to the government control over the revenues surrendered to the assembly by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act. Stanley was prepared to rescind Goderich\u2019s act, and he referred the 92 resolutions to a select committee of the House of Commons, which he assumed would exonerate Aylmer. But Stanley was replaced in June 1834 by Thomas Spring-Rice, an easy-going Irish Whig, who was determined to avoid confrontation. Spring-Rice persuaded the Commons committee to attribute the conflict in Lower Canada simply to \u201cmutual misconceptions.\u201d After meeting with delegates from the assembly, he authorized Aylmer in September to borrow \u00a331,000 from the military chest for unpaid salaries, assuming (erroneously) that the assembly would agree to repay the loan. Aylmer was dismayed by Spring-Rice\u2019s actions and by the failure of the select committee to vindicate his conduct.\n\nIronically, Aylmer had led the Colonial Office to adopt a more conciliatory policy by insisting that the radicals in the assembly were losing support. During the sessions of 1833 and 1834 a rift had developed within the Patriote party, and Aylmer sought to exploit it, in particular by cultivating the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the policies of the radicals. Although a devout member of the Church of England, Aylmer was unusually tolerant in his religious views, wishing, for example, to alter the oath taken by justices of the peace so that he could appoint Jewish magistrates [see Aaron Ezekiel Hart*]. He attended mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral as well as in his own, refused to go to the services of a local Anglican priest who had protested Aylmer\u2019s giving pecuniary aid to the Catholic Church, offered the Ursulines of Quebec refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau when a fire broke out in their convent, recommended that the Roman Catholic bishop be appointed to the Executive Council, and discouraged the Colonial Office from interfering with the Sulpician estates. In addition to cultivating the church, Aylmer deliberately chose his nominees for government posts from among the more conservative and \u201crespectable\u201d members of the Patriote party.\n\nAylmer\u2019s appointments, however, had the effect of weakening the moderates in the assembly, since appointees lost their seats. In any case Aylmer was himself an inadequate instrument for multiplying vendus. Progressively disenchanted with what he considered to be the ignorance and ingratitude of French Canadians, he had begun by September 1832 to argue that \u201cBritish influence in Lower Canada . . . must ere long be paramount\u201d and that French Canadians must \u201cfinally reconcile themselves to a fate which cannot be averted.\u201d In October he warned Sir John Colborne*, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, that \u201cwhen the king\u2019s Subjects are spoken of as Foreigners and the Canadians as a Nation held in subjection by another Nation, it becomes the constituted Authorities to be upon their Guard.\u201d By the spring of 1834 he was convinced that so long as the assembly was composed largely of French Canadians \u201cthe Constitution of the Province . . . will never work beneficially.\u201d After the passage of the 92 Resolutions his primary concern was to reconcile the American-born population in the Eastern Townships and the rapidly growing Irish communities in Montreal and Quebec by appointing representatives from both groups to positions of importance. In June 1835 he strongly endorsed the application of \u201can association of gentlemen\u201d from the townships for permission to purchase a large quantity of land on terms similar to those given to the British American Land Company [see Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt*], despite vehement opposition from the assembly.\n\nGradually, in fact, Aylmer had come under the influence of the old official group. In April 1834 he appointed David Chisholme, one of Dalhousie\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, coroner of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. When John Fletcher was unable to accept a promotion on the bench suggested as recompense for \u201cthe persecution of the House of Assembly to which he has been exposed for a series of years,\u201d Aylmer recommended Samuel Gale*, who had acted as Dalhousie\u2019s agent in England in 1828 and served as counsel to the officers in command during the Montreal \u201cmassacre.\u201d This recommendation encountered strong opposition at the Colonial Office but was accepted under pressure from Aylmer on condition that the next vacancy would be given to a French Canadian.\n\nGale\u2019s appointment alienated many moderates on both sides. Aylmer added to his unpopularity by refusing money to Montreal during a second outbreak of cholera in 1834 and by retreating to the governor\u2019s cottage at William Henry (Sorel) during the height of the outbreak. Late that year the radicals won a sweeping victory at the polls, virtually eliminating the moderates from the assembly. Aylmer was not displeased with this result, arguing that it had \u201croused a feeling (hitherto dormant) in the British Population,\u201d which might, however, \u201clead to very serious results, unless prudently managed.\u201d He enthusiastically approved the formation of militant constitutional associations at Quebec and Montreal, and warned that the British minority were no longer prepared to accept domination by the assembly. He blamed the Patriote victory on \u201cthe Complacency with which the Canada Committee [of 1834] listened to sham Grievances\u201d and predicted that the new assembly would be less reasonable than its predecessor. When the assembly met in February 1835, he made his prediction reality by refusing to issue money for the assembly\u2019s contingencies. In return the house again refused supplies and complained that Aylmer was prejudiced against French Canadians. On 18 March Aylmer prorogued the legislature and called upon Britain to find a solution to the constitutional and financial impasse.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Colonial Office was to replace Aylmer. Spring-Rice had begun to search for a successor in the autumn of 1834 and had promised Aylmer another government if he would resign. But Aylmer wanted exoneration, and he suggested sending a parliamentary commission to examine the assembly\u2019s charges. In April 1835 a three-man commission was appointed, but its head, Lord Gosford [Acheson], would also become Aylmer\u2019s replacement. Aylmer bitterly resented his dismissal and was further antagonized when Gosford, who assumed control of the government on 24 Aug. 1835, dissociated himself from his predecessor. Aylmer\u2019s mood was not improved by a terrifying return voyage, described by Lady Aylmer in Narrative of the passage of the \u201cPique\u201d across the Atlantic (London, 1837). Once in England, he attempted without success to obtain approval of his conduct by refusing appointment as commander of the forces in Ireland unless he got it. However, he did coerce the government into awarding him a gcb, on 10 Sept. 1836, and on 23 Nov. 1841 he became a general, but he never obtained an English peerage, to which he felt entitled, or another administrative post. On 23 Feb. 1850 he died in his London home of an aneurysm of the heart.\n\nOn leaving the colony Aylmer had expressed regret that his \u201canxious endeavours to promote the general welfare of Lower Canada, should have fallen (as they have) so far short\u201d of his initial expectations and burst into tears when the small crowd which had gathered at the wharf cheered. In truth, Aylmer is a tragic figure. He was well meaning and as competent as most of the military men sent to govern British North America following the Napoleonic Wars. But Lower Canada required a governor with political skill, and as Aylmer had noted in October 1831, \u201cI cannot look for advice, or support here, beyond the circle of my own family composed of Soldiers like myself; & on . . . [the other] side of the Water I am totally destitute of Political Connexions.\u201d Largely unprepared, he had found himself \u201ccalled upon all at once to contend against those whose lives have been devoted to the Study of Law & Politics.\u201d The Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser declared that Aylmer had \u201cearned a niche in Canadian History, alongside of the Craigs [Sir James Henry Craig*] and Dalhousies, and gained for himself the execration of half-a-million people\u201d; the Whigs blamed him for the failure of their conciliatory policy; and historians sympathetic to them, such as Helen Taft Manning, have echoed this assessment. Yet, although Aylmer was guilty of serious errors of judgement, much of the criticism of him is unfair. Many of his blunders, as historian Fernand Ouellet notes, \u201cwere more or less provoked,\u201d and he never became as violently francophobic as Craig or Dalhousie, never lost his temper in public, never closed the doors of the Ch\u00e2teau to his opponents. He contributed to ethnic polarization in Lower Canada, but he was not responsible for it, nor could he, any more than Gosford, a civilian with considerable political experience, have prevented its development. Moreover, Aylmer was handicapped by the rapid changes of government in Britain during the early 1830s, serving under five secretaries whose views on Lower Canada differed sharply. Without \u201cPolitical Connexions\u201d in Britain, he was sacrificed to facilitate accommodation with the Lower Canadian assembly; the sacrifice, ironically, was in vain for by then the train of events leading to the rebellions of 1837\u201338 was probably irreversible.\n\nPhillip Buckner"}, {"url": "https://britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/rirwhitworthaylmer.htm", "page_content": "Matthew Aylmer was born in 1775 the eldest of 5 children of Henry Aylmer, 4th Lord Aylmer, and Catherine Whitworth.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of captain; and he appears to have served almost constantly, during the next ten years, on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean. In October 1688 he was appointed captain of the Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delavall who commanded the blue squadron; and in 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, was one of the seconds of the commander-in-chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral, and to that of vice-admiral in the following year, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean. After the peace of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as commander-in-chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers; which he happily accomplished, and returned home towards the end of the next year. In November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the commissioners of the navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in parliament as baron or member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured; the rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the \u200bhaziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711. He held no further command till the accession of George I, when he was again appointed commander-in-chief, ranger of Greenwich Park, and governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death; and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which, from small beginnings, has been gradually developed into the magnificent institution of the present day. In April 1717 he became one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was advanced to be rear-admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage as Lord Aylmer of Balrath.

His career continued as colonel in 1810, being aide-de-camp to the King between 1810 and 1812 and then major-general in 1813.

He was unable to pacify the growing demands in Lower Canada for responsible government and, in 1834, the radical Assembly of Lower Canada passed 92 resolutions of grievance including a demand that Aylmer be recalled. Lord Aylmer exacerbated ethnic tensions in Lower Canada by favouring the English over the French. The deterioration of the situation led to his recall in 1835. His administration may have been a contributing factor to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837.\n\nReturn to England\n\nReturning to England, Aylmer was promoted to the rank of general in 1845 but he never obtained a British peerage (his dignity was in the Irish peerage), or another administrative post.\n\nHe died at 15 Eaton Square, Belgravia on 23 February 1850, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.\n\nAylmer's sister Rose Aylmer was the inspiration behind the poem of that name by Walter Savage Landor.\n\nFamily\n\nLady Louisa Anne Aylmer Lady Louisa Anne Aylmer\n\nGeneral the Right Honourable Matthew Whitworth, 5th Lord Aylmer, G.C.B., married Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call, Bart. on 4 August 1801.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of Captain, and he appears to have served almost constantly during the next ten years on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn October 1688 he was appointed captain of HMS Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delaval who commanded the blue squadron. In 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, he was one of the seconds of the Commander-in-Chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of Rear Admiral, and to that of Vice Admiral in 1694, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean, and was also appointed a Lord of the Admiralty. After the Treaty of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as Commander-in-Chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers. He returned home towards the end of the following year.\n\nIn November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the Admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the Commissioners of the Navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in Parliament as Baron or Member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured. The rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the haziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711.\n\nHe held no further command till the Accession of George I, when he was again appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ranger of Greenwich Park, and the second Governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death, and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which gradually developed into a magnificent institution. In April 1717 he became one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was promoted to Rear Admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage of Ireland as Lord Aylmer of Balrath. He had been elected Whig M.P. for Portsmouth in 1695, and for Dover in 1697, 1713, and 1715.\n\nA portrait, half-length, presented by his descendant, the fifth Lord Aylmer, is in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca. 1650 \u2013 18 August 1720), of Covent Garden, Westminster, and Westcliffe, near Dover, was an Anglo-Irish Royal Navy officer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1720.\n\nAylmer was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690 and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War.\n\nAylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. However, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so a few months later. Following the accession of George I and the appointment of the Townshend Ministry, Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. He was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital: in this post he founded the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen.\n\nEarly career\n\nAylmer was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer of Balrath, county Meath, and Margaret Aylmer (n\u00e9e Plunkett), daughter of Matthew Plunkett, 5th Baron Louth. He served briefly in the Army as Ensign of foot in the Duke of Buckingham\u2019s regiment from 1672 and then joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in the galley HMS Charles in October 1677 before being promoted to lieutenant in April 1678. Promoted to commander on 19 January 1679, he became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Chatham and then transferred to the command of the prize ship HMS Date Tree in Summer 1679. He transferred again to the command of the fire ship HMS Castle in the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year, to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Swann on the Coast of Ireland in July 1680 and to the command of the fourth-rate HMS Tiger in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1682, before becoming commanding officer of the galley HMS Charles in September 1685. Aylmer was a young officer of the \u201ccourtier type\u201d who benefited from the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nPromoted to captain on 1 October 1688, Aylmer was given command of the fourth-rate HMS Swallow in the Thames; he was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support. Indeed, he was perhaps the chief of the cabal. Aylmer followed up the letter with a visit to the Prince's headquarters and arranged that Lieutenant George Byng and Captain Anthony Hastings should accompany him during the visit. The Prince's warm response to the captains ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Mary in December 1688 and was present at the French victory at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689 at an early stage of the Nine Years' War. His brother George Aylmer was killed during the battle.\n\nAylmer transferred again, this time to the command of the second-rate HMS Royal Katherine in Spring 1690 and was present at the French victory at Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690. He transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Monck in the North Sea in Summer 1691 and then took command of the first-rate HMS London in Spring 1692. As Second Captain to Admiral Edward Russell, he saw action again at the tactically indecisive Battle of Barfleur in May 1692. As a captain, Aylmer was quite deferential to his Spanish partners during the War. Samuel Pepys believed that Aylmer should have been hanged for his habit of dipping his colours to Spanish Admirals.\n\nSenior command\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 8 February 1693 and to vice admiral in June 1693, Aylmer hoisted his flag in the first-rate HMS Royal Sovereign and served under Admiral Edward Russell as second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet. He also became Whig Member of Parliament for Portsmouth at a by-election in 1695 but had to stand down when the House of Commons declared the by-election void in January 1696. Nevertheless, he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Dover in December 1697. The Treaty of Ryswick was signed in September 1697, bringing the Nine Years' War to an end and, after a delay in fitting out his squadron, Aylmer went out into the Mediterranean, with his flag in the second-rate HMS Boyne, to ensure the treaty was being observed in September 1698; he then retired from active service in October 1699. In around 1700 he acquired Wallett's Court Manor at Westcliffe in Kent as a property in which he would live in retirement. He also had a property at No. 12 Great Piazza in Covent Garden.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince George (Queen Anne's consort), which brought Russell back to the Admiralty, Aylmer was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. He lost his Dover seat at the 1710 British general election which produced a landslide victory for the Tory party in the wake of the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell which Aylmer had supported. In July 1710, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so in January 1711.\n\nFollowing the accession of George I in August 1714, which led to the appointment of the Townshend Ministry in September 1714, Russell was back at the Admiralty again and Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. Alymer was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital on the same date: in this post he started to fund education for the sons of seamen from entry charges to the Painted Hall, pensioners' fines and proceeds from the sale of stores. The same day he was also appointed Ranger of Greenwich Park.\n\nAlymer recovered his seat in Parliament at Dover at the 1715 British general election which saw the Whigs win an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. He went on to join the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Berkeley, as Senior Naval Lord, in April 1717. He resigned his appointments as a member of the Admiralty Board and as Commander-in-Chief in March 1718 and was rewarded by being appointed Rear-Admiral of Great Britain and also being created Lord Aylmer of Balrath in the Peerage of Ireland on 1 May 1718.\n\nAylmer died at Queen's House in Greenwich on 18 August 1720 and was buried at St Alfege's Church in Greenwich.\n\nFamily\n\nIn circa 1680 Aylmer married Sarah Ellis; they had a son and two daughters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Aylmer,_1st_Baron_Aylmer"}], "Matthew Aylmer served in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War.": [{"url": "https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/war-austrian", "page_content": "Outbreak\n\nIn December 1740, King Frederick II of Prussia invaded the Austrian province of Silesia.

Ranged against them were Austria, Britain, the United Provinces and Russia.\n\nBritain\u2019s European war aims were to prevent the French from overrunning the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium) and to protect its Hanoverian territory (King George II of Britain was also Elector of Hanover).\n\nThe British Army\u2019s establishment was rapidly increased, new regiments were raised and in 1742 a force of 16,000 men was sent to Flanders in support of the Austrians."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Austrian-Succession", "page_content": "War of the Austrian Succession, (1740\u201348), a conglomeration of related wars, two of which developed directly from the death of Charles VI, Holy Roman emperor and head of the Austrian branch of the house of Habsburg, on Oct. 20, 1740.\n\nIn the war for the Austrian succession itself, France unsuccessfully supported the dubious claims of Bavaria, Saxony, and Spain to parts of the Habsburg domain and supported the claim of Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria, to the imperial crown, all with the overall aim of crippling or destroying Austria, France\u2019s long-standing continental enemy.\n\nAnother pair of wars were the First Silesian War (1740\u201342) and the Second Silesian War (1744\u201345), in which Frederick II the Great of Prussia, allied with France, wrested the province of Silesia from Austria and held on to it. A third series of wars centred on the continued conflict between France and Britain over colonial possessions in India and North America (see Jenkins\u2019 Ear, War of; King George\u2019s War).\n\nWhat is known collectively as the War of the Austrian Succession began on Dec. 16, 1740, when Frederick II of Prussia invaded Silesia, one of the richest Habsburg provinces. His army defeated the Austrians at Mollwitz in April 1741 and overran Silesia. His victory enhanced the suspicion in Europe that the Habsburg dominions were incapable of defending themselves and thus ensured that the war would become general. Within a month France\u2019s Charles-Louis-Auguste Fouquet, comte (later marshal and duc) de Belle-Isle, constructed an alliance with Bavaria and Spain and, later, with Saxony and Prussia against Austria. The Austrian ruler Maria Theresa (daughter of Charles VI) derived her main foreign support from Britain, which feared that, if the French achieved hegemony in Europe, the British commercial and colonial empire would be untenable. Thus, the War of the Austrian Succession was, in part, one phase of the struggle between France and Britain that lasted from 1689 to 1815.\n\nThe invasion of Austria and Bohemia by the French and Bavarian forces fell apart for lack of unity of purpose and military capability. Austria temporarily neutralized Prussia by allowing it to retain Silesia in July 1742, drove the French and Bavarians out of Bohemia (1742), and overran Bavaria. Austria\u2019s allies\u2014the British, Hanoverians, and Hessians\u2014defeated the French at the Battle of Dettingen (June 27, 1743) in Bavaria. In September 1743 Savoy joined the Austrians, and the French withdrew toward their own borders. In January 1745 the emperor Charles VII (Charles Albert of Bavaria), who was also chief claimant to the Austrian succession, died. His son Maximilian III Joseph gave up these claims and pledged to support Francis Stephen at the imperial election in return for Austria\u2019s restoration of its conquests to Bavaria. Frederick now feared the growing Austrian power, and he reentered the war. This Second Silesian War was concluded by the Treaty of Dresden in December 1745. It confirmed Prussian possession of Silesia.\n\nThe last major French success was Marshal Maurice de Saxe\u2019s conquest of the Austrian Netherlands (1745\u201346), which followed his great victory at the Battle of Fontenoy on May 11, 1745. From 1746 to 1748 the war dragged on indecisively. The British had withdrawn their army to England to oppose the French-supported efforts of the young pretender, Charles Edward, to win the thrones of Scotland and England for the Stuarts. The financial burden finally pushed the powers to the conference table. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (see Aix-la-Chapelle, Treaty of) in October 1748 preserved the bulk of the Austrian inheritance for Maria Theresa. Prussia remained in possession of Silesia, however, and none of the colonial or other conflicts between France and Britain was resolved."}, {"url": "https://www.thehistorycorner.org/articles-by-the-team/the-seven-years-war-the-first-world-war-and-its-consequences", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis geographical situation put Prussia in an awkward situation for the entire war. As soon as Prussia would neutralize one threat, a new threat from a new direction. In particular, Austria and Russia threatened Prussia on a constant basis. Throughout the war, Prussia was outnumbered in almost every battle. This did not stop the brilliant tactician Frederick the Great from outmaneuvering and defeating Austrian and Russian armies that were much larger. Prussia started off successfully seizing Saxony. However, the sheer numerical that Prussia had taken its toll and by 1759 Prussia was in dire straits. Prussia continued to be battered by their European enemies and Prussia began losing territory. In fact, Prussia saw their capital Berlin fall into enemy hands twice. Over in North America, France started the war strongly seizing two British forts. Part of France\u2019s success was due to their allyship with the Iroquois confederation and other Native Americans. France\u2019s luck would soon run out as William Pitt took over control of British actions in North America. Pitt organized a naval blockade of North America which severely weakened France\u2019s fighting ability. A decisive moment came when the British defeated the French at the Battle of Quebec. This battle marked how France had quickly lost control of the situation in North America. In India, the French allied themselves with the ruling Mughal empire. These two nations allied to prevent encroachment from the British and their trading companies. The battle of Plassey saw France lose a key ally in India and the capital of French influence in India fell to the British. The French and British naval fleets fought battles off the coast of West Africa. By 1762 Prussia seemed to be at the end of its rope. Prussia\u2019s territory was gradually enveloped by Austria and Russia. A Russian army was closing in on Brandenburg and the war seemed almost over. But then suddenly a miracle happened. The empress of Russia, Elizabeth died and was succeeded by Peter III. Peter, a life-long admirer of Prussia, could not bear to destroy the country he had a fondness for. Peter pulled Russia out of the territory they took from Prussia and negotiated a favorable treaty. Peter even sent a Russian army to fight for the Prussians. This allowed Frederick to focus his full attention on Austria. Prussia reconquered Saxony and pushed the Austrians back. At this time the powers of Europe realized the war was right back where it started. It was time for the Seven Years War to end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nEurope\n\nA truce was soon negotiated and the status quo before the war became the new political situation. Prussia ceded Saxony maintained control over Silesia and established itself as a European power.\n\nNorth America\n\nFrance ceded all of its North American territory east of the Mississippi river including Canada to Great Britain Britain.\n\nIndia\n\nFrance lost all control of India and the British now had considerable influence in India. India would become a British colony in 1858 and that groundwork was laid at the end of the Seven Years War.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Term Effects\n\nEurope\n\nThe Seven Years War did not see a significant increase in territory change but had long-lasting effects that contributed to the future world order.\n\nPrussia\n\nPrussia was an upstart power in Europe and the Old Guard of European nations sought to push Prussia back into obscurity and not a sovereign nation. Despite being considerably outnumbered and out-funded, Prussia staved off its enemies and confirmed its status as a power in Europe. This was due to the keen leadership of Frederick the Great and when later leaders had to rule Prussia, Prussia would fade and decline.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria had the most to gain from a defeat of Prussia and since the Seven Years War cemented Prussia as a European power, Austria suffered. Austria did not lose any territory but they failed to neutralize the threat of Prussia. Prussia\u2019s gain was Austria\u2019s loss. Austria lost influence in the German states and the declining Holy Roman Empire. However, Austria was able to maintain the influence of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria did reconquer Saxony from Prussia albeit in a weakened form.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia established itself as a first-rate power and a force to be reckoned within Europe. Previously Russia was regarded as a weaker nation on the edge of Europe. During the war, the Russians consistently troubled the Prussians beating them many times. The only reason why Russia could not prevail was their poor supply chains and organizations. Russia\u2019s military performance caught the eye of many European countries and caused an increase in status. Russia\u2019s abrupt 180 during the war under Peter III led to the rise of Catherine the Great. Peter\u2019s policy towards Prussia prompted talks in Russia that Peter was weak and ineffective. The aristocrats and Peter's wife, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, plotted to overthrow Peter and install Sophie as empress. Peter was arrested, forced to abdicate, and later died of a stroke although some claim he was assassinated. Sophie took the name of Catherine and became one of Russia\u2019s greatest leaders.\n\nFrance\n\nFrance saw a blow in status after the war. The French fought on three different continents, lost in two of them, and achieved one stalemate. France lost all of its territory in North America and any influence they had in India. Ever since the two countries existed, Great Britain and France fought each other for supremacy in Europe and the world. The Seven Years War was a significant step in confirming that Great Britain would win the eternal struggle. These results and developments prompted a military reform of France so when another conflict broke out, France refused to make the same mistakes again. It was this military reform that formed the basis of the formidable French military that controlled vast parts of Europe during the Napoleonic war. However, the end of the war prompted some degree of unrest that would lead to the French Revolution. The war was costly to France and new taxes had to be instituted. France\u2019s shaky financial situations was a significant cause of the French Revolution and that monetary unease began as a result of the Seven Years War\n\nGreat Britain\n\nThe nation most directly impacted by the Seven Years War was interestingly enough the nations who did not do any fighting in Europe. Great Britain only funded Prussia and did not provide troops. Great Britain fought around the world battling France. Great Britain took control of France\u2019s territory in North America. Britain was the undisputed dominant power in North America. As mentioned earlier, France lost influence in the European pecking order since they lost to Great Britain on two continents. At this time there were only three countries with significant colonial empires which are empires composed of colonies. Spain, Great Britain, and France. While France and Great Britain were heavyweights in Europe, Spain was not. As a result, Spain was not a realistic candidate for the most powerful nation on earth. France and Great Britain were the two nations who sought to be that dominant power. The Seven Years War resolved this endless struggle in favor of the British. Great Britain controlled half of North America, had considerable influence in India, and was the most powerful nation in Europe and the wealthiest due to its mercantilist economic policy. The Seven Years War ensured that until WWII Great Britain would be the most powerful nation on Earth and that the British would influence and change the world more than any other nation in human history. Great Britain was able to do this thanks to France\u2019s weakened status after the Seven Years War. The Seven Years War paved the way for British economic political and cultural dominance that defined human history in the 19th century However, the Seven Years War was not necessarily a positive event for Great Britain. The government went into huge amounts of debt trying to fund their armies on several continents. Britain did control of Canada and Eastern North America, but these new territories did not contain valuable resources or a vast population. As a result of the war, the British government tottered towards bankruptcy. To try and pump funds into the government, the British imposed new and higher taxes on their subjects in the thirteen colonies. These taxes enraged the colonists as they felt they had no say on whether these taxes should be implemented. Taxes that became infamous in the thirteen colonies such as the Stamp Act, the Tea Act and the Townsend Act all came as a result of British efforts to pay off their debts from the Seven Years War. These taxes provided the spark that would lead to the shot heard around the world: the American Revolution. The Seven Years War led to the American revolution.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Seven Years war was a conflict that involved the powers of Europe and started over three things: Unresolved problems from the war of Austrian Succession, the diplomatic revolution of 1756, and Prussia\u2019s sudden conquest of Saxony. The war involved European power, but fighting took place on every continent except for Australia and Antarctica. The war was truly the first world war. The Seven Years War had enormous consequences on history. The Seven Years War led to the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and British global dominance. The Seven Years War was one of the most influential conflicts in human history and its consequences led to the world we live in today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Aylmer,_Matthew", "page_content": "\u200bAYLMER, MATTHEW, Lord Aylmer (d. 1720), admiral and commander-in-chief, was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer of Balrath, county Meath, and entered the navy under the protection of the Duke of Buckingham, as a lieutenant, in 1678. Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of captain; and he appears to have served almost constantly, during the next ten years, on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean. In October 1688 he was appointed captain of the Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delavall who commanded the blue squadron; and in 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, was one of the seconds of the commander-in-chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral, and to that of vice-admiral in the following year, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean. After the peace of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as commander-in-chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers; which he happily accomplished, and returned home towards the end of the next year. In November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the commissioners of the navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in parliament as baron or member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured; the rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the \u200bhaziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711. He held no further command till the accession of George I, when he was again appointed commander-in-chief, ranger of Greenwich Park, and governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death; and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which, from small beginnings, has been gradually developed into the magnificent institution of the present day. In April 1717 he became one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was advanced to be rear-admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage as Lord Aylmer of Balrath. He died 18 Aug. 1720.\n\nA portrait, half-length, presented by his descendant, the fifth Lord Aylmer, is in the Painted Hall at Greenwich.\n\n[Charnock's Biog. Nav. ii. 35; Brit. Mus. MSS.

The conflict was not restricted to Europe, but also spilled into their colonial holdings in Asia.\n\nThe war established Prussia as a regional hegemon for years to come, altering the very balance of power in Europe. In India, the rivalry between Britain and France in the Austrian War of Succession resulted in the First Carnatic War.\n\nThis article will give further details about the War of the Austrian Succession within the context of the UPSC Exams.\n\nWhat was the reason behind the War of the Austrian Succession?\n\nThe pretext for the war came when a succession crisis happened upon the death of the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI in 1740. To understand how this crisis happened, one must keep in mind the following events:\n\nIn 1703, a Mutual Pact of Succession was agreed upon. It stated that should the male line of the Habsburgs become extinct, the female line would take precedence.\n\nIn this case, the female line referred to the heirs of the elder brother of Charles VI, Emperor Joseph I.\n\nBut the Salic law excluded women of the royal family from inheriting the throne. But if the various Habsburk territories and the Imperial Diet granted approval, then exceptions would be made.\n\nEmperor Joseph\u2019s death in 1711 left two potential female heirs, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia. But in April 1713, the Pragmatic Sanction was issued by Charles, which allowed female inheritance by the progeny of Charles VI.\n\nThis sanction effectively ignored the 1703 agreement and created a potential for conflict because it placed the children of Charles VI ahead of his nieces. The birth of his daughter Maria Theresa in 1717 ensured that conflict was on the horizon.\n\n*Fact About Holy Roman Empire: Founded in 800 AD, the \u2018Holy Roman Empire\u2019 was a misleading name for Europe\u2019s largest collective of kingdoms and fiefdoms. It was not \u2018Holy\u2019 as it had disputes with the Pope in Rome from time to time. In those times, such acts of intransigence were looked down upon by other European kingdoms. It was not \u2018Roman\u2019 as it was Byzantine Empire that continued the legacy of the Romans. At its core, the Holy Roman Empire was Germanic. It was not an Empire, as it consisted of a collection of kingdoms and fiefdoms.\n\nCharles required his nieces to renounce their claim to the imperial throne in favour of their cousin Maria Theresa in 1719 by marrying Frederick Augustus of Saxony and Charles Albert of Bavaria. He believed that it would secure his daughters\u2019 position, as Saxony and Bavaria \u2013 bitter rivals themselves \u2013 could not tolerate either gaining control of the Habsburg inheritance. Instead, he provided a legitimate claim on Habsburg territories.\n\nA family issue became a European one due to tensions within the Holy Roman Empire, caused by dramatic increases in the size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, mirrored by the post-1683 expansion of Habsburg power into lands previously held by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSince theoretically, the Holy Roman Emperor has always been a Habsburg since 1437, Bavaria and Saxony could both lay a claim on the throne. Soon other European powers like France began backing the claims of Charles Albert of Bavaria despite it accepting the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735\n\nCompounded by the failure to prepare Maria Theresa for her new role, many European statesmen were sceptical Austria could survive the contest that would follow Charles\u2019 death, which finally occurred in October 1740. In a matter of months, Europe was on a collision course for a prolonged War.\n\nCourse of the Austrian War of Succession\n\nThe war began on December 16, 1740, when Frederick II of Prussia invaded Silesia, one of the richest Habsburg provinces. His army defeated the Austrians at Mollwitz in April 1741 and overran Silesia.\n\nHis victory enhanced the suspicion in Europe that the Habsburg dominions were incapable of defending themselves, and thus ensured that the war would become general. Within a month, France\u2019s Charles-Louis-Auguste Fouquet, comte (later marshal and duc) de Belle-Isle, constructed an alliance with Bavaria and Spain and, later, with Saxony and Prussia against Austria.\n\nMaria Theresa derived her main foreign support from the British Empire, which feared that, if the French achieved hegemony in Europe, the British commercial and colonial empire would be untenable. Thus, the War of the Austrian Succession was, in part, one phase of the struggle between France and Britain that lasted from 1689 to 1815. As a consequence, the British would clash against their French counterparts in India during the Battle of Madras in 1746. It would end in a French victory.\n\nThe invasion of Austria and Bohemia by the French and Bavarian forces fell apart for lack of unity of purpose and military capability. Austria temporarily neutralized Prussia by allowing it to retain Silesia in July 1742, drove the French and Bavarians out of Bohemia (1742), and overran Bavaria. Austria\u2019s allies\u2014the British, Hanoverians, and Hessians\u2014defeated the French at the Battle of Dettingen (June 27, 1743) in Bavaria.\n\nThis Second Silesian War was concluded by the Treaty of Dresden in December 1745. It confirmed Prussian possession of Silesia.\n\nThe last major French success was Marshal Maurice de Saxe\u2019s conquest of the Austrian Netherlands (1745\u201346), which followed his great victory at the Battle of Fontenoy on May 11, 1745. From 1746 to 1748 the war dragged on indecisively.\n\nThe British had withdrawn their army to England to oppose the French-supported efforts of the young pretender, Charles Edward, to win the thrones of Scotland and England for the Stuarts. The financial burden finally pushed the powers to the conference table.\n\nEnd of the War of the Austrian Succession\n\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) by which Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary. The treaty reflected that stalemate since most of the commercial issues that had led to the war were left unresolved, and many of the signatories were unhappy with the terms. Although the war had nearly bankrupted the state, Louis XV of France withdrew from the Low Countries for minimal benefit, to the dismay of France\u2019s nobility and populace.\n\nThe Spanish considered their gains in Italy inadequate since they had failed to recover Menorca or Gibraltar and viewed the reassertion of British commercial rights in the Americas as an insult.\n\nAlthough Maria Theresa was acknowledged as her father\u2019s heir, she did not consider that a concession and deeply resented Britain\u2019s role in forcing her to cede Silesia to Prussia. For British statesmen, the war demonstrated the vulnerability of George II\u2019s German possession of Hanover to Prussia, and many politicians considered they had received little benefit from the enormous subsidies paid to Austria.\n\nThe result was the realignment known as the Diplomatic Revolution in which Austria aligned itself with France, which marked the end of their centuries-old enmity, and Prussia became an ally of Britain. The new alliances would fight the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years\u2019 War.\n\nWar of the Austrian Succession-Download PDF Here\n\nFind out the details regarding the UPSC Syllabus by visiting the linked article.

War of Austrian Succession A war (1740\u20131748) that involved most of the powers of Europe over the question of Maria Theresa\u2019s succession to the realms of the House of Habsburg. The war included King George\u2019s War in North America, the War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear (which formally began in October 1739), the First Carnatic War in India, the Jacobite rising of 1745 in Scotland, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.\n\nThe Diplomatic Revolution\n\nIn the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), Frederick the Great of Prussia seized the prosperous province of Silesia from Austria. Maria Theresa of Austria signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances. The War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerence align on a time-honored basis. France\u2019s traditional enemies, Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced. Prussia, the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, came to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747 and the maintenance of the Anglo-Austrian alignment after 1748 was deemed essential by some British politicians.\n\nThe collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the \u201cdiplomatic revolution\u201d or the \u201creversal of alliances.\u201d This change in European alliances was a prelude to the Seven Years\u2019 War.\n\nBackground\n\nThe diplomatic change was triggered by a separation of interests between Austria, Britain, and France. The 1748 Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, after the War of the Austrian Succession, left Austria aware of the high price it paid for having Britain as an ally. Maria Theresa of Austria defended her claim to the Habsburg throne and had her husband, Francis Stephen, crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1745. However, she had been forced to relinquish valuable territories in the process. Under British diplomatic pressure, Maria Theresa ceded Parma to Spain and, more importantly, the valuable state of Silesia to Prussia. The acquisition of Silesia further advanced Prussia as a great European power, which now posed an increasing threat to Austria\u2019s German lands and to Central Europe as a whole. The growth of Prussia, dangerous to Austria, was welcomed by the British, who saw it as a means of balancing French power.\n\nBritish-Prussian Alliance vs. Austrian-French Alliance\n\nThe results of the War of Austrian Succession made it clear that Britain no longer viewed Austria as powerful enough to check French power but was content to build up other states like Prussia. Therefore Britain and Prussia, in the Westminster Convention of 1756, agreed that Britain would not aid Austria in a renewed conflict for Silesia if Prussia agreed to protect Hanover (which remained in personal union with Britain) from France. Britain felt that with Prussia\u2019s growing strength, it would be more apt to defend Hanover than Austria. Meanwhile, Austria was determined to reclaim Silesia, so the two allies found themselves with conflicting interests. Maria Theresa, recognizing the futility of renewed alliance with Britain, knew that without a powerful ally (such as France), she could never hope to reclaim Silesia from Frederick the Great.\n\nMaria Theresa sent her foreign policy minister, Count Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz, to France to secure an alliance to enable Austria to reclaim Silesia. Louis XV proved reluctant to agree to any treaty presented by Kaunitz. Only with renewed aggression between France and Britain was Louis convinced to align with Austria. Furthermore, Austria no longer surrounded France, so France no longer saw Austria as an immediate threat. Consequently, it entered into a defensive alliance with Austria. In response to the Westminster Convention, Louis XV\u2019s ministers and Kaunitz concluded the First Treaty of Versailles (1756). Both sides agreed to remain neutral and provide 24,000 troops if either got into conflict with a third party.\n\nMaria Theresa\u2019s diplomats, after securing French neutrality, actively began to establish an anti-Prussian coalition. Austria\u2019s actions alerted Frederick, who decided to strike first by invading Saxony, commencing the Seven Years\u2019 War (1756\u20131763). Frederick\u2019s actions were meant to scare Russia out of supporting Austria (the two countries had previously entered into a defensive alliance in 1746). However, by invading Saxony, Frederick had inflamed his enemies. Russia, under the direction of Empress Elizabeth, sent an additional 80,000 troops to Austria. A year after the signing of the First Treaty of Versailles, France and Austria signed a new offensive alliance, the Second Treaty of Versailles (1757).\n\nIn 1758, the Anglo-Prussian Convention between Great Britain and the Kingdom of Prussia formalized the alliance between the two powers. However, the alliance proved to be short-lived largely because Britain withdrew financial and military support for Prussia in 1762. The dissolution of the alliance and the pre-eminent rise of Britain left it with no allies by the time the American Revolutionary War broke out.\n\nAttributions"}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-war-of-austrian-succession-summary-and-effects-on-the-world.html", "page_content": "Video Transcript\n\nWar of the Austrian Succession\n\nSometimes people can be selfish; sometimes they'll keep a treat all to themselves or even take the last piece of pizza when no one's looking. Countries, too, can be selfish and act in their own self-interests even when supposedly having allies. The War of the Austrian Succession, which took place from 1740 to 1748, is a perfect example of this. Although the original conflict was over who would take the Austrian throne, the fight that ensued involved most of the European powers of the mid-18th century who all fought for their own, personal interests.\n\nBackground\n\nThe whole reason the Austrian throne was contested in the first place was the interests of Austria's neighbors. The previous Hapsburg King of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI, had sought to secure the line of succession for his daughter, Maria Theresa, in case he had no surviving male heirs. Many of the major European states agreed to recognize Maria Theresa as Queen of Austria and sovereign of all Hapsburg territories, but reneged on their deal as soon as Maria Theresa succeeded to the throne in 1740. France, Spain, and several German states denied the ability of accession through the female line, and instead claimed Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria, to have the strongest claims to the Austrian throne.\n\nThere was very little chance of anyone ever actually recognizing Charles Albert's claims. These claims were made largely to make trouble for Austria, since her enemies had sensed a weakness in the Austrian monarchy. In turn, Prussia and France made a secret alliance that aimed to exploit the situation and invade and claim Austrian possessions in central Europe for themselves. Fortunately for Austria, after France formally declared war on Austria in 1744, it gained de facto allies in Great Britain and Holland, who were already at war with France.\n\nWar in Europe\n\nThe war began in December of 1740, when Frederick II of Prussia (known to history as Frederick the Great) invaded the neighboring Hapsburg-controlled province of Silesia. Maria Theresa was ill-prepared to fight a war because her father had left the Austrian throne in debt and without a strong, well-equipped military. As a result, Frederick was able to quickly overrun the country. By 1742, Maria Theresa was forced to formally recognize Prussian possession of Silesia in June at Breslau.\n\nWhile Maria Theresa spent time recouping for a renewed fight for Silesia, fighting between Great Britain, Holland, Spain, France, and their allied German states continued on the continent. In June of 1743, for example, an outnumbered British force led by King George II himself scored a huge victory over the French at Dettingen in Bavaria.\n\nBy 1744, Maria Theresa was ready to renew the fight for Silesia, and Austria's invasion of Silesia caused France to formally declare war on Austria. The Austrian and Prussian forces maneuvered around each other. Fighting between the two sides would be fierce, often with Frederick II himself leading his own forces into battle. By the end of 1744, Frederick had stopped Austrian incursions into Silesia. In 1745, he smashed the Austrian forces at Hennersdorf, forcing the Austrians to retreat to Bohemia, securing Prussian possession of Silesia for the remainder of the war.\n\nThe English, Dutch, and Austrians continued to fight France, Spain, and Bavaria for three more years, with both sides trading victories in southern Germany and northern Italy. Frederick II largely kept Prussia out of this later fighting, since his sole goal of annexing Silesia was achieved in 1745."}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/war-of-the-austrian-succession", "page_content": "View of Louisbourg from a warship, as it would have appeared in 1744 (artwork by Lewis Parker).\n\nCauses, Alliances and Theatres\n\nThe immediate cause of the war was the death in 1740 of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy. His eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, assumed the throne but her succession was challenged by France, Prussia, Bavaria and Spain. Maria Theresa was supported by Britain, Hanover and the Dutch Republic.\n\nThe War of the Austrian Succession included the First and Second Silesian Wars in central Europe and a separate conflict between Britain and Spain \u2014 the so-called War of Jenkins's Ear, which began in 1739 and was eventually subsumed by the larger war.\n\nThe imperial and commercial rivalry between Britain and France played an important role in the war. The two powers struggled for control of North America in what is known as King George\u2019s War (1744\u201348). Britain and France also clashed in India in the First Carnatic War (1746\u201348).\n\nBritain vs. France\n\nThe war proved a disaster for both Britain and France. A British army was soundly defeated by the French on 11 May 1745 at Fontenoy, Flanders [Belgium], and driven off the continent. French maritime trade was eventually ruined by the Royal Navy.\n\nIn North America, Canadian war parties ravaged British frontier settlements in Nova Scotia, New York and New England. A combined British-New England expedition captured Louisbourg in June, but the Anglo-American force was no more able to conquer New France than the Canadians were able to conquer New England.\n\nTreaty of Aix-la-Chapelle\n\nIn May\u2013June 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war but settled nothing. Britain returned Louisbourg to France in exchange for Madras, India, which French forces had captured during the war. The Netherlands were ceded to Austria, and Silesia to Prussia.\n\nThe powers were all dissatisfied with their respective allies, and so made changes. On the eve of the Seven Years' War, Prussia was allied with Britain, while Austria was allied with France."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Matthew_Aylmer,_1st_Baron_Aylmer", "page_content": "Admiral of the Fleet Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca. 1650 \u2013 18 August 1720), of Covent Garden, Westminster, and Westcliffe, near Dover, was an Anglo-Irish Royal Navy officer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1720.\n\nAnglo-Irish navy officer\n\nQuick facts: The Right Honourable The Lord Aylmer, Born, D... \u25bc\n\nAylmer was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690 and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War.\n\nAylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709.
