The two met at the ages of 13 and 14 --- as part of a Christian hip hop group. Raised in strict Pentecostal households and schools (see Jesus Camp), both Andrew and Chris found refuge in their shared love for Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic --- and a friendship born out of secular escape turned into a creative collaboration. In high school, hand-me-down church sound equipment and a weekend obsession with making and recording music provided the means for what became Pattern is Movement.\n\n\n\nAll Together continues the mysterious narrative of the band and it exalts their existence as a two-man wall of sound. The pounding energy of their live show --- with Chris and Andrew side-by-side, simultaneously hammering their instruments, sweat flying --- resides in ten exquisitely constructed tracks. In the studio (Scott Solter\u2019s), every idea was given its voice; a range of guest instruments embellished the core magic of Andrew\u2019s vocals and keys and Chris\u2019 drums. All Together embraces the vocabulary of the band\u2019s experienced and obsessive recording language, yet it holds on to that unmistakable dynamism of their live performance.\n\n\n\nFurthering All Together\u2019s lore is its song-by-song relationship to a series of old photographs. Found by Andrew\u2019s brother on the street in Philly, ten tiny early 20th century images formed Pattern is Movement\u2019s own set of Oblique Strategies. Each photo abstractly inspired a song and its final form on the record, with Andrew and Chris even referring to the pictures during tracking. The record\u2019s name also arose from the connotation of this found collection: though essentially disparate, we\u2019re ultimately all together in our experience. Once time passes, all our pictures tell the same story.\n\ncredits\n\nreleased April 1, 2008\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://patternismovement.bandcamp.com/album/suckling-untitled-how-does-it-feel", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

Deeply soulful and natively genre-defying, they toured extensively, joining bands like St. Vincent, The Roots, and Shudder to Think, before delving into their fourth album and, along with it, the brightest and darkest corners of composition, orchestration, and collaboration.

He\u2019s also got a few records by his own name: The Brief Light (Manifold) and this year\u2019s One River (on Tell-All) which we highly recommend. Just last year he also put his stamp on John Vanderslice\u2019s Cellar Door with remix album MGM Endings.\n\n\n\nEarly this year Scott picked up and moved to North Carolina, bringing Pattern Is Movement\u2019s Stowaway tapes with him. At his new studio, Baucom Road, with grease, razor, and tape in hand, Scott conjured up something completely new. Running with Pattern Is Movement\u2019s insistent rhythms and vocal experimentation, he has created an all-analog album of songs that would make King Tubby and Scientist proud. These songs boom and shake and crackle and hiss and revalidate the art of the remix.\n\n\n\nWe present to you......Canonic.\n\ncredits\n\nreleased October 10, 2006\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/releasing-music/what-is-an-ep/", "page_content": "The difference between an EP, LP, and single on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nPity the poor EP, that oft-overlooked music format; the middle child between the single and long playing album (LP). Often misunderstood and forever caught in format purgatory by digital music services, the EP has languished long enough.\n\nHeck, even its name is misleading. EP stands for \u201cextended play,\u201d but the format is actually shorter than long playing \u2014 or \u201cfull length\u201d \u2014 albums.\n\nDespite its confusing name though, this humble format possesses a flexibility any artist can employ to their advantage. We\u2019re here to show you how you can use an EP to build momentum for your music; we\u2019ll also shed light on how Spotify and Apple music define an EP.\n\nBut first, what even is an EP?\n\nA brief history of the EP\n\nIn the early days of the music industry when vinyl reigned supreme, the single was the only format by necessity. Technology had not evolved enough to fit more than one song on the wax cylinders and brittle shellac discs early sound recordings were cut on. So, from the day Thomas Edison sang \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d into his phonograph in 1877 to the 1920s, recorded sound was sold by the song.\n\nFinally, labels began pressing 78 rpm (revolutions per minute) records, which were able to fit two songs instead of one on the record due to the thinner grooves. In 1948 Columbia Records introduced the 33 1/3 rpm 12-inch long playing (LP) record and a year later RCA Victor released its 45 rpm seven-inch single, gambling that consumers would disregard the 45\u2019s limited four minute cap on each side in favor of its higher fidelity.\n\nThe ensuing \u201cbattle of the speeds\u201d between Columbia and RCA Victor in the late \u201840s resulted in a decisive victory for Columbia, and the industry standardized the 12-inch, 33 1/3 LP as the receptacle of choice for its newest format: the long playing album (LP).\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop RCA from one last attempt at besting their rival. In 1952 they released the seven-inch Extended Play 45. RCA compromised sound quality by narrowing the grooves to fit nearly twice as much music on each side as their original 45, but it wasn\u2019t enough to topple the LP juggernaut.\n\nBy the mid-\u201960s, most artists were not content to release one to four songs on an EP when the LP allowed five or six songs on each side. The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper, the concept album was born, and the \u201870s ushered in the era of Album Oriented Rock (AOR). Singles were released to radio stations and albums were distributed to record stores. A few major RCA artists like Elvis Presley had used the EP to significant success throughout the late \u201950s and into the \u201960s, but by the \u201970s its limited space relegated the format to niche status.\n\nIn the \u201880s, the short song lengths of the emerging punk rock scene combined with the musicians\u2019 inability to pay for LP-length recording sessions brought on a resurgence of the EP. Bands like Black Flag took full advantage of the format; Dukowski and Co. cut three legendary EPs\u2013 each under seven minutes \u2013 before their \u201981 debut Damaged. Thus, the EP had a newfound and noble purpose in independent music: to introduce hungry young bands to the world.\n\nAs the \u201890s dawned and CDs fully supplanted vinyl and cassettes as the dominant physical format, the EP kept its job and helped numerous artists sign record deals. Eminem signed with Aftermath after label owner Dr. Dre heard the Slim Shady EP through Interscope CEO Jimmy Iovine. (Coincidentally, the cover of Slim\u2019s EP bears a striking resemblance to Black Flag\u2019s Damaged.) This continued into the New Millennium. In 2001, the Strokes\u2019 EP The Modern Age attracted the attention of enough labels that the band essentially had their pick among potential suitors.\n\nThree ways artists use EPs in the modern era\n\nIn the wake of the streaming revolution where cherry-picking and playlists have mostly replaced full album downloads, artists have created a few uses for the EP:\n\nAs a multi-track debut after your single\n\nThe EP is still a great option for a first release, especially once you have more than one song recorded. It\u2019s not as long as an album, so there\u2019s no pressure to write more songs if you only have five instead of 10. It\u2019s also cheaper to record since you spend less time in the studio. The debut EP is a fantastic way to get what you have out to potential fans while you\u2019re writing more material. A common practice for artists is to re-record a song or two from their EP for their full-length debut. So pick a few favorites and make them even better when you get the cash for more studio time.\n\nAs a stopgap between albums\n\nEstablished artists use the EP to sate their fans\u2019 appetites between albums. Normally this consists of already recorded B-sides that didn\u2019t make it on the previous album; a nice snack for their following while the artist works on new music, tours, or even takes a much-needed break. Carly Rae Jepsen released Emotion: Side B a year after her 2015 album Emotion. It was a quick 27 minutes of tunes fans hadn\u2019t heard before but were already in the hopper after her album.\n\nAs a mix of recordings you enjoy that may not work on an album\n\nThe great thing about the EP is that it\u2019s flexible and freeform. Think of it as a little room to stretch and experiment. Got a few live recordings you\u2019re particularly fond of? Maybe a remix another artist did of one of your songs that you enjoyed? A song or two that didn\u2019t make the cut on your album? Toss \u2018em all onto a release and that\u2019s five tracks your fans haven\u2019t heard yet! A popular use of EPs in electronic music is to lead off the release with a single, then follow with a few remixes or reinterpretations. The EP is the gumbo of recorded music. Whatever you\u2019ve got that sounds good, add it to the pot.\n\nWhat qualifies as an EP with the digital platforms?\n\nNow that you have some ideas about why and how to make your EP, you might be asking just what qualifies as an EP with digital services like Apple Music and Spotify. Luckily, there are some pretty exact guidelines for those two major services, as they are the only two who list the EP as its own category.\n\nAn EP on Apple Music\n\nEPs must meet one of the following two requirements on Apple Music:\n\nThe release has a total of one to three (1-3) tracks, one or more of the tracks is/are 10 minutes or longer, and the entire release is less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe release has a total of four to six (4-6) tracks and the entire release is less than 30 minutes.\n\nIf your submission meets these criteria, iTunes will automatically add \u201c-EP\u201d to the end of your title. So whether or not you meant to release an EP, they\u2019ll qualify it as such if it falls under their qualifications.\n\nAn EP on Spotify\n\nAnything that meets the below requirements will show up under \u201cEP\u2019s & Singles\u201d rather than your \u201cAlbums\u201d section:\n\nThe release is under 30 minutes.\n\nThe release has 4-6 tracks.\n\nNote: Spotify will NOT change the title of your release to reflect the format.\n\nWhat qualifies as a single with the digital platforms?\n\nIf you only have one song, a single is still the best way to get your first song out there. As with EPs, Apple Music and Spotify have requirements for submissions to be listed under the Single category.\n\nA single on Apple Music\n\nApple Music will classify your release as a single if:\n\nThe release is one to three (1-3) tracks.\n\nThe entire release is 30 minutes or less and all individual tracks are less than 10 minutes.\n\nLike EPs, if you submission meets the requirements of a Single with Apple Music, they will add \u201c-Single\u201d at the end of the submission.\n\nA single on Spotify\n\nYour music will be classified under the single category if:\n\nThe release is under 30 minutes.\n\nThe release has three (3) or fewer tracks.\n\nHere are 10 strategies for releasing singles in 2019.\n\nEPs help artists in the streaming age build momentum and keep the attention of fans\n\nWhile singles are a great way to release one song, the EP is a fantastic next step in a young artist\u2019s career. It doesn\u2019t require the attention span of an album and it costs less to record. What\u2019s there not to like?"}, {"url": "https://dittomusic.com/en/blog/albums-vs-eps-vs-singles-a-guide-to-releasing-music/", "page_content": "The results are in! EPs are officially on the rise whilst albums are in demise - and we've got the data to prove it. Read on to check it out for yourself!\n\nWell with digital streaming taking a hold of the new music industry, we're beginning to wonder where that leaves the EP and traditional album formats in 2023 - and more importantly - which one is best suited for new artists to who want to know how to release music in 2023. All will be answered in due course. But first, let\u2019s open the floor with a basic run-down of what each is and how they differ.\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\nWhat's the difference between an EP and an album?\n\nWhat separates a single, album and EP comes down to 2 main things;\n\n1. Length (i.e. the number of songs which feature on the track list) 2. Duration (i.e. the total running time) of the entire project\n\n<br>\n\nAn album or LP (Long Play) refers to a full length body of work, features between 7-29 tracks and has a running time of roughly 35-60 mins.\n\nAn EP (Extended Play) refers to a half-length body of work, features between 4-6 tracks and has a running time of roughly 15-22 mins (but can be up to 30 minutes).\n\nA single is the shortest body of work you can release, features between 1-3 tracks and has a running time of roughly less than 10 mins.\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\nHow many albums, EPs and singles are released each year?\n\n\n\nAs you can see by the graph below, since 2016, album release numbers are plummeting while EPs & singles continue to skyrocket.\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nAccording to data from Ditto Music, over the past 5 years the number of album releases has seen a consistent year-on-year drop. While albums made up 35% of all releases in 2016, their popularity has dropped significantly, with albums making up only 9.7% of all releases last year in 2021 (that's over -25%!)\n\nOn the other hand, the number of singles & EP releases has seen continuous growth over the same 5 year period, making a whopping 90.3% of total releases in 2021.\n\nSo by a majority and popularity count, singles & EPs definitely come out on top.\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\nShould I release an album or an EP?\n\nDeciding whether or not to record and release an EP or an album ultimately comes down to a couple of different individual factors, including your budget, your target audience and ultimately, your music goals.\n\n<br>\n\n1. Budget\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nIn terms of money, EPs are cheaper to make than albums.\n\nWith almost half the no. of songs, you\u2019ll also be halving any money spent on things like studio time, production costs, instrument hire, session musicians - the list goes on!\n\n<br>\n\n2. Target audience\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nWhich album format you choose will directly influence your fans.\n\nWhether that\u2019s explorative audiences, your luke-warm fans or even your diehard superfans.\n\nAn EP tends to attract new listeners whilst also turning already gained listeners into luke-warm fans. Once you start releasing even more music in the form of an album, you\u2019ll be strengthening your relationship with your luke-warm fans, but also turning some into die-hard superfans. Makes sense right?\n\nSo to cut it short - putting out an EP tends to work better if you\u2019re a new artist with the aim of getting discovered by new listeners.\n\n<br>\n\n3. Your music goals\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nWhat are you aiming to achieve with your release?\n\nFor example, raising your artist profile, changing up your sound or launching new merch/a tour might be better suited to an album.\n\nWhereas if you\u2019re still finding your sound, getting your music into the ears of new listeners or simply focussed on getting music out quickly and consistently, an EP is arguably the better option.\n\nSo what does all this mean?\n\nWell, although there\u2019s no one-rule-fits-all for this kind of thing, for new, upcoming artists who are just starting out (which is probably you if you\u2019re reading this post!), there\u2019s a general consensus that releasing an EP is the better option during this early stage in your music career.\n\nRead on to find out why!\n\n<hr>\n\nWhy release an EP over an album?\n\n<br>\n\n1. The streaming industry\n\n\n\nWith on-demand streaming taking the new music industry by storm, digital streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify, as well as social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are now the main places where listeners are looking for new music.\n\nSo it makes sense that a short-form EP works perfectly to release on these big platforms, plus smaller ones like BandCamp and SoundCloud too.\n\nYou can show off what you and your brand is all about by really playing on your strengths as an artist, through a more specific selection of tracks that exhibit your strongest work to date. Talk about a crowd pleaser!\n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t already releasing music to major streaming platforms and stores, then what are you waiting for?!\n\nSign up and get started with Ditto today.\n\n<br>\n\n2. Playlists & music consumption habits\n\n\n\nWith millions of songs available to listeners at the touch of a button, listeners are becoming conditioned to listen to more artists and a shorter collection of songs.\n\nThis is down to modern consumption habits - including a shortened listener attention span as well as streaming giants like Apple Music and Spotify highly promoting more playlist consumption.\n\nNew listeners now rely on algorithmic playlist recommendations from the likes of \u2018Discover Weekly\u2019 and \u2018New Music Friday\u2019 to find new artists and tracks to listen to - and you\u2019ve got a much better chance of your favourite singles from your latest EP landing on there, that could otherwise get lost in the clutter if you released it within a longer-form album format.\n\nLearn how to get your music on Discover Weekly & Release Radar playlists!\n\nDid you know: A global streaming study found over half (54%) of people interviewed are listening to fewer albums now, than they did 5 or 10 years ago.\n\n<br>\n\n3. Maintain a regular release schedule\n\n\n\nFor new artists entering the music game, releasing singles that form an eventual EP over time might possibly be the best strategy to stay relevant, keep your fans engaged and even buy you some time should you want to eventually release an LP.\n\nAt this early stage, you don\u2019t want to be spending so much time and money recording, producing and marketing the perfect 12 track concept album, putting it out a year down the line, only to realise you\u2019ve lost all the listeners and fans you\u2019d already gained in the process because they got tired waiting to hear new music from you.\n\nGrowing a fan base is important - yes - but like any kind of business, it\u2019s important to hold onto the fans you already have, and turn them into superfans.\n\nHaving a predictable and regular release schedule is the way to do just that.\n\nReleasing an EP means you can still target new fans with a high standard of music that reflects your best work, whilst also marketing to current fans by releasing regular music.\n\n<br>\n\n4. Releasing music that didn\u2019t fit the bill\n\n\n\nHave you ever written an epic track but it just doesn't fit the theme or soundscape of your project?\n\nDon\u2019t dismiss it! Get it out there through an EP.\n\nArtists like Tech N9ne pledge to never waste a song - and he\u2019s right! He puts out every song he ever records, and you\u2019ll see this if you've ever had a gander at his discography. His output is huge - and a lot of that comes down to regular EPs that exist because the tracks on them didn\u2019t fit on his previous albums.\n\n<br>\n\n5. To act as a stop-gap between LPs\n\n\n\nBetween every major album or LP, some artists will choose to release an EP as a sort of precursor if you like, to their next project.\n\nThe point of the EP in this scenario is to introduce or hint at themes and concepts that will be revealed in the content of their bigger album.\n\nMaybe your LP will explore a radically different sound that your fans won\u2019t have heard from you before? Use an EP to slowly introduce them to your musical evolution.\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\nAlbum vs EP release strategies\n\n<br>\n\nThe best EP release strategies\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re releasing an EP, don\u2019t leave your fanbase waiting for new material. Releasing an EP by dropping some regular, killer singles is the most logical way!\n\nThis is what\u2019s been termed in the industry as the \u2018Waterfall Strategy.\u2019\n\nHit play on the video below to hear how it works!\n\n<br>\n\n<center>\n\n<div class=\"embed-youtube\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHjT_orf9n0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nThe point is - by releasing singles consistently over time, you\u2019ll actually be making an EP in the process.\n\nThis way you\u2019ll be able to handpick a selection of 4 - 6 tracks for your EP based on singles which have performed the best among your fans, which almost guarantees a highly successful EP release.\n\nIt\u2019ll ultimately serve as a portfolio of your best quality work to date and help you find out what your listeners love hearing from you, which can influence your approach to future singles, future EPs or an eventual LP down the line.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how, find out how to release a single in 2022.\n\n<br>\n\nThe best album release strategies\n\n\n\nAn album release plan is totally different from a single or EP.\n\nWriting, recording and promoting an album can take months - if not a year or more - of hard work and dedication.\n\nWhich leaves a good gap of time to fall out of the listening space of your audience.\n\nThat\u2019s why even when it comes to making and releasing an LP, you should never stop with the single output!\n\nLoads of big artists opt for this release strategy. Just last year Adele made a huge comeback with her single release \u2018Easy On Me\u2019, before releasing her entire studio album \u201830\u2019 just a few weeks later.\n\nDrip-feeding content first to build a following and thinking about the post-album release is just as important as the actual album drop itself.\n\n<hr>\n\n<br>\n\nShould I release an EP before an album?\n\nThe short answer - yes, probably.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some singles and an EP or a few under your belt, you\u2019ll soon be able to predict what your fans want to see from you which makes the time, effort and cost of an album well-worth it.\n\nIt\u2019s also really important you don\u2019t rush into an album release.\n\nYour first album (and the ones after) will be a hallmark moment in your music career. They\u2019ll generate a lot of interest from not just fans, but music critics, fellow artists and alike.\n\nSo put in the time to make sure that like your EPs, your album is an accurate reflection of your best work.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be put off by consumption habits!\n\nPeople will still listen to longer-form. You just have to lure them in with short-form first. Earn their time through quality and consistency.\n\n<hr>\n\nAlbum vs EP. Have we settled the debate?\n\nLike we mentioned, there\u2019s not one-size-fits all. Every artist is different and so too will their approach be to either an EP or album release.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to have all the facts on both before you start putting out your own projects.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, base it on what\u2019s right for your budget, your target audience and your musical goals at this stage of the game.\n\n<br>"}, {"url": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/music/all-exo-members-ages-and-birthdays/", "page_content": "EXO is a South Korean-Chinese boy group that debuted under the company, SM Entertainment in 2012 with the EP MAMA.

If you're gearing up to release music, you're likely overwhelmed by industry jargon, acronyms, and all of the mechanics that come with distributing a professional project.\n\nNot to worry! Below, we'll delve into the key difference between an EP vs LP so that you can secure the right format for your release.\n\nEP vs. LP In The Music Industry At A Glance\n\nTo get to the heart of the matter, an EP is a collection of typically four to six tracks while an LP or album is a body of work that contains seven or more tracks. These amounts were originally determined by the amount of music that could be held on vinyl records as discussed below, but the legacy of the track limits still holds today.\n\nEPs and LPs aren't the only music industry-standard formats, though they are arguably the most common for artists releasing projects. Streaming platforms might have changed the way we release music, but an extended play record and full-length album have a long recorded history within the music business.\n\nFor reference, EP stands for extended play while LP stands for long play. You could even consider an EP album a mini album by principle - these projects are too long to be considered singles, but too short to warrant the title of album.\n\nThe History Behind Vinyl Records: What Created EPs vs LPs?\n\nEPs and LPs are distinguished by the length of music and the number of tracks. These two factors came into play during the creation of vinyl records. Originally, Columbia records created a vinyl record that could hold up to 23 minutes of audio on each side. This was a huge advancement since at the time, the standard was a 12-inch record that could only play 5 minutes of audio on each side. Hence, the creation of full-length albums.\n\nIn order to compete with this format, RCA records released a smaller vinyl record that could hold approximately 8 minutes of audio on each side. These smaller records paved the way for the typical EP, serving as album samplers or just smaller projects for musicians.\n\nUnderstanding The Different Formats: LP, EP, and Singles\n\nTo start, it's key to break down the different possible formats for music releases. When you're releasing music, you're distributing your art as a single, EP, mixtape, LP or full-length album, or double LP.\n\nLP\n\nAn LP or full album holds anywhere from 7 to 29 tracks of physical or digital music. This is also the name of a modern studio album. An LP album is typically between 35 and 60 minutes long.\n\nDouble LPs\n\nDouble LPs are the most long-playing vinyl record, with track limits above 29 tracks. These album formats came about with the dawn of retrospective albums, like an artist's \"Greatest Hits\" record.\n\nThe double LP records come with two double-sided records that could encompass multiple or a single album era. Double LPs might also include bonus tracks or extended versions of songs that your top music fans may enjoy.\n\nEP\n\nEP albums tend to hold 4 to 6 tracks. The EP album format is usually 15 to 20 minutes long and serves as a great way for up-and-coming artists to build their music careers before they're ready for album releases.\n\nSingles\n\nA single release is typically one track released on its own, but it can technically be up to three tracks, bridging the gap between EP releases.\n\nMixtapes\n\nMixtapes operate in a category of their own. This distribution format has few rules and originates from the hip-hop community, though it's used all throughout the music industry. Typically, mixtapes are compilations of multiple songs that don't have as much marketing or cohesion as typical formal EP or album releases.\n\nBuilding Your Project Rollout\n\nReady to start releasing music? It's a good idea to put together a release plan for your project. Here are several methods for putting together your project release:\n\nWaterfall Release\n\nIn the age of streaming platforms, the waterfall release seems to be the most common. In this method, artists will drop the first track of an album or EP, then followed by the release of another track and the first track. This process continues until the release of the entire project, usually unveiling a handful of new music along with the previously expressed work.\n\nThe benefit of the waterfall release is that having a more continuous project on streaming can help boost listening since the platform will auto-play to the next song.\n\nTwo Singles and An EP or LP\n\nMany artists opt to drop two to three singles, followed by an EP or LP. This way, your listener gets a taste of what's to come, and you can build anticipation to your album with some extra runway.\n\nThe Project Drop\n\nLegacy artists like Beyonce can drop a project seemingly without planning and still reach the top of the charts. This rollout is more or less reserved for superstar artists who have built up their community to a point where it can run itself.\n\nReleasing Singles\n\nIf you have a track that didn't quite fit your previous albums or find yourself in between releases, it may make sense to drop a single entirely on its own. Artists might also drop singles as an extended single as bonus tracks to the album that was recently released.\n\nShould I Release An Album Or An EP?\n\nThe best release schedule is entirely dependent on your goals as an artist. Are you looking for new listeners? Single might be the best way to quickly introduce new sounds into your catalog. Looking to provide some depth for fans? Opt for an album or LP. Somewhere in the middle? An EP makes sense for artists who want to start building beyond single releases.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that a debut album or entire release comes with its own connotations. Some artists may prefer to wait until they progress along their music career before dropping their first studio album. Other artists might not find this aspect as important.\n\nIn any event, don't let your fears around the project format prevent you from releasing new music. In the age of digital downloads and streaming platforms, your most popular songs may hit peak popularity years after they've been released.\n\nFinding the right way to roll out more songs can be confusing. At the end of the day, listen to your fan base when choosing between launching a single, EP, or album. Committing to consistently releasing music will help keep your fans engaged while you build your skillset along the way. Have fun sending your art out into the world!"}, {"url": "https://victrola.com/blogs/articles/ep-vs-lp-what-s-the-difference", "page_content": "It\u2019s typical for music fans to talk about the albums they love or how different a song sounds on a vinyl record vs. a digital format or a CD. However, when taking a deeper dive into the artistry of all things music, the discussion often turns to other topics, such as the differences between Mixtapes vs. Albums, or the differences between EP vs. LP.\n\nRegardless of where you are on the music listening spectrum, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve seen these terms before. But, you may not be quite sure what they actually mean. We\u2019re here to define these terms, review the differences between an EP vs. LP vs. album, and share a few of the best of each of these album types. After reading this blog, you will feel like a pro next time you visit a record store.\n\nWhat is an EP?\n\nAn EP stands for an extended play album. It is usually in reference to a vinyl record but could also be a CD or digital download. The listening format isn\u2019t what defines an EP but rather how many tracks are included, or album length. Compared to a full length album, an EP album is a short album but has more songs than a single. A typical EP album, like the The Format: EP, has about four to six tracks, depending on the genre or artist\u2019s decision.\n\nHowever, even if an EP just has two or three songs, there are no time limitations to how long a song can be. That means you could still have nearly an hour-long listening experience from the entire release if the songs on the record are extended. For example, six tracks at around 12 minutes each fits into the EP album format.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing an EP vs. LP album, EPs are a way for indie artists to get their music heard (and funded) before producing a full-length long play album. They\u2019re often used for promotional purposes and to have ready when distributing to a record label and producers.\n\nVinyl EPs: What Sets Them Apart?\n\nWhile a small collection of songs can be called an EP across all mediums, vinyl EPs stand out for their uniqueness and collectibility. Unlike records on CD or in digital formats, vinyl EPs are physically different from their LP counterparts.\n\nLike David Bowie, vinyl EPs can easily be identified by their quirky physical characteristics, including their:\n\nSize \u2013 Any diehard Prince fan can tell you that great things come in small packages. Like singles, EPs are most frequently pressed onto 7-inch vinyl discs, the smallest of the standard sizes\u2014although, in some exceedingly rare and magical cases such as Bon Iver\u2019s Blood Bank , EPs can come on 10-inches. 1 Despite their small stature, you can still spin them on a standard record player, as long as you have an\u2026\n\n\u2013 Any diehard Prince fan can tell you that great things come in small packages.

Despite their small stature, you can still spin them on a standard record player, as long as you have an\u2026 Adapter \u2013 Many EPs\u2014especially older ones\u2014don\u2019t fit directly onto a standard record player\u2019s spindle. While your not-so-ingenious friend may suggest wadding up paper and stuffing it in an EP\u2019s oversized hole, without the proper attachment, you\u2019re going to damage your vinyl and your turntable. 7-inch EPs need a small plastic adapter to function properly\u2014and if they still sound funny with it on, that\u2019s probably because you\u2019re spinning them at the wrong speed.\n\n\u2013 Many EPs\u2014especially older ones\u2014don\u2019t fit directly onto a standard record player\u2019s spindle. While your not-so-ingenious friend may suggest wadding up paper and stuffing it in an EP\u2019s oversized hole, without the proper attachment, you\u2019re going to damage your vinyl and your turntable. 7-inch EPs need a small plastic adapter to function properly\u2014and if they still sound funny with it on, that\u2019s probably because you\u2019re spinning them at the wrong speed. Spin rate \u2013 The speed at which a record turns on a player, or turntable speed, is measured in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). The majority of 7-inches are pressed to spin at 45 RPM, hence their nickname 45s. Less commonly, EPs can be produced to turn at 33 1/3 RPM, but it\u2019s not the industry standard.2\n\nThe unique properties of the 7-inch actually helped shape EPs as we know them. A standard 7-inch turning at 45 RPM can hold about six minutes of music per side\u2014the perfect amount for a couple choice tunes from a mid-20th century crooner.2\n\nThus, since the 45 rose to prominence around 1950, they\u2019ve always come packed with a few quick and killer songs. One thing that has changed about them, however, is how they\u2019re viewed by the music industry.\n\nOriginally, 45s were seen as a form of competition to the standard full-length records (LPs) that we all know and love. The Battle of the Speeds pitted LP vs EP, and critics believed one format would emerge victorious over the other and become the go-to for the industry.2\n\nBut in the end, who won the epic war of EP vs LP?\n\nUltimately, the winners are all music fans\u2014who now have two wonderful ways to enjoy new music and songs from their favorite artists.\n\nWhat is an LP?\n\nAn LP refers to a long-playing or long play record or a full-length album. When comparing an EP vs. LP, think of the EP record as a warm-up to the headlining performance, a musical appetizer to the main course. An LP album is typically between 10 to 12 tracks and anywhere from 30 to 50+ minutes long. Keep in mind when listening to music on vinyl, a record can only hold 40 minutes of music per side, which is why some extended track albums aren\u2019t found on vinyl.\n\nFinally, when it comes to the difference between an EP vs LP vs album, LPs and albums are more often used interchangeably. For an EP, you may also find it referenced as a recording since an album represents a much longer body of work.\n\nWhat Makes Vinyl LPs Special?\n\nUnlike the term EP, people generally don\u2019t refer to albums as LPs unless they\u2019re pressed onto vinyl. Hence, LP is more of a name for the medium rather than a catch-all for full-length releases.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean that all records pressed onto vinyl are LPs. Besides their longer track count, LPs can be distinguished from EPs by their:\n\n12 inches of glory \u2013 Sometimes, size really does matter. Not only does the larger surface mean more songs can be jammed onto an LP than an EP, but it also provides a larger canvas for artists to express themselves visually. Some LPs, such as Tool\u2019s limited edition etched Fear Inoculum collection, use the vinyl\u2019s surface as a medium for artistic expression as much as the music itself.\n\nSlow turning speed \u2013 Unlike EPs zipping away at 45 RPM, LPs spin at a more lackadaisical 33 1/3 RPM. There are 12-inch records that turn at 45 RPM, but rare Maxi Singles such as M83\u2019s Go! are completely distinct entities from traditional LPs.\n\n\u2013 Sometimes, size really does matter.

There are 12-inch records that turn at 45 RPM, but rare Maxi Singles such as M83\u2019s are completely distinct entities from traditional LPs. Propensity to double up \u2013 Despite their increased length, some artists have more to say than one LP can handle. If there are two vinyls in one sleeve\u2014such as The Cure\u2019s Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\u2014that's likely a double LP you\u2019re holding. Of course, musical rules are made to be broken, and, in this case, Courtney Barnett\u2019s A Sea of Split Peas is perhaps the most famous double-EP culprit.\n\nWhile certainly interesting to note, do all these distinctions between LP vs EP vs album really matter to anyone besides certified music nerds?\n\nYes, indeed, and they\u2019re of particular importance to musicians themselves.\n\nWhy Does the Difference Between EP vs. LP Matter?\n\nTo the listener, the song length or number of tracks on a record may not matter as much on the surface. However, as you learn about different musicians and their creativity, you\u2019ll understand it\u2019s a big difference for them.\n\nFirst, organizing song tracks is an artistic choice. The sequencing is designed to channel a certain mood or vibe and give the listener an optimal experience. Conceptually, it\u2019s similar to what goes into preparing a live music show.\n\nHave you ever noticed how most artists start and end with their most upbeat songs with a slower break in the middle to play any ballads, acoustic versions, or song covers they like to perform? This is one way to optimize the experience. When EPs were reserved for vinyl records only, the limited amount of space also made it crucial to time each song and maximize the effort.\n\nSecond, EPs have been a medium for artists to get their foot in the door with record label prospects and fans. Although today, big name artists often use EPs as a way to give their audiences bonus track songs on their full-length albums. It\u2019s a way to provide deeper cuts or behind-the-scenes looks at the making of an album. Artists may share hidden bonus tracks that may have previously been on the cutting room floor. This gives EPs a special feel as an insight into the artist\u2019s recording process and an encore to the album fans already know and love.\n\nWhen sorting through the records of popular artists or looking for new music to enjoy, consider the difference between EP vs LP and know that if there is a full-length album already released, you may be able to find an EP. Additionally, as a record collector, stumbling across a rare EP of an artist when they were first starting out can be a rare gem to add to your collection. Here are a few examples of EPs and albums from some of the world\u2019s best known artists that we carry at Victrola.\n\nDuran Duran is arguably one of the \u201880\u2019s biggest artists, riding the New Wave era of music. They\u2019ve sold over 100 million records worldwide and have 30 Top 40 singles to their name.\n\nTheir No Ordinary Tour EP has three tracks: \u201cCome Undone: Live,\u201d \u201cNotorious: Live,\u201d and their most popular, \u201cHungry Like the Wolf: Live from Tower Records,\u201d which was recorded in an intimate acoustic show in Hollywood, CA in 1993.\n\nThe only people in attendance for this exclusive performance were those who won tickets from a radio station contest. At the time, the No Ordinary Tour EP was given away as a free cassette to attendees. \u201cHungry Like a Wolf\u201d then went on to be included on the band\u2019s second studio album, Rio.\n\nThis five-track EP is a must-have for fans of the legendary Carlos Santana. The concept of the recording stemmed from the artist\u2019s interaction with the famed Mona Lisa painting in Paris. Following his view, Santana created five songs for In Search of Mona Lisa that were written and produced by Santana and Narada Michael Walden. For listeners, it provided a unique artist insight into the place and memories of one of the world\u2019s most notorious performers.\n\nBefore lead singer Karen O was beloved by screaming audiences, her band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recorded its debut, self-released, five-song EP in 2001. It was the first production of the band, made up of Karen O\u2019s notorious vocals, drums from Brian Chase, and guitar riffs by Nick Zinners. Their distinctive, driving, alternative garage sound was introduced through these early tracks, which eventually led them to the stardom they\u2019ve reached today.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing EP vs LP vs album, Stevie Wonder\u2019s 16th studio album, Innervisions, released in 1973 is considered one of the best records of his career. Though an LP, here is where he transitioned from his earlier, more romantic, pop sound from his earlier Motown days and began to explore societal issues at the time that are still prevalent today.\n\nHe incorporated these themes through his lyrics, instrumentation, and sounds, which are captured beautifully when listening to this album on vinyl. Two of the best-known tracks, \u201cLiving for the City\u201d and \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d come in at 7:23 and 3:40, respectively, lengths familiar to the EP style. Stevie Wonder is an artist who\u2019s adapted to the changing trends in the music industry and has taken parts from each decade and made them his own.\n\nJazz is arguably one of the best genres to listen to on vinyl since that\u2019s where it originated. Charlie Parker is one of the world\u2019s most well-known jazz musicians with several albums to his name.\n\nThe Immortal is a green-colored vinyl with bonus tracks that makes this a collector\u2019s item for any longtime fan or even as a beginning album for those just getting into the genre. The vinyl LP music album was released posthumously and is a compilation of selections from five different recording sessions between 1944 and 1948. It contains previously unreleased alternate takes from these sessions.\n\nBeatlemania lives on with this special three-LP set of The Beatles recording music for a variety of radio shows throughout their career. It features an extensive 40 tracks, as well as live interviews with each member of the band.\n\nThough there are their most recognizable hits on the album, there are also song covers of rock and roll classics, as well as speech tracks of in-studio conversations capturing the banter between The Beatles and Saturday Club\u2019s Brian Matthew. For Beatles fans, there\u2019s no better gift than a rarity like On Air: Live at the BBC 2 to get a more intimate feel of their live performances.\n\nBefore Canadian superstar The Weeknd rose to international prominence, he kicked off his career with what, at that point, was considered a mixtape. Now, House of Balloons is noted as a seminal album in establishing the dark and foreboding tones that defined R&B throughout much of the 2010s.\n\nPressed onto a double LP, this is Abel Tesfaye as you\u2019ve never heard him. Vinyl is the perfect medium to experience the eclectic samples and silky smooth singing that alerted listeners to The Weeknd in the first place. From the new-wave tones of the title track to the dark ethereality of The Party and the Afterparty, House of Balloons is the certified soundtrack of nocturnes and late-night contemplators everywhere.\n\nLegendary singer-songwriter Neil Young may be getting on in years, but this live EP proves his musical talents age like fine wine. Recorded in the sanctity of his own home, The Times was Neil\u2019s attempt to comfort those suffering from loneliness and isolation during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.3\n\nWith live performances of some of his most iconic songs, including Ohio, Alabama, and Southern Man, The Times is the kind of golden era Young to get nostalgic for. The quick collection of songs holds a welcome surprise as well, with a moving cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are A-Changin sandwiched in the middle of Neil\u2019s hits.\n\nFind your Next EP or LP with Victrola\n\nInterested in exploring the world of EP and LP records? Peruse Victrola\u2019s record store and see which of your favorite artists may have EPs with tracks you\u2019ve never heard of before or special performances that take you back to a different time. The way you hear a song on a studio album will be much different than how it\u2019ll sound as a live performance or recording session.\n\nAnd still, how a song started as an EP recording may evolve into the full-length performance you\u2019re familiar with today. The beauty of the differences between an EP vs. LP vs. album shows how expansive music is and how the same song can sound different when using different mediums and formats.\n\nSources:"}]}
