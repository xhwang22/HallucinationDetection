Former Silver Fern Leana de Bruin wishes she\u2019d learnt it a little earlier in life, with the stunning netballer admitting there have been a few instances where a bit of trusting her first instincts would have come in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt a few lessons along the way,\u201d Leana says with a wry smile. So when it came to making the decision to move across the Tasman for a one-year contract with the Adelaide Thunderbirds, Leana (40) knew what she had to do \u2013 and three months later, the star defender knows her gut was 100% spot on. While it\u2019s a big call to leave New Zealand \u2013 pulling her seven-year-old son Caleb out of his school and leaving her partner behind \u2013 Leana says she wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave netball behind. Plus, she knew if she turned down this opportunity to play in Australia\u2019s netball league, she\u2019d always wonder, \u2018what if?\u2019. \u201cI was definitely at a bit of a crossroads,\u201d says Leana, who last year captained new team the Northern Stars in New Zealand\u2019s new ANZ Premiership.\n\nCaleb is heading to Adelaide with Leana.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018 Do I retire? Do I go one more year?\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, this came up. So I figured if they thought I was still good enough to be there, then I\u2019d give it one more year. Plus, I still have a lot of fire in my belly.\u201d She continues, \u201cI did get a little overwhelmed making the decision. I did feel responsible for the Stars in some way \u2013 we didn\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped this year and I know there\u2019s huge potential. \u201cBut, at the same time, I\u2019d reached the stage in my career where, and it sounds so horrible, I had to be a little bit selfish and do what I wanted.\u201d So Leana and Caleb are preparing to make the move to Adelaide in the New Year, with the duo both very excited to experience a new city, culture and in Leana\u2019s case, some of South Australia\u2019s famous wine! \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be able to enjoy it too much during the season, but after the season is a different story!\u201d she laughs.\n\nThe star represented New Zealand 104 times before retiring from international netball in 2016.\n\n\u201cBut we are really looking forward to it. I asked Caleb about it, because this would mean spending less time with his dad [Leana\u2019s ex-husband Quinton]. But, as Caleb pointed out, it\u2019s not forever and he said to me, \u2018Mum, we\u2019ll just FaceTime him!\u2019 I video call my parents every Sunday in South Africa, it\u2019s a bit of a tradition, so Caleb said, \u2018If you do that with your mum and dad, I\u2019ll do it with mine.\u2019 It was very cute.\u201d Leana, who describes herself as a farm girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of love for big cities, is adamant that this is a one-year move \u2013 home for both her and Caleb is their farmhouse in the Waikato. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t see myself living in Australia,\u201d she tells. \u201cI have a partner here. He was very supportive as well. He said if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d regret it one day. It\u2019s better to know than wonder! And Adelaide is only a flight away.\u201d She acknowledges that playing for an Australian team for the first time in her career was a big decision. Leana, who has represented New Zealand 104 times and her native South Africa in 34 tests, feels a huge loyalty to Aotearoa and the people here who gave her the opportunities that have led her to this point."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/leana-de-bruin", "page_content": "Leana de Bruin South African netball player\n\nLeana de Bruin is a 45 years old South African netball player from .

After retiring from international netball last month, even Leana\u2019s a little surprised at how happy she is post-Ferns. After all, it\u2019s a team she was a part of for a staggering 14 years, notching up 104 test caps in the black dress, and before that, 34 for her native South Africa. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s given her everything \u2013 a career as a professional sportswoman, her closest friends and a new home in New Zealand. And apart from being Mum to the very energetic and vivacious Caleb, netball remains her greatest passion. Leana\u2019s decision to hang up her now well-worn bib was incredibly tough but, as the 1.90m defender concedes, it was time.\n\n\u201cMy body couldn\u2019t take it any more,\u201d the no-nonsense netball stalwart says. \u201cI went into the Silver Fern trials with an open mind, but my ankle was giving me grief the whole season. The Ferns environment is tough and I was battling. I couldn\u2019t give 100 per cent, so I said to [Silver Ferns coach] Janine [Southby] before she made the final decision, I think it\u2019s time. And it was. I was always going to be playing in pain and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more.\u201d Still, it was hard to let go of a 14-year tenure that\u2019s seen her win a world championship, two Commonwealth Games and an ANZ Championship title. \u201cPart of me still wanted to be a part of it,\u201d she admits. \u201cI wanted to finish on a game, rather than just randomly like I had to. But, unfortunately, you know, life takes funny turns. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d And fate was the reason a 22-year-old Leana ended up in Aotearoa in the first place. After the 1999 World Championships, a World Seven invitational team was formed to play against the Silver Ferns in New Zealand, and Leana jumped at the chance to be a part of it.\n\n\u201cThe manager of that team was from Invercargill. I was chatting with her and I mentioned how cool it would be to come over and play in New Zealand, and then she asked me!\u201d Three years later, Leana was a surprise selection for the Silver Ferns and lined up for her debut in 2003. Soon, she found herself up against her former team. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe hardest part was hearing the South African national anthem. I couldn\u2019t sing that, I had to sing the New Zealand one. That got the heartstrings, for sure. But for some reason, it also felt right, as hard as it was. I was immensely proud to be wearing that black dress.\u201d Now Leana\u2019s a true blue Kiwi \u2013 a fact reinforced by her New Zealand-born and All Black fanatic son Caleb, whom she\u2019s thrilled to be spending more time with.\n\nLeana played for the Silver Ferns for the past 14 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loving the fact I\u2019m home a bit more now. Every afternoon, we\u2019ll have a bit of a rugby game or a kicking contest in the backyard,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows everything there is to know about the All Blacks, he has the same birthday as Kieran Read, which he just thinks is the coolest thing ever. He\u2019s playing rippa at the moment, but moves onto tackle rugby next year. \u201cHe does understand that I\u2019m not playing with the Ferns any more, but he does keep asking when we\u2019re going away again, because we\u2019ve been used to travelling a lot! It is a little weird to him that all of a sudden, Mum\u2019s home every weekend.\u201d As far as a new plan goes, spending time with her son is at the top of Leana\u2019s list, as well as being \u201ca good tenant\u201d and helping her landlords, Laurie and Jo, look after the farm and the animals. But Leana has found she\u2019s been unable to let go of netball completely. While she currently can\u2019t confirm if she is playing in either the new South Auckland-based team for the inaugural New Zealand elite league or is seeking an Australian contract, Leana reckons she might have one more year of domestic netball in her.\n\nAnd she\u2019s also scored coaching gigs overseas, as well as ambassador work for Netball New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in netball world!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think I would have been totally depressed if I had to ask myself,\n\n\u2018What next?\u2019, but the transition from player to ambassador has been quite easy. Netball New Zealand has been great.\u201d Along with moving into a more mentor-based netball role, where she\u2019s keen to share her experience and wisdom, she also has a very important event to plan \u2013 Caleb\u2019s upcoming seventh birthday party. \u201cI had planned to still be playing netball at the end of October, when his birthday is, so now that I\u2019m not, we get to organise the party together, which is really exciting. This will only be the second time in his life that I\u2019m home for his birthday because we\u2019ve always been playing overseas.\u201d She\u2019s also looking forward to spending some more time with her new partner, who lives in South Auckland. \u201cYup, there\u2019s a bit of a dude hanging around. It\u2019s quite nice,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice \u2013 well, it sounds horrible \u2013 but we\u2019re not in each other\u2019s face all the time! So the distance thing works. But it does help when you\u2019re not playing; you have a bit more time to fit everything in and the headspace too.\u201d\n\nWith her Silver Fern team mates.\n\nCaleb is keen on a caravan trip around the North Island too, but Leana admits she isn\u2019t so sure about that plan. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to attempt it!\u201d Still, Leana says she can\u2019t quite shake a few old habits, such as keeping up with the gym sessions. \u201cI know that sounds a bit weird, but I love training!\u201d she tells. \u201cThough now I can just cruise on the bike, instead of going a million miles an hour, and then afterwards, I have time to catch up with friends, have a coffee and go for a walk.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s blissfully happy with her new, less structured and more relaxed life, Leana knows netball will always be in her blood, and the woman her Silver Fern team-mates know as Vlooi will always be somewhere in the background, coaching, mentoring or simply as a fan. \u201cEveryone needs a nickname in the team and mine was Vlooi,\u201d explains Leana. \u201cIt actually means flea in Afrikaans... but I\u2019m not tiny and I can\u2019t jump that high. When Casey [Kopua] found that out, she started calling me fleabag.\u201d Shaking her head, she continues, \"My maiden name is du Plooy and someone at my high school gave me that nickname because it rhymed. Irene [van Dyk] is probably the reason why it\u2019s stuck!\u201d It\u2019s the friendships in the team that Leana will miss the most, especially with Irene, Maria Tutaia, Cathrine Latu, Grace Rasmussen and Anna Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/leana-de-bruin", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nLeana de Bruin was born on 9 July, 1977 in Bethlehem, South Africa, is a South African-New Zealand netball player.

My English wasn't the greatest and I was quite shy. I didn't feel very well on our little boat trip over there, but I had to be brave because I didn't want to come across as a bit of a wuss. We went for a few runs in the Stewart Island bush, which was pretty cool, because not many people go there.\n\nIn 1999, the World Champs was played in Christchurch and I played for South Africa then. They chose a world sevens team to come and play against New Zealand in 2000.\n\nSUPPLIED Leana De Bruin is pictured with Bernice Mene, on a Stewart Island beach, during a team photo shoot in 2003.\n\nOur manager for that team was one of the ladies down in Invercargill. She asked if I'd like to come and play for a season in New Zealand. I was like, \"Oh why not?\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Leana de Bruin links with Adelaid Thunderbirds\n\n* In my beauty bag: Silver Fern Leana de Bruin\n\nI had no idea what Invercargill was like. My brother's a pilot in South Africa and one of his co-workers was from New Zealand. When I told him I was going to Invercargill, he looked at me like, \"What have you done!\"\n\nNetball in South Africa wasn't very good and I thought it was a great opportunity to come and learn from the Kiwis. I was pretty nervous, I'm not going to lie about that, especially as my English wasn't great. I knew the basics to help myself but certainly didn't back myself to hold a conversation. Being put into a team with legends like Bernice (Mene) and Lesley Nicol, and Donna Loffhagen, and Adine Wilson - those are big names I'd looked up to and all of a sudden I was in their team.\n\nThey'd come through the ranks together and they'd been there for a while, but they were awesome - Kiwis are just so amazing making you feel welcome.\n\nI find Kiwis talk really fast. (Now I'm one of those who talks really fast when I get excited.) So I had to listen really carefully. But it wasn't so bad because at the end of the day all I needed to understand in English on the netball court is netball terms, which wasn't a problem. It was more in the day-to-day conversations, the confidence thing was a barrier.\n\nWe only played one season together and then she stopped but what I do really remember about Bernice is her laugh - she's got a really contagious laugh. She was real down-to-earth; she was an idol for lots of people and an amazing player but she didn't let that go to her head, she was humble and easy to talk to. She was the one who really explained stuff to me. She didn't get frustrated, she was willing to help.\n\nThe challenging thing for me last year when I did commentating for the first time was, I'd just got out of the team, and I had to talk about my teammates. It does make it challenging to commentate when things aren't going right. But at the end of the day, I've got a different hat on now and that's kind of how I see it. I told them: \"Just play well, then I don't have to say bad things about you.\" Easy.\n\nThe Constellation Cup screens on SKY Sport 3 on October 8 at 2pm, and on SKY Sport 2 on October 11 at 9.30pm, and on October 14 at 5pm."}, {"url": "https://www.nowtolove.co.nz/celebrity/celeb-news/former-silver-fern-leana-de-bruin-on-why-shes-leaving-nz-34666", "page_content": "The netball star is moving across the ditch but vows she will return.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those lessons you tend to learn with age \u2013 how to trust your gut. Former Silver Fern Leana de Bruin wishes she\u2019d learnt it a little earlier in life, with the stunning netballer admitting there have been a few instances where a bit of trusting her first instincts would have come in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt a few lessons along the way,\u201d Leana says with a wry smile. So when it came to making the decision to move across the Tasman for a one-year contract with the Adelaide Thunderbirds, Leana (40) knew what she had to do \u2013 and three months later, the star defender knows her gut was 100% spot on. While it\u2019s a big call to leave New Zealand \u2013 pulling her seven-year-old son Caleb out of his school and leaving her partner behind \u2013 Leana says she wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave netball behind. Plus, she knew if she turned down this opportunity to play in Australia\u2019s netball league, she\u2019d always wonder, \u2018what if?\u2019. \u201cI was definitely at a bit of a crossroads,\u201d says Leana, who last year captained new team the Northern Stars in New Zealand\u2019s new ANZ Premiership.\n\nCaleb is heading to Adelaide with Leana.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018 Do I retire? Do I go one more year?\u2019 And then, all of a sudden, this came up. So I figured if they thought I was still good enough to be there, then I\u2019d give it one more year. Plus, I still have a lot of fire in my belly.\u201d She continues, \u201cI did get a little overwhelmed making the decision. I did feel responsible for the Stars in some way \u2013 we didn\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped this year and I know there\u2019s huge potential. \u201cBut, at the same time, I\u2019d reached the stage in my career where, and it sounds so horrible, I had to be a little bit selfish and do what I wanted.\u201d So Leana and Caleb are preparing to make the move to Adelaide in the New Year, with the duo both very excited to experience a new city, culture and in Leana\u2019s case, some of South Australia\u2019s famous wine! \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be able to enjoy it too much during the season, but after the season is a different story!\u201d she laughs.\n\nThe star represented New Zealand 104 times before retiring from international netball in 2016.\n\n\u201cBut we are really looking forward to it. I asked Caleb about it, because this would mean spending less time with his dad [Leana\u2019s ex-husband Quinton]. But, as Caleb pointed out, it\u2019s not forever and he said to me, \u2018Mum, we\u2019ll just FaceTime him!\u2019 I video call my parents every Sunday in South Africa, it\u2019s a bit of a tradition, so Caleb said, \u2018If you do that with your mum and dad, I\u2019ll do it with mine.\u2019 It was very cute.\u201d Leana, who describes herself as a farm girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of love for big cities, is adamant that this is a one-year move \u2013 home for both her and Caleb is their farmhouse in the Waikato. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t see myself living in Australia,\u201d she tells. \u201cI have a partner here. He was very supportive as well. He said if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d regret it one day. It\u2019s better to know than wonder! And Adelaide is only a flight away.\u201d She acknowledges that playing for an Australian team for the first time in her career was a big decision. Leana, who has represented New Zealand 104 times and her native South Africa in 34 tests, feels a huge loyalty to Aotearoa and the people here who gave her the opportunities that have led her to this point."}, {"url": "https://www.reallife.nz/guests/leana-de-bruin", "page_content": "Leana De Bruin\n\nBeginning her international career in South Africa where she earned 34 caps, Leana moved to NZ in 2001 and joined the Southern Sting.\n\nShe made the Silver Ferns squad a year later and solidified her place in the team, being part of the victorious 2003 World Championship and the 2006 and 2010 Commonwealth Games gold medal winning teams.\n\nNamed \"Player of the Match\" in the recent final of the ANZ Championship, Leana played an integral role in the first Kiwi team to claim the trans-tasman title.\n\nLeana lives with her husband Quinton and their son on a farm just outside Hamilton.\n\nThe audio from this interview has not been uploaded.

The 40-year-old was a key cog in getting the new team up-and-running in the New Zealand league where she took on a senior role both on and off the court.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved my time with the Northern Stars,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a great leadership role for me in helping to establish a new team and culture with some of New Zealand\u2019s next generation of netballers.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had had thoughts of retiring but Adelaide approached me and it was an opportunity to try something different before I hang up the netball dress for good.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorthern Stars general manager Tim Hamilton said he had seen de Bruin become an inspirational leader who was a tireless worker at every level of the game.\n\n\n\n\u201cPersonally I have worked with Leana in three teams now \u2013 the Force, Magic and Stars so it is certainly an end of an era in New Zealand netball for one of the game greats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can only wish her well for her next netballing endeavour and thank her for what she accomplished in the Stars strip.\u201d\n\n\n\nDe Bruin ended her impressive international career last year having played 138 tests \u2013 104 for New Zealand and 34 for South Africa.

After retiring from international netball last month, even Leana\u2019s a little surprised at how happy she is post-Ferns. After all, it\u2019s a team she was a part of for a staggering 14 years, notching up 104 test caps in the black dress, and before that, 34 for her native South Africa. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s given her everything \u2013 a career as a professional sportswoman, her closest friends and a new home in New Zealand. And apart from being Mum to the very energetic and vivacious Caleb, netball remains her greatest passion. Leana\u2019s decision to hang up her now well-worn bib was incredibly tough but, as the 1.90m defender concedes, it was time.\n\n\u201cMy body couldn\u2019t take it any more,\u201d the no-nonsense netball stalwart says. \u201cI went into the Silver Fern trials with an open mind, but my ankle was giving me grief the whole season. The Ferns environment is tough and I was battling. I couldn\u2019t give 100 per cent, so I said to [Silver Ferns coach] Janine [Southby] before she made the final decision, I think it\u2019s time. And it was. I was always going to be playing in pain and I didn\u2019t want to do that any more.\u201d Still, it was hard to let go of a 14-year tenure that\u2019s seen her win a world championship, two Commonwealth Games and an ANZ Championship title. \u201cPart of me still wanted to be a part of it,\u201d she admits. \u201cI wanted to finish on a game, rather than just randomly like I had to. But, unfortunately, you know, life takes funny turns. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d And fate was the reason a 22-year-old Leana ended up in Aotearoa in the first place. After the 1999 World Championships, a World Seven invitational team was formed to play against the Silver Ferns in New Zealand, and Leana jumped at the chance to be a part of it.\n\n\u201cThe manager of that team was from Invercargill. I was chatting with her and I mentioned how cool it would be to come over and play in New Zealand, and then she asked me!\u201d Three years later, Leana was a surprise selection for the Silver Ferns and lined up for her debut in 2003. Soon, she found herself up against her former team. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe hardest part was hearing the South African national anthem. I couldn\u2019t sing that, I had to sing the New Zealand one. That got the heartstrings, for sure. But for some reason, it also felt right, as hard as it was. I was immensely proud to be wearing that black dress.\u201d Now Leana\u2019s a true blue Kiwi \u2013 a fact reinforced by her New Zealand-born and All Black fanatic son Caleb, whom she\u2019s thrilled to be spending more time with.\n\nLeana played for the Silver Ferns for the past 14 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loving the fact I\u2019m home a bit more now. Every afternoon, we\u2019ll have a bit of a rugby game or a kicking contest in the backyard,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows everything there is to know about the All Blacks, he has the same birthday as Kieran Read, which he just thinks is the coolest thing ever. He\u2019s playing rippa at the moment, but moves onto tackle rugby next year. \u201cHe does understand that I\u2019m not playing with the Ferns any more, but he does keep asking when we\u2019re going away again, because we\u2019ve been used to travelling a lot! It is a little weird to him that all of a sudden, Mum\u2019s home every weekend.\u201d As far as a new plan goes, spending time with her son is at the top of Leana\u2019s list, as well as being \u201ca good tenant\u201d and helping her landlords, Laurie and Jo, look after the farm and the animals. But Leana has found she\u2019s been unable to let go of netball completely. While she currently can\u2019t confirm if she is playing in either the new South Auckland-based team for the inaugural New Zealand elite league or is seeking an Australian contract, Leana reckons she might have one more year of domestic netball in her.\n\nAnd she\u2019s also scored coaching gigs overseas, as well as ambassador work for Netball New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in netball world!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think I would have been totally depressed if I had to ask myself,\n\n\u2018What next?\u2019, but the transition from player to ambassador has been quite easy. Netball New Zealand has been great.\u201d Along with moving into a more mentor-based netball role, where she\u2019s keen to share her experience and wisdom, she also has a very important event to plan \u2013 Caleb\u2019s upcoming seventh birthday party. \u201cI had planned to still be playing netball at the end of October, when his birthday is, so now that I\u2019m not, we get to organise the party together, which is really exciting. This will only be the second time in his life that I\u2019m home for his birthday because we\u2019ve always been playing overseas.\u201d She\u2019s also looking forward to spending some more time with her new partner, who lives in South Auckland. \u201cYup, there\u2019s a bit of a dude hanging around. It\u2019s quite nice,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice \u2013 well, it sounds horrible \u2013 but we\u2019re not in each other\u2019s face all the time! So the distance thing works. But it does help when you\u2019re not playing; you have a bit more time to fit everything in and the headspace too.\u201d\n\nWith her Silver Fern team mates.\n\nCaleb is keen on a caravan trip around the North Island too, but Leana admits she isn\u2019t so sure about that plan. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I feel about that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to attempt it!\u201d Still, Leana says she can\u2019t quite shake a few old habits, such as keeping up with the gym sessions. \u201cI know that sounds a bit weird, but I love training!\u201d she tells. \u201cThough now I can just cruise on the bike, instead of going a million miles an hour, and then afterwards, I have time to catch up with friends, have a coffee and go for a walk.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s blissfully happy with her new, less structured and more relaxed life, Leana knows netball will always be in her blood, and the woman her Silver Fern team-mates know as Vlooi will always be somewhere in the background, coaching, mentoring or simply as a fan. \u201cEveryone needs a nickname in the team and mine was Vlooi,\u201d explains Leana. \u201cIt actually means flea in Afrikaans... but I\u2019m not tiny and I can\u2019t jump that high. When Casey [Kopua] found that out, she started calling me fleabag.\u201d Shaking her head, she continues, \"My maiden name is du Plooy and someone at my high school gave me that nickname because it rhymed. Irene [van Dyk] is probably the reason why it\u2019s stuck!\u201d It\u2019s the friendships in the team that Leana will miss the most, especially with Irene, Maria Tutaia, Cathrine Latu, Grace Rasmussen and Anna Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.nowtolove.co.nz/news/real-life/leana-de-bruin-im-happy-being-single-6585", "page_content": "The Silver Fern is embracing her new life after separating from her husband.\n\nLeana de Bruin knows how lucky she is to have a certain guy in her life. Tall and energetic, with a smile that lights up the room, Leana's favourite chap never fails to be there for the Silver Fern, with cuddles and heart-melting words of endearment. He also has a serious fascination with superheroes and loves a good juice box. Since Leana split from her husband two years ago, it's been four-year-old Caleb who has occupied the number-one spot in the netballer's life. And though it took months of soul-searching to get her to where she is today, Leana (36) is adamant that she's never been in a better place \u2013 as a happy single mum. \"Life is really good right now,\" Leana says, as she watches Caleb zoom around the backyard of her Cambridge home, Batman cape fanning out behind him as he wields a stick that he says is his new \"waterblaster\". \"I mean, being a single mum isn't without certain challenges, and sometimes it's pretty scary. But I'm a very determined person, and if the last few years have taught me anything, it's that it's amazing how strong you can be when you have to be \u2013 especially when you're responsible for someone else.\" With Caleb now \"man of the house\" \u2013 a title he takes very seriously, Leana adds \u2013 the 6ft 3in (1.9m) netballer says she lives for the moments she gets to spend with her son. \"He makes me a stronger person,\" she says with a smile.\n\n\"Netball was my all before I had Caleb. I think, at times, I tried too hard. Now, the balance is good. I'm more settled. Netball is still super important, but at the end of the day it's a game, and my little fella loves me whether I win or lose. He gives me perspective.\" Although she makes no bones about going through her separation, a time she describes as \"hard\", Leana, who has played 66 tests for New Zealand and 34 for her native South Africa, has emerged from the experience a different woman \u2013 a far more confident and self-assured one. \"There's been change everywhere!\" Leana admits. \"But having to sort all this stuff out made me realise that I don't have anyone else to help me make decisions. I have to do it myself, and I have to believe that what I'm doing is right for\n\nCaleb and me.\" \"I know what my body needs, and I've now got this confidence to stand up for myself. One thing I have figured out is that in my next relationship, I'll say how I feel. What you see is what you get, and he can take it or leave it!\" The new and improved Leana is also a better mother, she believes \u2013 one that can balance her career with her duties as a parent. \"It's quality time over quantity, definitely,\" she says. \"And I always promised myself, although I love him to bits, that I would never stop doing what I love. So we do it all \u2013 netball, kindy, time at home.\"\n\nLeana has a great relationship with Caleb's dad \u2013 Quinton. And it's something she's incredibly thankful for. \"We talk, and laugh about Caleb,\" she says. \"We agreed to make the situation work.\" \"He's an amazing dad \u2013 we share custody, so Caleb's there every other week. It makes me appreciate every little bit of time we have, and you do feel guilty sometimes. You have children for a reason, but you can't forget yourself.\" As Caleb comes tearing back into the house, minus his waterblaster, Leana scoops him up into a bear hug. \"Mum's hair is bumpy!\" he exclaims, running his fingers through Leana's just-set curls. \"It gets harder and harder to leave him, though,\" she admits. \"When we go away with the Silver Ferns, we're gone for weeks on end. Some people say it gets easier, but he's a real personality at the moment, and you miss out on all those things. He'll say, 'Oh no, not netball again,' when I'm leaving.\"\n\nSilver lining: Since the split, Leana has discovered a new confidence, and cherishes every second with her son, Caleb."}, {"url": "https://www.newsroom.co.nz/silver-fern-legend-de-bruin-inveigled-by-aussies", "page_content": "Suzanne McFadden is a contributing writer to LockerRoom, dedicated to women's sport, and is the 2021 Voyager Media Awards Sports Journalist of the Year\n\nLockerRoom\n\nThunderbirds a surprise go for netball legend De Bruin\n\nOn the cusp of retirement, Silver Ferns centurion Leana de Bruin has been coaxed across the Tasman to taste a new intensity on the netball court. Suzanne McFadden reports.\n\nLeana de Bruin had planned to be \u201cunemployed and a beach bum\u201d by now.\n\nBut even the best-laid plans of a sporting star can go a little askew. And, in this case, it may be all for the better \u2013 for both herself and New Zealand netball.\n\nDe Bruin, now 40, had come to the realisation she missed the intensity of international netball, having hung up her black dress two years ago. So she pushed aside notions of retirement, and allowed herself to be lured across the Tasman, to play a leading role in Australia\u2019s Super Netball league.\n\nAs for her probability of becoming beach bum, she is, at least, living by the sea - near the popular white-sand beach of Glenelg in Adelaide. And, even though she\u2019s near the end of a long and glittering playing career, de Bruin has found herself gainfully employed, as captain of the Adelaide Thunderbirds.\n\nYesterday she began her what is essentially the third phase of her playing career, leading out the multi-national Thunderbirds in their season opener against the West Coast Fever.\n\nIt was a baptism of fire, as goal keep de Bruin found herself up against an old nemesis \u2013 former Southern Steel shooter Jhaniele Fowler-Reid. The towering Jamaican superstar made a stunning debut for the Fever: by three-quarter time, she was already the highest scorer in any Super Netball game. \u201cAnd I thought I\u2019d got rid of her,\u201d de Bruin says. Fowler-Reid ended up with 66 goals, consigning the Thunderbirds to a 74-56 defeat.\n\nPlaying in Australia, and at this level, is not something de Bruin saw in her future. \u201cNever in a million years would I have imagined this,\u201d she says. \u201cHonestly, sometimes I have to pinch myself. I never thought that people would think I was actually still good enough to compete on this side of the ditch.\u201d\n\nThis won\u2019t be a long-term gig. Of that, de Bruin is certain. But she hopes it will ultimately help in her big-picture goal of coaching at the elite level of netball back in New Zealand.\n\nDe Bruin had thought she was satisfied with her netball lot - 104 internationals for the Silver Ferns, and before that, 34 for the South African Proteas. For years an integral part of the victorious Magic side \u2013 including the only time a New Zealand team won the trans-Tasman league - she helped the new Northern Stars franchise get a foothold in the inaugural ANZ Premiership last season.\n\nBut just as that competition wrapped up last July, de Bruin got an unexpected long-distance call from Dan Ryan, the head coach of the Thunderbirds.\n\n\u201cHe asked what were the chances of me coming over to Adelaide to play for them. At the time, my answer was like: \u2018Probably zero\u2019,\u201d she recalls.\n\n\u201cI was thinking of my family and how would I make it work?\u201d\n\nA sea change would mean de Bruin and her eight-year-old son, Caleb, leaving their home on a farm in the Waikato; Caleb moving further away from his dad, and de Bruin from her new partner.\n\n\u201cBut Dan\u2019s a man who uses his words very well, and he convinced me to sit down and work out how we could make it happen. I talked it through with family, and at the end of the day, we had a plan we could all agree on. And now I\u2019m here,\u201d she says.\n\nAs Caleb starts at his new school today, his mum will be musing over her first day in Australia\u2019s premier league.\n\nUnlike New Zealand\u2019s elite competition, the Suncorp Super Netball league allows unlimited access to overseas players. The Thunderbirds \u2013 who struggled last season, scoring only one win - have taken full advantage, with the team laden with players who have turned out for five different Commonwealth nations.\n\n\u201cNot that New Zealand\u2019s competition has easy games, but there are so many international players in this league, it has more of an international netball feel about it, compared to what we have at home. It makes it a tougher competition to be part of,\u201d de Bruin says. \u201cThat was one of the big drawcards for me, because I do miss the international intensity.\u201d\n\nAmong the new-look T\u2019Birds are South African captain Bongiwe Msomi, Commonwealth Games gold medallist and Australian Diamond-turned-English Rose, Chelsea Pitman, and young Jamaican shooter Shimona Nelson, who came into the side to cover for former Silver Fern Cat Tuivaiti, on her way back from knee surgery.\n\n\u201cWe are very diverse bunch, and it took a while to bring us all together,\u201d de Bruin says. \u201cBut I think we all complement each other really well. Everybody respects each other and wants the team to be better than last year.\n\n\u201cEveryone asks me \u2018how\u2019s the body?\u2019 And it\u2019s great. Without those test matches now, I\u2019m pretty fresh. You just train smarter when you\u2019re my age.\u201d\n\nRyan headhunted de Bruin for her competitiveness and tenacity. \u201cWhen under pressure she wants to be the person who wins the ball for the team and that is leadership,\u201d he told the Adelaide Advertiser. She was a natural fit for the captaincy, he said, quickly winning the respect of the team.\n\nDe Bruin admits she is unfazed by the leadership role. \u201cI\u2019m really there to play as best I can,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd probably teach as well, share my experience. I enjoy the pressure that comes with the captaincy - it makes me play better. And I\u2019m a firm believer in leading by example.\u201d\n\nShe hopes the experience in a different environment will add to her credentials towards becoming a leading netball coach. Back in New Zealand, she had her own business, travelling the country providing specialist coaching sessions in schools and clubs. \u201cI\u2019d like to tap into what I\u2019ve learned here, and at home, to become a good coach in the long run,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough the grass may look greener on that side of the Tasman, de Bruin reckons from what she's experienced so far, the differences between the two netballing nations are minimal. \u201cWe all play the same game, and do the same kind of training,\" she says. \u201cWhile we\u2019re pretty fortunate in Adelaide, with netball well supported by the media, we\u2019re still a small fish competing against AFL for the public\u2019s attention. It\u2019s certainly not as big as it in New Zealand.\u201d\n\nShe feels a real sense of sadness for the Silver Ferns, and their recent downhill slide. She found the Commonwealth Games \u201cextremely hard to watch\u201d.\n\n\u201cI really feel for the girls. I\u2019ve been there when things haven\u2019t gone right, but this just seemed a lot tougher,\u201d she says.\n\nDespite this detour in her life plan, de Bruin is adamant she won\u2019t be returning to the international scene, and realistically knows the end of her playing days is near.\n\n\"Now that Caleb is getting older, it's time for us to concentrate on him doing what he wants to do,\" she says. \u201cAll he talks about is being a professional sportsperson, so hopefully he will.\u201d\n\nShe vows to bring her young rugby player back to New Zealand before he becomes with gripped by South Australia\u2019s favourite game of footie."}], "Leana de Bruin is a former netball player.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Leana_de_Bruin", "page_content": "Leana de Bruin (n\u00e9e du Plooy) (born 9 July 1977) is a South African and New Zealand international netball player.

De Bruin, now 40, has been playing netball for various regional teams ever since, and lives on a farm in the Waikato.\n\nEach week we ask a well-known Kiwi to share a photo memory. Leana de Bruin, a former Silver Fern who will play for Adelaide next year, is a commentator for this month's Constellation Cup.\n\nLEANA: I must confess I had to put a brave face on, being the new kid on the block from South Africa. My English wasn't the greatest and I was quite shy. I didn't feel very well on our little boat trip over there, but I had to be brave because I didn't want to come across as a bit of a wuss. We went for a few runs in the Stewart Island bush, which was pretty cool, because not many people go there.\n\nIn 1999, the World Champs was played in Christchurch and I played for South Africa then. They chose a world sevens team to come and play against New Zealand in 2000.\n\nSUPPLIED Leana De Bruin is pictured with Bernice Mene, on a Stewart Island beach, during a team photo shoot in 2003.\n\nOur manager for that team was one of the ladies down in Invercargill.

I was like, \"Oh why not?\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Leana de Bruin links with Adelaid Thunderbirds\n\n* In my beauty bag: Silver Fern Leana de Bruin\n\nI had no idea what Invercargill was like. My brother's a pilot in South Africa and one of his co-workers was from New Zealand. When I told him I was going to Invercargill, he looked at me like, \"What have you done!\"\n\nNetball in South Africa wasn't very good and I thought it was a great opportunity to come and learn from the Kiwis. I was pretty nervous, I'm not going to lie about that, especially as my English wasn't great. I knew the basics to help myself but certainly didn't back myself to hold a conversation. Being put into a team with legends like Bernice (Mene) and Lesley Nicol, and Donna Loffhagen, and Adine Wilson - those are big names I'd looked up to and all of a sudden I was in their team.\n\nThey'd come through the ranks together and they'd been there for a while, but they were awesome - Kiwis are just so amazing making you feel welcome.\n\nI find Kiwis talk really fast. (Now I'm one of those who talks really fast when I get excited.) So I had to listen really carefully. But it wasn't so bad because at the end of the day all I needed to understand in English on the netball court is netball terms, which wasn't a problem. It was more in the day-to-day conversations, the confidence thing was a barrier.\n\nWe only played one season together and then she stopped but what I do really remember about Bernice is her laugh - she's got a really contagious laugh. She was real down-to-earth; she was an idol for lots of people and an amazing player but she didn't let that go to her head, she was humble and easy to talk to. She was the one who really explained stuff to me. She didn't get frustrated, she was willing to help.\n\nThe challenging thing for me last year when I did commentating for the first time was, I'd just got out of the team, and I had to talk about my teammates. It does make it challenging to commentate when things aren't going right. But at the end of the day, I've got a different hat on now and that's kind of how I see it.

It also helps she's a familiar face, with many sponsors already having a rapport from her days at the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic.\n\n\"She's such a personable person and loves interacting with people, she's made for a role where she deals with people, for sure,\" Shirtcliff said.\n\nMARK TAYLOR/STUFF A 'people person' - Leana de Bruin's bubbly personality is one which is well suited to her new role.\n\n\"She's just got so much energy.

So when it came to making the decision to move across the Tasman for a one-year contract with the Adelaide Thunderbirds, Leana (40) knew what she had to do \u2013 and three months later, the star defender knows her gut was 100% spot on. While it\u2019s a big call to leave New Zealand \u2013 pulling her seven-year-old son Caleb out of his school and leaving her partner behind \u2013 Leana says she wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave netball behind.

I asked Caleb about it, because this would mean spending less time with his dad [Leana\u2019s ex-husband Quinton]. But, as Caleb pointed out, it\u2019s not forever and he said to me, \u2018Mum, we\u2019ll just FaceTime him!\u2019 I video call my parents every Sunday in South Africa, it\u2019s a bit of a tradition, so Caleb said, \u2018If you do that with your mum and dad, I\u2019ll do it with mine.\u2019 It was very cute.\u201d Leana, who describes herself as a farm girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of love for big cities, is adamant that this is a one-year move \u2013 home for both her and Caleb is their farmhouse in the Waikato. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t see myself living in Australia,\u201d she tells. \u201cI have a partner here.

With netball on hold due to the outbreak of COVID-19 Draft Central has decided to take a look at those players and their international careers and what could have been. Next in line is former Silver Ferns and Spar Proteas defender Leana de Bruin.\n\nStarting off her career with South Africa, de Bruin played 34 international caps for the Proteas before transitioning to the Silver Ferns in 2000 where she racked up a whopping 104 international caps in the black dress. She was as consistent as they came for the Spar Proteas acting as a real wall down in defence and using her smothering style of pressure to halt any easy movement into the attacking third. De Bruin was a commanding influence for South Africa throughout her time able to lead her side on court with her impressive vision and ball handling skills.\n\nA member of the New Zealand Silver Ferns, de Bruin was a key cog in the defensive circle with her hands over pressure, speed off the mark and tagging style of defence. She was hardly ever beaten in a one on one given her strength and general netball nous to work around the body of her opponent. Renowned for her physical pressure and aerial ability de Bruin was a constant pain in any goalers side, able to ruffle their feathers and create turnovers.\n\nHer connection with the likes of Katrina Rore and Casey Kopua was electric with the trio able to cause all sorts of havoc down back. Their zone style of defence was what made them such a formidable unit able to transition well and continue that high pressure intensity. She well and truly cemented herself in the squad becoming the fifth player to notch up over 100 tests with her hard-working mentality constantly on display. While her defensive pressure was a clear asset for the Ferns it was her ability to bring the ball down the court and provide attacking options that also made her a force to be reckoned with.\n\nShe has had a decorated career, with the highly touted defender lucky enough to feature in five Netball World Cups \u2013 one for South Africa in 1999 and the next four in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 with New Zealand. Her dominance did not stop there with de Bruin also playing in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games for the Ferns. Throughout her time, she tasted plenty of success filling the trophy cabinet with gold and silver medals.\n\nAfter switching to the Silver Ferns, it is fair to say that de Bruin\u2019s services were well and truly missed for the Spar Proteas who at times lacked that X-factor she possessed. Her ability to read the flight of the ball and inject herself into the game was second to none able to make something out of nothing more times than not given her long reaching arms and footwork."}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/netball/5023485/Leana-De-Bruin-delighted-by-netball-MVP-win", "page_content": "RELAXED: Southern Steel defender and joint MVP Leana de Bruin and her 19-month-old son Caleb at home in Waikato.\n\nSouthern Steel defender Leana de Bruin is putting her sensational season down to finding the right balance between the rigours of top-level netball and family life.\n\nThe 44-cap Silver Fern has been jointly named the trans-Tasman netball league's most valuable player with Queensland Firebirds' shooter Natalie Medhurst.\n\nShe was struggling to comprehend the news yesterday.\n\n\"It was a bit of a surprise,\"de Bruin said.\n\n\"I was like `are you for real'? It feels a little bit surreal still, but it's definitely a nice feeling.\"\n\nDe Bruin's achievement is remarkable considering that Steel only won four of their 13 games this season.\n\nShe was a more than worthy recipient of the award, however, with the South African native in brilliant touch for an underperforming Steel side. She led the ANZ Championship in deflections and was second for both intercepts and rebounds.\n\nDe Bruin was also named in the inaugural ANZ Championship All Star Seven team this year, pipping Firebirds' standout Laura Geitz for the starting goal keep berth.\n\nThe 33-year-old de Bruin has played some of the best netball of her career since switching to Steel two years ago. This year, she has commuted between her Hamilton home and Invercargill, which allowed her to spend time with her 19-month-old son Caleb and train individually before joining her Steel team-mates later in the week.\n\nDe Bruin said she often felt guilty being away from her team-mates, which forced her to train harder than she normally would, and credited having the best of both worlds for her remarkable play this year.\n\n\"I had a good balance. When I worked (in Hamilton), I worked really hard. I felt bad being away from the girls. I had to do my bit at home and did a little bit extra because I knew the girls would have been working hard as well.\"\n\nWith so many talented players in the ANZ Championship, de Bruin said it was a real honour to claim the prestigious trophy with Medhurst.\n\n\"There's so many awesome players in this league and they just seem to get better and better. Getting older does help. The older I get, the wiser I get. It's a great privilege really.\"\n\nIn the closest MVP race in the competition's history, de Bruin and Medhurst each scored 18 votes with Queensland's Romelda Aiken, West Coast's Caitlin Bassett and Adelaide midcourter Natalie von Bertouch all gaining 16 votes.\n\nVotes are awarded by national selectors from Australia and New Zealand, who nominate the three most outstanding players on court at every game on a 3-2-1 basis.\n\nIt is the second year in a row a Steel player has taken out the ANZ Championship's MVP gong with midcourter Liana Leota winning the award last season.\n\nWith strong competition for places in the Silver Ferns' defensive circle in world championship year, de Bruin set her sights on a strong campaign with Steel. She rated 2011 as one of her finest seasons on the netball court and was now turning her attentions towards backing up last year's Commonwealth Games gold with a world championship title in Singapore in July.\n\n\"I want to be one of those players that makes history in winning a world championship after Commonwealth Games gold.\n\n\" I'm on a mission to make that happen,\" de Bruin said.\n\n\"It's awesome to have so many different styles of play (in our defensive end). We want to win, whatever it takes. We're lucky to have so many options.\"\n\nWith Robyn Broughton not returning as Steel coach next year, de Bruin said she would have to talk to the franchise's new coach and weigh up her options, before committing herself for a third season in the powder blue dress.\n\n\"I haven't thought about it too much. There's still lots to be decided,\" she said.\n\n\"It depends who the coach is and whether they will allow me to commute. There's a lot of unknowns at the moment. It's pretty hard to say.\""}]}
