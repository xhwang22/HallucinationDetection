He served (1971\u201374) on the Inner London Education Authority and was its chair in 1973, before working as a special adviser to Labour Party cabinet ministers Barbara Castle (1974\u201376) and Peter Shore (1976\u201377). After a brief stint as a television researcher, Straw entered Parliament in 1979 as MP for Castle\u2019s former seat of Blackburn, Lancashire. He rose steadily through Labour\u2019s ranks and was elected to the party\u2019s opposition shadow cabinet in 1987. During the party\u2019s internal ideological conflict in the 1980s, he moved from being a traditional left-winger to becoming a more centrist modernizer. He was the first leading member of the Labour Party to propose that it repeal its socialist commitment\u2014Clause IV of the party\u2019s constitution\u2014to the state control of industry. In 1994 Straw managed Tony Blair\u2019s successful campaign to be elected party leader, and one of Blair\u2019s first acts on becoming leader was to win the party\u2019s agreement to rewrite Clause IV.\n\nFollowing Labour\u2019s election victory in 1997, Straw was appointed home secretary. He quickly established his progressive credentials by setting up an inquiry into charges of racism in the London police force, promoting the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and refusing to allow the former Chilean head of state, Augusto Pinochet, to return home following Pinochet\u2019s October 1998 arrest in London. (The arrest followed a request by the Spanish government that Pinochet be extradited to Spain to face charges of murder. He was allowed to return to Chile in March 2000 when a panel of doctors advised that he was unfit to face trial.) Straw upset many progressives, however, by initiating legislation to withdraw the right of some defendants to be tried by a jury, introducing stricter requirements for people seeking political asylum in Great Britain, diluting Labour\u2019s pre-1997 election promise to establish a freedom of information law, and resisting calls to decriminalize the consumption of so-called \u201csoft\u201d drugs, such as marijuana.\n\nIn a 2001 cabinet reshuffle, Straw received the foreign and Commonwealth affairs portfolio. As foreign minister, Straw supported the invasion of Iraq as well as the expansion of the European Union (EU). Despite the latter position, however, Straw was a known skeptic of the euro, the EU\u2019s single currency. Shortly after Labour\u2019s poor showing in the May 2006 local elections, Blair overhauled his cabinet, and Straw was removed as foreign minister and made leader of the House of Commons. Later that year he caused controversy when he stated that Muslim women should not wear full veils. After Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007, Straw was named justice secretary and lord chancellor, thereby becoming the first member of the House of Commons to take up the latter post. The following year he outlined potential reforms to the House of Lords, which included the election of a certain percentage of members and a reduction in the number of lords. In 2009 he sparked debate after stating that oil deals with Libya had played a \u201cvery big part\u201d in the decision to release Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi\u2014a Libyan convicted of bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988\u2014from a Scottish prison. In the general election of 2010 Straw easily retained his Blackburn constituency but lost his cabinet position when Labour was ousted from office. In February 2015 Straw temporarily resigned from the Labour Party after allegations surfaced of his involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that resulted from a sting investigation conducted by Channel Four and The Daily Telegraph. Having already announced in 2013 that he would not stand for reelection, Straw retired from the House of Commons in 2015."}, {"url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jack-straw", "page_content": "Rt Hon Jack Straw was appointed in July 2015 as a Member of the Independent Commission on Freedom of Information.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw's maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family. Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\"\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978 he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006 Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. They have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nHe supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015 He was Given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "http://www.quizmonkey.net/history/great%20offices.htm", "page_content": "Quiz Monkey What do you want to know?\n\nThe 'Great Offices of State'\n\nOnce upon a time, in England, there were Great Officers of State. Wikipedia lists nine of them. Some of these offices still exist; some of them have been merged with more up\u2013to\u2013date posts; others have fallen by the wayside.\n\nIn some cases at least, the titles of the nine Great Officers can sound quite arcane to modern ears. They were satirised by Gilbert & Sullivan in The Mikado \u2013 where Ko\u2013Ko was the Lord High Executioner, and Pooh\u2013Bah was the Lord High Everything Else.\n\nNowadays, you will sometimes hear mention of \"the four Great Offices of State\". This (usually) refers to the offices of Prime Minister, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nThis page covers both the traditional Great Officers and the modern Great Offices. I hope this will help to resolve any confusion, and not add to it ...\n\nPrime Ministers are covered in Prime Ministers: Classified and Prime Ministers: Details. This page lists the people who have held the other three Great Offices \u2013 Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer \u2013 since 1945. It also lists the nine traditional \"Great Officers\".\n\nYou may find further details about the people listed on this page in Members of Parliament.\n\nThe Nine Traditional \"Great Officers of State\"\n\nIn order of precedence (starting with the most senior):\n\nOnce the most powerful position in England: generally vacant since 1421, and only appointed to serve at a coronation, where he bears St. Edward's Crown; up to 1948, also presided over the trials of peers in the House of Lords Lord High Steward Responsible for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts; up to 2007, presided over proceedings in the House of Lords; also up to 2007, was the head of the judiciary in England and Wales; the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005 transferred these responsibilities to the Lord Speaker and the Lord Chief Justice respectively; also acts as the custodian of the Great Seal of the Realm, which is used to symbolise the Sovereign's approval of important state documents; from 2005\u20137, this position was held jointly with that of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs; since 2007, it has been held jointly with the position of Secretary of State for Justice Lord (High) Chancellor Head of the government department with responsibility for public finance and economic policies; since the 17th century, these powers have been in the hands of a board, of which the Prime Minister is normally the First Lord and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord Lord High Treasurer Responsible for presiding over meetings of the Privy Council, presenting business for the monarch's approval; in modern times, this is a Cabinet post in its own right Lord President of the Council Traditionally the custodian of the monarch's personal seal (as opposed to the Great Seal of the Realm); nowadays a sinecure, normally combined with the position of Leader of the House of Lords or Commons (which confers membership of the Cabinet) Lord (Keeper of the) Privy Seal Officer in charge of the Palace of Westminster (a hereditary post) Lord Great Chamberlain Traditionally, commander of the royal armies and Master of the Horse (with responsibility for the sovereign's horses and hounds);

also oversees the College of Arms, which is responsible for heraldic matters Earl Marshal Titular head of the Royal Navy; title vested in the sovereign in 1964, following the abolition of the Board of Commissioners and the position of First Lord of the Admiralty; bestowed by the Queen on the Duke of Edinburgh in 2011, on the occasion of his 90th birthday Lord High Admiral\n\nLord Chancellor\n\nOf the nine Great Officers, I reckon the only one that's had any real relevance within the memory of anyone who's still partaking in quizzes is the Lord Chancellor.\n\nAs we've seen, the main responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor were transferred in 2007 to the Lord Speaker and the Lord Chief Justice; since 2007, the title has been held jointly with that of Secretary of State for Justice.\n\nThis section lists the last six people to hold the position of Lord Chancellor, including the incumbent in 2005 when it was combined with that of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs (and Secretary of State for Justice since 2007).\n\n1970\u20134 Heath Son of a previous Lord Chancellor, whose father had played football for Wanderers, Old Etonians and Scotland;

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010, the others being Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election.\n\nIn February 2015 Channel 4 Dispatches and The Daily Telegraph accused Straw of impropriety following a meeting they set up with a fictitious Chinese company. Straw strongly denied the allegations and referred himself to Parliament\u2019s Commissioner for Standards. In September 2015 the Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute and criticised Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph\u2019s conduct.\n\nEarly life\n\nJack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw, an insurance salesman, and Joan Sylvia Gilbey. After his father left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). Straw himself is a Christian.\n\nJack Straw was educated at Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"\n\nStraw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968, he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, to be defeated by Trevor Fisk. However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978.\n\nA motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 removed Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for asylum and immigration bill and limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007 the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board.\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979\u20132015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987\u20131997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.\n\nHome Secretary (1997\u20132001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building\u2014a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nOn 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\".\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments, but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.\n\nThe Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying \u201c there was a \"specific problem\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \"target vulnerable young white girls\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \u201ceasy meat\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"\n\nForeign & Commonwealth Secretary (2001\u20132006)\n\nStraw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice Straw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\".\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (-12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \"egregious group\", and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nStraw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001. Straw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006\u20132007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\" He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007\u20132010)\n\nStraw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn Straw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'\n\nExpenses claims\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010 - present)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n\nIn 2013, at a round table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Jack Straw (who has Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \"obsession\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Jack Straw's comments \"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows:\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's \"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\" In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\" He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \"Jewish money\", Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \"Israeli lobby\" and \"the problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\" and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed comments referring to \"Jewish money\".\n\nCash for Access\n\nIn February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \"under the radar\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him \u00a360,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Commissioner on Parliamentary Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \u201c[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\u201d. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [a bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\u201d She said that \"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \"neither exaggerated nor boasted\" in what he said to the reporters.\" The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying \"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [Channel 4] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.\n\nStraw supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice president of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.\n\nStraw has suffered from depression and tinnitus.\n\nIn October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jack_Straw", "page_content": "John Whitaker Straw (born 3 August 1946) is a British politician who served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout Gordon Brown's Premiership. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously under the Labour government from 1997 to 2010.\n\nAfter the Labour Party lost power in the general election, in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election. He retired as a Member of Parliament in 2015.\n\nEarly life\n\nStraw was born in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, England, the son of Joan Sylvia (n\u00e9e Gilbey)[1][2] and Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw,[1] an insurance salesman. Straw was brought up in Loughton, Essex, by his mother, on a council estate after his father left the family.[3] Straw was educated at Staples Road School, Loughton, then boarded at Brentwood School - at that time a direct grant grammar school.\n\nStraw went on to read Law at the University of Leeds. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought.\"[4]\n\nStraw, a Marxist, was then elected President of Leeds University Students' Union]]. At the 1967 UK National Union of Students' (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for an officer's position. In April 1968, he again unsuccessfully stood, this time for NUS President, defeated by Trevor Fisk.[5]\n\nLeeds University Students' Union Council reinstated Jack Straw's life membership of the Union in 2007, given to all Presidents. A previous motion in 2000 had removed his life membership and led to the removal of his name from the Presidents\u2019 Board owing to disagreement with his involvement in anti-terror legislation.[6]\n\nStraw subsequently qualified as a barrister at the Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974.\n\nBetween 1971 to 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. Straw served as political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series, World in Action.\n\nStraw unsuccessfully contested as the Labour candidate for Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 general election.\n\nMember of Parliament from 1979-2015\n\nStraw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election. He won the seat in 1979 and held it until he retired. On 25 October 2013, Jack Straw announced that he would stand down as Blackburn MP at the next election.[7]\n\nShadow Cabinet (1987-1997)\n\nStraw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Education spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on Local Education Authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women.\n\nStraw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under Labour Party leader John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \"soft on crime\" and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Party Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\" and calling for a curfew on children.[8]\n\nHome Secretary (1997-2001)\n\nAppointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, On 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by an ageing judge Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\".[9] Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\"[10] and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following the 1981 race riots by negroes in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \"institutionally racist\".[11] It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be repealed in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\"[12], which doesn't say much.\n\nStraw piloted through Parliament the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (England and Wales) which, under sections 28 to 32, includes what he decided was the meaning of \"racially aggravated\" offences. It is so all-embracing that almost anyone could be covered by it and become a potential criminal. This began the slippery slope towards Stalinist totalitarianism in \"offensive\" and \"racist\" matters that has been legislated upon again in 2003 (UK) and in Scotland twice since then.\n\nIn March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean Head of State General Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several socialist countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for \"crimes against humanity\". General Pinochet was outrageously placed under house arrest while visiting Britain for medical treatment, while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.[13]\n\nAlso in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Iraq, stating \"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\"[14]\n\nHe brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases.[15] These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building \u2014 a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.[16]\n\nAs Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of d'Hondt formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments,[17] but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.\n\n\n\nHe worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\"[18]\n\nForeign Secretary (2001-2006)\n\nStraw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice\n\nHe was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in the UK Government's prosecution of the \"war against terrorism\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution.[19]\n\nIn 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest.[20] There have been a series of causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\".[21]\n\nIn a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\" and recommended \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin.[22]\n\nIn the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'\u00e9tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.[23][24][25]\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 general election Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War \u2013 the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. In addition, Craig Murray, who had been pushed out of his job as ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was head of the FCO) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \"War on Terror\". Straw's vote fell by 20% compared to the previous general election in 2001 (21,808 to 17,562) although the multiplicity of anti-Straw candidates makes it difficult to discern whether this was a particularly poor result for Straw and Labour. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average. In any event, Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an 'egregious group', and criticised their tactics during the election.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \"Nonsense\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.[26][27][28]\n\nOn 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own\u2014a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.\n\nStraw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001.\n\nIn February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.[29]\n\nIn August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran.[30] This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request,[31] allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US.[32] Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \"Ayatollah Straw\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.[33]\n\nStraw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \"haunted him\" and that it was the \"most difficult decision\" of his life.[34] He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.[35]\n\nRendition and torture allegations\n\nDespite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition\u2014he once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \"conspiracy theory\"\u2014Straw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012.[36][37] In October 2012, the Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs.[38]\n\nLeader of the House of Commons (2006-2007)\n\nAfter the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.[39]\n\nOn 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.[40]\n\n2006 debate over veils\n\nMain article: British debate over veils\n\nIn October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\"[41] He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.[42][43][44]\n\nStraw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil.[45] Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the build up to the United Kingdom General Election, 2010.[46]\n\nLord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007-2010)\n\nStraw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn\n\nStraw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year administration from 1997 to 2010.[47]\n\nIn February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003.[48]\n\nStraw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.\n\nAlleged ambitions for premiership\n\nAndrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition.'[49]\n\nExpenses claims\n\nMain article: List of expenses claims in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal\n\nTwo months after learning that MP's expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight \u2013 he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\".[50][51]\n\nRetirement from front-bench politics (2010)\n\nIn August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a \u2018fresh start\u2019 for the Labour Party under a new leader.[52] Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \"tragedy\".[53]\n\nIn December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to the Guardian[54] arguing in favour of the alternative vote.\n\nIn January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men.[55] He said \"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\"[56] His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby.\n\nIn April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F Man on a salary of \u00a330,000 per annum, Straw said, \"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there\u2019s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it\u2019s really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\"[57]\n\nIn late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.[58]\n\nAllegations of anti-semitism by Einat Wilf\n\nIn 2013, at the Round Table Global Diplomatic Forum at the House of Commons, Jack Straw was described by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with defending Israel. Israeli politician Einat Wilf stated: \"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\"[59] Wilf said that she nearly fell off the chair when she heard Straw's comments. Wilf said she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel\u2019s sovereign legitimacy as a Jewish state.[60]\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, said that Jack Straw's comments \u201cecho some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about \u2018Jewish power\u2019 and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\u201d[61]\n\nSpeaking to the Jerusalem Post, Jack Straw strongly pushed back against claims that his criticism was anti-Semitic.[61] In a statement to the Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being anti-Semitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an anti-Semitic diatribe, as it had been described in many of the media reports.[60] He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, which was described as follows:[62]\n\nStraw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel\u2019s \u201csettlement-building\u2026 on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to \u201ctheft\u201d of Palestinians\u2019 land.\u201d In addition, he said that he advocated at the seminar \u201ca tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\u201d He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to a EU policy on this had been \u201cthe attitude of Germany, who for understandable reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of Israel.\u201d Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to 'Jewish money', Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \u201cIsraeli lobby\u201d and \u201cthe problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\u201d and spoke of the way AIPAC spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's suppose comments referring to 'Jewish money'.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStraw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect.\n\nOn 10 November 1978 he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant.[63] In 2006 Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial.[64] They have two adult children, Will and Charlotte.[65]\n\nHe supports his local football club Blackburn Rovers,[66] and was made an Honorary Vice President of them in 1998 by Jack Walker.[67]\n\nStraw has spoken publicly about his battles with depression, and tinnitus.[3]\n\nBibliography\n\nAutobiography\n\nStraw, Jack (2012).
