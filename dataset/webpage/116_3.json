Helmed by former ABA coach Bill Musselman, the Thrillers won back-to-back championships in the NBA\u2019s developmental league, the Continental Basketball Association, in 1985 and 1986. Midway through the 1986-87 CBA season, the Thrillers were poised for a three-peat.\n\nOff the court, the Thrillers were a circus. In 1986 the Internal Revenue Service seized the team and sold it at auction. New owner John Tuschman quickly grew disenchanted with Tampa (well, actually, St. Pete) and announced plans to leave town. This put him at odds with the famously volcanic Musselman, who called his boss \u201ca goddamn idiot\u201d during a press conference in January 1987. The Thrillers finished out the regular season at the Bayfront Center in St. Pete. Then Tuschman yanked team out of town and moved them 2,000 miles north to Rapid City, South Dakota to play the 1987 CBA playoffs.\n\nMusselman and Tuschman\u2019s re-named Rapid City Thrillers tore through the 1987 playoffs, earning a championship series date with the Rockford Lightning. On Easter Sunday 1987, the Thrillers sealed their three-peat with a 127-120 victory over Rockford in front of 2,856 at the Rushmore Civic Center.\n\nKey Players & Coaches\n\nOver the years the Rapid City Thrillers featured two players who hit iconic championship-clinching shots in the NCAA tournament. Lorenzo Charles, who sealed N.C. State\u2019s shocking upset of the University of Houston in 1983, played for the Thrillers in 1989. Keith Smart (Thrillers \u201989-\u201990) iced the 1987 Tournament for the University of Indiana with a buzzer-beating jumper against Syracuse.\n\nThree Thrillers coaches \u2013 Bill Musselman, his son Eric Musselman, and Flip Saunders \u2013 went on to coach in the NBA after leaving Rapid City.\n\nDemise & Re-Boot\n\nThe Thrillers would go play eight CBA seasons in the Rapid City. They returned to the finals twice in 1990 and 1992 but never won another title. During the summer of 1995 the team moved back to Florida (West Palm Beach this time) and became the Florida Beach Dogs. The franchise went out of business in 1997\n\nIn 1998, original owner John Tuschman attempted to re-boot the Thrillers in the lower-budget International Basketball Association. The new Thrillers failed after one season.\n\nRapid City Thrillers Shop\n\nContains Affiliate Links\n\nRapid City Thrillers Logo T from Rebound Vintage Hoops\n\nThrillers Women\u2019s Cut Logo T from Rebound Vintage Hoops\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nHead coach Bill Musselman (Thrillers \u201987) passed away on May 5, 2000 at age 59.

The usual winter athletic activities were marching, calisthenics, and apparatus work but they weren\u2019t nearly as thrilling as football or lacrosse which were played during the warmer seasons.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nNaismith wanted to create a game that would be simple to understand but complex enough to be interesting. The game had to be playable indoors, and it had to accommodate several players at once. The game also needed to provide plenty of exercise for the students, yet without the physicality of football, soccer, or rugby since those would threaten more severe injuries if played in a confined space. (See 100 years of football in pictures.)\n\nNaismith approached the school janitor, hoping he could find two square boxes to use for goals. When the janitor came back from his search, he had two peach baskets instead. Naismith nailed the peach baskets to the lower rail of the gymnasium balcony, one on each side. The height of that lower balcony rail happened to be 10 feet. The students would play on teams to try to get the ball into their team\u2019s basket. A person was stationed at each end of the balcony to retrieve the ball from the basket and put it back into play.\n\nThe first game ever played between students was a complete brawl.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\n\u201cThe boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the crunches, they ended up in a free for all in the middle of the gym floor before I could pull them apart,\u201d Naismith said during a January 1939 radio program on WOR in New York City called We the People, his only known recording. \u201cOne boy was knocked out. Several of them had black eyes and one had a dislocated shoulder.\u201d Naismith said. \u201cAfter that first match, I was afraid they'd kill each other, but they kept nagging me to let them play again so I made up some more rules.\u201d\n\nThe humble beginnings of the only professional sport to originate in the United States laid the foundation for today\u2019s multi-billion-dollar business. The current National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) March Madness college basketball tournament includes the best 68 of more than 1,000 college teams, stadiums that seat tens of thousands of spectators and lucrative television contracts.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nOriginal rules of the game\n\nNaismith didn\u2019t create all of the rules at once, but continued to modify them into what are now known as the original 13 rules. Some are still part of the modern game today. Naismith\u2019s original rules of the game sold at auction in 2010 for $4.3 million.\n\nIn the original rules: The ball could be thrown in any direction with one or both hands, never a fist. A player could not run with the ball but had to throw it from the spot where it was caught. Players were not allowed to push, trip or strike their opponents. The first infringement was considered a foul. A second foul would disqualify a player until the next goal was made. But if there was evidence that a player intended to injure an opponent, the player would be disqualified for the whole game.\n\nUmpires served as judges for the game, made note of fouls and had the power to disqualify players. They decided when the ball was in bounds, to which side it belonged, and managed the time. Umpires decided when a goal had been made and kept track of the goals.\n\nIf a team made three consecutive fouls, the opposing team would be allowed a goal.\n\nA goal was made when the ball was thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stayed there. If the ball rested on the edges, and the opponent moved the basket, it would count as a goal. When the ball went out of bounds, it was thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. The person throwing the ball was allowed five seconds; if he held it longer, the ball would go to the opponent. In case of a dispute, an umpire would throw the ball straight into the field. If any side persisted in delaying the game, the umpire would call a foul on that side.\n\nThe length of a game was two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between. The team making the most goals within the allotted time was declared the winner. If a game was tied, it could be continued until another goal was made.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

Photograph by George Rinhart, Corbis/Getty Images\n\nFirst public games\n\nThe first public game of basketball was played in a YMCA gymnasium and was recorded by the Springfield Republican on March 12th, 1892. The instructors played against the students. Around 200 spectators attended to discover this new sport they had never heard of or seen before. In the story published by the Republican, the teachers were credited with \u201cagility\u201d but the student\u2019s \u201cscience\u201d is what led them to defeat the teachers 5-1.\n\nWithin weeks the sport\u2019s popularity grew rapidly. Students attending other schools introduced the game at their own YMCAs. The original rules were printed in a college magazine, which was mailed to YMCAs across the country. With the colleges\u2019 well-represented international student body the sport also was introduced to many foreign nations. High schools began to introduce the new game, and by 1905, basketball was officially recognized as a permanent winter sport.\n\nThe first intercollegiate basketball game between two schools is disputed, according to the NCAA. In 1893, two school newspaper articles were published chronicling separate recordings of collegiate basketball games facing an opposing college team.\n\nIn 1892, less than a year after Naismith created the sport, Smith College gymnastics instructor Senda Berenson, introduced the game to women\u2019s athletics. The first recorded intercollegiate game between women took place between Stanford University and University of California at Berkeley in 1896.\n\nWith the sport\u2019s growth in popularity, it gained notice from the International Olympic Committee and was introduced at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis as a demonstration event. It wasn\u2019t until 1936 that basketball was recognized as a medal event. Women\u2019s basketball wasn\u2019t included as an Olympic medal event until the 1976 Montreal games. (Wheelchair basketball in Cambodia changed these women's lives.)\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nAs the sport continued its rapid spread, professional leagues began to form across the United States. Basketball fans cheered on their new hometown teams. The first professional league was the National Basketball League (NBL) formed in 1898, comprised of six teams in the northeast. The league only lasted about five years. After it dissolved in 1904, the league would be reintroduced 33 years later in 1937 with an entirely new support system, with Goodyear, Firestone, and General Electric corporations as the league owners, and 13 teams.\n\nWhile professional sports leagues gained nationwide attention, college basketball was also a major fixture. The first NCAA tournament, which included eight teams, was held in 1939 at Northwestern University. The first collegiate basketball national champion was the University of Oregon. The team defeated Ohio State University.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The sport wouldn\u2019t be integrated until 1950 when Chuck Cooper was drafted by the Boston Celtics. Prior to Cooper being drafted there were groups of black teams across the country, commonly known as \u201cthe black fives\u201d, which referred to the five starting players on a basketball team. All-black teams were often referred to as colored quints or Negro cagers. The teams flourished in New York City, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Chicago, and in other cities with substantial African American populations. They were amateur, semi-professional, and professional.\n\nOf the more than 1,000 collegiate basketball teams across all divisions of the NCAA, 68 teams play in the annual March Madness tournament. The best college teams from each conference around the country compete for a place in the Sweet 16, Elite Eight, Final Four and, ultimately, the national championship.

The development of Chinese basketball should be based on the successful experience of the development of professional basketball in the United States. The development of China\u2019s basketball has a solid cultural and mass foundation, but we should not be proud and arrogant. It is necessary to make full use of the critical and inherited attitude to learn and absorb the excellent and advanced knowledge of American basketball culture. At present, there are still some problems that need to be further explored. The purpose of this paper is to research and discuss the cultural differences of basketball between China and the United States and their concepts in basketball teaching based on the background of wireless network intelligence technology. This paper firstly analyzes and introduces the difference between the wireless network and wireless sensor network. The main design goal of traditional wireless networks is to improve service quality and efficiently use bandwidth and then consider energy saving, while the main design goal of sensor networks is to use energy efficiently, which is one of the most important differences between sensor networks and traditional networks, to analyze the differences between Chinese and American basketball cultures, to understand the impact of Chinese and American basketball cultural differences on basketball teaching concepts, and to compare and study the differences between Chinese and American basketball culture and their teaching philosophy in basketball. Using the method of this article, through the analysis of experimental data, we understand the impact of Chinese and American basketball cultural differences on basketball teaching concepts and find that Chinese and American basketball cultural differences play an important role in basketball teaching concepts, with a satisfaction rate of 66%. Through theory and experiments, based on the data, it is analyzed that the impact of the differences between Chinese and American basketball cultures on basketball teaching concepts reaches 50%. The research results show that the differences between Chinese and American basketball cultures play an important role in basketball teaching concepts and can be used to promote the development of basketball culture and skills.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nToday, China\u2019s basketball has a certain foundation and has achieved good results. However, compared with American basketball, there is still a big gap, and China needs continuous efforts to promote the development of Chinese basketball culture. There are great differences between Chinese and western sports cultures in terms of cultural basis, basic model, and value orientation. Chinese and Western sports culture is the two main types of world sports culture [1]. The basic models of Chinese traditional sports culture are health care, skills, and performance, while the basic models of Western sports culture are competition, utilitarianism, and entertainment. The Chinese sports culture is influenced by the ancient Chinese traditional culture, and Confucian culture and is based on the philosophy of \u201cheaven and man are united.\u201d Western sports culture is influenced by the Western Renaissance, the modern industrial revolution, and cultural enlightenment [2, 3]. Chinese sports culture advocates courtesy, tolerance, and peace, while Western sports culture is more targeted, faster, higher, and stronger. Although basketball is a worldwide sport, the connotation of basketball is also different due to the influence of Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds. Chinese ancient culture is vast and profound. Ancient Confucian and Taoist cultures had a significant impact on the emergence and development of Chinese traditional sports culture. In Chinese sports culture, there are static concepts of \u201cmindfulness and foresight\u201d and \u201cmindfulness of inactivity\u201d in the complementary culture of Confucianism and Taoism [4]. Although China\u2019s basketball culture has been formed, it still has certain differences compared with the American basketball culture. Different national cultures form different basketball cultures, which also have different promoting effects on the development of basketball culture.\n\nBasketball entered China earlier, but its development was slow, its promotion was narrow, competition was low, and its overall level was low. After the founding of New China, although Chinese basketball has made a breakthrough in development, the development process of the Chinese professional basketball league CBA is relatively short, and the system is not perfect. The western sports culture is based on the western \u201csports philosophy\u201d philosophy and attaches importance to sports. Western professional basketball starts early, develops rapidly, spreads widely, and has a high degree of industrialization and commercialization [5, 6]. Stable guarantee conditions are more conducive to the development of players and personnel training. The famous American professional basketball league NBA has a history of more than 100 years, has a complete industrial chain and commercial chain, and a sound operating mechanism. The NCAA has a long history and there is more than one in these areas [7]. In China, most people who like basketball and participate in basketball are students and some young people. In school, basketball is more popular and popular with most students, but once they work, many people give up basketball. The main competition and struggle of western sports culture. Americans believe that the basketball court is a battlefield and a place to show personal value, which is more conducive to the personalized development of players [8]. Westerners hope to cultivate young people\u2019s will and quality through various exercises, making them more tenacious, tenacious, and extremely agile. Americans believe that winning or losing depends on the number of balls in the opponent\u2019s basket. It is a collective sport that promotes the overall development of people. Although basketball training methods are different, their thinking is the same. They all cultivate their feelings and responsibilities through basketball [9, 10].\n\nThe differences between Chinese and Western cultures have led to different understandings of basketball between China and the United States. Chinese traditional sports culture emphasizes collectiveness, neglects individuals, emphasizes the responsibility of intermediate subjects, and demands individual rights. The author believes that basketball is a team project and a project that wins honor for the country. He emphasized the cooperation of the entire team. From training to competition, it is relatively rigid, and there is very little fierce competition. Based on western individualism and liberal philosophy, western sports culture pays more attention to individual rights and liberalism. Americans consider the basketball court to be a stage for self-expression, pay attention to the display of personality, and consider the basketball court to be a place to realize self-worth [11]. When they have a chance, they will show their superb skills, followed by the game. They are full of confidence in the game. They often see passionate matches, which brings us an audiovisual feast. Under the influence of Chinese traditional sports culture, Chinese basketball is based on the integration of mind and nature. It is relatively calm and harmonious, with weak physical confrontation and competition awareness and weak performance on the court. Westerners\u2019 cheerful personalities and attitudes towards self-worth have a great influence on them [12]. They have a strong sense of competition and resistance. The physical differences between Chinese and American players are also huge. China and the United States have different talent training systems. Chinese basketball players often abandon their studies early for basketball. From being selected as a young basketball players to becoming gifted basketball players, they have followed an unobstructed path with good treatment and priority, which has ultimately led to the low overall quality of Chinese professional basketball players. With the continuous development of basketball, only athletes with higher cultural quality can better grasp the rules of basketball and better understand basketball tactics, so as to improve their basketball level and extend the basketball life of athletes [13]. Therefore, the training system of Chinese basketball talents is not perfect and needs to be further improved to narrow the gap with the world\u2019s top teams. In the United States, whether it is high school league, college league, or various basketball training camps, there is a complete training plan and selection system. The United States pays attention to the cultivation of the comprehensive qualities of basketball players [14].\n\nThis article uses the method of experimental research to understand the impact of Chinese and American basketball cultural differences on basketball teaching concepts, as well as a comparative inquiry before and after the application. Through theoretical analysis and experimental exploration, find out the role of Chinese and American basketball cultural differences in basketball teaching concepts; Process the data through data recording, sorting, calculation, mapping, analysis, and simulation through the statistical data set of the differences between Chinese and American basketball cultures and their basketball teaching concepts. Combined with the data, the empirical analysis of Chinese and American basketball cultural differences is The role of basketball teaching ideas, combined with effective data, summarizes and analyzes the role of the differences between Chinese and American basketball cultures in basketball teaching ideas. The results show that with the method of this paper, the recognition rate reaches 35%, which is faster and 12% faster than others.\n\nThe innovations of this paper are that it (1) introduces the difference between wireless network and wireless sensor network; (2) introduces Chinese basketball culture and American basketball culture. (3) analyzes the development of Chinese and American basketball culture; (4) conducts an experimental analysis on the American NBA professional basketball culture and China\u2019s CBA professional basketball culture.\n\n2. Proposed Method\n\n2.1. Difference between Wireless Network and Wireless Sensor Network\n\nIn a broad sense, wireless ad hoc networks usually have two organizational forms: infrastructure networks and infrastructure-free networks. The so-called wireless network refers to a network that can realize the interconnection of various communication devices without wiring.\n\nThe infrastructure network is a general-purpose, public, packet-switched network supplementary facility that provides a network environment with high security, flexibility, and high-quality services for enterprises and demanding private users. Infrastructure networks, also known as central fabric networks, consist of networks that contain fixed wired gateways. Within the wireless coverage, the mobile host communicates with the base station (fixed wired gateway) and can move during the communication process. When the mobile host leaves the wireless coverage of the original base station, it can establish a connection with another base station and continue to communicate through this base station. In this networking and communication mode, the location of the base station is fixed.\n\nInfrastructure-free networks are also known as wireless mobile ad hoc networks. Among them, no infrastructure network has the following characteristics: independence, distributed characteristics, communication bandwidth, and so on. An infrastructure-free network is a multihop mobility peer-to-peer network composed of dozens to hundreds of nodes, using wireless communication and dynamic networking. Its purpose is to transmit multimedia information flows with quality of service requirements through dynamic routing and mobility management techniques. Nodes usually have a continuous power supply.\n\nAlthough sensor networks have similarities with wireless ad hoc networks, they also have great differences. A wireless ad hoc network is a multihop mobility peer-to-peer network that is composed of dozens to hundreds of nodes, adopts wireless communication, and is dynamically networked. The sensor network is a network system that integrates monitoring, control, and wireless communication [15, 16]. The number of nodes is larger (thousands or even tens of thousands), and the nodes are more closely distributed; due to environmental impact and energy exhaustion, nodes are more prone to failure. Environmental disturbances and node failures can easily cause changes in network topology; usually, most sensor nodes are stationary. In addition, sensor nodes have limited energy, processing capacity, storage capacity, and communication capacity. The primary design goal of traditional wireless networks is to improve service quality and efficient use of bandwidth and then to consider energy conservation, while the primary design goal of sensor networks is to use energy efficiently, which is one of the most important differences between sensor networks and traditional networks [17, 18]. Wireless sensor network is a distributed sensor network, a wireless network composed of a large number of stationary or moving sensors in a self-organizing and multihop manner to cooperatively sense, collect, process, and transmit the information of the sensed objects in the geographical area covered by the network, and finally send the information to the owner of the network.\n\n2.2. Chinese Basketball Culture\n\nBasketball culture refers to the institutionalized condensation of the way of thinking and behavior of people who watch and participate in basketball. It is a general term for basketball knowledge, skills, customs, and systems.\n\nDue to historical changes in thousands of years in China, ancient Eastern countries have their own civilization and culture and are deeply influenced by Confucianism, family thinking, and Buddhist thinking. Such moral norms are \u201cbenefits,\u201d \u201crighteousness,\u201d \u201cceremony,\u201d \u201cbelief,\u201d and the unified view of heaven and human life [19]. Its performance is fair and reasonable, and harmony is nonutilitarian. The formation and thinking mode of thousands of national traditional cultures are formed in the course of historical evolution and will not be easily replaced by foreign cultures. Therefore, Chinese basketball is deeply influenced by Chinese culture, which is mainly reflected in basketball activities and basketball players themselves. In order to innovate and surpass the strong teams, we must absorb and learn from the excellent foreign basketball culture, change the way of thinking, learn from each other, enrich the connotation, and develop in a diversified and modernized direction [20, 21]. Modern basketball has been introduced to China for more than a century. For more than 100 years, basketball has been widely popularized and developed in the world and in China. It has transformed from a simple competitive game in the past to a new cultural carrier integrating political influence, economic productivity, social affinity, and cultural communication.\n\nAfter basketball entered China, in the process of collision, selection, and fusion of Eastern and Western cultures on Chinese soil, basketball, and its American basketball culture also began to be accepted by Chinese people gradually. The impact of foreign basketball culture on Chinese basketball culture has a certain impact, and there are different forms of inheritance in material and spiritual culture. Constant innovation and integration can stand on the forefront of world basketball. For example, from the perspective of Chinese basketball values, we are mainly concerned with fitness, education, and entertainment functions; in competition, we focus on harmonious and friendly competition concepts; in terms of technology and tactics, we focus on individual cooperation with the overall attack and pay attention to collective cooperation. In the values, the national interest is higher than the collective interest, and the collective interest is higher than the personal interest. In the arena, we are concerned that due to the influence of traditional Chinese culture, athletes are introverted, uninhibited, lacking passion, and kingliness [22].\n\nThe national cultural patterns, national psychology, and mode of thinking that have been deposited over the past millennium have made great achievements in the course of history. These achievements cannot easily be replaced by the introduction and collision of foreign cultures. Therefore, the basketball culture derived from the development of Chinese basketball has national traditional characteristics. Reflected in the sports career of basketball and competitive athletes. Those who grew up in the land of China, those who love the splendid culture of the Chinese nation created by their ancestors, cannot get rid of it, nor can it disappear, because it is wealth, spirit, and characteristics [23]. But in order to innovate and catch up, we cannot ignore the absorption and organic integration of foreign excellent basketball culture. In the process of carrying forward the Chinese basketball culture formed by the traditional view of history, it is necessary to change the way of thinking, to get rough and refined, to enrich the connotation, and to develop in the direction of diversification and modernization. Today, China\u2019s basketball culture is inherited in different forms, both spiritually and materially. It has inherited both domestic experience and foreign experience. Without the integration and innovation of the essential concept of basketball and the scientific concept of development, it will be difficult to stand at the forefront of basketball in the world [24, 25]. In terms of basketball values, we usually pay attention to the fitness, education, and psychological training functions of basketball; in competitive games, we focus on the concept of friendship; in sports law, we focus on offensive and defensive balance, and in an orderly game; in tactical guidance, we focus on the spirit of collectivism. In the tactical cooperation, we focus on the overall combination of attacks, and individual tactical actions obey the overall tactical requirements, showing a certain degree of high concentration; in team management, we focus on the intensive management of the overall action; the practice of values emphasizes national interests first; personal interests obey collective interests; we pay attention to traditional customs and nonpersonalized colors in the form and behavior of auxiliary sports events; the image of the logo team of each club; Chinese athletes are introverted and lack passion because they pay attention to adjusting mentality and emotional changes [26].\n\n2.3. American Basketball Culture\n\nSome also cover entire websites and grid equipment, similar to a large cage. Affected by weather conditions, the winter temperature in Massachusetts, USA, is low, and outdoor sports activities that students like cannot be performed, so James Smith Nai put indoor basketball games and improved the game, the suspension frame was initially placed on the ground, about 10 off the ground feet and divided personnel into two teams to launch offensive and defensive confrontations. Then the bottom of the basket was removed and the gondola was mounted on a special post, which basically established the prototype of basketball sports [27, 28].\n\nIn the first stage, in the 1890s, there were no competition rules for basketball. There is no limit to the size of the court or the number of participants. Only two peach baskets were hung at the ends of the narrow open space. Because there were no rules at the time and the venue was not standardized, the competition between the two sides was very fierce, so the moves were rude. The second period was a period of gradual improvement and popularity of basketball, around the 1930s and 1940s. At the end of the 1930s, basketball was rapidly popularized and developed in many countries such as Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and the technical level of basketball was also continuously improved. The fighting form gradually changed from singles to cover and auxiliary defense. The third period is the period of popularization and development of basketball, mainly referring to the 1950s and 1960s. During this time, basketball was very popular around the world. With the continuous development and innovation of basketball technology and tactics, the height of players is also increasing, forcing the existing rules, technologies, and tactics to constantly restrict and promote each other. Height has become one of the important factors in modern basketball games. The fourth period is the period of overall promotion of basketball, mainly after the 1970s. During this period, with the development of basketball, the basketball game gradually became a giant game. This phenomenon has promoted the further improvement of basketball tactics and formed an offensive defense-half-court man-to-man defense and mixed defense tactics, showing a new high power system. The fifth stage is the innovation and climbing stage from the 1990s to the present. The performance of modern basketball techniques represented by super basketball players Jordan, Johnson, etc. makes this sport technique more complete, concise, and more practical. In modern basketball, both men and women will develop in the direction of \u201chigh,\u201d \u201csmart,\u201d \u201cfast,\u201d \u201cfull,\u201d \u201cquasi,\u201d \u201cruthless,\u201d and \u201cchange,\u201d and both technology and tactics will move towards using technology. Different styles and game rules will develop in the new direction of high memory, high business, high appreciation, and high cultural display [29]. Street basketball culture is the most distinctive basketball culture in the United States. There are basketball courts on the street and in the courtyard, and basketball is everywhere.\n\nThe reason why the United States is so powerful is that it has a complete training system. The game system for basketball matches from elementary school to professional teams is relatively complete. American children have been playing basketball since the age of six. Middle and primary schools have become an important stage for students\u2019 basic skills training. During the holidays, students will also set up basketball summer camps, which will be guided by professional coaches and outstanding players to improve students\u2019 solid basic skills. At the high school level, their main task was to learn cultural knowledge and technical tactics. With the continuous progress of science and technology, only players with higher cultures can master and learn advanced strategies and tactics for their own use. American basketball culture is inseparable from its own national culture, which is reflected in basketball. Basketball players in the United States see the basketball court as a stage to show their physical fitness, personal capabilities, and basketball talent. From Chamberlain to Jabal and Michael Jordan, they have brought us into the world of basketball and made an indelible contribution to the rapid development of American basketball. The main value of American basketball culture is to lay the foundation for its formation and development, organically combine the material wealth and spiritual wealth created by basketball, and create the brand effect of American basketball.\n\n2.4. Development of Chinese and American Basketball Culture\n\nThere are great differences between Chinese and western sports cultures in terms of cultural basis, basic model, and value orientation. Chinese and Western sports culture is the two main types of world sports culture [30, 31]. The basic models of Chinese traditional sports culture are health care, skills, and performance, while the basic models of Western sports culture are competition, utilitarianism, and entertainment. The Chinese sports culture is influenced by the ancient Chinese traditional culture Confucian culture and is based on the philosophy of \u201cheaven and man unite.\u201d Western sports culture is influenced by the Western Renaissance, modern industrial revolution, and cultural enlightenment. Chinese sports culture advocates courtesy, tolerance, and peace, while Western sports culture is more targeted, faster, higher, and stronger. Although basketball is a worldwide sport, it has different connotations due to the influence of Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds.\n\nFirst, there is a profound difference between the \u201cstatic view\u201d and the \u201cmotion view\u201d in ancient Chinese culture. The ancient Confucian and Taoist cultures had a great influence on the production and development of traditional Chinese sports culture. In the complementary culture of Confucianism and Taoism, there exist static concepts such as \u201charmony and distance\u201d and \u201cstillness without movement\u201d in Chinese sports culture. Basketball entered China earlier, but its development was slow, its promotion was narrow, the competition was low, and its overall level was low. After the founding of New China, although Chinese basketball has made a breakthrough in development, the development process of the Chinese professional basketball league CBA is relatively short and the system is not perfect. The western sports culture is based on the western \u201csports philosophy\u201d philosophy and attaches importance to sports. Western professional basketball starts early, develops rapidly, spreads widely, and has a high degree of industrialization and commercialization. Stable guarantee conditions are more conducive to the development of players and personnel training. The famous American professional basketball league NBA has a history of more than 100 years, has a complete industrial chain and commercial chain, and a sound operating mechanism. The NCAA has a long history, and there are more than one in these areas.\n\nSecondly, the difference between \u201charmony and symmetry\u201d and \u201cstruggle\u201d is influenced by the Confucian culture of \u201cuse of etiquette and the value of etiquette.\u201d Chinese sports culture is based on the concept of harmonious sports and civilization as the theme of solving people\u2019s health problems. In China, most people who like basketball and participate in basketball are students and some young people. In school, basketball is more popular and popular with most students, but once they work, many people give up basketball. The Chinese consider basketball to be a place of emotional exchange and friendship. The slogan of \u201cfriendship first, competition second\u201d severely restricted the athletes\u2019 individuality. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said: \u201cStruggle is the father of all, war is the boat of all.\u201d The main competition and struggle of Western sports culture. Americans believe that the basketball court is a battlefield and a place to show personal value, which is more conducive to the personalized development of players. Westerners hope to cultivate young people\u2019s will and quality through various exercises, making them more tenacious, tenacious, and extremely agile. Distinguish between \u201cintuitive thinking\u201d and \u201canalytic thinking.\u201d As an important feature of traditional Chinese culture, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism are proposed, which is conducive to the dynamic grasp of the entire world, but it does not focus on quantitative analysis and inaccurate and rigorous conclusion. Western culture is based on \u201canalytic thinking,\u201d pays attention to quantitative analysis, and draws precise and rigorous conclusions. Two different ways of thinking have led to different concepts of \u201cheavy ball and light people\u201d and \u201cheavy ball and light people\u201d in Chinese and American basketball. Americans believe that winning or losing depends on the number of balls in the opponent\u2019s basket. It is a collective sport that promotes the overall development of people.\n\nChinese basketball culture is deeply influenced by Chinese traditional culture. The development of Chinese basketball culture needs to establish a symbol of basketball culture representing China so as to expand the international influence of Chinese basketball culture.\n\n3. Experiments\n\n3.1. Research Object\n\nThis article mainly takes the comparison of American NBA professional basketball culture and Chinese CBA professional basketball culture as the research object, using sports theory, culture, and sociology as the theoretical basis, and compares and analyzes the current status of Chinese and American professional basketball culture. Through the development model and social culture of basketball culture, through in-depth research of similarities and differences, the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese and American professional basketball culture, and the main characteristics and influencing factors of Chinese professional basketball culture, this article provides theoretical references to promote improvement and sustainable and healthy development. The level of professional basketball in China achieves the cultural level from the sports level.\n\n3.2. Research Methods\n\n(1)Literature method: refer to the literature to understand basketball culture in China and the United States professional basketball culture, strategy, development and management, teaching materials and works, analyze and summarize more in-depth research results, extract new ideas for this article, stimulate new ideas, and find new parameters to enrich the article. Relevant databases come from the data information provided by Weipu Database, China Periodicals Network, China Knowledge Network, Sports Periodical Literature Search Database, NBA official website, and CBA official website.(2)Logical reasoning method: analyze the formation of basketball from the aspects of humanities, society, culture, etc. According to the development of culture, sports, and sociology, use logical principles to analyze the characteristics, influencing factors, and development status of sports reasoning analysis.(3)Comparative research method: This paper mainly uses the collected data and the data of Chinese and American professional basketball culture to find the similarities and differences between national culture and Chinese and American professional basketball culture. Based on a comparative analysis of the above two, further analyze the influencing factors and values of Chinese professional basketball culture so as to provide a theoretical basis and countermeasures for the development of Chinese professional basketball culture.(4)Mathematical statistics: Mathematical statistical processing is performed on the data to be found in this article and the data contained in the content to provide convincing empirical data for the completion of this research.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Analysis of Chinese and American Basketball Coaches\n\n4.1.1. Comparison of Academic Qualifications of Chinese and American Basketball Coaches\n\nAccording to the analysis of statistical data, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, the level of education depends on the learning experience of receiving scientific and cultural knowledge training. The coach\u2019s level can reflect whether he can use the knowledge of other disciplines to guide the training of athletes. In the CBA, there are 6 coaches with a bachelor\u2019s degree, accounting for 38% of the total; 10 coaches with a high school degree, accounting for 62% of the total. The number of coaches with junior college, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees is zero, and the educational structure is unreasonable. The NBA has 28 coaches with a bachelor\u2019s degree, accounting for 93% of the total number, 2 masters, accounting for 7% of the total number, 0 high school, college, and doctoral degree coaches, and a reasonable academic structure. These coaches have a set of scientific training guidance methods and can also use advanced equipment on athletes to improve athletes\u2019 sports skills. Compared with American professional basketball coaches, the gap between Chinese professional basketball coaches and American professional basketball coaches is obvious. To train an excellent team, there must be a professional coach team, and the professional coach team must have a high education. Only in this way can the coaching team have excellent professional quality and technology, rich theoretical knowledge, and scientific training methods, and build a strong team. The coaching team of our professional basketball team needs such a high-level coaching team. On the one hand, it is necessary to improve the educational background of the coach. On the other hand, it is more important to change the training method and system. In the final analysis, this is a change in people\u2019s mindset, not only a change in the mindset of the coach but also a change in the sense of leadership of the supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2. Comparison of Coaching Experience between Chinese and American Coaches\n\nAccording to the statistical data analysis, as shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, by searching for information on the website, the coaching situation of professional basketball coaches in China is sorted out. 37.9% of Chinese professional basketball coaches do not have the experience guidance of former assistant coaches, which has also led to these new coaches not having the experience of leading a team. His experience mainly comes from past thought coaches, his experience in games and some of his books, reading, etc. In addition to his own opinions, it has become a group plan for his team, which is a disadvantage of the team and he lacks experience in controlling the game in the fierce competition process. 60.1% of basketball coaches have the experience of assistant coaches, laying a solid foundation for becoming head coach assistant coaches. Through early learning and guidance, they have the rich practical experience and theoretical foundation. In order to be able to deal with the problems of the team or players in a timely manner when encountering dangers in the future during difficult matches. In order to solve the problem of players or players in future training. The professional basketball coaching team in the United States has 79% of its coaching assistant experience, reflecting the good theoretical and practical foundation of American coaches. I have my own ideas and views on training and games. In terms of years of coaching, 15.7% of Chinese coaches have been coaching for 22 years or more. 10.1% of Chinese coaches coached 12\u201321 years, 12.3% of American coaches coached 12\u201321 years. 71.2% of Chinese coaches have coached less than 12 years, and 85.7% of American coaches have coached less than 12 years. There is a big gap between Chinese professional basketball coaches and American professional basketball coaches in various indicators. First of all, the percentage of coaches with assistant coaching experience in China is very low. Compared with the professional coaching business in the United States, there is a big gap. In addition to professional competence, coaching experience is also a very important aspect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2. Analysis of Chinese and American Basketball Culture\n\n4.2.1. Comparison of Chinese and American Basketball Cultures\n\nAccording to statistical data analysis, as shown in Figure 3, the United States emphasizes independence and individualism by 46%, encourages confrontation by 34% during training, the team has outstanding personal abilities, and the confrontation ability is as strong as 14%. Parents encourage students to participate in exercise for up to 6%. In contrast, China emphasizes independence and individualism by less than 35%, encourages confrontation by 27% during training, the team\u2019s individual ability is outstanding, confrontation is strong by 12%, and parents encourage students to participate in exercise up to 26%. Culture has a profound influence on the formation of a country and its national basketball style. Basketball is not a single sport but a sport that can rise to a cultural level. It requires cultural support. The accumulation and formation of culture take time. Basketball without culture is tantamount to insider information without basketball. This kind of basketball will become a net without vitality and tension. It is easy to be broken. There is no solid at all. In the highly mixed \u201cmixed\u201d culture of the United States, the words \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cindividualism\u201d represent the unique basketball culture of the United States, and realizing its value to society is the main purpose of the American thinking model. For example, coaches in the United States encourage athletes to engage in physical contact and confrontation at all stages. They focus on the application and development of physical confrontation exercises. Showing self-competence through confrontation and performance can reflect self-worth, which is very consistent with the concept of competitive sports. Chinese basketball culture has undergone an evolution from tradition to modernity, and its thinking is the golden mean. This traditional way of thinking is as follows: Do not go to extremes and advocate not going on both sides. In addition, the education received by the Chinese from an early age is to take into account both the collective and the country and emphasize the \u201ccollective concept\u201d everywhere. Therefore, athletes were cultivated in such an environment during their youth, forming features such as performance methods. During the game, athletes do not particularly advocate fierce confrontation but use speed, flexibility, and cooperation between players to replace some physical contact. To a certain extent, our tactics have achieved the characteristics of \u201cquick\u201d and \u201cclever.\u201d But on the other hand, it also caused bad confrontation for the team. Historically, it has a lot to do with our social system and historical heritage. On the other hand, with the development of China\u2019s economy, the conditions of national families have greatly improved. Children are often the object of parental care and love in the family. This is a normal situation in most families in China. In such an environment, children who grow up in sports are not only vulnerable to giving up but also overprotected by their parents and lack the courage to study hard. In competitive sports, confrontation and physical contact can easily be injured or uncomfortable. At this time, parents often do not understand or encourage them, which has a negative impact on training and a negative impact on the training of young people. Therefore, for basketball culture, China should inherit fine traditions and abandon bad habits. The long-form basketball style and style of play should be appropriately adjusted according to the general trend and direction of the development of the world\u2019s basketball and cannot be static. In addition, countries with high-level basketball development should actively research and summarize, summarize their own needs to improve the success of others, combine their own characteristics and characteristics to absorb the cultures of other countries, and establish the cornerstones of their own basketball characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2. Comparison of Chinese and American Basketball Training\n\nAccording to statistical data analysis, as shown in Figure 4 and Table 3, the training time of American college basketball teams is usually concentrated in the afternoon. According to a survey by basketball teams, their average training time and time are 3.55 hours and 5.2 times, respectively. In addition, the United States has participated in training competitions more often, with a total of 40 times, and China has fewer 14\u201324. Basketball team training is usually scheduled in the afternoon. Sometimes, in order to prepare for important matches, they also perform a period of concentrated training. The training time and load intensity of American basketball players are significantly higher than those of Chinese college athletes. The training time and time of most basketball players in China are difficult to meet the needs of sports training development. There are many reasons for this. Most high-level athletes have low education levels and have more learning difficulties after entering school. If we only focus on learning, it will affect training, and the contradiction between the two is very prominent. Due to insufficient funds and the inability to deploy high-tech training equipment, most basketball players in China still use traditional experience training methods. It is difficult to make great innovations in traditional training methods. Without scientific training methods, athletes\u2019 technical and tactical levels cannot be improved rapidly. Even if the training takes longer, it can only complete half of the work and even have the opposite effect. This left a group of better-conditioned athletes abandoned. The long-term training plan of basketball players and athletes is not perfect. Many basketball players do not attach importance to regular training and are unexpected when the game is approaching. This is also one of the reasons for the poor sports performance of athletes. Because American basketball players implement a \u201clenient entry and strict exit\u201d education policy, the academic system is not very strict. In fact, many college athletes are free to extend their four-year school hours, so their education management system can also help alleviate the contradiction between perennial training time and cultural learning. American basketball players attach great importance to the cultivation of athletes\u2019 competitive ability and attach great importance to the connection between training and competition. They see competition as an important part of training. Sports competitions for American college students are quite frequent. In addition to the various levels of the competition organized by the College Student Sports Association, states and even regions often organize high-level leagues, invitational tournaments, and exhibition matches. Check the training level through the competition, enhance the confrontation ability, and enrich the competition experience. Comparing the average number and type of basketball matches between the American basketball team and the Chinese basketball team, there is a large gap between the number of matches between Chinese basketball players \u201chigh-level basketball teams and the Chinese and American basketball players\u201d basketball culture. Too little competition is also one of the main reasons affecting the training level of basketball players. No matter how good the sports technique is in normal training, it is worthless to test it without participating in the game. The skills we usually master can only be consolidated and improved if they are used in competitions. Lack of school funding is another reason for lack of competition. Secondly, basketball players\u2019 basketball levels are uneven, and the comparability among basketball players is poor. Some high-level colleges and universities have no competitors in the province and do not have sufficient funds to carry out activities outside the province. In the long run, it is difficult to improve their technical and tactical levels. Therefore, we must increase the number and time of matches for high-level basketball team of basketball players, strengthen cultural propaganda in China, training and games are closely linked, and we must promote the improvement of high-level basketball training levels for basketball players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\n(1) The training methods of Chinese and American basketball players are quite different. The traditional training of basketball players in China is based on the training of professional sports teams under the national system. Although this kind of training mode has cultivated a group of outstanding basketball players in a short time, it has also caused a series of problems. In this way, the separation of the sports system from the education system, excessive emphasis on sports training, and neglect of cultural courses have prevented athletes from all-around development. In recent years, although new training methods such as combining sports and education, socialization, and professionalism have begun to emerge in China, their development is not mature enough. Generally speaking, traditional professional sports teams still dominate the training model of basketball players in China. The basic training method of American basketball players is to combine sports with sports. In the United States, a mature and systematic training model combining sports and education has been formed. (2) There are large differences in the management systems of the basketball leagues between the two countries. The management system of the American Basketball Club is self-management, self-restraint, and self-motivation. The management system of Chinese basketball clubs is \u201ccommon ownership of sports enterprises\u201d and \u201cpersonal ownership,\u201d but there is no independent management. (3) There are some differences between the two countries in terms of basketball player training, basketball team, and basketball team coaching. The United States has a systematic basketball player training model, which has a good foundation in terms of cultural quality. However, the training of basketball players in China is relatively singular, and the cultural quality is relatively weak. Basketball players and coaches are mainly managed in the United States through laws, and in China, they are mainly managed through administrative means. The management of the American basketball team is mainly loose, and the management of the Chinese basketball team is highly unified.\n\nHowever, due to the limitation of time and technology, we have not conducted in-depth research on the application of wireless sensor networks in basketball culture, and we will conduct more in-depth research and discussion in the future.\n\nData Availability\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declares no potential con\ufb02icts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, {"url": "https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1089493/fiba-gcbh-lp-basketball-champions-league", "page_content": "FIBA sign partnership with US investment group, as Basketball Champions League enters new era\n\nThe International Basketball Federation (FIBA) has entered into a strategic partnership agreement with GCBH LP, a United States entity backed by experienced sports and media investors, in a bid to take Basketball Champions League (BCL) to the next level and reshape the landscape of club competitions.\n\nUnder the terms of the strategic partnership agreement, FIBA and GCBH have formed a new entity, majority owned and controlled by FIBA, called FIBA ClubCo, to jointly hold their shareholding in BCL.\n\nTogether, GCBH and FIBA will partner with 11 European national basketball leagues and the Union of European Leagues of Basketball to provide equity funding and targeted know-how to BCL to further improve, develop and commercialise the competition for the benefit of fans, players and clubs.\n\nAdditionally, FIBA ClubCo will also hold and develop the newly revamped Intercontinental Cup, which features the winners of FIBA's continental competitions and the champions of the National Basketball Association (NBA) G League, and possibly other international club competitions in the future.\n\nGCBH is said to bring important financial capital and resources, as well as expertise in the fields of media, broadcasting, digital rights, sports commercialisation, sponsorship and growth investing.\n\nIt is led by principals Brian Bailey and Kevin Tsujihara.\n\nBailey is a 25-year private equity industry veteran who has held senior positions at the Carlyle Group, Carmichael Partners, Carousel Capital and Forstmann Little & Company.\n\nTsujihara is a dynamic media executive who spent nearly 25 years at Warner Bros.

Naismith, an instructor at the school, responded to the need for an indoor winter recreational activity that could be easily learned and played in teams. Naismith wanted to develop a game that emphasized skill instead of force. The result was a team sport in which the object was to score by throwing a large ball into a (peach) basket placed about 3 m (or 10 feet) above the floor. Naismith also defined 13 basic rules, including prohibitions against running with the ball and \u201cshouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way.\u201d\n\nGraduates of the YMCA training school in Springfield helped to spread basketball throughout the world. By the 1930s, it was played in countries around the world, prompting its acceptance as an official Olympic men\u2019s competition in 1936.\n\nBasketball in Canada\n\nMany students at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield were Canadian, and these young men (e.g., Lyman Archibald, J. Howard Crocker, William H. Ball) helped establish the new game across the country. By 1900, basketball was being played in Canada by both men and women at local YMCAs and YWCAs, and in schools and clubs.\n\nIn 1923, the Canadian Amateur Basketball Association (CABA) was formed in Port Arthur [Thunder Bay], Ontario. As the official governing body for basketball in Canada, its main function was to assist with national championships, but its programs, beyond men's and women's national championships, now include: men's and women's national team development; technical development with coaching; official and player certification; youth programs; a Hall of Fame; educational services; and promotion and revenue generation. In 1973, the organization voted to adopt the international playing rules of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basketball Amateur/International Amateur Basketball Federation (FIBA). The CABA was renamed Basketball Canada by 1980, and later became Canada Basketball.\n\nBasketball is one of the most popular sports in Canada. According to the Canadian Youth Sports Report, around 354,000 youth (age 3\u201317) played basketball in 2014, making it the sixth most popular sporting activity for young Canadians after swimming, soccer, dance, hockey and skating. Among new Canadians (those whose parents were born outside Canada), basketball was second only to soccer.\n\nProfessional Basketball in Canada\n\nCanada\u2019s first professional basketball teams began playing in the 1946\u201347 season. The Toronto Huskies played that season as part of the Basketball Association of America, a forerunner of the National Basketball Association. On 1 November 1946, Toronto hosted the league\u2019s first game, playing the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens. The Huskies lost to the Knickerbockers that evening and folded at the end of the season. On the West Coast, the Vancouver Hornets played in the Pacific Coast Professional Basketball League (1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348), before the league folded. It would be several decades until professional basketball returned to Canada. In the 1980s, Canadian teams began playing in minor professional leagues such as the Continental Basketball Association and the World Basketball League.\n\nA new era in Canadian professional basketball began in 1994, when the National Basketball Association (NBA), the major professional league in the United States, awarded franchises to two Canadian cities. The Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies, who both began play in 1995, brought major professional basketball to Canada for the first time. The Grizzlies were unsuccessful and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 2001. The Raptors continue as the league's only Canadian team. Support for the Raptors has grown, with increasing numbers watching or attending games. In 2005\u201306, the average attendance at Raptors home games was 17,056 (17th of 30 teams in the NBA), but by 2015\u201316, attendance had risen to 19,825 (4th of 30 teams). Between the 2010\u201311 and 2014\u201315 seasons, TV viewership for the Raptors more than doubled, from 108,000 to 246,000.\n\nA growing number of Canadians have played on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) teams in the United States, and in the professional National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Canadian NBA players include Bob Houbregs, Bill Wennington, Rick Fox, Steve Nash, Cory Joseph and Andrew Wiggins. In 2005, while playing for the Phoenix Suns, Nash won the league's MVP award, becoming the first Canadian to receive the honour.\n\nInternational Competition\n\nBasketball appeared as a demonstration sport for male athletes at the 1904 Olympic Games in St Louis. The Edmonton Grads, a women's team, played a series of matches in conjunction with the 1924, 1928 and 1936 Olympic Summer Games. In 1936, men\u2019s basketball first appeared as an official Olympic sport. Canada's team at the 1936 Berlin Olympiad, the Windsor Ford V8s, made up of players primarily from Windsor, Ontario, and strengthened by players from the West Coast, won the silver medal, losing in the final to the United States 19 to 8. Women\u2019s basketball became an Olympic sport in 1976. Neither team has won an Olympic medal in basketball since 1936, but both have reached the podium at the Pan American Games and the FIBA Americas Championships. The women\u2019s team has also won bronze medals at the FIBA World Championships.\n\nCanada Men\u2019s National Basketball Team (Medals)\n\nOlympic Summer Games (Men)\n\n1936 Berlin, Germany Silver\n\n\n\nFIBA Americas Championship (Men)\n\n1980 San Juan, Puerto Rico Silver 1984 Sao Paulo, Brazil Bronze 1988 Montevideo, Uruguay Bronze 1999 San Juan, Puerto Rico Silver 2001 Nuequen, Argentina Bronze 2015 Mexico City, Mexico Bronze\n\n\n\nPan American Games (Men)\n\n2015 Toronto, Ontario Silver\n\nCanada Women\u2019s National Basketball Team (Medals)\n\nFIBA World Championship (Women)\n\n1979 Seoul, South Korea Bronze 1986 Vilnius, Minsk, Moscow, Soviet Union Bronze\n\n\n\nFIBA Americas Championship (Women)\n\n1989 Sao Paulo, Brazil Bronze 1993 Sao Paulo, Brazil Bronze 1995 Hamilton, Ontario Gold 1999 Havana, Cuba Bronze 2003 Culiacan, Mexico Bronze 2005 Hato Mayor, Dominican Republic Bronze 2009 Mato Grosso, Brazil Bronze 2011 Neiva, Colombia Bronze 2013 Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico Silver 2015 Edmonton, Alberta Gold\n\n\n\nPan American Games (Women)\n\n1967 Winnipeg, Manitoba Bronze 1979 San Juan, Puerto Rico Bronze 1987 Indianapolis, Indiana Bronze 1999 Winnipeg, Manitoba Silver 2015 Toronto, Ontario Gold\n\nWheelchair Basketball\n\nIn 1946, about half a century after basketball was invented, American Second World War veterans played the first documented wheelchair basketball game. Two Canadian teams soon formed \u2014 the Vancouver Dueck Powerglides in 1950 and the Montr\u00e9al Wheelchair Wonders in 1951. The game quickly became popular, and in 1968 the first Canadian championships were held in Edmonton, Alberta. Wheelchair basketball is now one of the most popular team sports for athletes with disabilities.

The Lightning\u2019s twenty-season run was unusually long by the standards of minor league basketball. The club played in the Continental Basketball Association championship series on four occasions but never managed to win a title.\n\nThroughout most of the Lightning\u2019s run in Rockford, the CBA served as the Official Development League of the NBA. Players went back and forth from Rockford to the NBA a few times a season, typically on 10-day contracts as injury replacements. Rockford\u2019s greatest success story was small forward Bruce Bowen. Bowen played parts of two CBA seasons in Rockford between 1995 and 1997 before earning a spot and sticking with the Boston Celtics. Bowen went on to win three NBA titles with the San Antonio Spurs and to earn eight NBA All-Defensive Team selections. The Spurs retired Bowen\u2019s uniform number 12 in 2012.\n\nIsaiah Thomas Fiasco\n\nThe team nearly folded in 2001 following the disastrous intrusion of former NBA star Isaiah Thomas into CBA affairs. Thomas purchased the entire league and all of its individually-owned franchises in August of 1999 for $10 million. Thomas destroyed the relationship with the NBA, spurning that league\u2019s $11 million offer to buy the CBA outright in early 2000. The NBA then announced the formation of its own minor league (known commonly today as the \u201cG-League\u201c) and terminated its long-time developmental partnership with the CBA. When Thomas was offered the opportunity to coach the NBA\u2019s Indiana Pacers in 2000, he was forced to divest his CBA holdings. He placed the league into a blind trust, which ultimately starved the franchises of operating capital and forced the league into bankruptcy. The CBA folded midway through its 55th season on February 8, 2001.\n\nLong-time Lightning owner Wayne Timpe swooped in to rescue the club after the CBA imploded. He re-acquired the franchise, reportedly for $1.00, and entered it into the rival International Basketball League to finish out the 2000-01 season. Timpe and a group of other former CBA owners then re-acquired the Continental Basketball Association\u2019s name and marks from the bankruptcy court and re-launched the league in the fall of 2001.\n\nDemise\n\nThe Lightning would go on to play another five seasons at Rockford\u2019s MetroCentre. Wayne Timpe\u2019s death from cancer in 2004 marked the beginning of the end for the franchise. Timpe\u2019s widow Judy kept the Lightning going for two more seasons before announcing that the 2005-06 season would be its last.\n\nIn 2014, former Lightning player Carson Cunningham published Underbelly Hoops, a memoir of his time in the mid-2000\u2019s CBA.

In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800 square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square metres) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Basketball was introduced in France in 1893, in England in 1894, in Australia, China, and India soon thereafter, and in Japan in 1900.\n\nWhile basketball helped swell the membership of YMCAs because of the availability of their gyms, within five years the game was outlawed by various associations because gyms that had been occupied by classes of 50 or 60 members were now monopolized by only 10 to 18 players. The banishment of the game induced many members to terminate their YMCA membership and to hire halls to play the game, thus paving the way to the professionalization of the sport.\n\nOriginally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length football trousers; jersey tights, as commonly worn by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of today\u2019s uniforms, plus knee guards. The courts often were of irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that interfered with play. In 1903 it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In 1893 the Narragansett Machinery Co. of Providence, Rhode Island, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket. Originally a ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after a goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were adopted in 1912\u201313. In 1895\u201396 the points for making a basket (goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and the points for making a free throw (shot uncontested from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed) were reduced from three to one.\n\nBaskets were frequently attached to balconies, making it easy for spectators behind a basket to lean over the railings and deflect the ball to favour one side and hinder the other; in 1895 teams were urged to provide a 4-by-6-foot (1.2-by-1.8-metre) screen for the purpose of eliminating interference. Soon after, wooden backboards proved more suitable. Glass backboards were legalized by the professionals in 1908\u201309 and by colleges in 1909\u201310. In 1920\u201321 the backboards were moved 2 feet (0.6 metre), and in 1939\u201340 4 feet, in from the end lines to reduce frequent stepping out-of-bounds. Fan-shaped backboards were made legal in 1940\u201341.\n\nA soccer ball (football) was used for the first two years. In 1894 the first basketball was marketed. It was laced, measured close to 32 inches (81 cm), or about 4 inches (10 cm) larger than the soccer ball, in circumference, and weighed less than 20 ounces (567 grams). By 1948\u201349, when the laceless molded ball was made official, the size had been set at 30 inches (76 cm).\n\nThe first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania) or the University of Iowa. C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in 1892. At Iowa, H.F. Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules and also presented the game to his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met Amos Alonzo Stagg, who became athletic director at the new University of Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was played between the University of Chicago and the University of Iowa in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The University of Chicago won, 15\u201312, with neither team using a substitute. Kallenberg refereed that game\u2014a common practice in that era\u2014and some of the spectators took exception to some of his decisions.\n\nThe colleges formed their own rules committee in 1905, and by 1913 there were at least five sets of rules: collegiate, YMCA\u2013Amateur Athletic Union, those used by state militia groups, and two varieties of professional rules. Teams often agreed to play under a different set for each half of a game. To establish some measure of uniformity, the colleges, Amateur Athletic Union, and YMCA formed the Joint Rules Committee in 1915. This group was renamed the National Basketball Committee (NBC) of the United States and Canada in 1936 and until 1979 served as the game\u2019s sole amateur rule-making body. In that year, however, the colleges broke away to form their own rules committee, and during the same year the National Federation of State High School Associations likewise assumed the task of establishing separate playing rules for the high schools. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Rules Committee for men is a 12-member board representing all three NCAA divisions. It has six members from Division I schools and three each from Divisions II and III. It has jurisdiction over colleges, junior colleges, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and Armed Forces basketball. There is a similar body for women\u2019s play."}, {"url": "http://www.insidehoops.com/cba.shtml", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nMINOR LEAGUE BASKETBALL InsideHoops Home | NBA Basketball | College Hoops | High School | Streetball | Rucker Park | NYC | Minors | WNBA | World\n\nNBA NEWS & RUMORS News NBA rumors Media Links Basketball Blog\n\n\n\nEMAIL & FORUMS Message Board Free Email\n\n\n\nSCORES & STATS Scores NBA Stats Previews Recaps Standings NBA Video Schedule Transactions\n\n\n\nNBA FEATURES Fantasy Basketball Power Rankings NBA Awards Watch NBA Articles Archive NBA Salaries Free Agents Interviews Depth Charts MVP Race Rookie Watch NBA Draft NBA Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE BASKETBALL History NBA All-Star Weekend Business Playing Tips NBA Throwback Jerseys\n\n\n\nMORE LEAGUES Olympics World USA Minors Summer\n\n\n\nWEBSITE INFO About Us Write For Us Advertise Contact Us\n\n\n\nSelect NBA Team Atlanta Hawks Boston Celtics Charlotte Bobcats Chicago Bulls Cleveland Cavaliers Dallas Mavericks Denver Nuggets Detroit Pistons Golden State Warriors Houston Rockets Indiana Pacers LA Clippers LA Lakers Memphis Grizzlies Miami Heat Milwaukee Bucks Minnesota T-Wolves New Jersey Nets New Orleans Hornets New York Knicks OKC Thunder Orlando Magic Philadelphia 76ers Phoenix Suns Portland Trail Blazers Sacramento Kings San Antonio Spurs Toronto Raptors Utah Jazz Washington Wizards\n\nCBA Basketball\n\n\n\n\n\n\"LIKE\" US ON FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsideHoops.com provides basic CBA basketball league info.

This is a first a member of the Indiana Alley Cats franchise has been so honored. Fountain has been a steady force for the Alley Cats all season long. Fountain is currently second in the CBA in scoring (23.2), third in assists (6.2), and first in steals (3) per game. The Alley Cats are on a four game winning streak and have moved to second place in the American Conference, largely because of Fountain\u0092s play.\n\n\n\nIn his first game of the week, Fountain had 34 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a 117-105, 7-0 sweep of Minot. Shawn was 11/19 from the field and 3/6 from behind the arc for Indiana. The Alley Cats were off to Pittsburgh and Fountain again led the way with 27 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists in a 110-105 win. Fountain finished the week at home, as the Alley Cats hosted conference rival Minot. Down one, Fountain hit a reverse lay-up with seven seconds left in regulation to put the Indiana ahead for good, 112-111. Fountain scored 34 points, and had 7 rebounds and 4 assists for the Alley Cats.\n\n\n\nWith the win, the Alley Cats finished the week 3-0 and moved ahead of Minot to capture second place in the American Conference. Fountain averaged 31.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2 steals a game on the week for Indiana.\n\n\n\nOther players receiving consideration were: T.J. Thompson (Albany), Nick VanderLaan (Butte), Jamar Howard (Great Falls), Ray Cunningham (Minot), Kevin Pittsnogle (Pittsburgh), John Millsap (Utah) and Galen Young (Yakama).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBA WEEKLY REVIEW | Jan. 3, 2007\n\n\n\nThe Continental Basketball Association announced today that Albany Patroons head coach Micheal Ray Richardson has been named CBA Coach of the Month for December 2006. Richardson, a former NBA All-Star and member of the 1987-88 CBA champion Patroons, guided his team to a 10-3 record, earning 61.5 quarter points, for an average of 4.73 quarter points per game. Richardson is the first Patroon head coach to win the award since the Patroons' return to the CBA in the 2005-06 season. In December, the Patroons went 7-1 against teams from the American Conference, and took three victories out of five contests on the team's first National Conference road trip of the season.\n\n\n\nDuring this time period, Richardson's players have been at or near the top of several statistical fields; guard T.J. Thompson (24.3 ppg) leads the league in scoring; while forward Jamario Moon (2.7 blocks per game) and center Eric Williams (8.5 rpg) are among the tops in their categories.\n\n\n\nThis is Richardson's second year as head coach of the Patroons; he had previously patrolled the sidelines as both a coach and player-coach for several European teams. This honor is a first for an Albany Patroons coach since the Pats returned to the CBA in 2005.\n\n\n\nKevin Pittsnogle has been named CBA Player of the Week. The West Virginia product has been a steady force for the Xplosion early this season as they have been competitive every game but has been unable to capture a win until this week.

Gary cut its deficit to two points twice in the final minute, but could not get any closer.\n\n\n\n\"We wanted to come out and be aggressive from the jump,\" said Yakama forward Antwain Barbour, who scored 18 points to go with eight rebounds. \"We wanted to make them (Gary) do things that they didn't want to do. We wanted to push the ball and get up and down the court. We know we can play well on the road.\"\n\n\n\nThe Sun Kings bounced back after dropping game one of the 2006 CBA Finals on their home court on Thursday, March 23, 119-103.\n\n\n\nAfter shooting a sizzling 58.5 pct. in its game-one victory in Yakima, Wash., the Steelheads shot only 36.4 pct.

The 2004 University of Texas alum made the Philadelphia 76ers' 2005 opening-night roster and played in 15 games, averaging 1.5 points and 2.1 rebounds, before being released. He recently received a 10-day call-up by the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 27, appearing in seven games and averaging 3.7 minutes with 1.1 rebounds per game.
