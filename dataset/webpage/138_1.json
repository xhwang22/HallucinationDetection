Her triumphant win led to a Tony-nominated performance in Arthur Kopit's \"End of the World\" (1983) and a supporting role as a saloon keep in the revisionist Western, \"Silverado\" (1985), though opportunities later became few and far between. While she logged numerous film and television roles over the years, including a long-running recurring role as a judge on \"The Practice\" (ABC, 1996-2004), Hunt developed a second career as a busy voiceover artist. She lent her surprising baritone as a narrator on environmental specials, while voicing characters in both video games - most notably on the \"God of War\" series - and various animated projects like Disney's \"Pocahontas\" (1995). By the time she was seen with regularity on such hit procedurals as \"Without a Trace\" (CBS, 2002-09) and \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (2009- ), Hunt was a familiar presence in several different mediums; a testament to both her talent and her ability to overcome the odds.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, NJ, Hunt moved to Westport, CT with her family while still an infant. Burdened with a host of health problems since birth, Hunt was misdiagnosed with cretinism at six months of age. While in her teens, she was correctly diagnosed with hypo-pituitary dwarfism, a condition in which the pituitary gland fails to release enough growth hormone. Ironically, or perhaps consequently, Hunt grew up an unusual overachiever, undaunted by her condition. She took her first stab at acting at age 12 while performing in a production of \"Flibbertigibbet\" at Westport's famed Silver Nutmeg Theater. Hunt moved to New York in the mid-1960s, where she found consistent work in summer stock theater. Concerned that her unusual physical type would limit her future as an actress, Hunt initially focused on becoming a stage director. But the lure of acting proved too powerful to resist, so in 1969, Hunt returned to Westport to study acting under dramatic coach, Robert Lewis.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hunt began a longtime association with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. Her one-woman show based on the life of Joan of Arc won the actress rave reviews and even flickers of interest from Broadway. A year later, Hunt went to New York City and made her off-Broadway debut as the Player Queen in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"Hamlet\" in Central Park. This led to Hunt's first major role as the Irish maid Nora in a 1973 production of Eugene O'Neill's play, \"Ah, Wilderness!\" Originally directed by Arvin Brown for the Long Wharf Theatre, the play eventually moved to the Circle-in-the-Square Theatre along the Great White Way in New York, where it was taped for airing as a PBS special, \"Theater In America\" (1976). Hunt's screen career began in the late 1970s, when she made her television debut in a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation of Arthur Miller's \"Fame\" (CBS, 1979). Adapted for the screen by the playwright himself, it was noteworthy that Miller specifically created Hunt's role of Mona with the actress in mind.\n\nThe following year, Hunt made her official big screen debut in Robert Altman's bloated and ultimately failed musical, \"Popeye\" (1980). Cast in a small supporting role as the feisty Mrs. Oxheart, Hunt's appearance was a fortunately forgettable cameo lost in an even more forgettable film that dogged stars Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall for years to come. Her next film, however, permanently changed her career. Tapped to co-star in the controversial drama \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" Hunt joined burgeoning young actors Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in director Peter Weir's complex drama. Based on a novel of the same name by Christopher Koch, the film told the complicated tale of an Australian journalist caught at the center of a foreign country's political overthrow. Based on the real-life events of the attempted 1965 coup of Jakarta by Indonesia's Communist party, \"Dangerously\" earned Hunt an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Eurasian photographer, Billy Kwan. The first actor to ever win an Oscar for playing a role of the opposite gender, Hunt's record stood untouched until 1999, when Hilary Swank won an Oscar for \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\nDespite her formidable talent, however, Hunt hit the proverbial glass ceiling. Though she remained consistently employed on stage - even winning two Obies and a Tony nomination in the 1980s and 1990s - the pedigree of her film work had slipped. Still, Hunt's presence in movies managed to endure throughout this period. Among her higher profile roles were supporting turns in such critical favorites as \"Silverado\" (1985), in which she played Stella, a genial saloon proprietor, and the blockbuster comedy, \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), portraying a school principle disapproving of a rough-and-tumble cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) going undercover as a kindergarten teacher to capture a wanted fugitive. In 1993, Hunt briefly returned to television, starring in the ill-fated space opera, \"Space Rangers\" (CBS, 1993), which was cancelled after just six episodes. After a brief dormancy in the mid-to late 1990s, during which time she only appeared in the horror dud, \"The Relic\" (1997), Hunt's career underwent something of a renaissance when she turned to television. In 1997, Hunt created the role of Judge Zoey Hiller on David E. Kelly's long-running legal dramedy, \"The Practice.\" A favorite recurring character for the show's fans, Hunt reprised the role more than two dozen times before the show finally adjourned its run.\n\nIn 2003, Hunt joined the cast of the HBO drama \"Carnivale\" (HBO, 2003-05) for a 10-episode run as the mysterious voice of Management. In 2005, actress Hunt added an unlikely new credit to her resume: video game icon. As the resonant, authoritative voice of the Narrator for the award-winning \"God of War\" video game series, Hunt gained a whole new generation of fans unfamiliar with her acting work. Hunt reprised the voiceover role for the game's sequel, \"God of War 2.\" Following a long vacation away from features, Hunt finally returned to the big screen with the blended family comedy \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" (2005), starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. While her role was hardly much of a challenge for the actress, the movie did at least allow Hunt a rare opportunity to flex her comedic muscles. Her next project continued in the same vein, as Dr. Mittag-Leffler in director Marc Forster's twisted comedy, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006) starring Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. After building a second career voicing narration for numerous PBS specials, including \"Secrets of the Ocean Realm\" (1997), \"Woodrow Wilson\" (2002) and \"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State\" (2004), Hunt joined the cast of the successful spin-off series, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (CBS, 2009- ), playing OSP Operations Manager Henrietta Lange."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Linda-Hunt", "page_content": "Lydia Susanna Hunter (born April 2, 1945), better known by her stage name Linda Hunt, is an American film, stage, and television actress.

Hunt portrayed the male character Billy Kwan in The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first person to win an Oscar for portraying a character of the opposite sex. Hunt has also appeared in films such as Dune (1984), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Pocahontas (1995), Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998), and Stranger Than Fiction (2006).\n\nHunt has had a successful career on television and in voice-over work, notably being the narrator for the Greek-era God of War series. From 1997 to 2002, she played the recurring role of Judge Zoey Hiller on The Practice and played Commander Chennault on the sci-fi series Space Rangers. Beginning in 2009, she has portrayed Henrietta \"Hetty\" Lange on the CBS television series NCIS: Los Angeles, a role for which she has received two Teen Choice Awards.\n\nEarly life\n\nHunt was born on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, New Jersey. Her father, Raymond Davy Hunt (1902\u20131985), was vice president of Harper Fuel Oil. Her mother, Elsie Doying Hunt (1903 \u2013 c. 1994), was a piano teacher who taught at the Westport School of Music, and performed with the Saugatuck Congregational Church Choir in Westport, Connecticut, the town where Hunt would be raised. She has one sibling, an older sister named Marcia (born 1940). Hunt attended the Interlochen Arts Academy and graduated from the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University).\n\nCareer\n\nTheatre\n\nHunt was a well-known live-stage actress before she entered film and television.

She was a member of the Long Wharf Theatre Company in Connecticut. There, she played the Player Queen in a production of Hamlet, among other roles. She portrayed Sister Aloysius in the Pasadena Playhouse production of John Patrick Shanley's play Doubt. Hunt was praised for her performance as the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children. Hunt also appeared as Pope Joan in Caryl Churchill's Top Girls when London's Royal Court Theatre's production was staged at the Public Theater in New York.\n\nIn an interview with writer Craig Gholson and actor Vincent Caristi, Hunt said: \"Acting onstage is like an explosion each night. And what comes in at you all the time as you are trying to . . . create something which is a tremendous act of organization and concentration.\"\n\nFilm\n\nKnown for her small stature, Hunt made her film debut in 1980 in Robert Altman's musical comedy Popeye.\n\nTwo years later, Hunt co-starred as Billy Kwan in The Year of Living Dangerously, Peter Weir's film adaptation of the novel of the same name. For her work in this film, Hunt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1983, becoming the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex. In her screen test, Hunt wore a hairpiece, a fake moustache, and \"paste-on pieces above her eyes to [appear] Asian.\" To play the role, Hunt had her hair dyed and cut short, had her eyebrows shaved, wore padding and makeup, and wore something in her shirt pocket. In her 1986 interview with the Bomb magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan \"is supra-personal [with] layers of sexual ambiguity[.]\"\n\nHunt also played Shadout Mapes in Dune (1984 film), a nurse in She-Devil (1989), an austere school principal opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop (1990), and assassin Ilsa Grunt in If Looks Could Kill (1991).\n\nTelevision\n\nHunt's television appearances include recurring roles as Judge Zoey Hiller on David E.

Hunt has won two Teen Choice Awards for her work on NCIS: Los Angeles.\n\nVoice work\n\nHunt is known for her husky voice. She has narrated numerous documentaries, cartoons, and commercials. She is the on-air host for City Arts & Lectures, a radio program recorded by KQED public radio at the Nourse Theater in San Francisco. Hunt voiced the role of Grandmother Willow in the animated musical film Pocahontas (1995) and its direct-to-video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998).\n\nHunt narrated the National Geographic documentary The Great Indian Railway (1995).

Del Herbert-Jane struck a more melancholic note in director Sophie Hyde\u2019s drama 52 Tuesdays, which focused on a daughter\u2019s reaction to her mother\u2019s journey to becoming a trans man.\n\nBut Peter Weir\u2019s 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, adapted by the director himself and playwright David Williamson from Christopher Koch\u2019s bestselling novel, takes the cake for the most startling gender-realigning performance in Australian cinema.\n\nAmerican actor Linda Hunt played Chinese-Australian dwarf Billy Kwan, a photographer who teams up with newbie foreign correspondent Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson) when he moves to Jakarta. Billy shows him the ropes in a city where simmering danger (the film is set in the mid 1960s, during the overthrow of President Sukarno) is about to boil over into violence and revolution.\n\nHunt\u2019s performance isn\u2019t startling because of a body-related character arc. There is no physical transformation for Billy, who has always been a man. It\u2019s startling because Hunt\u2019s performance is so good you never pause to doubt it.\n\nWhat a bold (yet strangely sensible) turn of casting: Hunt, a woman, hired to play Billy, a man, because she was simply the best fit for the part. Hunt stole the hearts and minds of audiences and wooed the Academy, who awarded her an Oscar for best supporting actress.\n\nBilly is stubborn and headstrong but needy in uncomfortable ways that the film gradually reveals. He shares similarities with acidic protagonist Barbara Covette (Judi Dench) from director Richard Eyre\u2019s Notes on a Scandal, a loquacious narrator loyal to the point of being unnervingly possessive. Hunt channels the demeanour of someone constantly trying to make sense of the environment around them, propelled to pick it apart bit by bit: a world of big things and grand purposes, overpowering and impenetrable.\n\nThere is a scene in which Billy looks up at a huge billboard-sized picture of Suharto and stands in awe, as if wowed by the might of it. Hunt\u2019s performance seems to exist in that moment: a constant struggle to come to terms with forces outside the control of Billy, a proud, cunning little man forced into humility.\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously charts his journey and those of several others with a sensibility both subtle (utterly restrained, given the subject and setting) and unforgettable (the film\u2019s images, particularly Billy\u2019s final scene and Guy\u2019s trip to the airport in the last act, will stay with you).\n\nIt opens with Billy banging away on his typewriter, writing to Guy. Moments like this form a voiceover that give the film a colourful, literary ooze, as if partly written by Billy himself. The commentary functions like film noir narration (recalling the framing of 1944 classic Double Indemnity \u2013 the confession of a crooked insurance salesman to his boss), only more florid and a little less spiffy.\n\n\u201cMost of us become children again when we enter the slums of Asia,\u201d Billy writes. \u201cLast night I watched you walk back into childhood, with all its opposite intensities. Laughter and misery, the crazy and the grim. Toy town and a city of fear.\u201d\n\nAs bold but strait-laced Hamilton \u2013 a fish out of water rising to a challenge and slowly growing frazzled and stressed \u2013 Mel Gibson cuts a solid presence in the Tom Cruise ilk of a leading man. The film\u2019s emotions either bounce off or project on to him, without the actor needing to do much. Sigourney Weaver plays his lover, and while the film\u2019s poster depicts their embrace, it\u2019s most memorable for other things \u2013 its mood, its sense of location and Hunt\u2019s tour de force performance.\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously was the first Australian film to be financed by an American studio (MGM). While indisputably there is plenty Australian about it (including key characters and cast, the crew, filming locations, government-granted tax incentives and financing for development and marketing), the producers\u2019 unprecedented wheeling and dealing with Hollywood ultimately led to an existential question for the local industry: what does the term \u201cAustralian film\u201d even mean?\n\nThat question hit a high water mark (or a moment of absurdity) in January 2014 when a blockbuster studio movie, The Great Gatsby, won 13 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards. It was not only financed by Warner Bros and led by A-list Hollywood celebrities, but based on a book widely regarded as one of the greatest and most quintessentially American novels.\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously was a stepping stone to Hollywood for Weir, whose body of work includes Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Last Wave. It was on the set of his first world war film Gallipoli that he proposed the character of Guy Hamilton to Gibson. The director, one of our very greatest, has made fine work since (including 1989\u2019s Dead Poet\u2019s Society and 1998\u2019s The Truman Show) but never returned to Australian stories."}, {"url": "https://english.elpais.com/usa/2022-01-31/when-the-oscars-rewarded-an-american-actress-for-portraying-a-chinese-australian-man.html", "page_content": "Linda Hunt with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1983. Bettmann (Bettmann Archive)\n\nJavier Bardem is at the center of the latest Hollywood controversy due to the inappropriateness \u2013 in the eyes of some at least \u2013 of the Spanish actor portraying a Cuban character, Desi Arnaz, in Being the Ricardos, the story of American comedian Lucille Ball and her husband and co-star on the sitcom I Love Lucy. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bardem played down the issue: \u201cI\u2019m an actor, and that\u2019s what I do for a living: try to be people that I\u2019m not,\u201d said the Oscar winner. Bardem also alluded to the problem being based on \u201caccents\u201d \u2013 that there tends not to be any furore over English-speakers giving a foreign tongue a go. \u201cWhere is that conversation with English-speaking people doing things like The Last Duel, where they were supposed to be French people in the Middle Ages?\u201d he wondered.\n\nIn the interview, Bardem joked about the prevailing debate on representation and casting: \u201cWe should all start not allowing anybody to play Hamlet unless they were born in Denmark.\u201d The issue tends to surface most around the awards season \u2013 the issue of diversity has more or less finished off the Golden Globes \u2013 and the decision by director Guy Nattiv to cast English actress Helen Mirren as former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir has recently been making headlines. Jewish actress Maureen Lipman criticized Mirren\u2019s involvement in the movie Golda a few weeks ago, stating that the \u201cthe Jewishness of the character is so integral.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opinion, and that\u2019s what it is, a mere opinion, is that if the character\u2019s race, creed or gender drives or defines the portrayal then the correct \u2013 for want of an umbrella [term] \u2013 ethnicity should be a priority,\u201d The Pianist actor told Variety.\n\nThe days when a director had the option to skirt the industry\u2019s norms and cast an actor not only against race or creed, but gender, seem long distant but that is exactly what Peter Weir did in 1982 when the man behind the camera on Dead Poets Society (1989) and The Truman Show (1998) was casting The Year of Living Dangerously, a romantic tale set against the backdrop of the overthrow of President Sukarno in Indonesia.\n\nHelen Mirren at the Telluride Film Festival Vivien Killilea (Getty Images)\n\nMel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver were on board, but Weir had difficulty finding an actor capable of playing the role of photographer Billy Kwan, a charismatic character who would serve as the moral compass of the movie. Weir had settled on Australian dancer David Atkins, but a clash of personalities with Gibson led him to leave the production after filming had begun. That was when a member of the casting department suggested Linda Hunt.\n\n\u201cThe sets were being built in Manila and time was of the essence,\u201d Weir said in an interview with The New York Times in 2019. \u201cThe casting agent said he had a possible Billy Kwan called L. Hunt. Later it was revealed she was a woman. We were desperate, we gave her a shot and it was brilliant.\u201d Hunt, who had enjoyed a solid career in theater to that point but was far from a household name, was more surprised than anyone by the decision. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand what I was there for; I talked to the casting director about it and he just said, \u2018This would be a part that you would play as a man,\u2019\u201d the NCIS: Los Angeles star told The Daily Beast. \u201cI said, \u2018Holy shit,\u2019 and laughed.\u201d\n\nHunt attempted to change Weir\u2019s mind but without success. \u201cCan you rewrite it for a woman?\u201d the director recalls the actor asking. \u201cI said this would change the entire story and there was a silence,\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018Could you play a man?\u2019 I asked her and there was a longer silence. \u2018Only if you believe in me,\u2019 she replied.\u201d\n\nWhen Hunt went for the first screen test they put her in a wig, a mustache and placed pieces of rubber over her eyes to give her a more oriental appearance. She looked in the mirror and said to herself: \u201cLet\u2019s take all this shit off and let me do it.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t try to pass myself off as a man; the movie wasn\u2019t about that Actress Linda Hunt\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t try to pass myself off as a man; the movie wasn\u2019t about that,\u201d Hunt told the New Straits Times in 2016. But she had to make the audience believe that she was a man. To achieve this, she cut her hair short and dyed it, and shaved her eyebrows. The result was so convincing that waiters would call her \u201csir\u201d even when she was wearing a dress.\n\nHunt, who despite playing a Chinese-Australian in The Year of Living Dangerously, is white and was born in New Jersey in 1945, was diagnosed with hypopituitary dwarfism as a teenager, which made her adolescent life difficult. \u201cWhen I was growing up, particularly during puberty in my teen years, I was so miserable because I elicited so much teasing and meanness from my teenage cohorts,\u201d she told The Daily Beast. She first felt the call of acting in a production of Peter Pan \u2013 a role traditionally played by women in the theater \u2013 but due to the reaction among the producers to her physical appearance, she decided to concentrate on directing. \u201cUntil I got to New York and saw the stupidity of that idea. If it\u2019s hard to get into acting, what is it like for a woman to become a director?\u201d\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously was Hunt\u2019s first major movie role following her debut in Robert Altman\u2019s Popeye, which was roundly panned by critics. As such, in 1982, Hunt\u2019s extraordinary talent was a secret beyond the theaters of Broadway. After the movie was released, it would never be a secret again. Spectators stayed in theaters for the credits to roll to find out who the actor playing Billy Kwan was and were surprised when it was revealed to be a woman. \u201cLinda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that she is not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another,\u201d wrote movie critic Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun Times: words that echo Bardem\u2019s in The Hollywood Reporter. Her portrayal of Billy Kwan even won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1983.\n\nHunt\u2019s performance as Kwan is not one of cinema\u2019s greatest whitewashing moments \u2013 see John Wayne as Genghis Khan in The Conqueror or Mickey Rooney playing Mr Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s \u2013 but in 2018 there was a considerable backlash when an image of Hunt in The Year of Living Dangerously was shown at the Oscars during a montage of past winners. Critics said her inclusion detracted from what was an important year for minority representation, explained Teen Vogue.\n\nDespite the controversy, a few months after the gala Weir told The New York Times that he did not regret the decision to cast Hunt. \u201cCasting is fundamental and it should not be influenced by any trends.\u201d Tell that to the Golden Globes."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/oscars-academy-awards-linda-hunt-year-of-living-dangerously-a8781306.html", "page_content": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse Loughrey Get our The Life Cinematic email for free Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But 35 years ago, when Peter Weir embraced the spirit of the title The Year of Living Dangerously and hired an American woman to play a Chinese-Australian man in that political drama, his gamble paid off: Linda Hunt became the only person to win an Academy Award for playing a cisgender character of the opposite sex.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision. The filmmaker had asked a fellow Australian David Atkins to take the role of dwarf Billy Kwan in the drama about expats in Indonesia during the 1965 coup attempt. But Atkins didn\u2019t click with the movie\u2019s star, Mel Gibson, during rehearsals. \u201cSets were being constructed in Manila, and the clock was ticking,\u201d Weir recalled in a recent email. \u201cThe casting agent said he had a possible Billy Kwan called L Hunt. He then revealed he was a she. We were desperate and gave her a try, and she was great.\u201d\n\nBut Hunt, a stage actor whose sole film credit was a part in Robert Altman\u2019s Popeye, wasn\u2019t sure she could pull off the role of a male photographer who facilitates a romance between an Australian journalist (Gibson) and a British diplomat (Sigourney Weaver). \u201cShe said, \u2018Could you rewrite it for a woman?\u2019\u201d Weir remembered. \u201cI said it would change the whole story. Silence. \u2018Could you play a man?\u2019 Now a really long silence. \u2018Only if you believe in me,\u2019 she said. So we took the plunge.\u201d\n\nDuring the early stages of production, Hunt still doubted herself. \u201cI thought, oh my God, I\u2019m going to have to go somewhere when this film opens, just away, as far as I could get,\u201d she told The Daily Beast in 2011. She said she thought her performance \u201cwas so awful. It got better and better as we went on\u201d. Hunt declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nLinda Hunt in \u2018The Year of Living Dangerously\u2019 in 1983 (Rex)\n\nCritics agreed after The Year of Living Dangerously opened in January 1983. \u201cThis is what great acting is,\u201d Roger Ebert wrote in The Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cA magical transformation of one person into another.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Vincent Canby said the crossgender casting \u201cworks to the film\u2019s advantage. It\u2019s Billy\u2019s fate to play God, and gods are, if not androgynous, then not necessarily condemned to a single sexual identity.\u201d\n\nA year later, Hunt won Best Supporting Actress from critics\u2019 associations in New York and Los Angeles. Her Oscar nomination pitted her against another woman with little big-screen experience \u2013 Cher in Silkwood \u2013 as well as Amy Irving (Yentl), Alfre Woodard (Cross Creek) and Glenn Close (The Big Chill). It would be the second of six losses for Close, who received her seventh nomination last month, for Best Actress for The Wife.\n\nAfter Hunt\u2019s name was announced, she told the academy members: \u201cThere was an Indonesian phrase in the film, which translates into English as \u2018water from the moon\u2019, and it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know. Making The Year of Living Dangerously for me was water from the moon.\u201d\n\nThe actors who\u2019ve won the most Oscars Show all 44 1 / 44 The actors who\u2019ve won the most Oscars The actors who\u2019ve won the most Oscars Anthony Hopkins.jpg Anthony Hopkins picked up his second Oscar for \u2018The Father\u2019, beating the late Chadwick Boseman in a shock victory in 2021.

Burdened with a host of health problems since birth, Hunt was misdiagnosed with cretinism at six months of age. While in her teens, she was correctly diagnosed with hypo-pituitary dwarfism, a condition in which the pituitary gland fails to release enough growth hormone. Ironically, or perhaps consequently, Hunt grew up an unusual overachiever, undaunted by her condition. She took her first stab at acting at age 12 while performing in a production of \"Flibbertigibbet\" at Westport's famed Silver Nutmeg Theater. Hunt moved to New York in the mid-1960s, where she found consistent work in summer stock theater. Concerned that her unusual physical type would limit her future as an actress, Hunt initially focused on becoming a stage director. But the lure of acting proved too powerful to resist, so in 1969, Hunt returned to Westport to study acting under dramatic coach, Robert Lewis.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hunt began a longtime association with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. Her one-woman show based on the life of Joan of Arc won the actress rave reviews and even flickers of interest from Broadway. A year later, Hunt went to New York City and made her off-Broadway debut as the Player Queen in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"Hamlet\" in Central Park. This led to Hunt's first major role as the Irish maid Nora in a 1973 production of Eugene O'Neill's play, \"Ah, Wilderness!\" Originally directed by Arvin Brown for the Long Wharf Theatre, the play eventually moved to the Circle-in-the-Square Theatre along the Great White Way in New York, where it was taped for airing as a PBS special, \"Theater In America\" (1976). Hunt's screen career began in the late 1970s, when she made her television debut in a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation of Arthur Miller's \"Fame\" (CBS, 1979). Adapted for the screen by the playwright himself, it was noteworthy that Miller specifically created Hunt's role of Mona with the actress in mind.\n\nThe following year, Hunt made her official big screen debut in Robert Altman's bloated and ultimately failed musical, \"Popeye\" (1980). Cast in a small supporting role as the feisty Mrs. Oxheart, Hunt's appearance was a fortunately forgettable cameo lost in an even more forgettable film that dogged stars Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall for years to come. Her next film, however, permanently changed her career. Tapped to co-star in the controversial drama \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" Hunt joined burgeoning young actors Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in director Peter Weir's complex drama. Based on a novel of the same name by Christopher Koch, the film told the complicated tale of an Australian journalist caught at the center of a foreign country's political overthrow. Based on the real-life events of the attempted 1965 coup of Jakarta by Indonesia's Communist party, \"Dangerously\" earned Hunt an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Eurasian photographer, Billy Kwan. The first actor to ever win an Oscar for playing a role of the opposite gender, Hunt's record stood untouched until 1999, when Hilary Swank won an Oscar for \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\nDespite her formidable talent, however, Hunt hit the proverbial glass ceiling. Though she remained consistently employed on stage - even winning two Obies and a Tony nomination in the 1980s and 1990s - the pedigree of her film work had slipped. Still, Hunt's presence in movies managed to endure throughout this period. Among her higher profile roles were supporting turns in such critical favorites as \"Silverado\" (1985), in which she played Stella, a genial saloon proprietor, and the blockbuster comedy, \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), portraying a school principle disapproving of a rough-and-tumble cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) going undercover as a kindergarten teacher to capture a wanted fugitive. In 1993, Hunt briefly returned to television, starring in the ill-fated space opera, \"Space Rangers\" (CBS, 1993), which was cancelled after just six episodes. After a brief dormancy in the mid-to late 1990s, during which time she only appeared in the horror dud, \"The Relic\" (1997), Hunt's career underwent something of a renaissance when she turned to television. In 1997, Hunt created the role of Judge Zoey Hiller on David E. Kelly's long-running legal dramedy, \"The Practice.\" A favorite recurring character for the show's fans, Hunt reprised the role more than two dozen times before the show finally adjourned its run.\n\nIn 2003, Hunt joined the cast of the HBO drama \"Carnivale\" (HBO, 2003-05) for a 10-episode run as the mysterious voice of Management. In 2005, actress Hunt added an unlikely new credit to her resume: video game icon. As the resonant, authoritative voice of the Narrator for the award-winning \"God of War\" video game series, Hunt gained a whole new generation of fans unfamiliar with her acting work. Hunt reprised the voiceover role for the game's sequel, \"God of War 2.\" Following a long vacation away from features, Hunt finally returned to the big screen with the blended family comedy \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" (2005), starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. While her role was hardly much of a challenge for the actress, the movie did at least allow Hunt a rare opportunity to flex her comedic muscles. Her next project continued in the same vein, as Dr. Mittag-Leffler in director Marc Forster's twisted comedy, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006) starring Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. After building a second career voicing narration for numerous PBS specials, including \"Secrets of the Ocean Realm\" (1997), \"Woodrow Wilson\" (2002) and \"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State\" (2004), Hunt joined the cast of the successful spin-off series, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (CBS, 2009- ), playing OSP Operations Manager Henrietta Lange."}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/linda-hunt/", "page_content": "Linda Hunt as Hetty Lange, operations manager of an elite undercover division of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in \"NCIS: Los Angeles.\"\n\n\n\nThe diminutive 4-foot, 9-inch actress is a towering talent on stage, TV, and the movie screen.
