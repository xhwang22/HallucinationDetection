I am someone who believes in not airing our dirty laundry in public.\n\n\u201cDespite me being part of the Umno supreme council, no one can point at me and say that I have ever exposed Umno\u2019s flaws to the public.\n\n\u201cI believe in respecting the party and keeping its honour. If the party is in pain, we as housekeepers must provide the cushioning measures.\n\n\u201cWe may have our differences within the party, but we live in the same house. Even when we lost (the Federal Government in 2018), Umno managed to stay intact,\u201d said Reezal.\n\nReezal also called on those who are \u201cexcessive\u201d in their campaigning to tone it down as their actions might not only take down individuals, but also give a bad name to the party.\n\n\u201cThe party is obviously still very much alive, judging from the crowd that is willing to contest all the posts in Umno both at the grassroots and national level.\n\n\u201cI offer myself as a 24-hour housekeeper of the party and I want those who vote for me to look at my record.\n\n\u201cI have been with the party since I was in my 20s and have stuck with the party through thick and thin for more than two decades, rising through the ranks. This shows that I have climbed the political steps and I offer my services. My record is for all to see.\n\nThe nomination period closes on Feb 26.\n\nUmno is in the midst of its internal elections for the 191 divisions and 22,000 branches, including the divisions that were suspended.\n\nThe party\u2019s new office bearers will be elected from Feb 1 to March 18, but the top two positions of president and deputy president will not be contested this time around.\n\nIn May last year, Umno amended its constitution to allow party polls to be held within six months after the conclusion of the 15th General Election.\n\nUmno had postponed its party elections for 18 months after the 2018/2021 term ended on June 30, 2021, which meant party polls for the 2021/2023 term should have been held before Dec 30 last year. However, the polls were postponed."}, {"url": "https://www.msn.com/en-my/news/national/ge15-reezal-merican-accepts-defeat-thanks-people-of-kepala-batas/ar-AA14jTpg", "page_content": "\u00a9 Provided by New Straits Times\n\nKEPALA BATAS: Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican, who failed to defend his Kepala Batas parliamentary seat in the 15th general election (GE15), said he accepted the decision with an open heart.\n\n\"The people of Kepala Batas have exercised their democratic rights in choosing their elected representative.\n\n\"I accept the decision made with an open heart, which is not in favour of Barisan Nasional, in Kepala Batas.\n\n\"I want to congratulate Dr Siti Mastura Muhammad for winning the seat.\n\n\"I am confident that she will be able to carry out the responsibility as a member of parliament (MP) well and can continue with the people-centric agenda which I have initiated during my tenure,\" he said.\n\nReezal Merican's defeat was seen as one of the biggest casualties in the GE15 in Penang as Kepala Batas has always been Barisan Nasional's fortress.\n\nKepala Batas was previously held by former prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and had been a safe deposit for BN in the last five decades.\n\nThe former Housing and Local Government Minister in the previous administration also thanked all voters for their support and the opportunity to represent them for two terms.\n\n\"InsyaAllah, my services as well as that of my team for Kepala Batas, will not end just because of the result.\n\n\"I will continue to serve Kepala Batas in my new capacity as this is my soul - Demi Kepala Batas,\" he added.\n\nBN failed to secure any seats in Penang in GE15.\n\nIt also failed to wrestle the Tasek Gelugor seat, which it won in the 14th general election, before it fell to Bersatu after Datuk Shahbudin Yahaya crossed over.\n\nBoth seats went to Perikatan Nasional (PN) candidates Dr Siti Mastura and Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan.\n\n\u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd"}, {"url": "https://www.sinardaily.my/article/179488/malaysia/its-a-loss-for-umno-if-kj-does-not-contest-in-ge15-reezal-merican", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nSHAH ALAM - Umno Supreme Council (MKT) member Datuk Seri Reezal Merican Naina Merican has said it will be a loss for the party if Rembau MP Khairy Jamaluddin does not contest in the 15th General Election (GE15).\n\n\n\nHe said Khairy could attract young and first-time voters.\n\n\n\n\"The voter demographics of Undi18 dynamic and Khairy has the aura to woo them.\n\n\n\n\"Just like any other politician, Khairy is not perfect but I am confident of his capabilities and abilities as a leader will continue to be an important political asset for the party's victory in the upcoming GE15,\" he said in a post on his Facebook on Sunday.\n\n\n\nKhairy was previously reported to confirm that he will not defend the Rembau parliamentary seat in GE15.
