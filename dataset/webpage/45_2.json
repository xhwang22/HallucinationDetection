The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/twila.shively/1797300", "page_content": "Twila Shively\n\nbaseball player\n\nMarch 20, 1920 (age 79)\n\nAn outfielder, she played from 1945 through 1950 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

Coast won the pool, which pushed Storm into TAV\u2019s bracket and required the Arizona squad to win twice to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nJami Rolfes\u2019 team swept two close games from Circle City 18 Purple, which was one of only two teams to advance out of its pool with a 2-3 record; then shocked the tournament by sweeping TAV.\n\nAZ Storm will take on Elevation 18-Goller in a Sunday quarterfinal. Adam Goller\u2019s team is one of just two unbeaten teams remaining in contention for the title.\n\n\u201cElevation has been great at making good decisions and being very low error all weekend,\u201d Goller said.\n\nIn our story here after Day 1, two coaches yesterday stressed the importance of coming out first in pool play, because that would require just one match win rather than two to make the Gold bracket. Indeed, six of the eight pool winners took advantage of the extra rest to sweep to the quarterfinals. All six of those teams faced opponents that had to play three tough sets just to get to that match!\n\nThe aforementioned TAV and Tri-State Elite 18 Blue were the two pool winners that didn\u2019t make the final eight. Tri-State fell in two to FC Elite 18 Elite, a young team with a junior, two sophomores and a freshman on the roster.\n\n\u201cGreatness does not know age!\u201d coach Brett Damrow exclaimed.\n\nSaturday was a massive day for the Midwest. Six of the eight quarterfinalists hail from the country\u2019s midsection. Texas, however, is not represented. The Lone Star State, which has produced bullies over the years, got four teams into the Challenge phase, but none advanced to the Gold bracket.\n\nSouthern California will be represented by Coast in the quarterfinals, but the region\u2019s very strong Friday showing was not duplicated on Saturday. After going 16-5 during the tournament\u2019s opening day, the seven SCVA teams struggled to a 2-12 mark today. Five of the seven still managed to advance out of pool play, but only Coast survived. The San Diego squad reached the quarters by downing its biggest rival, WAVE 18 Kevin.\n\nThe conclusion of pool play Saturday morning produced several plot twists from where this drama appeared to be going on Friday. Adversity G18 Adidas Purple, the club\u2019s second team; won twice, including a sweep of national No. 4 Colorado Juniors 18Kevin, to sneak into the Challenge phase at 3-2. Dallas Skyline 18 Royal won a must-win match versus Metro 18 Travel to advance from its pool. Mizuno Northern Lights 181, Circle City and SA Juniors 18 Adidas also got into the Challenge bracket by virtue of final-match do-or-die wins.\n\n\n\nUnion 18-UA, from Louisville, is the lone At-Large big recipient still in contention. Craig Bossmeyer\u2019s team is 6-0 and has been extended to three sets just twice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really just clicking and coming together when it matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as coaches put a game plan together and the girls are executing well, whether that\u2019s on blocking, defense, or something just as simple as serving. That\u2019s huge when you\u2019re matching up with this level of competition. This is high-level volleyball out here and what these girls are all about, so we\u2019re having fun but know there\u2019s an objective at the end and that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for.\u201d\n\nPremier Nebraska 18 Gold is still standing. Shannon Smolinski\u2019s, which is not at full strength due to injury, team swept MAVSKC 18-1 to win Pool 4, then eliminated A5, the No. 2 overall seed, in a Challenge match.\n\n\u201cSuper proud of this group and what they have overcome this season!\u201d Smolinski exclaimed. \u201cIt was another solid day for our serve and pass. Norah Sis was incredible offensively for us and Phyona Schrader and Lindsay Krause did a phenomenal job being our battery. The team as a whole is just playing at a really high level and all of our girls are stepping up in big moments.\u201d\n\nSaturday was a tough day for the national rankings, as No. 1 TAV and seven other teams in the top 11, were eliminated from medal contention.\n\nMintonette m. 81 is one team still alive and kicking. The hometown team took advantage of Tstreet 18-Kasia\u2019s \u201cstruggles\u201d \u2013 two 15-13 losses, to HJV 18 Elite and FC Elite, to win its pool. Audrey Flaugh\u2019s team then instigated a massive rally in Game 1 of the Challenge match with Dallas Skyline to sweep to the quarters.\n\n\u201cWith our RS, Liv Kennedy, out with injury, Syd Taylor (our bro) has moved to the left side and Addie Evans moved to libero,\u201d Flaugh said. \u201cEvans was consistent and played really well all day. Logan Flaugh (setter) was steady and calm and pin hitters Riley Kindall and London Davis stayed aggressive and were clutch in tight situations.\u201d\n\nThe Gold bracket matches get started at 8 a.m. Columbus time in Sunday. In addition to AZ Storm/Elevation, Premier Nebraska faces FC Elite, Adversity, which is probably the favorite now, squares off against m.81 and Coast battles Union.\n\nTAV is out. Of the eight remaining, any team can win.

In the frame, each player served two doubles faults and faced one break point; however, in what proved to be a crucial difference in the match, Maslova pulled out a hold while Games was unable to do so. That would be the only look at a break point Games got the entire set, as the two competitors still battled through lengthy rallies but took care of serve at a more efficient rate until the last game, when Maslova broke by winning the final two points.\n\nNo. 8 Nadejda Maslova\u2019s Road to the Championship\n\nRound of 128: def.

No. 1 Leyden Games 4-6, 6-3, 6-3\n\nA highly-competitive boy\u2019s 18s final went the way of Ravichander by a slim 7-6(2), 6-3 margin over No. 9 Zachery Lim (Fairfield, Calif.). Even with the two players hovering around a first serve percentage of 60% for the match, there were just five breaks in total, two of which took place in the first four games. For the remained of the set, a mere four break points materialized, but Ravichander and Lim continued to hold to force a tiebreak; Ravichander won the first three and final three points to take the tiebreak in commanding fashion. The second frame was more straightforward thanks to Ravichander breaking Lim twice en route to a 5-1 cushion. Lim did fight back to 5-3, but Ravichander slammed the door shut from there.\n\nNo. 17 Ishaan Ravichander\u2019s Road to the Championship\n\nRound of 128: def.

Neither player was able to gain much traction throughout the first set, as Casper broke serve a total of three times but Snyder immediately responded on each occasion. Fittingly, a back-and-forth tiebreak would decide it, where Casper battled through for the triumph, seven points to five. Casper and Snyder also traded breaks of serve in the early goings of set two, but it would be Casper producing the crucial break at 4-4. In the next game, he squandered two match points before successfully cashing in on his third.\n\nNo. 5 Luke Casper\u2019s Road to the Championship\n\nRound of 128: def.
