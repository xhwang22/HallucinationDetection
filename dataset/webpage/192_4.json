Which of the following choices most effectively combines the two underlined sentences below?\n\nAlan Dinehart was an American actor and director who initially studied to be a priest. He entered the film industry and eventually appeared in over eighty-eight films.\n\nA. Alan Dinehart was an American actor and director who initially studied to be a priest, who entered the film industry, and eventually appeared in over eight-eight films.\n\nB. Alan Dinehart was an American actor and director who initially studied to be a priest, but entered the film industry instead, eventually appearing in over eighty-eight films.\n\nC. Entering the film industry, Alan Dinehart was an American actor and director who initially studied to be a priest, and eventually appeared in over eighty-eight films.\n\nD. Alan Dinehart, entering the film industry, an American actor and director, initially studied to be a priest, and eventually appeared in over eight-eight films.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nQuestion Type: Objective\n\nB - This Objective Question is one of the most common types on the SAT and ACT: \"effectively combining\" two sentences. These questions can combine a variety of grammar subtopics, such as Punctuation Marks (Lesson 8), Sentence Structure (Lesson 9),Misplaced Modifiers (Lesson 11), Redundancy and Wordiness (Lesson 13), and more.\n\nLet's look for ways to eliminate and narrow things down. Choice A commits a Parallelism error (Lesson 10) - there is a list of three items, and two start with \"who,\" but the third item does not maintain the pattern of beginning with \"who.\" The timeline of Choice C is a bit questionable - \"entering the film industry\" (a present or ongoing action) clashes with \"[he] was an actor and director\" (which implies that he already was in the industry). Choice D has a similar problem, along with some questionable Sentence Structure (Lesson 9) - notice the back-to-back Parenthetical Clauses \"entering the film industry\" and \"an American actor and director,\" which feel clunky and disorganized.\n\nChoice B avoids any grammar mistakes and has a clear timeline. The Sentence Structure is the simplest, most direct option available. It's our best choice."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsages.com/alan-dinehart/", "page_content": "Birth Name: Mason Alan Dinehart Occupation: Movie Actor Place Of Birth: Minnesota Date Of Birth: October 3, 1889 Date Of Death: July 17, 1944 Cause Of Death: N/A Ethnicity: White Nationality: American\n\nAlan Dinehart was born on the 3rd of October, 1889.

After her father was killed in an accident, Gladys became the family\u2019s main breadwinner by performing in the theatre. She was seven years old. In fact, the stage became a family venture, as her younger siblings Lottie and Jack and even her mother took up the trade. But the drive and determination to be a star belonged solely to Gladys. In 1907, her ambition would take her to Broadway and famed producer-director David Belasco, who changed her name to Mary Pickford and gave her a part in \u201cThe Warrens of Virginia.\u201d In 1909, when Pickford was between stage engagements, she approached director D. W. Griffith at the Biograph Company in New York and asked for work in moving pictures. She had no intention of working permanently in the new medium, but hoped the income would tide her over before she went back to Belasco and the stage. Pickford was intrigued with film acting, and before long she began to enjoy \u201cposing\u201d for motion pictures. She stayed with the Biograph Company, working as both an actress and writer from 1909 to 1911, leaving for a brief stint with the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP), and later with Majestic Pictures Corporation. She returned to Griffith at Biograph in early 1912, finishing out the year with him. In 1913, after a run on Broadway in \u201cA Good Little Devil,\u201d Pickford made a definitive break from the stage by signing a motion picture contract with Adolph Zukor and the Famous Players Film Company. The year 1913 marked the dawn of the feature motion picture, and Pickford was about to become its biggest star. In fact, she came to feature films with a well-established legacy. In 1911, \u201cMoving Picture Mary\u201d was the first movie star to adorn the cover of the New York Dramatic Mirror, an honor previously bestowed only on theatrical stars. And because moviegoers had already singled Pickford out as a favorite, her success in features was guaranteed. In 1914, Pickford\u2019s Tess of the Storm Country, the story of a fiery young woman fighting for the underclass, caused a sensation. The extraordinary reaction made Pickford an international star and created fan worship that had never before been witnessed. In turn, this success gave Mary Pickford incredible bargaining power. In 1916, Pickford had negotiated a contract that gave her a $10,000 a week salary, 50% of her film profits, and her own production company. Pickford would sign off on every aspect of her productions, from the script to the director. She was even known to have had a hand in editing. During these years she worked with directors Maurice Tourneur and Marshall Neilan, the writer Frances Marion, and made some of the best features of her career, including Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Stella Maris (1918), and The Hoodlum (1919). Pickford is often remembered for her portrayals of children in films including Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Daddy-Long-Legs (1919). The stories were adapted from popular novels and had been performed on stage with an adult actress (Edith Taliaferro and Ruth Chatterton) playing the role of a young girl. Pickford\u2019s petite size and youthful beauty made her ideal for these parts, but it was her acting talent that seared these roles into the public consciousness. Her portrait of childhood captured both the simplicity and complexity of a young person\u2019s inner world, and also its physicality, through body language and mannerism. In 1919, when she was only twenty-seven years old, Pickford cofounded United Artists, the first independent film distribution company, along with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her future husband Douglas Fairbanks. Then in 1920 she and Fairbanks were wed in a private ceremony, but they shared their married life with the world. At first, the couple had feared a negative reaction (both were already married when they met), but their union only fed into the romantic fantasies many fans had about Hollywood. The couple was mobbed at every port on their whirlwind European honeymoon. Back in California, they relished their place as the King and Queen of Hollywood, holding court at their home, known as Pickfair. Pickford decided to make only one film a year after 1921, focusing on the quality of her productions. Many believe that she was at her creative peak during the teens, but her films of the 1920s were the most successful. Favorite titles from this decade include a remake of Tess of the Storm Country (1922), Rosita (1923), and Sparrows (1926). Her last silent film, My Best Girl (1927), would be one of the greatest of the era. The decade\u2019s last year brought about major changes in the industry and for Mary Pickford. By 1929, the Talkies had all but obliterated silent film. Pickford knew she could not resist the change. She cut her old-fashioned curls and made two Talkies before the decade ended. Coquette (1929) won her an Oscar for best actress, and Taming of the Shrew (1929) featured the much-anticipated pairing of Pickford and Fairbanks. But even with good reviews and promotion, these films were not as successful as her silent pictures. She attempted two more sound features, then retired in 1933 after twenty-three years of making movies. And though she kept on producing films after retiring, the experience was not as rich as running her own career had been. Pickford, whose professional decline had begun in the same year as the death of her beloved mother, Gladys, in 1928, saw her brother and sister die in the 1930s. In 1936, her fairytale marriage to Fairbanks ended in divorce. Fairbanks died of heart failure only three years later. In 1937, Pickford married actor Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Rogers, her costar in My Best Girl. The marriage lasted until Mary Pickford\u2019s death in 1979.

The sound track on these prints is different than the original 1929 version. Several films exist as incomplete prints: A Timely Repentance, At a Quarter of Two, A Good Little Devil, Less than the Dust, Daddy-Long-Legs, The Hoodlum, Tess of the Storm Country. The author states that there are silent versions of Coquette and The Taming of the Shrew. It is believed that Mary Pickford wrote Their First Misunderstanding (1911), while IMDb credits George Loane Tucker.\n\nCitation\n\nSchmidt, Christel. \"Mary Pickford.\" In Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal, and Monica Dall\u2019Asta, eds.
