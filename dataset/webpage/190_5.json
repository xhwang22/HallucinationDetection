The original founding members were Len \u201cBoogsie\u201d Sharpe, Barry Howard, Andy Phillips, Selwyn Tarradath, Noel Seon and Rawle Mitchell.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most distinguishing feature about Phase II Pan Groove is the fact that, from its inception, the bold decision was taken to promote the performing of original compositions in steelband competitions, earlier pioneered by Ray Holman. In keeping with this policy, the band consistently elected to perform pieces specifically composed and arranged for the instrument, by its charismatic leader and Musical Director Len \u201cBoogsie\u201d Sharpe.\n\nDespite this calculated disadvantage, Phase II, after an initial period of non-acceptance, was able to gain some recognition as from 1977, when the band captured its first North Zonal title, and thereafter emerged as Champions of the North for a then unprecedented four consecutive years (1986-1989), eventually creating history in 1987 by becoming the first unsponsored band to win the national Panorama competition, as well as the first band to do so performing its own tune. This feat was repeated in 1988, and from that year, the band has very rarely placed lower than in the top three positions, including its most recent national titles in 2005, 2006, 2008, and this year, 2013.\n\nAt the Steelband Musical Festival, \u201cBoogsie\u201d has been dubbed the Mozart of Pan by foreign adjudicators, as his compositions have been able to stand alongside those of the great classical masters. This was evident at the Festival of 1986, when the band captured third place, performing \u201cDance of the Douens\u201d composed by \u201cBoogsie.\u201d\n\nOver the years Phase II has toured extensively throughout North America, the Caribbean, Europe, South Africa and Japan, and had the distinction of being part of the cultural contingent that accompanied our Soca Worriers to the Football World Cup in Germany 2006. Its virtuoso Musical Director, generally regarded as the world\u2019s premier panist, along with his acknowledged genius as a composer and arranger, has toured extensively around the world as a solo artist, sharing stages with some of the world\u2019s greatest jazz musicians, including legendary jazz drummer Max Roach. He has been inducted as an honorary distinguished fellow of the University of Trinidad and Tobago where he now teaches musical improvisation, and was awarded the Chaconia Silver Medal in 1988 and the Humming Bird Medal Gold at the 2009 awards ceremony, for his contribution to the art form.\n\nClick for more on Phase II Pan Groove\n\nPhase II in Pictures - 2014\n\nChampion Years - 1987, 1988, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, 2014\n\nVideo Performances - 2013, 2008, 2006, 2005, 1988, 1987\n\nPhase II Arranger 2013 - 2019 - 2020 - Len \u201cBoogsie\u201d Sharpe\n\nManager: Errol Skerritt\n\nAdditional info below posted with special permission from the BestOfTrinidad.com by Ronald C.

His art and music, born out of struggle, hardship, but perhaps more importantly, out of furious curiosity and biological necessity, has manifested itself in drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, performance, music, and filmmaking. Holley\u2019s sculptures are constructed from found materials in the oldest tradition of African American sculpture. Objects, already imbued with cultural and artistic metaphor, are combined into narrative sculptures that commemorate places, people, and events. His work is now in collections of major museums throughout the world (The Museums of Fine Arts, San Francisco; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; The Philadelphia Museum of Art; The Smithsonian American Art Museum; The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, and many others), on permanent display in the United Nations, and been displayed in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nHolley did not start making and performing music in a studio nor does his creative process mirror that of the typical musician. His music and lyrics are improvised on the spot and morph and evolve with every event, concert, and recording. In Holley\u2019s original art environment, he would construct and deconstruct his visual works, repurposing their elements for new pieces. This often led to the transfer of individual narratives into the new work creating a cumulative composite image that has depth and purpose beyond its original singular meaning. The layers of sound in Holley\u2019s music, likewise, are the result of decades of evolving experimentation.\n\nHolley has released five critically acclaimed albums\u2013\u2013Just Before Music, 2012; Keeping a Record of It, 2013; MITH, 2018; National Freedom, 2020; Broken Mirror: A Selfie Reflection (with Matthew E. White), 2021. His sixth album, Oh Me Oh My, produced by Jacknife Lee, which includes collaborations with Bon Iver, Michael Stipe (REM), Moor Mother, Sharon Van Etten, and Rokia Kon\u00e9, comes out March 10, 2023, on Jagjaguwar.\n\nHe has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand, and shared stages with Bon Iver, Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Bill Callahan, Saul Williams, Tinariwen, Daniel Lanois, and many others.\n\nHe has also experimented with film, photography, and video throughout his career. His directorial debut, the short narrative film I Snuck Off the Slave Ship, premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe 2023 podcast, Unreformed: The Story of the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, follows the history of the infamous reform school in Alabama (which many refer to as a \u201cslave camp for kids\u201d) and profiles Holley\u2019s early life and the struggles he and so many others suffered at the hands of the state of Alabama.\n\nIn 2022 Holley was named a USA Artist Fellow. His visual art is represented by Blum & Poe Gallery (Los Angeles) and Edel Assanti Gallery (London). He continues to make art and music from his home and studio in Atlanta, Georgia."}, {"url": "https://www.mundotish.com/about", "page_content": "Tish Hinojosa is a Mexican-American Singer Songwriter born in San Antonio Texas and living most recently in Austin, Texas. She is the youngest of 13 children born to two Mexican immigrants who, as stated in her song \u201cWest Side of Town,\u201d \u201cmade a good life the hard way\u2026\u201d\n\nHer songs blend the genres of country, folk and Hispanic music in a way that can only be described as a musical melting pot; unique and insightful. She sings and writes in Spanish and English and has many bilingual songs, including a full album of children\u2019s songs that has often been used by teachers as a tool for teaching the Spanish language. The Chicago Tribune put it succinctly \u201cSimply put, Hinojosa is a first-class songwriter.\u201d\n\nHinojosa started playing guitar and singing in her early years of high school at 14. She was influenced by her Mexican parents\u2019 kitchen radio with its eclectic Latino programming, her older sisters sixties records and the seventies folk rock she grew up with. By the time she started college she was playing gigs at local coffee houses and student gatherings on campus.\n\nIn 1979 she was invited to sing at the Kerrville Folk Festival, but was also required to present some original songs. Even though she had never written before, she won the New Folk Songwriters contest that year and launched her career as a writer.\n\nTish moved to Northern New Mexico in 1979, to follow her friends and mentors Bill and Bonnie Hearne where she learned about country music and gathered experience as a singer, a writer, a band leader as well as a back-up singer for fellow Texan Michael Martin Murphey.\n\nIn New Mexico she also met her former husband, Craig Barker and decided to try her hand at singing and songwriting in Nashville. While there, she worked as a demo singer for Mel Tillis\u2019 publishing company alongside legendary songwriter and producer Buddy Cannon. She had her first child Adam, in Nashville in 1984.\n\nAfter a couple of years on the Nashville scene Hinojosa and her young family decided that \u201cMusic Row\u201d wasn\u2019t the right answer and returned to New Mexico, where she gave birth to her second child, Maria (Nina) in 1987. They eventually decided to relocate to Austin, Texas where there was a growing and vibrant \u201cAlternative Country\u201d music scene.\n\nJust after the move to Texas, Tish decided to give Nashville one final shot. She drove all night with her babies and a niece in the car for help and moral support and presented some of her original songs at a songwriters showcase at the famed Bluebird Caf\u00e9.\n\nAfter the session she was approached by an A&M record executive with the coveted words, \u201cI like what I heard.\u201d A few months later she was signed by her first major record label (A&M) and her national and international career were on their way. She released her first studio album Homeland the next year.\n\nThis album met with great success and ultimately one of the songs \u201cAdonde Voy,\u201d was covered by Linda Ronstadt. It became a multi-platinum release in Korea for Tish.\n\nHer songs have been covered by other artists; she has written and worked with, Peter Rowan, Joan Baez, Chris Hillman, Booker T. Jones, Kris Kristofferson and Pete Seeger.\n\nHinojosa\u2019s music catalog now includes 14 studio albums as well as live albums and retrospectives. She has played at the White House for President and Mrs. Bill Clinton and at The Texas Governor\u2019s mansion for then Governor George W. Bush. She was inducted into the Texas Songwriters Association Music Legends Hall of Fame in 2018. She was awarded membership to The Texas Institute of Letters, as only the second songwriter ever to be given the honor of membership, in 2019.\n\nThroughout her career Tish has contributed her talent to numerous causes such as bilingual education, immigration, and farm workers rights. She continues in these endeavors today.\n\nHinojosa has toured extensively throughout the United States, North America, Europe and Korea in her 40 plus year career. She moved to Hamburg, Germany in 2005 where she gained a greater appreciation of European city life and the deep history and culture of that continent. She returned to Austin in 2013.\n\nShe now splits her time between Austin, Texas and Tubac, Arizona with her husband Lynn, and loves being \u201cAbuelita\u201d to her 4 grandchildren ranging from 13 years to 16 months (with number 5 on the way).\n\nCurrently Tish is ramping up her solo career and tour dates after an 18-month hiatus due to COVID. She also continues to play and write with her Latina music trio The Texicana Mamas, (launched in 2018) who released their first album in 2020, amid the pandemic. Coincidentally, their initial gig was played at the Bluebird Caf\u00e9; they have since played at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC in early 2020 (just pre-pandemic) and will grace the stage at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville in September 2021. They are slated to headline at the Kerrville Folk Festival in October of this year (2021).
