McClendon was named interim head coach at UGA at the end of the 2015 season and led the Bulldogs to a 24-17 victory over Penn State in the TaxSlayer Bowl.\n\n\n\nSince that time McClendon has held assistant coaching positions at South Carolina (2016-19) and Oregon (2020-21). He had accepted the post of co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach at Miami in January of 2022 but left when his alma mater offered him his current position.\n\n\n\nAt UGA, he coached a number of elite running backs during his tenure, including Isaiah Crowell, Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, as well as Nick Chubb and Sony Michel. Additionally, McClendon was named National Recruiter of the Year by 247Sports in 2014. McClendon lettered as a wide receiver at Georgia in 2002-05. During that time, the Bulldogs won three SEC Eastern Division titles, two SEC championships and played in four bowl games (2003 Nokia Sugar, \u201904 Capital One, \u201805 Outback, \u201806 Nokia Sugar), winning three of them.\n\n\n\nHe graduated in December 2005 with a degree in Recreation and Leisure Studies.

Dawgs247 has confirmed that Kirby Smart has tapped him as the new wide receivers coach at UGA. The news was first reported by Palmer Thombs of DawgsHQ.\n\nThe Mays High School (Atlanta, Ga.) product joins the Bulldog staff after an extremely short stint (less than four weeks) at Miami where he was holding the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach titles. McClendon replaces Cortez Hankton, who left for LSU after being the Bulldogs wide receivers coach and pass-game coordinator the past few seasons.\n\nMcClendon was the receivers coach at Oregon in 2020 and 2021. He was also the Ducks' interim head coach when Mario Cristobol left to take the Miami job. He was at South Carolina for the four seasons prior to that where he was hired by Will Muschamp, a current assistant coach on Georgia's defensive staff. McClendon held the co-offensive coordinator title at South Carolina in 2016 and 2017. He then became the offensive coordinator and play caller in 2018 and 2019 before being relieved of his duties.\n\nDuring his time with the Gamecocks McClendon helped develop current NFL wideouts Deebo Samuel and Bryan Edwards. They each went over 800 yards receiving in 2018 while Shi Smith had 673 yards receiving. Edwards stayed for the 2019 season and had over 800 yards receiving in that season, too.\n\nHis coaching career began at UGA in 2007 as a graduate assistant. He spent two seasons in that role before being promoted by Mark Richt to the on-field staff in 2009 as running backs coach. McClendon coached running backs from 2009 to 2014 and grew into one of the nation's top recruiters.\n\nMcClendon had a huge hand in Georgia winning out in the hotly tested recruitments of prospects like Isaiah Crowell, Isaiah Wynn, Keith Marshall, Todd Gurley, Sony Michel, and Nick Chubb among others. He was moved to coach wide receivers in 2015 to make room for Thomas Brown to join the coaching staff, but he spent just one season in that role before Richt was fired and most of the staff was let go. McClendon stayed on with the Bulldogs for the 2015 TaxSlayer Bowl and helped lead the team to a victory over Penn State.\n\nMcClendon is the son of UGA running back great Willie McClendon and joined the UGA football team as a player in 2002. He spent four years with the program and was a part of two SEC Championship teams in 2002 and 2005. Smart was the running backs coach on that 2005 team while McClendon was the team's second-leading receiver behind Leonard Pope. After his time at UGA as a player, McClendon was picked up by the Chicago Bears but didn't make it to the 2006 season with the team before he was let go.\n\nIncluding Smart, the on-field staff now includes four UGA alumni. McClendon joins Todd Hartley (tight ends) and Will Muschamp (defensive assistant). Former UGA quarterback and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo has also recently joined the staff as an offensive analyst."}, {"url": "https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sports/bryan-mcclendon-former-georgia-and-south-carolina-assistant-reportedly-lands-acc-co-oc-job/", "page_content": "Bryan McClendon, a former assistant coach at Georgia and South Carolina, has reportedly landed a new job with the Miami Hurricanes.\n\nMcClendon, who was the interim coach at Oregon after he held a similar post at Georgia, is set to become the co-offensive coordinator at Miami, Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports reported.\n\nAt Oregon, McClendon was the Pass Game Coordinator/wide receivers coach.

All six of those scores, including the game winner against Georgia Tech, came during his senior season. From there it was the NFL, playing one season for the Chicago Bears before returning back to Athens to coach under Mark Richt.\n\nMcClendon was a graduate assistant during the 2007 and 2008 seasons until he was promoted into the role of running backs coach in 2009. Recruiting the likes of Todd Gurley, Keith Marshall, Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, Georgia under McClendon continued to build its reputation as \u201cRBU.\u201d In his final season at Georgia, McClendon moved to coaching wide receivers where he has remained for the rest of his career. He also served as the interim head coach, leading the Bulldogs to victory over Penn State in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl.\n\nWhen Richt left Georgia, so too did McClendon. He joined forces with Will Muschamp, who is on staff at Georgia now, at South Carolina from 2016 to 2019 focusing on the Gamecock wide receivers the entirety of his time there as well as his duties as offensive coordinator in 2018 and 2019. Under McClendon\u2019s direction, Deebo Samuel earned All-SEC honors with 62 catches for 882 yards and 11 touchdowns while Bryan Edwards and Shi Smith also combined for 100 receptions, 1,519 yards and 11 touchdowns. McClendon then went to Oregon for two seasons as the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator, also serving as the interim head coach when Cristobal made the move to Miami.\n\nMcClendon will be tasked with replacing quite a bit of lost talent and production in the wide receiver room this coming season. Aside from the departure of former position coach Cortez Hankton, Georgia saw George Pickens leave for the NFL Draft and Jermaine Burton, as well as Justin Robinson and Jaylen Johnson, enter the transfer portal.
