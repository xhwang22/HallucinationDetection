Our teams are:\n\nEarly Child Care and Development: These programs are focused on children aged 0-6, a period of tremendous growth in all areas of a child\u2019s development. Our ECCD interventions range from work with 0-6 year olds as well as efforts to enable parents or caregivers to promote brain development, health and well-being as children prepare for school.\n\nBasic Education: Our Basic Education programs help school-age children develop vital skills to ensure their success both in school and out. Using proven approaches such as Literacy Boost and Numeracy Boost, Save the Children is ensuring children acquire foundational literacy, math and socio-emotional skills, which will prepare them for a lifetime of learning.\n\nSchool Health and Nutrition: School Health and Nutrition programs help school age children be healthy to learn and learn to be healthy. We use comprehensive approaches to overcome the effects of chronic malnutrition, illnesses, like malaria and zika, as well as working to improve oral and vision health, access to water and sanitation including menstrual hygiene and road safety.\n\nEducation Research: Save the Children\u2019s dedicated researchers, build the capacity of the organization to better understand what works for supporting all children\u2019s learning and development.\n\nEducation in Emergencies: Save the Children\u2019s education in emergency programs ensure children return to learning as quickly as possible after the onset of a humanitarian crisis. Children experiencing natural disasters or conflict benefit from our Learning and Well-being in Emergencies approach which provides them with essential academic and socio-emotional skills to start to recover and resume some normalcy in their lives."}, {"url": "https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-nonprofit-organizations/", "page_content": "At schools, teachers are change makers. So, what happens to student learning when only one in six teachers in a district has proper training? New York City confronted such a crisis in 2000 and they needed help. In particular, they needed to address low graduation rates among minority and low-income students, the students most often in classrooms with underqualified teachers. In collaboration with the educational nonprofit The New Teacher\u2019s Project (TNTP), the New York City Department of Education rolled out a plan to help ensure that every student in the city had a credentialed, talented teacher in the classroom.\n\nAlmost two decades later, the department\u2019s plan, the New York City Teaching Fellows program, has transformed the city\u2019s public schools. With nearly 19,000 talented teachers recruited, who now make up 12 percent of the city\u2019s teachers, the program has placed effective teachers throughout the city. While New York City has more goals to achieve, on-time graduation rates for black and Hispanic students have moved from 40 percent to 60 percent since the teaching fellows program started.\n\nSolving the most pressing issues in education requires collaboration between institutions. Education nonprofit organizations can play a key role in leading school districts in shifts to educational policy and leadership that can help schools overcome the challenges to delivering an equitable education. Those interested in forging meaningful changes in education should consider how a Master of Education in Education Policy and Leadership can help develop the skills needed to make a difference.\n\nThe Role of Education Nonprofit Organizations\n\nEducation nonprofit organizations help schools tackle the problems of limited resources, achievement gaps, and opportunity gaps in schools. Far too often, schools lack what they need. This is particularly true of schools serving predominantly low-income and minority students. According to a 2018 National Center for Education Statistics study, 1.3 million students, nearly half of them minorities, drop out of school every year. Education nonprofit organizations address the causes of such problems as early as prekindergarten, and they take on various tasks in the process. These nonprofits do everything from training volunteers to provide programming that ensures that all children are ready for kindergarten to aiding districts in effective teacher recruitment. Some education nonprofits deliver training and professional development to teachers and administrators, and others organize extracurricular programs or provide educational materials and other important resources that may be in short supply.\n\nGrants, government money, and donations from individuals and corporations, as well as in-kind contributions, fund education nonprofit organizations. But the teams of dedicated, knowledgeable individuals who innovate ways to improve retention, help teachers use data to drive instruction, and advocate for policies that improve access to a quality education regardless of skin color, zip code, or first language, allow these organizations to thrive.\n\nSchools can\u2019t control many factors that influence student achievement. For example, socioeconomic status can impact a students\u2019 access to educational support, such as whether they can afford professional tutoring. Socioeconomic status can also affect a student\u2019s attitude toward education. In low-income communities, there may be less emphasis on going to college and more focus on getting a job to survive. The parents of students in disenfranchised communities may also have limited education or lack English proficiency. This can restrict their ability to meet educational goals for their children or to offer help with homework. In addition, schools serving marginalized students are more likely to be run-down, poorly equipped, overcrowded, located in violent neighborhoods, and staffed with less-experienced teachers. All these factors disadvantage students and make reaching their greatest potential much more challenging. The best education nonprofit organizations, however, help level the playing field. They play a vital part in overcoming educational inequities and the future success of education in the United States.\n\nEducation Nonprofit Organizations Making a Difference\n\nAcross the nation, education nonprofit organizations work to improve education in the U.S. They address the multiple challenges schools face in ensuring that all children can reach their full potential.\n\nCity Year\n\nCity Year recognizes that students living in high poverty areas are twice as likely to experience traumatic events like violent crime or abuse that disrupt their ability to learn. To overcome this, schools need resources. City Year helps high-need communities by supplying talented tutors to help make up for this gap. City Year\u2019s tutors collaborate with teachers to support academic success in the classroom. They improve school culture by serving as mentors to students they tutor, focusing on their emotional and social needs.\n\nTeach for America\n\nTeach for America cultivates education leaders who work to make systemic changes that help eliminate educational inequities. The Teach for America model recruits \u201cpromising leaders\u201d who agree to teach in a low-income community for two years. It provides educational resources to the communities and a support network to the recruits. Following their service, recruits either continue teaching, assume leadership roles in education, or serve in other capacities as advocates for educational equity.\n\nThe New Teacher Project\n\nThe New Teacher Project (TNTP) strives to end inequities in schools and ensure that all students have access to a vibrant education. The organization trains teachers and administrators to create engaging classrooms, rigorous instruction, and school policies that support positive learning environments. TNTP also counsels education decision-makers, helps schools leverage data to promote effectiveness in areas such as teacher evaluations and training.\n\nPeace Corps\n\nThe Peace Corps promotes friendship and peace between the United States and partnering nations across the globe. To achieve this goal, they match skilled volunteers to international communities in need of trained individuals in areas such as education and health care. Volunteers work alongside local leaders to address local needs and cultivate mutual cultural understanding.\n\nAssociation of Independent Schools of Greater Washington\n\nThe Association of Independent Schools of Greater Washington (AISGW) promotes high professional standards and best practices among educators in independent schools in Washington, DC. The organization provides research opportunities on educational topics and sponsors professional development activities as well as networking opportunities meant to lower operational costs and improve efficiency in areas such as hiring and admissions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools\n\nServing the students of the nation\u2019s capital, District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) dedicates itself to creating joyful, rigorous learning experiences in a nurturing environment. It focuses on teaching excellence; setting clear, high expectations for students and teachers; and creating supportive school environments. Several initiatives \u2014 including nutrition programs, extracurricular activities and field trips, English language learner programs, and the Empowering Males of Color initiative \u2014 all seek to address inequities within the system.\n\nCapital Teaching Residency\n\nThe Capital Teaching Residency seeks to ensure that every student in Washington, DC, has access to the highest quality teachers. It focuses on teacher effectiveness, retention, and impact. It recruits talented teaching residents who serve for one year alongside lead teachers who offer coaching. Following the first year, residents teach for two years and earn a fully funded or subsidized Master of Arts in Teaching.\n\nUrban Teachers\n\nUrban Teachers supplies students in urban schools with excellent teachers committed to equity and inclusivity. The four-year program provides training and resources for new teachers in Washington, DC; Baltimore, Maryland; and Dallas, Texas. Participants spend their first year under the tutelage of an experienced teacher and attend graduate classes in the evenings. During their second year, participants complete their master\u2019s degree in education and teach as full-time salaried teachers. During their third and fourth years, participants complete their program commitment as full-time teachers while continuing to receive active guidance and coaching.\n\nStand for Children\n\nStand for Children commits itself to helping students receive a quality education regardless of socioeconomic status, race, or geographic location. The organization engages parents to actively support their children\u2019s education. It also lobbies for policies proven to help students achieve reading proficiency and other milestones. In addition, it seeks out political candidates devoted to equitable education measures and then works to get them elected.\n\nCollaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning\n\nThe Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) promotes social and emotional learning (SEL). The organization strives to ensure education focuses on the whole child. CASEL increases knowledge and awareness about SEL by promoting research used to develop SEL tools and resources for the classroom. CASEL also works with policy makers to develop SEL guidelines for pre-K-12 and builds networks that promote SEL in education.\n\nDeveloping the Skills Needed to Achieve Education Equity\n\nEducation leaders who support the missions of education nonprofits like those described above need advanced knowledge in key areas. An advanced degree in education policy and leadership can help. A Master of Education in Educational Policy and Leadership offers students the opportunity to learn critical information about the design, adoption, and implementation of educational policies. Coursework develops a deep understanding of the historical context of major public policy issues, such as standards, teacher quality, and accountability.\n\nMany education nonprofits support teachers. A Master of Education in Educational Policy and Leadership curriculum explores teacher mentorship strategies, methods of evaluating instruction, and frameworks for giving constructive feedback. Coursework also focuses on gathering and using data to improve learning outcomes. In addition, students have the opportunity to build the project management and client relation skills needed to carry out initiatives essential to education nonprofit work.\n\nLearn More About Earning a Master\u2019s in Education Policy and Leadership\n\nEducation nonprofit organizations help shape education policy and create social change by addressing the need for quality education resources and strong teacher support and training. These organizations identify the systemic changes required to provide equitable education to all children, as well as the policies needed to make changes happen.\n\nIf you are committed to building just communities in which every child receives an equitable education, consider a career in education policy and leadership.

Our vision is to ensure that everyone can achieve her or his full potential with access to a quality education and lifelong learning. We envision a world in which all countries prepare all their children and youth to succeed as citizens and have the tools to participate in their country\u2019s development.\n\nBy 2030, our target is to halve Learning Poverty \u2013 the share of 10-year-old children around the world who cannot read and understand a simple text. We are working toward the target by helping countries build foundational skills like literacy, numeracy, and socioemotional skills \u2013 the building blocks for all other learning. Throughout all education levels \u2013 from early childhood to tertiary education and beyond \u2013 we help children and youth acquire the skills they need to thrive in school, the labor market and throughout their lives.\n\nWe work directly with governments, providing technical assistance, loans, and grants. We help countries share and apply innovative solutions to education challenges, focusing on systemic reform throughout the education cycle.\n\nWorld Bank support to countries covers the entire learning cycle to support resilient, equitable, and inclusive education systems that ensure learning happens for everyone. We do this by generating and disseminating evidence, ensuring alignment with policymaking processes, and bridging the gap between research and practice.\n\nThe World Bank is the largest source of external financing for education in developing countries, with a portfolio of about $24 billion in 95 countries, including IBRD, IDA and Recipient-Executed Trust Funds. IDA operations comprise about 60% of the education portfolio. In the last three fiscal years (FY 20-22), our lending for education has doubled compared to the preceding 10 years.\n\nOur portfolio encompasses the whole learning cycle. The investment in early childhood education has increased dramatically and now accounts for 11% of our portfolio. About 25% of our portfolio is in FCV settings.\n\nWorld Bank projects reach at least 432 million students and 18 million teachers \u2013 one-third of students and nearly a quarter of teachers in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nWe are also the largest implementing agency of the Global Partnership for Education\u2019s (GPE) grants for low-income countries, managing 55% of GPE\u2019s portfolio at the country level ($1.9 billion).\n\nStrategic Approach to Education\n\nOur vision for the future is that learning should happen with joy, purpose, and rigor for everyone, everywhere. This vision should guide today\u2019s investments and policy reforms so that countries can lay the foundations for effective, equitable, and resilient education systems.\n\nTo guide our policy advisory and operational support to countries, we focus on policy actions that are needed to accelerate learning and that characterize the way many successful systems operate. These are presented within five interrelated pillars of a well-functioning education system that underpin the World Bank\u2019s education policy approach: learners, teachers, learning resources, schools, and system management.\n\nLearners are prepared and motivated to learn; Teachers at all levels are effective and valued; Classrooms are equipped for learning; Schools are safe and inclusive spaces; and Education systems are well managed.\n\nOur Principles\n\nTackling the Global Learning Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nEven before COVID-19, the world was facing a learning and skills crisis. COVID-19 deepened this crisis. School closures have led to huge learning losses, and without urgent policy action, today\u2019s students could lose 10% of their future average annual earnings. Beyond reduced incomes, learning losses will lead to lower productivity, greater inequality, and increased risks of social unrest for decades to come. These trends can be reversed if countries act quickly, decisively, and with adequate resources, guided by evidence on what works.\n\nThe World Bank responded to the pandemic immediately, ramping up its support to countries through a variety of different channels and on different priority interventions.\n\nOur operational and policy support is not just responding to the crisis, but is building forward better so that systems use this window of opportunity to shape more resilient systems that are better prepared to cope with future shocks, as well as more equitable systems that ensure opportunities for all. Our operations are helping countries re-enroll and retain students in school, measure learning losses, and implement evidence-based pedagogical approaches for accelerating learning, including targeted instruction and self-guided learning.\n\nLaying the groundwork for the future, now\n\nThe predicted increase in Learning Poverty is a simulation, not a forecast. Learning losses can be minimized if urgent action is taken now.\n\nCountry challenges vary, but there is a menu of options to build forward better, more resilient, and equitable education systems.\n\nCountries are facing an education crisis that requires a two-pronged approach: first, confronting the emergency and supporting actions to recover lost time through remedial and accelerated learning; and, second, building on these investments for a more equitable, resilient, and effective system.\n\nRecovering from the learning crisis must be a political priority, backed with adequate financing and the resolve to implement needed reforms. Domestic financing for education over the last two years has not kept pace with the need to recover and accelerate learning. Across low- and lower-middle-income countries, the average share of education in government budgets fell during the pandemic, and in 2022 it remained below 2019 levels.\n\nThe best chance for a better future is to invest in education and make sure each dollar is put toward improving learning. In a time of fiscal pressure, protecting spending that yields long-run gains \u2013 like spending on education \u2013 will maximize impact.\n\nEvidence-based policy responses at scale are crucial to recover and accelerate learning. The RAPID framework for learning recovery can provide this approach. Its five elements are focused on ensuring that all children and youth are in school and building the foundational skills that they will need for success in school and beyond:\n\nR each every child and keep them in school\n\neach every child and keep them in school A ssess learning levels regularly\n\nssess learning levels regularly P rioritize teaching the fundamentals\n\nrioritize teaching the fundamentals I ncrease the efficiency of instruction including through catch-up learning\n\nncrease the efficiency of instruction including through catch-up learning Develop psychosocial health and well-being\n\nWithout prompt action, there is a serious risk that the learning losses suffered during the pandemic could become permanent. But countries that adopt these five elements \u2013 tailored to their own contexts \u2013 can quickly make up the losses.\n\nEducation technology can be a powerful tool to implement these actions by supporting teachers, children, principals, and parents; expanding accessible digital learning platforms, including radio/TV/Online learning resources (which is here to stay); and using data to identify and help at-risk children, personalize learning, and improve service delivery.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWe must seize this opportunity to reimagine education in bold ways. The World Bank is committed to supporting countries during these challenging times. Together, we can build forward better more equitable, effective, and resilient education systems for the world\u2019s children and youth. We not only owe it to them \u2013 in their minds rest our future.\n\nGlobal Initiatives\n\nAt the global level, the World Bank promotes cross-regional and cross-sectoral knowledge; fosters in-depth technical knowledge and teams of experts through Global Solutions Groups and Thematic Groups; and incubates ideas, programs, and partnerships \u2013 including with multilateral, bilateral, foundations and with civil society organizations (CSOs) \u2013 in strategic areas of knowledge, advisory, and operational support.\n\nAccelerating Improvements:\n\nSupporting countries in establishing time-bound learning targets and a focused education investment plan, outlining actions and investments geared to achieve these goals.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the Accelerator Program works with a set of \u2018Accelerator\u2019 countries to channel investments in education and to learn from each other. The program coordinates efforts across partners to ensure that the countries in the program show improvements in foundational skills at scale over the next three to five years. These investment plans build on the collective work of multiple partners, and leverage the latest evidence on what works, and how best to plan for implementation.\n\nUniversalizing Foundational Literacy:\n\nReadying children for the future by supporting acquisition of foundational skills \u2013 the most fundamental of which is literacy \u2013 which are the gateway to other skills and subjects.\n\nThe Literacy Policy Package (LPP) includes near-term interventions of the education approach that successful countries have followed to help all children in classrooms become literate today. These include assuring political and technical commitment to making all children literate; ensuring effective literacy instruction by supporting teachers; providing quality, age-appropriate books; teaching children first in the language they speak and understand best; and fostering children\u2019s oral language abilities and love of books and reading.\n\nStrengthening Measurement Systems:\n\nEnabling countries to gather and evaluate information on learning and its drivers more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe World Bank supports initiatives to help countries effectively build and strengthen their measurement systems to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. Examples of this work include:\n\n(1) The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD): developed by the World Bank\u2019s Education Global Practice, can help countries reduce Learning Poverty. This tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context by focusing on the three dimensions of practices, policies, and politics. GEPD:\n\nHighlights gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; Allows governments to track progress as they act to close the gaps.\n\nThe GEPD has been implemented in seven education systems \u2013 Ethiopia, Jordan, Madagascar, Niger, Peru, Sierra Leone and Rwanda \u2013 and preparation is ongoing in eight more countries with expected completion by the end of 2024.\n\n(2) Learning Assessment Platform (LeAP): a one-stop shop for knowledge, capacity-building tools, support for policy dialogue, and technical staff expertise to aid those working toward better assessment for better learning. LeAP is currently supported by the Russia Education Aid for Development (READ) Trust Fund program.\n\nBuilding & Synthesizing Evidence:\n\nFilling gaps on what works to improve learning and drawing out lessons to inform policy and implementation.\n\nGlobal Education Evidence Advisory Panel (GEEAP): The GEEAP, co-convened by the World Bank, the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, and UNICEF Office of Research-Innocenti, brings together a diverse group of leading researchers and practitioners to provide guidance for policymakers. It is chaired by Professor Kwame Akyeampong of The Open University and Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham.\n\nThe first GEEAP report focused on cost-effective policies to improve education access and foundational learning;\n\nThe second report offers guidance on how to reverse the devastating learning losses caused by the pandemic.\n\nStrategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF): In the past five years, the SIEF, a multi-donor trust fund focused on building evidence in the human development sectors, has supported 45 randomized control trials (with total funding of nearly US$20 million) that test out different approaches for improving education outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. To ensure the findings make a difference, SIEF has also invested in disseminating this evidence and building capacity of government staff, local researchers, and local journalists to help them critically appraise education evidence.\n\nSupporting Successful Teachers:\n\nHelping systems develop the right selection, incentives, and support to the professional development of teachers.\n\nThe Global Platform for Successful Teachers has two main instruments: global public goods that support the implementation of the key principles, and operations that accompany governments in implementing successful teacher policies. Currently, the World Bank Education Global Practice has over 100 active projects supporting over 18 million teachers worldwide, about a third of the teacher population in low- and middle-income countries. In 12 countries alone, these projects cover 16 million teachers, including all primary school teachers in Ethiopia and Turkey, and over 80% in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Two examples of Global Public Goods created as part of the Platform are:\n\nTeach: A World Bank-developed classroom observation tool designed to capture the quality of teaching in low- and middle-income countries, which is available in 12 languages. Since Teach launched in 2019, it has been applied in 36 countries, reaching almost 200,000 students.\n\nCoach: The World Bank\u2019s program focused on accelerating student learning by improving in-service teacher professional development (TPD) around the world. While Teach helps identify teachers\u2019 professional development needs, Coach leverages these insights to support teachers to improve their teaching.\n\nSupporting Education Finance Systems:\n\nStrengthening country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of sector spending.\n\nThe Global Education Finance Platform (GEFP) aims to support the strengthening of country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of education spending, by bringing together various partners to work on the development of sustainable financing strategies, better public financial management and stronger data and monitoring systems for education financing.\n\nOur Work in Fragile, Conflict, and Violent (FCV) Contexts:\n\nThe massive and growing global challenge of having so many children living in conflict and violent situations requires a response at the same scale and scope. Our education engagement in the Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV) context, which stands at US$5.35 billion, has grown rapidly in recent years, reflecting the ever-increasing importance of the FCV agenda in education. Indeed, these projects now account for more than 25% of the World Bank education portfolio of US$23.6 billion.\n\nAs our support continues to grow to face the more numerous and longer-lasting crises (including those induced by climate emergencies), investments will be guided by our recent White Paper. The paper states that education is especially crucial to minimizing the effects of fragility and displacement on the welfare of youth and children in the short-term and preventing the emergence of violent conflict in the long-term. It outlines our proposed way forward for keeping children safe and learning in these most difficult contexts, following the pillars of the WBG Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 11, 2023"}], "The Global Education Fund provides educational opportunities to children in developing countries.": [{"url": "https://www.unicef.org/education", "page_content": "A child\u2019s right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for too many children across the globe, schooling does not lead to learning.\n\nOver 600 million children and adolescents worldwide are unable to attain minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school.

But countries that adopt these five elements \u2013 tailored to their own contexts \u2013 can quickly make up the losses.\n\nEducation technology can be a powerful tool to implement these actions by supporting teachers, children, principals, and parents; expanding accessible digital learning platforms, including radio/TV/Online learning resources (which is here to stay); and using data to identify and help at-risk children, personalize learning, and improve service delivery.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWe must seize this opportunity to reimagine education in bold ways. The World Bank is committed to supporting countries during these challenging times. Together, we can build forward better more equitable, effective, and resilient education systems for the world\u2019s children and youth. We not only owe it to them \u2013 in their minds rest our future.\n\nGlobal Initiatives\n\nAt the global level, the World Bank promotes cross-regional and cross-sectoral knowledge; fosters in-depth technical knowledge and teams of experts through Global Solutions Groups and Thematic Groups; and incubates ideas, programs, and partnerships \u2013 including with multilateral, bilateral, foundations and with civil society organizations (CSOs) \u2013 in strategic areas of knowledge, advisory, and operational support.\n\nAccelerating Improvements:\n\nSupporting countries in establishing time-bound learning targets and a focused education investment plan, outlining actions and investments geared to achieve these goals.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the Accelerator Program works with a set of \u2018Accelerator\u2019 countries to channel investments in education and to learn from each other. The program coordinates efforts across partners to ensure that the countries in the program show improvements in foundational skills at scale over the next three to five years. These investment plans build on the collective work of multiple partners, and leverage the latest evidence on what works, and how best to plan for implementation.\n\nUniversalizing Foundational Literacy:\n\nReadying children for the future by supporting acquisition of foundational skills \u2013 the most fundamental of which is literacy \u2013 which are the gateway to other skills and subjects.\n\nThe Literacy Policy Package (LPP) includes near-term interventions of the education approach that successful countries have followed to help all children in classrooms become literate today. These include assuring political and technical commitment to making all children literate; ensuring effective literacy instruction by supporting teachers; providing quality, age-appropriate books; teaching children first in the language they speak and understand best; and fostering children\u2019s oral language abilities and love of books and reading.\n\nStrengthening Measurement Systems:\n\nEnabling countries to gather and evaluate information on learning and its drivers more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe World Bank supports initiatives to help countries effectively build and strengthen their measurement systems to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. Examples of this work include:\n\n(1) The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD): developed by the World Bank\u2019s Education Global Practice, can help countries reduce Learning Poverty. This tool offers a strong basis for identifying priorities for investment and policy reforms that are suited to each country context by focusing on the three dimensions of practices, policies, and politics. GEPD:\n\nHighlights gaps between what the evidence suggests is effective in promoting learning and what is happening in practice in each system; Allows governments to track progress as they act to close the gaps.\n\nThe GEPD has been implemented in seven education systems \u2013 Ethiopia, Jordan, Madagascar, Niger, Peru, Sierra Leone and Rwanda \u2013 and preparation is ongoing in eight more countries with expected completion by the end of 2024.\n\n(2) Learning Assessment Platform (LeAP): a one-stop shop for knowledge, capacity-building tools, support for policy dialogue, and technical staff expertise to aid those working toward better assessment for better learning. LeAP is currently supported by the Russia Education Aid for Development (READ) Trust Fund program.\n\nBuilding & Synthesizing Evidence:\n\nFilling gaps on what works to improve learning and drawing out lessons to inform policy and implementation.\n\nGlobal Education Evidence Advisory Panel (GEEAP): The GEEAP, co-convened by the World Bank, the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, and UNICEF Office of Research-Innocenti, brings together a diverse group of leading researchers and practitioners to provide guidance for policymakers. It is chaired by Professor Kwame Akyeampong of The Open University and Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham.\n\nThe first GEEAP report focused on cost-effective policies to improve education access and foundational learning;\n\nThe second report offers guidance on how to reverse the devastating learning losses caused by the pandemic.\n\nStrategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF): In the past five years, the SIEF, a multi-donor trust fund focused on building evidence in the human development sectors, has supported 45 randomized control trials (with total funding of nearly US$20 million) that test out different approaches for improving education outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. To ensure the findings make a difference, SIEF has also invested in disseminating this evidence and building capacity of government staff, local researchers, and local journalists to help them critically appraise education evidence.\n\nSupporting Successful Teachers:\n\nHelping systems develop the right selection, incentives, and support to the professional development of teachers.\n\nThe Global Platform for Successful Teachers has two main instruments: global public goods that support the implementation of the key principles, and operations that accompany governments in implementing successful teacher policies. Currently, the World Bank Education Global Practice has over 100 active projects supporting over 18 million teachers worldwide, about a third of the teacher population in low- and middle-income countries. In 12 countries alone, these projects cover 16 million teachers, including all primary school teachers in Ethiopia and Turkey, and over 80% in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Two examples of Global Public Goods created as part of the Platform are:\n\nTeach: A World Bank-developed classroom observation tool designed to capture the quality of teaching in low- and middle-income countries, which is available in 12 languages. Since Teach launched in 2019, it has been applied in 36 countries, reaching almost 200,000 students.\n\nCoach: The World Bank\u2019s program focused on accelerating student learning by improving in-service teacher professional development (TPD) around the world. While Teach helps identify teachers\u2019 professional development needs, Coach leverages these insights to support teachers to improve their teaching.\n\nSupporting Education Finance Systems:\n\nStrengthening country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of sector spending.\n\nThe Global Education Finance Platform (GEFP) aims to support the strengthening of country financing systems to mobilize more resources and improve the equity and efficiency of education spending, by bringing together various partners to work on the development of sustainable financing strategies, better public financial management and stronger data and monitoring systems for education financing.\n\nOur Work in Fragile, Conflict, and Violent (FCV) Contexts:\n\nThe massive and growing global challenge of having so many children living in conflict and violent situations requires a response at the same scale and scope. Our education engagement in the Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV) context, which stands at US$5.35 billion, has grown rapidly in recent years, reflecting the ever-increasing importance of the FCV agenda in education. Indeed, these projects now account for more than 25% of the World Bank education portfolio of US$23.6 billion.\n\nAs our support continues to grow to face the more numerous and longer-lasting crises (including those induced by climate emergencies), investments will be guided by our recent White Paper. The paper states that education is especially crucial to minimizing the effects of fragility and displacement on the welfare of youth and children in the short-term and preventing the emergence of violent conflict in the long-term. It outlines our proposed way forward for keeping children safe and learning in these most difficult contexts, following the pillars of the WBG Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 11, 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/programs/global-growth-and-opportunity/global-education-program", "page_content": "Unsupported browser detected\n\nYour browser appears to be unsupported.

In 2008, Presidential Candidate Barack Obama committed to making sure that every child has the chance to learn by creating a Global Fund for Education. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recently called for a new architecture of global cooperation that requires institutions to \u201ccombine the efficiency and capacity for action with inclusiveness.\u201d A new Global Fund for Education should be an independent and inclusive multi-stakeholder institution that builds upon existing institutions and supports country-driven solutions. It must be capable of mobilizing the approximately $7 billion annually still needed to achieve education for all, while holding all stakeholders accountable for achieving results with these resources.\n\nNone of these objectives will be achieved without a major rethinking of the global education architecture and an evolution of current mechanisms for financing education. More than 75 million children remain out of primary school, and only 53 of the 171 countries with available data have achieved gender parity in primary and secondary education. Achieving these two Millennium Development Goals, and the broader Education for All Goals set out by 164 countries, will require more capable international institutions. A Global Fund for Education that links funding to performance, that ensures a greater share of resources reach schools and that coordinates the efforts of diverse stakeholders is essential to putting these goals within reach.\n\nIn order to realize President Obama\u2019s vision for creating a Global Fund for Education, significant leadership by the United States on global education will be needed in the coming year. A clear commitment by the United States to leverage the contributions of other nations and work together to support country-driven strategies through a Global Fund for Education could catalyze unprecedented international energy around achieving education for all.\n\nPolicy Brief #169\n\nLearning from Existing and Innovative Mechanisms\n\nThe Global Fund for Education should reflect an evolution of the successful elements of existing multilateral mechanisms. Seven years ago, the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) was launched as the primary financing vehicle for achieving education for all. Working with key donors and international institutions, the FTI was supposed to mobilize the resources needed to close the massive education-financing gap. Housed within the World Bank, the FTI has not yet been able to build a strong public brand, engage the support of a number of leading donors or mobilize adequate resources from major donor countries.\n\nThe FTI has not been capable of generating resources on a scale consistent with its founding vision of achieving universal education for all. Although the FTI initially focused on expanding bilateral investments in education, in 2003 it created a multilateral Catalytic Fund to mobilize additional resources with an early focus on countries without major bilateral donors. In 2006, the FTI\u2019s multilateral Catalytic Fund represented approximately 2% of aid commitments to basic education. Although the number of countries contributing to the Catalytic Fund has increased in recent years, many of the biggest donors are still not participating, and just three countries accounted for over 70% of total pledges in 2008. As a result, the FTI faces a shortfall of $1.2 billion for the coming year, which is more than all the money it has received from donors in the last six years. Although many countries endorsed by the FTI have experienced increases in bilateral basic education funding, their share of overall assistance focused on basic education has not increased, a fact that makes it hard to rule out the possibility that overall aid trends were largely responsible for that growth.\n\nThe FTI has recently undertaken a set of internal governance reforms designed to improve its performance, but these changes alone are unlikely to overcome some of the structural challenges it still faces. Without independent capacity for action, more inclusive governance, greater attention to conflict-affected countries and stronger accountability for results the FTI will not be able to mobilize sufficient resources or deliver the results that it was set up to achieve. At the same time, the FTI\u2019s model of requiring and supporting the development of comprehensive national education strategies and seeking to align donor funding around these strategies should be incorporated in any evolution to a Global Fund for Education. Similarly, the FTI\u2019s ambition of aligning bilateral flows along with multilateral funding remains an important objective to ensure that all types of donor funding are being fully leveraged.\n\nA Global Fund for Education should also draw on the successful experience of other innovative global development financing mechanisms. Among the most successful of these new institutions is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM). Since its inception, the GFATM has generated commitments of over $20 billion and is now the leading source of external financing for tuberculosis and malaria. One of the keys to the GFATM\u2019s success in resource mobilization has been the strong engagement of both civil society and developing countries as full partners with donors in its governance. Civil society representatives and developing countries have equal standing in decision-making at the global level within the GFATM. As a result, civil society stakeholders have been at the center of the largely successful drive for resource mobilization for the Fund and partner countries are more invested in its success.\n\nToward a Global Fund for Education\n\nThe core mission of the Global Fund for Education should be to mobilize the financing needed to achieve universal quality education. Linking successful early learning with meaningful opportunities for secondary education, the Global Fund for Education should maintain a focus on achieving universal quality basic education for all while also supporting early childhood learning and secondary schooling as part of a comprehensive approach to education. The GFE should be guided by a set of core principles, focused on key objectives, and reflect an evolution of existing mechanisms:\n\n1. Independent Capacity for Action\n\nIndependence from any other international institution will be essential to establish the public profile necessary to succeed in this resource mobilization challenge. The independence of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has been a key to its success, while the lack of independence of the FTI has been a primary obstacle to its ability to mobilize sufficient resources. An independent Global Fund for Education should still leverage the expertise and commitment of other international institutions, such as UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Bank. Technical experts from these institutions can play an important role in supporting countries both in the development of national strategies and in the effective implementation of these strategies.\n\n2. Inclusive Governance\n\nDavid Gartner Former Brookings Expert\n\nInclusive governance will be critical to building a multi-stakeholder constituency that is committed to mobilizing resources. Developing countries, civil society and donor countries should be equal partners in a system in which there is equal representation and the support of each constituency is necessary for major decisions. Such a requirement in the governance structure of the GFE will not only strengthen the internal decision-making process by subjecting it to the scrutiny of diverse perspectives but will also provide external legitimacy and increase the effectiveness of its implementation efforts. Without such inclusiveness, the Global Fund for Education will not be able to succeed in either mobilizing donors to make education a top priority nor in ensuring that these resources are being well-spent in partner countries.\n\n3. Country-Driven Solutions\n\nDeveloping countries should set the agenda for the best approach for themselves through the development of comprehensive national education strategies. The Global Fund for Education should build on the FTI\u2019s ambition of aligning donor investments around comprehensive national education plans that reflect country-driven solutions. In order to ensure that strategies are truly national\u2014not simply government plans\u2014the Global Fund for Education should mandate that civil society and other non-governmental stakeholders are full partners in the development of these strategies at the national level. Just as inclusive participation at the global level supports effective resource mobilization, ensuring full participation at the national-level supports effective implementation by diverse stakeholders.\n\n4. Accountability for Results\n\nAccountability must be central to the design of the Global Fund for Education. Systems to ensure financial accountability and that money actually reaches the school level and helps students learn are essential to the effectiveness of the Fund. Performance-based disbursement, which connects continued funding with demonstrated results, is the best way to create incentives for recipient countries to deliver on promised results. In addition, key indicators including gains in enrollment, gender equity and student learning outcomes should be included among performance measures. Utilizing improved measures for assessing student learning will be critical to improving completion rates and maximizing the development gains from education. In order to ensure some reasonable predictability of financing, countries that show strong performance should be eligible for extensions of funding over significant periods.\n\n5. Focus on Low-Income and Conflict-Affected States\n\nGiven the inevitable limits on the resources of the Global Fund for Education, it is important to establish an allocation principle for distributing funding. First, the eligibility for funding should be limited to low-income countries, or those countries that are eligible for funding under the World Bank\u2019s IDA window. Second, there should be special attention to the challenges of states currently experiencing or emerging from conflict and mechanisms to ensure support for education in these states. Third, the GFE should prioritize those countries categorized as least-developed and that have the most limited national resources. Finally, funding should generally be linked to the level of effort by national governments in supporting education.\n\n6. Leverage and Align Donor Resources\n\nThe Global Fund for Education holds enormous promise for mobilizing funding from a diverse array of donors. Just as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has leveraged a two-to-one match of U.S. resources from the rest of the world, the Global Fund for Education could similarly leverage global resources for education. In order to ensure adequate incentives for countries to contribute their fair share, donor board seats should be allocated and adjusted with reference to donor contributions. In addition, there should be a regularized replenishment process built into the initial design that is linked to the overall resource needs for universal education and that encourages long-term commitments by donors. The GFE should also be committed to providing multiple channels for donor assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, as long as these funds are truly aligned with national strategies. While there is a clear need to expand multilateral financing for education far beyond what has been possible to date, it is also important that ongoing bilateral commitments are much better integrated with the objectives of national education strategies.\n\nA Global Fund for Education holds the key to delivering on the world\u2019s commitment to education for all by 2015. Evolving current mechanisms into a more independent, inclusive, and accountable institution can catalyze the resources and performance needed to achieve universal education. Since education is one of the most leveraged of all development investments, establishing a Global Fund for Education would make a major contribution to reducing global poverty, empowering women, and promoting economic growth in low-income countries around the world."}, {"url": "https://www.unesco.org/en/education-policies/financing", "page_content": "What is an education simulation model and why use it?\n\nMaking an education vision a reality is a complicated process and requires substantial human and financial resources. What happens if we want to ensure free pre-school education for all? Or lower secondary education to become free and compulsory? Or raise teachers\u2019 salaries to make teaching more attractive? These are just some of the questions to be answered when a country develops its education sector policies and plans. Without feasibility testing, countries face the risk of underfunding which leads to under or no implementation of policies and programmes. UNESCO provides direct technical support and capacity development to countries to undertake costing exercises and has also developed generic Excel-based simulation models (SimuED) that can be downloaded and used by country experts.\n\nUNESCO advocates for data-informed policy and decision-making in education. In educational planning, data can help ground policy and programme strategies and priorities in the economic and demographic realities of a country making them more likely to be realized. To help countries estimate the resources associated with implementation of their Education Policy and Strategy (ESP), in 2001 UNESCO developed the Education Policy and Strategy Simulation (EPSSim) model which has since been used in dozens of countries around the world.\n\nTo meet new education contexts and challenges and the targets of SDG4, in 2019 UNESCO launched the Simulation for Education (SimuED) model which is Excel-based and covers every sub-sector in education. Unlike other generic education simulation models, SimuED\u2019s structure allows users to select the most relevant elements and projection techniques depending on their country needs and data availability. The process simplifies the model development process reducing the time needed to use it. SimuED also allows users to easily create and compare different scenarios to facilitate prioritization and decision-making."}, {"url": "https://www.savethechildren.org/us/what-we-do/education/global-education", "page_content": "Achieving Breakthroughs in Education for Children\n\nA good quality education helps children reach their full potential; however, for millions of children and youth, it is beyond reach and many are not learning basic skills like reading and math if they do attend school.\n\nThe Global Education team works across five major areas, finding the best solutions to help children learn and thrive.
