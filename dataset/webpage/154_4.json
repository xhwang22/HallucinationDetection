As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. By the time he was twelve, he played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic. Hsu was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, and she invited him to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. He was not allowed to accept because of the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. He survived the labor camps and became known in China and toured throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic.[2]\n\nHe was a Gold Medal winner at the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition. He also garnered top prizes in other competitions. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East.\n\nIn 1979, Hsu attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Philharmonic, and the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestraope. Hsu also played with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan. Since the early 1970s, Hsu had recorded for labels such as the Columbia Records, the RCA Victor Records, the Hugo Records, the ROI Productions, and the MA Recordings in Japan.\n\nHe died in a car accident on a highway from Harbin to Qiqihar while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, aged 51.[3] He is survived by his wife and daughter.[4]"}, {"url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/faces-of-leadership-the-directors-of-jpl", "page_content": "JPL Director, 2001-2016\n\n\n\nCharles Elachi was born in Lebanon and received a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Grenoble, France, and a diploma in engineering from the Polytechnic Institute, Grenoble (both in 1968). He received a master's degree (1969) and doctorate (1971) in electrical sciences from Caltech. He also earned a master's in business administration (1978) from USC and a master's in geology (1983) from UCLA.\n\n\n\nDr. Elachi taught at Caltech, served in a variety of research and management positions at JPL beginning in 1971, specializing in remote sensing, and became the Director of JPL in May 2001. During his tenure as Director, JPL was involved in more than 20 missions including Cloudsat, Jason 1 and 2, Aquarius, OCO-2, GRACE, SMAP, GRAIL, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Phoenix, Cassini, Deep Impact, Stardust, Dawn, and Juno. Three rovers \u2014Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity\u2014 reached Mars and provided detailed information about the planet.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from JPL in June 2016 he became professor emeritus at Caltech, allowing him to pursue research interests while continuing to participate as a science investigator on a number of missions. He continues to advocate and be a spokesman for a strong space and Earth science program."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Qian-Xuesen", "page_content": "Qian Xuesen, Wade-Giles romanization Ch\u2019ien Hs\u00fceh-sen, also spelled Tsien Hsue-shen, (born December 11, 1911, Shanghai, China\u2014died October 31, 2009, Beijing), Chinese engineer and research scientist widely recognized as the \u201cfather of Chinese aerospace\u201d for his role in establishing China\u2019s ballistic missile program.\n\nQian was the only child of an aristocratic Hangzhou family whose recorded lineage of more than a thousand years has been traced to Qian Liu (852\u2013932), the founder of the Wu-Yue kingdom. His grandparents were wealthy merchants. His father, Qian Jiachi, was an educational reformer and administrator, and his mother, Zhang Lanjuan, studied the Confucian classics. Qian\u2019s family history engendered powerful emotional connections to a transforming Chinese culture that would define Qian\u2019s professional life and make him an icon of 20th-century China.\n\nQian placed third in mechanical engineering in the national college entrance examination and won a coveted slot studying railroad engineering at Shanghai\u2019s Jiaotong University, but as the promising young scientist was developing, his homeland collapsed. Failed governments had left China impoverished and weak; Shanghai was bombed and invaded by Japan in 1932. Qian graduated from Jiaotong in 1934, and the following year he left China for graduate study in aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship from the U.S. government.\n\nThe focus of the MIT program on practical applications was ill-suited to Qian, and in 1936 he left for the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to study under research engineer Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. In an age before computers, Qian\u2019s ability to quickly perform complex calculations flawlessly was an invaluable asset to von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n and a nascent group of rocket scientists at Caltech, where Qian became a recognized expert in the study of aerodynamics and jet propulsion. He received his doctorate in aeronautics from Caltech in 1939.\n\nIn 1943, during World War II, Qian helped prepare an analysis of the German rocket program for the U.S. Army, and at the war\u2019s end he traveled to Germany as a U.S. Army colonel to debrief captured German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun. He helped create and organize the U.S. long-range rocket research program and directed research on the country\u2019s first successful solid-fueled missile, the Private A. In 1947 Qian left Caltech with von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n for MIT. He then surrendered his tenured professorship in aeronautics to follow von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n back to Caltech in 1949, and that same year he succeeded von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n as the Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion and as the director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center.\n\nQian\u2019s difficulty adjusting to American culture and his strong personal attachment to China engendered suspicions during the McCarthy era that abruptly ended his career. In 1950 he was detained on charges of espionage. (It is still undetermined if there was any basis to these charges.) After five years under house arrest, Qian was allowed to return to China with his wife, Jiang Ying, and his two American-born children, son Yonggang and daughter Yongzhen. He received a hero\u2019s welcome from the Chinese government, which had negotiated with the Eisenhower administration for his release in exchange for Americans imprisoned in China.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nQian\u2019s leadership role in the founding of the U.S. rocket program led to his appointment in 1956 as the director, and later deputy director, of the Fifth Academy of the Chinese Ministry of Defense (later reorganized as the Chinese Academy of Space Technology [CAST] with Qian as director in 1968). Qian was not directly responsible for the development of any specific missile, rocket engine, or satellite. He earned the imprimatur \u201cthe father of Chinese aerospace\u201d because he personally trained the first generation of revolutionary China\u2019s aerospace engineers. Qian\u2019s loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and his commitment to the revitalization of his homeland cemented his legacy as a scientific leader. His unquestioned political integrity and patriotic zeal were indispensable in helping the aerospace program acquire critical institutional and financial support throughout the turbulent political struggles of the Maoist era.\n\nQian was a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. He held several overlapping leadership positions over the years, including the director of the Institute of Mechanics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the director of the Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, and the vice-minister of the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building.\n\nQian\u2019s career as a scientist was cut short by his administrative duties as well as by China\u2019s international isolation and technological immaturity. After his retirement in 1970, Qian turned to music, the martial arts, and traditional Chinese philosophy for intellectual stimulation. He spent the last two decades of his life in relative isolation, occasionally appearing in public to attend events or make pronouncements in support of government policies."}, {"url":

As the youngest son of a Christian pastor, he grew up singing hymns while his mother played on an upright piano. By the time he was twelve, he played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic. Hsu was invited to perform for Queen Elisabeth of Belgium and she invited him to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. He was not allowed to accept because of the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. He survived the labor camps and became known in China and toured throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic.\n\nA winner at the Rubinstein International Piano Competition, he also garnered top prizes in other competitions. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East.\n\nIn 1979, Hsu attended the Juilliard School under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzky. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Philharmonic, and the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestraope. Hsu also played with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan. Since the early 1970s, Hsu had recorded for labels such as the Columbia Records, the RCA Victor Records, the Hugo Records, the ROI Productions, and the MA Recordings in Japan.\n\nHe died in a car accident on a highway from Harbin to Qiqihar while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001, aged 51."}, {"url": "https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/hook/", "page_content": "Dr. Simon J. Hook is a senior research scientist in the Science Division at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His research is focused on improving our understanding of geologic, hydrodynamic and ecologic processes on planets. He is currently studying large lakes, wildfires and mineral distributions on Earth. He has also applied his knowledge of terrestrial geologic processes to other planets, in particular Mars.\n\nSimon has served in a variety of Project, Program and Line management positions at JPL. These include the Principal Investigator (PI) for ECOSTRESS, HyTES and MASTER, the ASTER Project Scientist, the Discipline Program Manager for Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, the Engineering and Science Directorate (ESD) Chief Scientist, the Manager for the Earth Science Section and Manager for the Science Division. He is also the Principal Investigator or co-investigator of several NASA ROSES proposals.\n\nSimon\u2019s passion is research and mission development in the optical domain, particularly the thermal infrared, he is an expert on optical radiometry and thermal infrared spectroscopy and member of several instrument teams. The instrument teams include ASTER, MODIS, SNPP, Landsat and AATSR. He has developed validation sites at Lake Tahoe, CA/NV and several other sites in California including Salton Sea, Russel Ranch, and Tonzi Ranch, for determining the absolute radiometry of airborne and spaceborne mid and thermal infrared radiometers and developing surface temperature and emissivity retrieval algorithms. The measurements at the sites are used as an absolute reference standard for multiple instruments developed by both domestic and foreign space agencies. The Lake Tahoe site was established in 1999 and has been operational for over 20 years measuring the surface temperature and other meteorological and radiation variables at 4 locations every few minutes. The Tahoe data are primarily used to calibrate and validate satellite sensors, but are also used to develop surface temperature retrieval algorithms and help understand hydrodynamic and limnological processes.\n\nSimon is the Principal Investigator for the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS). Simon led the original proposal for ECOSTRESS which was selected in 2014. He then led then development which culminated with the launch of ECOSTRESS to the International Space Station in 2018. He continues to lead the ECOSTRESS team today which is now focused on analyzing the data. ECOSTRESS provides detailed temperature and emissivity measurements of the surface of the Earth, and scientists use that information for a variety of studies, in particular, how ecosystems use water through a process called evapotranspiration (ET). The ET information is used to calculate how much water crops use to maximize the food yield or crop per drop. ECOSTRESS derives the surface temperature at resolutions of about the size of a football field, these are the highest resolution surface temperature data publicly available and allow farmers to maximize crop water use within a field. ECOSTRESS data can be used to study many other processes such as urban heating and its mitigation and monitoring volcanic activity with many more uses described on the ECOSTRESS website.\n\nECOSTRESS was originally planned as a 1-year mission but has been extended to at least 2023 as it continues to deliver critical detailed thermal information over the land and oceans. The results from ECOSTRESS have highlighted the need for frequent high resolution multispectral thermal infrared data and led, in part, to the undertaking of three new missions: TRISHNA, SBG and LSTM. TRISHNA is a French-Indian collaboration planned for launch in 2025. SBG is a US led activity with the thermal element jointly developed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and NASA, planned for launch in 2027. LSTM is led by the European Space Agency with a launch planned for 2029. This international effort will provide the first ever, freely available, daily detailed temperature maps of the land and oceans for science and societal benefit. SBG is one of the fundamental earth system observables recommended by the US National Academy in their recent Earth Science Decadal Survey. Simon is working with all 3 teams to coordinate their activities to maximize the usefulness of the data for science and society.\n\nSimon is also the PI of a new airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES). HyTES is providing key antecedent data for TRISHNA, SBG and LSTM for algorithm development and precursor science and application studies.\n\nA key aspect of Simon's research is the development of new techniques to analyze and extract critical information from optical remotely sensed data, in particular, temperature and emissivity. Techniques developed by Simon are widely used by researchers and have been incorporated into commercial packages and form the basis for the standard temperature and emissivity products from ASTER, MODIS, ECOSTRESS, Landsat and several other instruments.\n\nSimon has held multiple leadership positions at JPL, most recently as the Division Manager (DM) for the Science Division and ESD Chief Scientist (CS). As DM, he focused on increasing the transparency of Division processes, developing employees and expanding the business base for the Division. Examples include providing written expectations for all research levels and providing clear processes, metrics and pathways for scientists to be recognized and develop their careers. During his 7-year tenure, the business base for the Division increased by 30% and several new missions, led by scientists in the Division, were selected.\n\nAs ESD CS, he developed several scientific strategic initiatives (SI\u2019s). These initiatives typically fund scientists to carry out research focused on a particular mission. Simon modified the approach to combine the initiative with a related activity designed to develop the research community. The activities were cross divisional and cross directorate. For example, a recently selected Data Science SI has focused activities in Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary coupled with JPL research community activities including lectures, hackathons and short courses in Data Science. This combination of activities, are designed to elevate the knowledge of the broader community compared to just those individuals working the SI.

His instincts run to big sounds and bold statements.\" Those who heard him at the Rubinstein competition in Israel in 1983, where he won the third gold medal, long remembered his sensational performances of the Tarantella from Liszt's Venezia e Napoli, and Chopin's Sonata No 2 in B flat minor.\n\nHis recordings, including mazurkas by Chopin and Beethoven's Moonlight sonata, reveal a spirited approach with an engaging rhythmic instinct and rich tone. He was small of stature and youthful in appearance; his friends describe him as a relaxed, cheerful and generous person, a \"man of faith\" who had a positive influence on all those around him.\n\nHsu was the son of a pastor on Gulangyu island, off the south-east coast of China. An idyllic enclave much influenced by Jesuit missionaries, the area earned the nickname of \"Piano Island\" because of its extraordinary number of pianos - more than 500 in the early 1950s. Hsu was a child prodigy, and, by the age of 14, had already performed Chopin's 24 Etudes.\n\nHe entered the Shanghai Conservatory, then China's most sought-after musical training ground (thanks to the impact of teachers from the great Russian tradition), but his studies came to an abrupt end when the college was closed down during the cultural revolution. His last teacher died in Hsu's arms after being brutally tortured by Red Guards.\n\nBanished to the countryside, Hsu worked on a rice farm and in a factory; his friend, the pianist Hung-Kuan Chen, who won second prize at the Rubinstein competition when Hsu won third, recalled that Hsu never regained the same flexibility in his fingers after his banishment.\n\nHe was, however, summoned back to the piano to perform the Yellow River Concerto - a hybrid piece, based on the Yellow River Cantata by Hsien Hsing-hai, written by a committee of composers from the Central Philharmonic Society of the People's Republic of China, and promoted by Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, as a suitable \"revolutionary\" work.\n\nFor two years, Hsu and a group of musicians walked across China behind a three-wheeled vehicle carrying an upright piano, playing the Yellow River Concerto several hundred times to soldiers and farm and factory workers. Although this was an arduous task, he was pleased to have been the first Chinese pianist allowed to return to his instrument.\n\nAfter moving to America, Hsu studied at the Eastman School of Music, and with Sasha Grodnitsky at the Juilliard School of Music; he subsequently became a US citizen and settled in New York. After his success at the Rubinstein competition, he made his New York debut in 1984.\n\nHsu was sustained by his strong Christian faith. According to Hung-Kuan Chen, he had been diagnosed with cancer while still in his teens, but had refused treatment, feeling that \"if it was his time to go, he would\". That time came when the van in which he was travelling hit a stationary tractor on a dark road near Qiqihar, in north-eastern China.\n\nHsu is survived by his wife and daughter.\n\n\u00b7 Fei-Ping Hsu, pianist, born December 20 1949; died November 27 2001"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/fei-ping.hsu/2433004", "page_content": "Fei-Ping Hsu\n\npianist Christian pastor\n\n1952 (age 49)\n\nThe family realized his tremendous talent and encouraged him to study music When he was eight years old, he had a rare opportunity to meet Professor Ji-sen Fan, the head of the piano department of the Shanghai Conservatory, and was recognized as a child prodigy. By the time he was twelve-years-old, he already played the complete Chopin Etudes and had performed with the Shanghai Philharmonic. Feiping was invited to perform for the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, who was so impressed with his ability that she personally invited Feiping to study and perform in Europe under her sponsorship. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to accept this invitation because of the advent of the Cultural Revolution during the 1960s. However, he survived the labor camps and became well known in China and toured extensively throughout the Far East as a soloist with the Central Philharmonic which was the foremost leading orchestra. He also garnered top prizes in other international competitions including the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Scholarship Competition, the University of Maryland International Competition, and the Paloma O\u2019Shea International Competition (Spain). Mr. Hsu made his New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1983 and performed throughout the United States, including notable appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, District of Columbia He also frequently toured Europe, South America, and the Far East. Mr. Hsu was especially noted for his larger-than-life virtuosic style of Horowitzian pianism. In 1979, Fei-Ping Hsu received permission to study in the United States. Among others he attended the Juilliard School of Music under the tutelage of Sascha Gorodnitzki. He had given numerous concerts in Germany, France, Andorra, Switzerland, and Italy. He has appeared as a soloist with major orchestra including the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Maestro Charles Dutoit, the Moscow Philharmonic in Russia, the Finnish Tempere Symphony Orchestra in Europe, as well as numerous orchestra in the United States performing in various concert halls and music festivals. Mr. Hsu was also actively engaged in his native Asia, where his collaborations include appearances with the China National Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Shanghai Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra in Japan. Since the early 1970s Mr. Hsu had recorded for major labels such as the Columbia Records, the Radio Corporation of America Victor Records, the Hugo Records, the Republic of Ireland Productions, and the Master of Arts Recordings in Japan. His life was cut short in a road accident while on a concert tour in China on November 27, 2001 and is remembered by many to this day."}, {"url": "https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/news/18/career-profile-how-hui-su-became-an-atmospheric-scientist-at-nasa-jpl/", "page_content": "Hui Su is an earth scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies clouds and storms.\n\nWhat\u2019s your topic of research?\n\nI study any sort of storm where scurrying clouds, strong winds, lightning, thunder, and heavy rain move in an organized way. Hurricanes are an example. I\u2019ve been at JPL since 2005.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were little?\n\nMy parents were both meteorologists. In fact, they even met and got married at their jobs. So I had an early interest in that, and basically, I\u2019ve been studying weather all my career.\n\nWhen I was young, the meteorologists in China lived with their families in the same complex where the office buildings were. So, I grew up in a complex like that with about 20 other kids who were just my age. We used to all bike together to and from school, stopping to play on the roadside. And when we got back to the complex, we would watch the weather balloons being released. They were huge white hydrogen balloons, and as they rose, they measured temperature, wind, and pressure.\n\nWhat was the weather like in your hometown?\n\nMy hometown, Chengdu, is famous for its clouds. You rarely see blue skies. It\u2019s because we\u2019re in a basin surrounded by mountains, right by the Tibetan Plateau. Because of our location, in the summer, we would get a lot of thunderstorms and flooding, and one time we even had a huge flood in our own meteorology complex that caused a lot of damage.\n\nWhat were your college days like?\n\nI was at Peking University, where doing further studies abroad was very popular. So, I followed in those same footsteps and was admitted to the atmospheric dynamics doctoral program at the University of Washington in Seattle. I really liked Seattle. Like Chengdu, it's also famous for its rainy days, and that reminded me of home. It\u2019s a beautiful city with lots of lakes, and the skyline is just lovely. I\u2019d buy seafood at the famous Pike Place Market, and although I\u2019m not that good at cooking, we\u2019d have potlucks with groups of friends. We did many outdoors activities together, from skiing in the winter to beach trips in the summer, to crab-hunting in the Puget Sound.\n\nHui Su on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle during her second year there.\n\nHow did you end up at JPL?\n\nI first came to Los Angeles to do research at UCLA. I focused on El Ni\u00f1o, and eventually that led to my job at JPL. I\u2019ve been researching clouds and hurricanes this whole time, often using satellite data to draw conclusions. Hurricanes cause so much damage, and we\u2019re still not very good at predicting how powerful they will be. That\u2019s a big reason I\u2019m drawn to studying them \u2013 I want to help improve the forecast.\n\nHow do you like Los Angeles?\n\nInitially, it was a blast, because I felt, wow! I really love all the palm trees and the sunny skies! But now, twenty years later, I really miss the rain. There are too many dry days here, and I really feel the drawback of not having enough water in California. Otherwise, I feel that JPL is a great place. I\u2019m constantly impressed by the missions we launch into space \u2013 they are all miracles to me. I\u2019m constantly inspired by what I see happening.\n\nWhat do you do for fun?\n\nI like hiking, and I like dancing \u2013 not really on the stage, but as a work-out. I have a group of friends and we all like to exercise to Chinese folk-dancing. Then one time, we performed at the Lunar New Year party at JPL. We made the top news on the JPL internal newsletter, \u201cUniverse\u201d!\n\nWhat\u2019s one of the hardest parts of your job?\n\nHui in the cockpit of a DC-8 plane -- a plane used to chase hurricanes.\n\nThere\u2019s a tremendous pressure to always stay at the top. I think that\u2019s a positive thing, but it can also add a lot of stress to always maintain yourself at the forefront of research. I\u2019m worried about being not competitive enough for funding grants. A way to relieve the pressure is to form teams and work together with others. That\u2019s a way to share the burdens. We\u2019re constantly exploring new directions and making our research diversified.\n\nWhat if someone can\u2019t see a clear career path from their childhood like you did?\n\nMy career path was almost too simple! I stayed in my major and have been doing that ever since. But for people with a more winding path, it\u2019s okay. People do change, and I\u2019d advise them to follow their heart and do what they\u2019re passionate about and then stick to it."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/08/arts/fei-ping-hsu-51-new-york-concert-pianist.html", "page_content": "Fei-Ping Hsu, a Chinese-born American concert pianist, was killed in a car crash in northeastern China on Nov. 27.
