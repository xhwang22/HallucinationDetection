This prince, perhaps, experienced more challenges in life than any other Grimaldi. Most of his hardships were caused by the French Revolution, and the last hours of his life are still shrouded in mystery \u2026\n\nThe victims of the Great Terror\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9 IV was unlucky enough to be living in Paris when the Reign of Terror broke out in France. As a nobleman and prince he was soon arrested and thrown into prison. The prince\u2019s former wife, Duchess of Mazarin, was also taken into custody. Assisted by their family doctor, however, she managed to escape and hide with her youngest son Florestan.\n\nThe revolution did not spare the family of Prince\u2019s Honore IV\u2019s youngest brother, Joseph. His wife, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, was arrested on suspicion of espionage and executed by guillotine. She was only 27, leaving behind three little daughters.\n\nAs for Prince Honor\u00e9, he was imprisoned for one and a half years. This time in prison greatly undermined his health, and he never fully recovered from it afterwards. On March 21, 1795 his father died and Honor\u00e9 IV ascended the throne of Monaco. At that time the monarchy had just been banned and Monaco was once again annexed to the French Republic under the name of Port Hercule.\n\nEven after Prince Honor\u00e9 was released from prison, it took another seven years of negotiations before the French regime restored some of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s and his brother Prince Joseph\u2019s income. The future started to look brighter for the Grimaldi\u2019s once the radical revolutionary regime was followed by the French consulate and, finally, by the First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nReturn to the throne\n\nWhen the Napoleonic Wars finally came to an end, the status of Monaco was restored by the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) thanks to the efforts of Prince Talleyrand. On May 30, 1814 Honor\u00e9 IV was officially named the Principality\u2019s ruler. However, he was too ill to take control of his country. So it was his brother Prince Joseph who became regent.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s eldest son, 36-year-old Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, however, was not happy about this decision. A brilliant soldier, he entered the cavalry service at the age of 20 and prospered in the army of the Empire Marshal, Emmanuel de Grouchy. Since Prince Joseph was not particularly eager to deal with the Principality\u2019s affairs, preferring his life in the capital, he easily facilitated handing over the reins to his nephew, Honor\u00e9 Gabriel, who ruled Monaco up until the death of Honor\u00e9 IV (later becoming Prince Honor\u00e9 V). As for Honor\u00e9 IV, he lived in Paris until his very death which remains mysterious to this day\u2026\n\nAccident or murder ..?\n\nOn a winter\u2019s day of February 16, 1819, Honor\u00e9 IV drowned in the Seine river. The death of the Monaco prince looked like a typical accident. That\u2019s what the investigation concluded as an official version. It must not be forgotten, however, that Honor\u00e9 IV was not a very healthy person, to say the least. This is the reason why he was not only unwilling, but was also physically unfit to rule the country. Imprisonment and numerous personal tragedies had taken their toll on the Prince, making him, for all intents and purposes, disabled. This is what the scanty preserved data suggests. A legitimate question arises: how could a 60-year-old monarch, in deplorable physical state, manage to cover such a considerable distance away from home (Avenue Denfert-Rochereau) to the Seine river bank..?\n\nWas it really an accident? Or rather a premeditated murder? Or could it be that the Prince decided to put an end to his own unhappy life? Being a depressed person, did he step into the Seine himself..? The answer remains a mystery.\n\nThe main legacy of Prince Honore IV\n\nAs Prince of Monaco, Honor\u00e9 IV suffered three arrests and never actually ruled Monaco. He spent part of his life in a prison cell and the rest, trying to improve his health. Needless to say, there are very few mentions of the Prince, even in the archives of Monaco. His most important contribution to the history of Monaco was the birth of his two sons \u2014 the future princes, Honor\u00e9 V and Florestan I, who consistently ruled the Principality and left their mark on the state\u2019s history."}, {"url": "https://www.unofficialroyalty.com/honore-iv-prince-of-monaco/", "page_content": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n\u00a9 Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nHonor\u00e9 Charles Anne Grimaldi was born in Paris, France on May 17, 1758. He was the elder of the two sons of Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco and Maria Caterina Brignole who came from a Republic of Genoa (now in Italy) noble family. Honor\u00e9\u2019s paternal grandparents were Louise-Hippolyte, Sovereign Princess of Monaco for ten months before her death from smallpox, and Jacques I, briefly the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, born Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Leonor Goyon de Matignon. His maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis di Groppoli, the Ambassador to France from the Republic of Genoa, now in Italy, and Maria Anna Balbi.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV had one younger brother:\n\nPrince Joseph of Monaco, Regent of Monaco (1763 \u2013 1816), married (1) Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Choiseul, had three children, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was guillotined during the French Revolution (2) Frances Margaret Powell, no children\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV\u2019s parents had issues with their marriage. Honor\u00e9 III and Maria Caterina initially lived in Monaco but by 1760, Honor\u00e9 III was dissatisfied with his life there, and returned to France without his wife, spending time with his mistresses at his French homes. Eventually, Maria Caterina was allowed to come to France. However, Honor\u00e9 III continued his affairs and Maria Caterina began an affair, that would become long-term, with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. In 1770, Louis Joseph used his influence to obtain a legal separation for Maria Caterina from Honor\u00e9 III and the right to manage her own finances. Honor\u00e9 III finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was over and eventually accepted Maria Caterina\u2019s relationship with Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9. Three years after Honor\u00e9 III\u2019s death in 1798, Maria Caterina and Louis Joseph were married but their marriage was kept secret for ten years.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV and his brother Joseph grew up mostly in France, living in homes inherited from their paternal grandfather Jacques III Goyon de Matignon, Count of Thorigny: a Paris mansion, the H\u00f4tel de Matignon, now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France, and the Ch\u00e2teau des Matignon (link in French) in Torigni-sur-Vire in Normandy, France. In 1641, during the reign of Honor\u00e9 II, Monaco had become a French protectorate, and the Princes of Monaco became vassals of the Kings of France while remaining sovereign princes. Many successive Princes of Monaco and their families spent most of their lives in France and intermarried with French and Italian noble families.\n\nHonor\u00e9 III arranged a marriage for his son Honor\u00e9 (IV) to Louise d\u2019Aumont, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the only child of Louis Marie Guy d\u2019Aumont de Rochebaron, Duke of Aumont (1732 \u2013 1799) and Louise-Jeanne de Durfort, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye (1735 \u2013 1781). Through her mother, Louise was the great-great-great-granddaughter of Hortense Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin, Duchess of Mayenne, Duchess of Meilleraye, the mistress of King Charles II of England, and one of the two heirs of her uncle Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the First Minister of King Louis XIV of France. Louise was the heir of Hortense Mancini\u2019s titles and the Mazarin family wealth. Therefore, a marriage to Louise came with a large dowry and the prospect of a fortune. Honor\u00e9 (IV) and Louise married on July 15, 1777.\n\nThe marriage did produce two sons, both Sovereign Princes of Monaco:\n\nThe French Revolution had dire consequences for the Grimaldi family. In January 1793, Honor\u00e9 III, Prince of Monaco was officially declared deposed and the Principality of Monaco was annexed by France. The members of the former ruling Grimaldi dynasty lost all aristocratic privileges in France, were dispossessed of their French property, and became French citizens. During the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Honor\u00e9 (IV), his wife Louise, their son Florestan, and Honor\u00e9 (IV)\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 III were arrested and imprisoned in Paris as enemies of the people. Louise and her son Florestan were rescued by a family doctor who forged release papers and then hid them in his home until the Reign of Terror was over. The wife of Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was not as lucky. Joseph spent most of his time abroad negotiating foreign loans which made him a suspect of counter-revolutionary activities. When Joseph did become involved in a counter-revolution, his wife Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was arrested in the absence of her husband, condemned to death, and guillotined in 1794, one of the last victims before the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn October 1794, Honor\u00e9 III and Honor\u00e9 (IV) were released from prison. Honor\u00e9 III never recovered from his imprisonment and died in Paris on March 21, 1795, at the age of 74, but his burial place is unknown. Honor\u00e9 IV, whose chronic ill health had been worsened by imprisonment, would have become Prince of Monaco but Monaco was no longer a sovereign monarchy. However, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s family properties in France were returned to him but they were in poor condition and all of the contents were gone.\n\nIn 1794, while Honor\u00e9 IV was still in prison, Louise had given birth to an illegitimate daughter Am\u00e9lie C\u00e9leste Erodore d\u2019Aumont. The father of the child is believed to have been Antoine de Montazet, Archbishop of Lyon. After Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s release from prison, Louise and Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s marriage became unhappy and the couple separated. In 1798, Louise divorced Honor\u00e9 IV, giving Louise sole access to her fortune.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. Honor\u00e9 IV could not adapt to the new French society and for the most part, remained an outsider. Because of a lack of funds, he needed to sell his family\u2019s Paris and Normandy homes. Surprisingly, Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s health improved and he joined the French Army. He was wounded during Napoleon\u2019s Russian Campaign, lost the use of one arm, and was sent back to Paris.\n\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s defeat in 1814 and the Bourbon Restoration which saw Louis XVIII, a younger brother of the beheaded King Louis XVI, become King of France, Florestan\u2019s uncle Joseph petitioned King Louis XVIII to restore the Principality of Monaco to the Grimaldi family. Florestan\u2019s father Honor\u00e9 IV finally became Sovereign Prince of Monaco in 1814. The independence of Monaco lasted for only one year. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, an international diplomatic conference that reconstituted the European political order after the downfall of Napoleon I, declared that Monaco would be a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nBy the time Honor\u00e9 IV became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, his physical condition had worsened and he was now paralyzed on one side of his body. Because of his condition, a regency was established to rule in his name. Honor\u00e9 IV\u2019s brother Joseph was regent from 1814 -1815 and then Florestan\u2019s brother Honor\u00e9 V served as regent until his father\u2019s death in 1819 when he succeeded him as Honor\u00e9 V, Prince of Monaco.\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV, Prince of Monaco died in Paris, France on February 16, 1819, aged 60. He was buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas in Monaco. During the late 19th century, a new and larger church, the Cathedral of Monaco, was built on the site of the Church of Saint Nicholas. The original church was demolished in 1874 but the current cathedral was built over the areas of the previous church and the old burial site so that the sovereign princes and consorts originally buried at the Church of Saint Nicholas are now buried in the Cathedral of Monaco.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He helped to establish the traditional form of the novel and is generally considered to be one of the greatest novelists of all time.\n\nEarly career\n\nBalzac\u2019s father was a man of southern peasant stock who worked in the civil service for 43 years under Louis XVI and Napoleon. Honor\u00e9\u2019s mother came from a family of prosperous Parisian cloth merchants. His sister Laure (later de Surville) was his only childhood friend, and she became his first biographer.\n\nBalzac was sent to school at the Coll\u00e8ge des Oratoriens at Vend\u00f4me from age 8 to 14. At Napoleon\u2019s downfall his family moved from Tours to Paris, where he went to school for two more years and then spent three years as a lawyer\u2019s clerk. During this time he already aimed at a literary career, but as the writer of Cromwell (1819) and other tragic plays he was utterly unsuccessful. He then began writing novels filled with mystic and philosophical speculations before turning to the production of potboilers\u2014gothic, humorous, historical novels\u2014written under composite pseudonyms. Then he tried a business career as a publisher, printer, and owner of a typefoundry, but disaster soon followed. In 1828 he was narrowly saved from bankruptcy and was left with debts of more than 60,000 francs. From then on his life was to be one of mounting debts and almost incessant toil. He returned to writing with a new mastery, and his literary apprenticeship was over.\n\nTwo works of 1829 brought Balzac to the brink of success. Les Chouans, the first novel he felt enough confidence about to have published under his own name, is a historical novel about the Breton peasants called Chouans who took part in a royalist insurrection against Revolutionary France in 1799. The other, La Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), is a humorous and satirical essay on the subject of marital infidelity, encompassing both its causes and its cure. The six stories in his Sc\u00e8nes de la vie priv\u00e9e (1830; \u201cScenes from Private Life\u201d) further increased his reputation. These long short stories are for the most part psychological studies of girls in conflict with parental authority. The minute attention he gave to describing domestic background in his works anticipated the spectacularly detailed societal observations of his later Parisian studies.\n\nBritannica Quiz Novels and Novelists Quiz\n\nFrom this point forward Balzac spent much of his time in Paris. He began to frequent some of the best-known Parisian salons of the day and redoubled his efforts to set himself up as a dazzling figure in society. To most people he seemed full of exuberant vitality, talkative, jovial and robustious, egoistic, credulous, and boastful. He adopted for his own use the armorial bearings of an ancient noble family with which he had no connection and assumed the honorific particle de. He was avid for fame, fortune, and love but was above all conscious of his own genius. He also began to have love affairs with fashionable or aristocratic women at this time, finally gaining that firsthand understanding of mature women that is so evident in his novels.\n\nBetween 1828 and 1834 Balzac led a tumultuous existence, spending his earnings in advance as a dandy and man-about-town. A fascinating raconteur, he was fairly well received in society. But social ostentation was only a relaxation from phenomenal bouts of work\u201414 to 16 hours spent writing at his table in his white, quasi-monastic dressing gown, with his goose-quill pen and his endless cups of black coffee. In 1832 Balzac became friendly with \u00c9veline Hanska, a Polish countess who was married to an elderly Ukrainian landowner. She, like many other women, had written to Balzac expressing admiration of his writings. They met twice in Switzerland in 1833\u2014the second time in Geneva, where they became lovers\u2014and again in Vienna in 1835. They agreed to marry when her husband died, and so Balzac continued to conduct his courtship of her by correspondence; the resulting Lettres \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9trang\u00e8re (\u201cLetters to a Foreigner\u201d), which appeared posthumously (4 vol., 1889\u20131950), are an important source of information for the history both of Balzac\u2019s life and of his work.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nTo clear his debts and put himself in a position to marry Madame Hanska now became Balzac\u2019s great incentive. He was at the peak of his creative power. In the period 1832\u201335 he produced more than 20 works, including the novels Le M\u00e9decin de campagne (1833; The Country Doctor), Eug\u00e9nie Grandet (1833), L\u2019Illustre Gaudissart (1833; The Illustrious Gaudissart), and Le P\u00e8re Goriot (1835), one of his masterpieces. Among the shorter works were Le Colonel Chabert (1832), Le Cur\u00e9 de Tours (1832; The Vicar of Tours), the trilogy of stories entitled Histoire des treize (1833\u201335; History of the Thirteen), and Gobseck (1835). Between 1836 and 1839 he wrote Le Cabinet des antiques (1839), the first two parts of another masterpiece, Illusions perdues (1837\u201343; Lost Illusions), C\u00e9sar Birotteau (1837), and La Maison Nucingen (1838; The Firm of Nucingen). Between 1832 and 1837 he also published three sets of Contes drolatiques (Droll Stories). These stories, Rabelaisian in theme, are written with great verve and gusto in an ingenious pastiche of 16th-century language. During the 1830s he also wrote a number of philosophical novels dealing with mystical, pseudoscientific, and other exotic themes. Among these are La Peau de chagrin (1831; The Wild Ass\u2019s Skin), Le Chef-d\u2019oeuvre inconnu (1831; The Unknown Masterpiece), Louis Lambert (1834), La Recherche de l\u2019absolu (1834; The Quest of the Absolute), and S\u00e9raph\u00eeta (1834\u201335).\n\nIn all these varied works Balzac emerged as the supreme observer and chronicler of contemporary French society. These novels are unsurpassed for their narrative drive, their large casts of vital, diverse, and interesting characters, and their obsessive interest in and examination of virtually all spheres of life: the contrast between provincial and metropolitan manners and customs; the commercial spheres of banking, publishing, and industrial enterprise; the worlds of art, literature, and high culture; politics and partisan intrigue; romantic love in all its aspects; and the intricate social relations and scandals among the aristocracy and the haute bourgeoisie.\n\nNo theme is more typically Balzacian than that of the ambitious young provincial fighting for advancement in the competitive world of Paris. Balzac admired those individuals who were ruthless, astute, and, above all, successful in thrusting their way up the social and economic scale at all costs. He was especially attracted by the theme of the individual in conflict with society: the adventurer, the scoundrel, the unscrupulous financier, and the criminal. Frequently his villains are more vigorous and interesting than his virtuous characters. He was both fascinated and appalled by the French social system of his time, in which the bourgeois values of material acquisitiveness and gain were steadily replacing what he viewed as the more stable moral values of the old-time aristocracy.\n\nThese topics provided material largely unknown, or unexplored, by earlier writers of French fiction. The individual in Balzac\u2019s stories is continually affected by the pressure of material difficulties and social ambitions, and he may expend his tremendous vitality in ways Balzac views as socially destructive and self-destructive. Linked with this idea of the potentially destructive power of passionate will, emotion, and thought is Balzac\u2019s peculiar notion of a vital fluid concentrated inside the person, a store of energy that he may husband or squander as he desires, thereby lengthening or shortening his vital span. Indeed, a supremely important feature in Balzac\u2019s characters is that most are spendthrifts of this vital force, a fact that explains his monomaniacs who are both victim and embodiment of some ruling passion; avarice, as in the main character of Gobseck, a usurer gloating over his sense of power, or the miserly father obsessed with riches in Eug\u00e9nie Grandet; excessive paternal affection, as in the idolatrous Learlike father in Le P\u00e8re Goriot; feminine vindictiveness, as evidenced in La Cousine Bette and a half-dozen other novels; the mania of the art collector, as in Le Cousin Pons; the artist\u2019s desire for perfection, as in Le Chef-d\u2019oeuvre inconnu; the curiosity of the scientist, as in the fanatical chemist of La Recherche de l\u2019absolu; or the vaulting and frustrated ambition of the astonishingly resourceful criminal mastermind Vautrin in Illusions perdues and Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res des courtisanes. Once such an obsession has gained a hold, Balzac shows it growing irresistibly in power and blinding the person concerned to all other considerations. The typical structure of his novels from the early 1830s onward is determined by this approach: there is a long period of preparation and exposition, and then tension mounts swiftly to an inevitable climax, as in classical tragedy."}, {"url": "https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/history-of-the-french-language", "page_content": "Illustration by Vivien Mildenberger.\n\nWondering how the French language came to be? From its humble origins to its official recognition in 1539, there are several major milestones in the evolution of this Romance language. Here are some of the most notable milestones in the history of the French language:\n\nRoman Gaul\n\nTo understand how French came to be, we have to go back two millennia to the age of the Roman Empire. When the Gallic War ended (between 58 BCE and 51 BCE), territories located south of the Rhine became Roman provinces. This change led to the emergence of population centers and increased trade, which improved communication between the Gauls and the Romans. For five centuries, oral Latin, also called Vulgar (from vulgus, meaning \u201cthe people\u201d), coexisted with Gaulish, a language of Celtic origin.\n\nHowever, as Gaulish was not predominantly used for writing, its survival was threatened in the more Romanized areas in the south. Eventually, Vulgar supplanted Gaulish as the primary language of the region. Currently, of the 100,000 entries in the Le Grand Robert French dictionary, about 100 words are of Gaulish origin. Most of them refer to land-related objects and animals, for example: char (cart), bruy\u00e8re (heather), ch\u00eane (oak), if (yew), chemin (path), caillou (stone), ruche (hive), mouton (lamb) and tonneau (barrel).\n\nThe Ancestor Of The Franks\n\nBy the 4th century, several Franks (tribes of Germanic origin) had already settled in the northeast of Gaul and were integrated into the Roman army. Even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks remained in what is now modern-day France. People of this proto-French culture were first unified by King Clovis via military victories and the support of the great Gallo-Roman families. This political support was largely attained by adopting their language, Gallo-Roman, as well as their religion, Catholicism.\n\nDue to the Germanic origin of the Franks, the pronunciation and musicality of the language were modified. New sounds, like the [\u0153] in fleur (flower) and [\u00f8] in n\u0153uds (knot), and new words were also introduced. However, the Franks\u2019 most important contribution was providing the name of what was one day to become France.\n\nPolitical Birth\n\nAt the end of the 8th century, the Dark Ages spurred an educational decline for the majority of the population \u2014 meaning that most people could no longer understand the Latin that clerics spoke. After the Council of Tours in 813, King Charlemagne required that priests give sermons either in the \u201cRoman rustic language\u201d or Theotiscam (a Germanic language) so the common people could understand. This decision marked the first recognition of French (or what would become French) as an oral language. The true birth of the French language, however, took place three decades later.\n\nCharlemagne\u2019s empire was divided after his death and tensions rose between his grandchildren Lothair I, Charles the Bald, and Louis the German, which ultimately culminated in war. In 842, Charles and Louis took an oath to support one another against Lothair, and they each adopted a language understood by their brother\u2019s troops: Charles spoke in Old High German and Louis in Gallo-Roman (proto-French). The Oaths of Strasbourg, transcribed into both of these languages and into Latin, arguably marked the birth of both German and French. While this version of Proto-French was still quite similar to Vulgar Latin, this marks the first point where it had an acknowledged written form.\n\nThe Frankish Inheritance\n\nIn the 10th century, the Gallo-Romance language took on hundreds of forms and dialects. Under the influence of the Franks, a group of languages emerged in the North: the so-called languages of O\u00efl, while in the more Romanized South, there was the birth of the languages of Oc (O\u00efl and Oc both mean oui). The languages of O\u00efl include the Picard, Walloon, Burgundy and Frankish dialects, among others. The Oc languages, on the other hand, include the Limousin, Auvergne, Provencal, and Languedocian dialects. This fragmentation meant that the people started speaking many different variations, which became very important later.\n\nOld French (10th\u201313th Centuries)\n\nLatin continued to be the prevailing language in religion, education and law, but little by little the vernacular language also started being used for written communication. At the end of the 11th century, the troubadours started chanting their poems in the various dialects of the country. In fact, the Song of Roland, written in the O\u00efl language, is one of the most emblematic examples of literature of this time.\n\n\n\nIt probably goes without saying that this Old French, like other vernaculars of its day, had a lack of clear rules and therefore had considerable variety in writing and speech. Because of this, some individuals advocated the \u201cre-Latinization\u201d of the lexicon. In the 12th century, French was still divided between O\u00efl and Oc, but eventually, the royal power from the \u00cele-de-France region spread the O\u00efl variant across France. O\u00efl became an instrument of power and a symbol of unification.\n\nMiddle French (14th-17th Centuries)\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, France witnessed its darkest years: The Black Plague and the Hundred Years\u2019 War devastated the population. The texts of Fran\u00e7ois Villon, written in Middle French, reflect this turbulent period perfectly. For the modern reader, the terminology he employed is somewhat understandable to those who speak Standard French. This is thanks to the loss of both declensions, changing of word order, and other foundational changes to the language. Nowadays, some of his spellings can seem funny (e.g. doncques, pluye and oyseaulx), but they were very fashionable at the time. The letter Y was in vogue, while K and W \u2014 then considered \u201cnot Latin enough\u201d \u2014 were eliminated.\n\nThe history of the French language took another turn in the 15th century with the start of the Renaissance, as well as the invention of the printing press. In order to disseminate a large number of written works, it was necessary to create rules and structures for the language. It was in this context that the vernacular language finally achieved recognition: the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats in 1539 established the primacy of French for written laws.\n\nRe-Latinization\n\nIn order to render legitimacy and distinction to the French language, it was \u201cre-Latinized\u201d during the Enlightenment \u2014 although sometimes this was done in the wrong way. The word doit became doigt (finger) from the Latin digitus, while pie became pied (foot) from the Latin pedis. Meanwhile, words that were considered \u201cbarbaric\u201d \u2014 that is, not of Latin origin \u2014 were systematically taken out.\n\nAs A Lingua Franca\n\nIt may come as a shock to Francophiles and students of history that, at the time of the French Revolution, less than half of France\u2019s population could speak French, and only a fraction of those speakers could do it conversationally. That said, French was an extremely popular language with the elite and higher classes, as it was adopted by nearly all European courts and it even reached the other side of the Atlantic. Powered by the influence it had in the political and literary spheres, French became the world\u2019s lingua franca (until English eventually supplanted it). Even today, French is still one of the most spoken languages in the world and continues to enjoy considerable appeal.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the history of French is full of paradoxes: It has had a near-constant struggle to eliminate its own \u201cbarbarism,\u201d even if that\u2019s something which is inevitably part of its identity. The study of the language reveals a larger history of France, torn between its ambition to unify and the reality of its diversity."}, {"url": "https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/grimaldi-family/prince-honore-v-a-brilliant-officer-and-an-unlucky-sovereign/", "page_content": "The eldest son of Prince Honor\u00e9 IV was so eager for power that he declared himself a ruler against the will of his father. Tough and authoritarian, accustomed to military discipline from his youth, he made important economic decisions alone but failed to make the country prosperous and failed to make its population rich and happy. In fairness, we note that the Prince sincerely did his best.\n\nMilitary service for France\n\nPrince Honor\u00e9-Gabriel, the eldest son of Prince Honor\u00e9 IV of Monaco and Princess Louise Felicite Victoire d\u2019Aumont, was born in Paris on May 14, 1778. He enlisted in a French cavalry regiment when he was 20 years old and worked his way up through the ranks by his own merits until he became an officer on the staff of Marshal Grouchy. He was an exemplary soldier and was cited for his bravery many times. Being wounded in the arm he couldn\u2019t take part in the action at Austerlitz (1805) but did serve with great distinction at the battle of Jena (1806) with Marshal Murat\u2019s cavalry corps. Marshal Grouchy recommended him for the star of the Legion of Honour, relating that the Prince had taken a handful of cavalry and forced the surrender of an entire enemy battalion.\n\nIn April 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated the throne and was sent into exile on the island of Elba. The restored King Louis XVIII of France himself then also restored the Grimaldis to their places in the French nobility. Therefore, after the restoration of 1814, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel was also named member of the House of Peers by King Louis XVIII. But many were afraid that Monegasque independence would not be secure or that the Principality might be annexed by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Thanks to Prince Talleyrand, however, a clause was inserted into the Treaty of Paris to put Monaco securely back in order and independent.\n\nReturn to Monaco and meeting with Napoleon\n\nHonor\u00e9 IV was unable to return to Monaco because of his poor health and so appointed his brother Joseph to rule on his behalf. But Honor\u00e9-Gabriel didn\u2019t like that idea and he protested fiercely about this and after some struggle he was himself appointed to govern Monaco.\n\nIn March, 1815 on his way to Monaco he met with his old commander Napoleon who was on his way to Paris to seize power at the start of the 100 days. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d, Napoleon asked. \u201cGoing home, to Monaco\u201d, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel answered. \u201cMe too, I\u2019m going home, to the Tuileries,\u201d Napoleon said. When Napoleon attempted to restore his empire during the 100 days Monaco was occupied by British troops and so the Grimaldis played no part in the affair.\n\nDifficult years of reign\n\nIn 1819, when his father passed away, Honor\u00e9-Gabriel became the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as Honor\u00e9 V and inherited a Principality beset with problems. At the same time being both a member of the French Parliament and the Sovereign of Monaco, he picked up on the project of his grandfather to diversify economic resources and encouraged the installation of factories. The Great Powers of Europe had taken Monaco out of the French sphere of influence and made the Principality a protectorate of Piedmont-Sardinia. The government in Turin closed the tobacco plant that Honor\u00e9 III had established and enforced a number of other changes that had left Monaco impoverished.\n\nHonor\u00e9 V went to Turin to try to reason with the King of Piedmont-Sardinia but, although he was treated with great honour and respect, none of his grievances were addressed. Honor\u00e9 V also had to raise taxes considerably which made him increasingly unpopular. His granting of a monopoly on flour caused a bread shortage but no one had the nerve to voice opposition to him. He also pushed opportunities for tourism. However, the lack of a market for local products, the omnipresence of the State and the lack of presence of the Sovereign created tensions, especially in Menton. The Sovereign ended up pacifying Menton before going forward with his effort to provide the Principality with amenities. By his own admission he \u201cdesired to do good\u201d but \u201cdid not manage to\u201d, despite his philanthropic ideals.\n\nWhen liberal movements began to oppose the counter revolutionary tide of post-Napoleonic Europe some in Monaco thought of joining in but Sardinian troops arrived to crush the potential rebellion in its infancy.\n\nUnjust dislike\n\nHistory has tended to record Prince Honor\u00e9 V as a very unpopular and autocratic monarch, but, in reality he was quite progressive. He sincerely wished to help his people and had great sympathy for the poor. His reaction to seeing beggars on the streets was to form state-owned industries and put them to work. Some of the industries he set up included a lace factory and a hat factory. He also had them put to work on farm cooperatives as citrus orchards had long been a large part of the Monegasque economy. All of this has led some people to regard Prince Honor\u00e9 V as a sort of socialist, though he probably would not have seen it that way.\n\nBut all efforts to save the economy did not make Monegasques appreciate their Prince. Honor\u00e9 V of Monaco died on October 2, 1841 in Paris and remained in the history of the country as an authoritarian ruler who did not trust anyone, including family members, and made decisions alone. As he was not married and had no children the Monegasque throne passed to his poet-actor brother Florestan."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/French-language", "page_content": "History The first document apparently written in French probably dates from 842. Known as the Strasbourg Oaths, it is a Romance version of oaths sworn by two of Charlemagne\u2019s grandsons. Some claim that the text of that document is thinly disguised Latin constructed after the event to look authentic for political propaganda purposes, while others suppose that its Latinizing tendencies reveal the struggle of the scribe with the problems of spelling French as it was spoken at the time. If the language of the Strasbourg Oaths is northern French, it is difficult to ascertain what dialect it represents; some say that of Picard, the dialect of Picardy, others Franco-Proven\u00e7al, and so on. The second existing text in Old French (with Picard and Walloon features) is a rendering of a short sequence by Prudentius on the life of St. Eulalia, precisely dated 880\u2013882 ce. Two 10th-century texts (the Passion du Christ and the Vie de St. L\u00e9ger) seem to mingle northern and southern dialect features, while another (the \u201cJonas fragment\u201d) is obviously from the far north. In the 12th century the \u201cgem\u201d of the epic poems known as chansons de geste, La Chanson de Roland, was written. One of the most beautiful poems of its type in world literature, it evinces certain dialectal characteristics the origins of which are difficult to establish. In the 12th\u201313th century the Francien dialect became dominant, and it gained the status of literary language because of both the central position of the \u00cele-de-France region and the political and cultural prestige of Paris. The Francien dialect was basically a north-central dialect with some northern features. Before that, other dialects, especially Norman (which developed in Britain as Anglo-Norman, widely used until the 14th century) and northern dialects (such as Picard), had more prestige, especially in the literary sphere (see Anglo-Norman literature). The legal reform known as the Edict of Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539), however, established Francien as the only official language (as opposed to both Latin and other dialects) after it proved to be the most popular written form. From then on, standard French began to replace local dialects, which were officially discouraged, though the standard language did not spread to popular usage in all regions until well into the 19th century. Dialectal features, which were still admired and cherished by 16th-century writers, were ridiculed in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the grammar and vocabulary of the modern language were standardized and polished to an unprecedented degree.

Subscribe Now Francien has largely replaced other regional dialects of French spoken in northern and central France; those dialects made up the so-called langue d\u2019o\u00efl (the term is based on the French use of the word o\u00efl, modern oui, for \u201cyes\u201d). Standard French has also greatly reduced the use of the Occitan language of southern France (the so-called langue d\u2019oc, from Proven\u00e7al oc for \u201cyes\u201d). Proven\u00e7al, Occitan\u2019s major dialect, was a widely used medieval literary language.\n\nCharacteristics letter signed by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix French phonology is characterized by great changes in the sounds of words as compared with their Latin parent forms as well as cognates in the other Romance languages. For example, Latin sec\u016brum \u2018sure, secure\u2019 became Spanish seguro but French s\u00fbr; Latin v\u014dcem \u2018voice\u2019 became Spanish voz but French voix, pronounced vwa. French grammar, like that of the other Romance languages, has been greatly simplified from that of Latin. Nouns are not declined for case. Formerly, they were marked for plural by the addition of -s or -es, but the ending, though retained in spelling, has generally been lost in speech. Masculine and feminine gender are distinguished but are usually marked not in the noun but rather in the accompanying article or adjective. Plural marking in spoken French is often similarly distinguished. The verb in French is conjugated for three persons, singular and plural, but again, although distinguished in spelling, several of these forms are pronounced identically. French has verb forms for indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; preterite, imperfect, present, future, and conditional, and a variety of perfect and progressive tenses; and passive and reflexive constructions. Linguistic change was more rapid and more drastic in northern France than it was in other European Romance regions, and influence from Latin was comparatively slight (though borrowing of Latin vocabulary has been great since the 14th century). The influence of the Germanic Frankish invaders is often held to account for exotic features in Old French, such as strong stress accent and abundant use of diphthongs and nasal vowels, but by the 15th century the language had begun to change, and a sober (even monotonous) intonation and loss of a stress accent became characteristic. The popularity of French as a first foreign language, in spite of numerous pronunciation difficulties for nearly all foreign speakers, is perhaps as much the result of the precise codification of its grammar, effectuated especially during the 18th century, as of the brilliance of its literature at all periods. Modern dialects are classified mainly on a geographic basis, and most survive only in rural areas. Walloon, spoken mainly in Belgium, is something of an exception in that it has had a flourishing dialect literature since approximately 1600. Other dialects are grouped as follows: Central: Francien, Orl\u00e9anais, Bourbonnais, Champenois\n\nNorthern: Picard, Northern Norman\n\nEastern: Lorrain, Bourguignon (Burgundian), Franc-Comtois\n\nWestern: Norman, Gallo (around the Celtic Breton area), Angevin, Manceau\n\nSouthwestern: Poitevin, Saintongeais, Angoumois"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Honore-Fragonard", "page_content": "Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, (born April 5, 1732, Grasse, France\u2014died August 22, 1806, Paris), French Rococo painter whose most familiar works, such as The Swing (1767), are characterized by delicate hedonism.\n\nFragonard was the son of a haberdasher\u2019s assistant. The family moved to Paris about 1738, and in 1747 the boy was apprenticed to a lawyer, who, noticing his appetite for drawing, suggested that he be taught painting. Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was prevailed upon to accept him as a pupil (c. 1748), and in 1752, Fragonard\u2019s elementary training completed, Boucher recommended that he compete for a Prix de Rome scholarship, which meant study under the court painter to Louis XV, Carle Van Loo, in Paris. On September 17, 1756, Fragonard set off with other scholarship winners for the French Academy at Rome.\n\nBritannica Quiz Who Painted the Most Expensive Paintings in the World?\n\nAt the academy Fragonard copied many paintings, chiefly by Roman Baroque artists, and, with his friend the French painter Hubert Robert, made numerous sketches of the Roman countryside. When his scholarship ended in July 1759, he was allowed to remain in residence until, in late November, he met a wealthy French amateur artist, Jean-Claude Richard, abb\u00e9 de Saint-Non, who was to become one of his chief patrons. Early in 1760 Saint-Non took Fragonard and Robert on a prolonged tour of Italy, where the two artists studied Italian paintings and antiquities and made hundreds of sketches of local scenery.\n\nIn 1761, after returning to Paris, Fragonard exhibited a few landscape paintings and the large Coresus and Callirho\u00eb (1765) at the Salon, where it was purchased for King Louis XV. Consequently, the artist was commissioned to paint a pendant, or companion piece, granted a studio in the Louvre Palace, and accepted as an Academician. Nevertheless, after 1767 he almost ceased to exhibit at the salons, concentrating on landscapes, often in the manner of the 17th-century Dutch painter Jacob van Ruisdael (Return of the Herd, 1766); portraits; and decorative, sensuous outdoor party scenes, such as The Swing, in the style of Boucher but more fluently painted. His admiration for Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, Frans Hals, and a Venetian contemporary, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, emerges in a large series of loosely and vigorously executed heads of old men, painted probably between 1760 and 1770 (Head of an Old Man, 1768/70), followed by a series of portraits (c. 1765\u201372) in a similar style and in which the sitters were real persons, but their fantastic costumes were emphasized rather than their facial expressions.\n\nIn 1769 Fragonard married Marie-Anne G\u00e9rard from Grasse and shortly afterward received the accolade of fashion, when in 1770 he was commissioned by Mme du Barry to decorate her newly built Pavillon de Louveciennes, with four large paintings (Progress of Love, 1771\u201373), and in 1772 he received a somewhat similar commission from the notorious actress Madeleine Guimard. Neither was a success, the Louveciennes paintings probably being rejected as too Rococo for a totally Neoclassical setting.\n\nA journey to the Low Countries perhaps in 1772\u201373 increased his admiration for Rembrandt and Hals and was reflected in his later portraits. A second visit to Italy followed in 1773\u201374. As before, he concentrated on drawing picturesque Italian landscape subjects rather than on painting. The return journey was taken through Vienna, Prague, and Germany. On his return to Paris, the family was joined by his wife\u2019s 14-year-old sister, Marguerite, with whom Fragonard fell passionately in love. Consequently, he turned his interests toward a new type of subject matter: domestic scenes inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s moral philosophy or romantic novels (The Happy Family, c. 1775) or scenes concerned with children\u2019s upbringing, in which his son \u00c9variste (born 1780) frequently figures (The Schoolmistress [\u201cNow Say Please\u201d], c. 1780).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the last years preceding the French Revolution, Fragonard turned finally to Neoclassical subject matter and developed a less fluent Neoclassical style of painting (The Fountain of Love, c. 1785), which becomes increasingly evident in his later works, particularly the genre scenes executed in collaboration with Marguerite G\u00e9rard (The Beloved Child, 1780\u201385).\n\nFragonard\u2019s art was too closely associated with the pre-Revolutionary period to make him acceptable during the Revolution, which also deprived him of private patrons. At first he retired to Grasse, but he returned to Paris in 1791, where the protection of the leading Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David obtained for him a post with the Museum Commission, but he lost this position in 1797. He spent the rest of his life in obscurity, painting little. His death in 1806 passed almost unnoticed, and his work remained unfashionable until well after 1850.\n\nFragonard has been bracketed with Watteau as one of the two great poetic painters of the 18th century in France. A prodigiously active artist, he produced more than 550 paintings, several thousand drawings (although many hundreds are known to be lost), and 35 etchings. His style, based primarily on that of Rubens, was rapid, vigorous, and fluent, never tight or fussy like that of so many of his contemporaries.\n\nAlthough the greater part of his active life was passed during the Neoclassical period, he continued to paint in a Rococo idiom until shortly before the French Revolution. Only five paintings by Fragonard are dated, but the chronology of the rest can be fairly accurately established from other sources such as engravings and documents."}, {"url": "https://tasteandtravel.fr/en/en-blog/the-real-history-of-the-french-pastries-part-two/", "page_content": "The real history of the French pastries. Part two.\n\nFrench pastries: the story. Immerse yourself in the fascinating history of French pastry. Find out why a bean is introduced into the Galette des Rois, how a real French charlotte was invented, why the madeleine is shaped like a scallop and how cannel\u00e9s relate to the Bordaux wines? Here is the real history of French pastry. Part two\u2026\n\nGALETTE DES ROIS (KINGS CAKE)\n\nWe eat the galette des rois (the kings cake) in France at Epiphany, (today the first Sunday in January) is the day when the three wise men guided by the star arrived to Jesus who had just been born. The three wise men gave Jesus gifts: gold, incense and myrrh.\n\nThe tradition of eating a galette on this date dates back to the 13th century. We share the galette in numbers of guests plus a part (part of the Good Lord or part of the Virgin) that we gave to the first poor passerby.\n\nOnce the galette is cut, the youngest of the guests hides under the table and designates the portion for each. Whoever finds the bean is King for the day and can wear the crown of the galette.\n\nAs for the bean, the tradition goes back to the time of the Romans, in the 11th century. They hid a piece of arget, gold or a simple white bean in a loaf of bread to designate the chef.\n\nMADELAINES\n\nMadeleines are soft cakes without filling, made in small molds in the shape of an elongated scallop.\n\nWithout speaking of their literary glory which the madeleines owe to Marcel Proust, here are two versions of their creation.\n\nThe oldest would be that of the rudimentary brioche from the Middle Ages, molded in a real shell, and for this reason, intended for pilgrims to Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle.\n\nAnother story goes that in 1755, in the castle of Commercy, the King of Poland Stanislas Lesczynski, received Voltaire and Madame de Ch\u00e2telet for dinner.\n\nHis pastry chef argues in the kitchens, returns her apron and leaves the guests without dessert. Fortunately, a young woman saved the meal by quickly baking little soft cakes according to her grandmother\u2019s recipe. This young girl was called Madeleine \u2026\n\nCANELE DE BORDEAUX\n\nCanel\u00e9 is a small cake from Bordeaux, soft on the inside and caramelized on the outside, flavored with rum and vanilla that is baked in canel\u00e9 molds.\n\nHistory has two versions as to the creation of this cake.\n\nThe first says that its recipe was invented in the 16th century by the nuns of the Les Annonciales de Saint-Eulalie convent in Gironde, who collected the rests of the flour in the holds of the boats.\n\nThese first canel\u00e9s hardly resembled those we know today. Actually, it was a dough that was wrapped around a tube and fried in lard.\n\nThe second version is related to winemaking. Historically many Bordeaux chateaux used (and still use) egg whites to clarify wine. This process is called fining and allows the particles in suspension in the wine, along with the egg white, to descend to the bottom of the barrel\u2026 There were therefore a lot of unused yolks left. And they created the canel\u00e9s to avoid waste by adding products easily found in the port of Bordeaux (flour, rum, vanilla and cane sugar).\n\nMACARONS\n\nSmall biscuit made from almonds, sugar, flour and egg white, the macaroon was not born in France but in Italy! It is said that in 1581 Catherine de Medici would have had this small cake served at the wedding of Duke Anne de Joyeuse in Ard\u00e8che. Then it appeared in 1660 in the Basque Country, in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where he was offered to King Louis XIV for his marriage to Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Austria, a Spanish Infanta.\n\nAt the time, it was still a simple biscuit, without garnish. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was pastry chef Ladur\u00e9e who created the Parisian macaroon that we know today, with two colorful scented biscuits side by side, with a cream or jam between them. This macaroon is a real worldwide phenomenon today.\n\nCHARLOTTE\n\nIt is one of the favorite cakes of the French. But its origin is English!\n\nIts original recipe dating from the early 19th century was created in honnor of Princess Charlotte, spouse of Georges III and grandmother of Queen Victoria. And originally it was made of white bread or brioche, filled with apple, plum or pear compote, cooked and tasted hot, to accompany a cup of tea of \u200b\u200bcourse \u2026\n\nToday\u2019s charlotte (or charlotte \u00e0 la Parisienne) was invented by pastry chef Antonin Car\u00eame. While working at the English royal court, he decided to make the Charlotte lighter.\n\nHe used ladyfinger biscuits instead of the brioche and garnished them with the Bavarian cream and fresh fruit. It had to be eaten cold.\n\nBy the way, then M Car\u00eame also worked for the Russian Tsar Alexander, and his cake was baptized \u201cRussian charlotte\u201d. That said, the contemporary version of charlotte in Russia is more like apple cake.\n\nTARTE AU CITRON MERINGUE (LEMON MERINGUE PIE)\n\nAnother of the favorite desserts of the French for its freshness and sweetness. We like the sweetness of the meringue counterbalanced by the acidity of the lemon.\n\nThis wonderful tart was invented in three steps and not in France.\n\nFirst the lemon cream. This cream was invented by the English in XVIII. Americans have also been very fond of this cream, but with lime. They created the Key Lime Pie which has been widely consumed by sailors to prevent scurvy thanks to its vitamin C content.\n\nAs for the meringue, its origin is Swiss but made by an Italian chef in 1720. He gives his creation the name of his birthplace \u2013 Meiringen.\n\nAs for our Lemon Meringue Tart as we prepare it today, it was created in Philadelphia in the United States by a pastry chef Elisabeth Goodwell.\n\nPROFITEROLES\n\nProfiteroles are small puffs filled with ice cream and covered with hot chocolate topping.\n\nBut originally, the word \u201cprofiterolle\u201d comes from the sixteenth century. We talk then, as one can read it in Pantagruel de Rabelais, about \u201cProfiterolles of indulgence\u201d. It is a gratuity for the servants \u2013 a small ball of bread baked in the ashes and thrown into the \u201cprofiteroles soup\u201d.\n\nIn 1690, the word \u201cprofiterolle\u201d officially designated \u201chollow roll stuffed with beatilles (offal) and cooked in a soup.\n\nIn the same sixteenth century, the cook of Queen Catherine de Medici, invented the \u201chot pastry\u201d which was actually the choux pastry that we know today.\n\nIt was in the 19th century that the \u201cpastry chef of kings\u201d, Antonin Car\u00eame, created small chouquettes stuffed with whipped or pastry cream. The profiteroles were born!\n\nRUM BABA\n\nLike many good things, the rum baba recipe was born out of a mistake.\n\nIn the 18th century, a French pastry chef named Nicolas Stohrer worked for the Polish king Stanislas Leszcynski who was in exile in Alsace.\n\nStohrer brings from Poland a brioche for the king. But it dries out during the trip. The chef then decides to sprinkle it with the sweet Spanish wine Malaga, garnish it with pastry cream and raisins.\n\nThe king greatly appreciates the cake and renames it Ali-baba (according to the book he was reading at that time).\n\nThis recipe has evolved a little today, the wine has been replaced by rum and pastry cream by whipped cream.\n\nSAINT-HONORE\n\nThe Saint-Honor\u00e9 owes its name to the 6th century Bishop of Amiens, who became the patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs.\n\nIt was created in 1850 by the young pastry chef Auguste Jullien from the famous Parisian house Chilboust, located on rue Saint-Honor\u00e9.\n\nAt first it was just a brioche filled with pastry cream.\n\nWhen the young pastry chef sets up his own pastry shop, he improves the recipe. He now uses a base of shortcrust pastry (now flaky), on which he placed (with caramel) small choux, garnished with chilboust cream (light pastry cream with egg whites whipped in peaks). Light and frozen, the Saint-Honor\u00e9 is an airy delight!\n\nAlessia Sirel\n\nRead: The True History of French Pastry. Part one.\n\nRead more articles\n\nAlessia Sirel private guide\u2019s site"}]}
