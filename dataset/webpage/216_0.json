He was a four-time NBA All-Star with the New York Knicks and won three NBA championships with the Boston Celtics.\n\nNaulls grew up in California, where he was named the state's Mr. Basketball in high school. He played college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, and earned All-American honors as a senior in 1956. Naulls was selected by the St. Louis Hawks (known now as the Atlanta Hawks) with the ninth overall pick of the 1956 NBA draft. He played briefly with St. Louis before being traded to New York, where he spent most of his career. With the Knicks, he became the first African American to be named a captain of a professional team in a major American sport. After a brief stint with the San Francisco Warriors (now the Golden State Warriors), Naulls finished his career with Boston. In December 1964, he was part of a Celtics unit that became the first all-black starting lineup in NBA history.\n\nEarly life Naulls was born in Dallas, Texas, to Daily and Bettie (Artis) Naulls. During World War II, the family moved to Los Angeles when he was nine to escape racial segregration. His father worked at shipyards in San Pedro, and his mother was a domestic worker. Naulls was a basketball star at San Pedro High, where he was named California Mr. Basketball in 1952.\n\nCollege career Naulls attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he played for the Bruins under future Basketball Hall of Fame coach John Wooden. In December 1954 during his junior year, UCLA won 47\u201340 over San Francisco, who were led by Naulls' future Boston teammates Bill Russell and K. C. Jones. Naulls outplayed Russell in the Dons' lone defeat of the season en route to their first of two consecutive national championships. As a senior in 1955\u201356, Naulls set the Bruins single-game rebounding record with 28 against Arizona State, and he finished the season with 582 field goal attempts to set the school's single-season record. UCLA won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament that season, while Naulls was named a consensus second-team All-American. In his three seasons at UCLA, Naulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. At the time his career ended, he was the Bruins' career leader in both points (1,225) and rebounds (900). He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nNBA career Naulls was selected by the St. Louis Hawks in second round of the 1956 NBA draft with the ninth overall pick. He called it a \"culture shock\" to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he had not seen since he was eight before moving to Southern California. He spent just 19 games with the Hawks before being traded to the New York Knicks, with whom he would spend most of his career. Naulls averaged a double-double (19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds per game) during his seven-year tenure with the Knicks, and he appeared as an NBA All-Star four times. The Knicks named him their captain in 1960, making him the first African-American athlete to hold the position for any pro team in a major American sport. In 1960\u201361, Naulls scored a single-season team record of 1,846 points, averaging 23.4 points per game. The record was broken the following season by teammate Richie Guerin. On March 2, 1962, Naulls scored 31 points and established another team record with his seventh straight game scoring 30 points or more. In that same game, Philadelphia Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain notched his NBA record 100-point game against the Knicks. Naulls' 30+ streak stood until 2010, when it was broken by Amar'e Stoudemire. During the 1962\u201363 NBA season, the Knicks traded Naulls to the San Francisco Warriors, with whom he played briefly before being traded to the Boston Celtics. Naulls spent his last three professional seasons with the Celtics, winning three consecutive NBA championships in the process. In December 1964 against St. Louis, he replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn to form NBA's first all-black starting lineup along with Russell at center, K. C. and Sam Jones at the guards and Satch Sanders at forward. That 1964\u201365 Celtics team was named one of the 10 best teams in NBA history during the league's 50th anniversary. The 6-foot-6-inch (1.98 m) Naulls finished his 10-year NBA career with averages of 15.8 points and 9.1 rebounds per game."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/willie-naulls", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nWillie Naulls (William Dean Naulls) was born on 7 October, 1934 in Dallas, TX, is an American basketball player.

He was 84.\n\nNaulls died on Thanksgiving at his home in Laguna Niguel, south of Los Angeles, UCLA said. The cause was respiratory failure resulting from Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare condition that can restrict blood flow to vital organs and tissues.\n\nThere was a moment of silence for Naulls before UCLA's basketball game Wednesday night.\n\nAfter playing for UCLA from 1954-56, Naulls was selected with the ninth overall pick in the NBA draft by the St. Louis Hawks.\n\nBut he spent just 19 games with the Hawks, calling it a \"culture shock\" to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he hadn't seen since he was eight before moving from Dallas to Los Angeles. He was then traded to the Knicks.\n\nBoston won titles in 1964, '65 and '66, Naulls' final three seasons.\n\nAlong with Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Tom Sanders, Naulls comprised the first all-black lineup in the history of integrated pro sports in December 1964 when Naulls replaced injured Tom Heinsohn as a starter.\n\nWith the Knicks, Naulls became the first black to be named a captain of a pro team in a major American sport. He averaged a double-double (19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds) during his seven-year tenure with the Knicks.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 forward also played for the San Francisco Warriors during his 10-year pro career.\n\nNaulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds playing for three years at UCLA.\n\nHe set UCLA's single-game rebounding record with 28 against Arizona State on Jan. 28, 1956, a mark that still stands. He led the team in rebounding each of his three seasons.\n\nPlaying for future Hall of Fame coach John Wooden, he helped the Bruins win the Pacific Coast Conference title as a senior in 1956, when he earned All-America honours. At the time his college career ended, he was the school's career leader in points (1,225) and rebounds (900).\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Naulls returned to UCLA and completed his undergraduate degree. He earned a master's in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena in 1993.\n\nNaulls worked with underserved youth for over 50 years and founded a non-profit organization that raised money for free summer basketball camps for junior high and high school boys.\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; children Lisa, Shannon, Joanh and Malaika; and six grandchildren.\n\nThe Associated Press"}]}
