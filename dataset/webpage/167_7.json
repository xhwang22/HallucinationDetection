At StoryCorps, Anderson, now 49, and Karen, 52, remembered how their father's pioneering spirit also influenced how he raised them.\n\nOne of the few Black engineers in Silicon Valley at the time, Jerry worked for a company called Fairchild Camera and Instrument. He helped lead a team that in 1976 released a product known as Channel F, a precursor to video game systems like today's PlayStation and Xbox.\n\ntoggle caption The Lawson family\n\n\"Dad was a man without limitations as far as what he felt he could do or accomplish,\" Karen said to her brother. \"When he did pass, as sad as it was, you and I both know that he lived a full life.\"\n\nAt 6 feet, 6 inches, and some 300 pounds, his stature was intimidating, said the siblings. But Anderson remembered a gentle giant. \"He'd pick us up and he would pretend like he was King Kong and go, 'Aaaahhhh!' \" he recalled.\n\nAfter all, the \"F\" in his father's shining achievement, Channel F, stood for \"fun.\"\n\nJerry was always tinkering, taking devices apart and seeing what was inside. As a teenager in Queens, N.Y., he made house calls to repair TVs.\n\nAnderson remembers his dad's makeshift lab in their garage resembling a slapdash Star Trek console.\n\n\"There might be eight to 10 different computers, about the size of a refrigerator, all networked together,\" he said. \"And I remember walking around and stepping on some of the electronic components and hurting my foot.\"\n\nShoes were necessary, Karen joked: \"It was a death trap.\"\n\nSome of their earliest memories were of them playing games that their dad's team designed.\n\nThe siblings realized as they got older that as they were having fun and games, they also served as guinea pigs for their father's early game designs, Karen said, \"checking out bugs.\"\n\n\"He just got some free labor out of us,\" Anderson said, laughing.\n\nA book Jerry gave to his son and nephew, 101 BASIC Computer Games, inspired Anderson's decision to become a computer scientist.\n\n\"He forced us to figure out how to make our own games,\" said Anderson.\n\n\"I had so much fun doing it,\" he said. \"It changed the whole trajectory of my life.\"\n\nLike the sci-fi books and movies he devoured, Jerry saw no rules to what he could do in life.\n\n\"If everyone was going right, he'd figure out a good reason to go left,\" Anderson said. \"That was just him. He created his own destiny.\"\n\nAudio produced for Morning Edition by Lauren Smith.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.

Nope, not the Atari 2600, or even the popular Nintendo NES from the '80s.\n\nIn fact, the very first console dates back to 1967, when \"The Brown Box\" was released, five years before the Magnavox Odyssey launched in the early '70s, according to RIPT Apparel(Opens in a new window), which compiled a complete history of video game consoles into a tidy timeline (see below).\n\nHome video games didn't take off until about 1973, when Atari's Pong arcade machine became so popular that the company decided to market the game as a home console two years later.\n\nIn the same year, Magnavox developed the Odyssey 100 and 200, in an effort to improve upon its former system. The TV manufacturer continued to release more Odyssey boxes, turning out the 300, 400, and 500 series in 1976. They were overshadowed the next year, though, when Atari's iconic 2600 hit the market.\n\nNintendo, meanwhile, delivered its first console with 1978's Color TV Game Series, which, according to RIPT Apparel, followed the Atari Pong-style games and was only available for sale in Japan.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids maker Coleco had a decent run in the late '70s, pushing out five consoles in two years, and also introduced a line of ROM cartridges for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision before exiting the video game business in a few years later.\n\n\"As the struggle for domination continues between Nintendo and Sega, each of them released brand new consoles to challenge each other's positions,\" RIPT said, pointing to the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (1983) and the No. 1 console of its time, the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1988).\n\nTwo years later, the Super NES system rang in a new decade with massive competition.\n\nThe first few years of the '90s marked what RIPT called a \"notable shift in the medium used for storing games,\" moving from cartridges to the more modern compact discs, helping to increase the capacity for video gaming and prompting a transition from 2D graphics to 3D.\n\nSony finally entered the console fight in 1994 when it introduced the Playstation, competing for interest along with the cartridge-based Sega Genesis 2 and 3 (released in 1994 and '97, respectively), and the new Sega Saturn, aimed at rivaling other CD-compatible consoles. Nintendo stuck with the cartridge system for its Nintendo 64, which hit shelves in the mid '90s.\n\nIn 1998, Sega became an Internet-gaming pioneer with the Sega Dreamcast's built-in modem for online playing. By the new millennium, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo began taking over the market, with the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, respectively.\n\n\"Finally, the current generation of video game console only has room for three major competitors: Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii,\" RIPT said. With the first two's full 1080p HD graphics and the Wii's innovative movement-sensing remote, \"it seems that video gaming had indeed come a long, long way,\" the graphic said.\n\nFor a full look at the decades-spanning video game industry, check out RIPT Apparel's infographic below.

If you were born after 2000, you probably take the superior game quality for granted. However, at the dawn of the video game console development things were pretty different.\n\nIf you are an 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s child, you must have felt the genuine pleasure of inviting friends over to your house as you were the first kid in the neighbourhood who got the latest console.\n\nAnyway, no matter how old you are, no matter if you still play games or not, you might be curious to look behind the scenes and see how video game consoles have evolved throughout the years.\n\nA Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Step\n\nThe Brown Box\n\nThe Brown Box\n\nThe year 1967 saw the creation of the first video game console. The device, known as the Brown Box, was essentially a rectangular brown wooden box with two attached controllers. It was invented by Ralph H. Baer, \u201cthe Father of the Video Games\u201d. The console was designed to connect to TV sets and players had a total of six games at their disposal \u2013 tennis, ping-pong, handball, volleyball, chase, and a light gun game.\n\nMagnavox Odyssey\n\nMagnavox Odyssey\n\nBack in 1972, Magnavox released the first home video game console \u2013 the Magnavox Odyssey. Back then, it must have been the most sophisticated piece of gaming merchandise, although I bet contemporary players will consider the lack of sound plain ridiculous.\n\nOdyssey Console Series and Atari\u2019s Grand Entrance\n\nIn 1975, Magnavox decided to improve the Odyssey system and started rolling out new models on a regular basis. Although each released console outshined its predecessor in terms of graphics, controllers and performance, the number of compatible games remained largely the same.\n\nMagnavox Odyssey 100 Magnavox Odyssey 200\n\nMagnavox Odyssey 400 Magnavox Odyssey 300\n\nMagnavox Odyssey 500 Magnavox Odyssey 2000\n\nMagnavox Odyssey 3000 Magnavox Odyssey 4000\n\nAtari 2600\n\nHowever, the Magnavox devices faced the competition of the highly acclaimed Atari 2600.\n\nMeanwhile, Fairchild, Coleco and Stunt Cycle also entered the video game console market.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Fairchild failed to gain a considerable market share but Coleco Telstar was a different story. Its debut caused a lot of excitement as it enabled players to play games in color and complete different difficulty levels. Coleco unleashed Telstar Ranger, Alpha, Colormatic, and Combat consoles. On top of that, General Home Products brought the Wonder Wizard to players\u2019attention.\n\nColeco Telstar Ranger Coleco Telstar Alpha\n\nColeco Telstar Colormatic Coleco Telstar Combat\n\nThe Wonder Wizard\n\nThe Late 70s \u2013 Nintendo, Mattel, and Philips in the Spotlight\n\nBy the end of the 70s, Nintendo became a major figure on the console gaming market. However, the Color TV Game Series was available only in Japan.\n\nIn 1979, Mattel introduced the Intellivision console. Coleco continued paving its way to growth by releasing Telstar Sportsman, Colortron, Marksman, and Gemini consoles.\n\nIntellivision Telstar Sportsman\n\nColeco Telstar Colortron Coleco Telstar Marksman\n\nColeco Telstar Gemini\n\nMagnavox also unleashed several upgraded consoles that play Pong-based games. In 1974, Philips bought Magnavox and released Philips Odyssey 2, Philips Odyssey 2001, and Philips Odyssey 2100.\n\nPhilips Odyssey 2 Philips Odyssey 2001\n\nPhilips Odyssey 2100\n\nThe Early 80s \u2013 The Golden Era\n\nSega Master System\n\nIn the early 80s, the console gaming segment started to take the shape. This was a period of innovation. The industry made a deviation from the Pong games and took the first steps towards diversification and development of adventure, RPG, and fighting games. The early 80s is the era of Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Golden Axe, and more. However, the most notable change was the shift from dedicated consoles with a handful of built-in games to cartridge-based video game systems.\n\nAtari 5200\n\nAt that time, Sega and Nintendo dominated the market. In 1983, Sega released the SG-1000, but it achieved sporadic success due to the introduction of the NES console. Two years later, in 1985, Sega released the Sega Master System, which was well-accepted by players.\n\nThe competition did not fall behind, though. Atari released the 5200 model. Intellivision II and ColecoVision were also launched. However, none of these models managed to dethrone Sega and Nintendo. As a matter of fact, the ColecoVision was the last console the company has released.\n\nColeco Vision\n\nLate 80\u2019s \u2013 Clash of the Titans\n\nThe war between Sega and Nintendo reached its peak. Both companies struggled to outshine each other and released more and more sophisticated pieces of gaming gear. Sega came up with the Mega Drive and Master System III, while Nintendo rolled out the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).\n\nMega Drive Master System 3\n\nSNES\n\nAt that time, Atari released the 7800 model that offered backward compatibility with the legendary Atari 2600.\n\nIn 1990, SNK Neo Geo shook up the market with the introduction of the Neo Geo AES. The latter featured stunning for its time graphics, but the hefty price tag (the console itself cost $800, and each game cost $200) played a trick on SNK and the console did not achieve the expected overwhelming success.\n\nAtari 7800 Neo Geo AES\n\nEarly 90\u2019s- Video Game Consoles (R)evolution\n\nIn the beginning of the 90\u2019s, there was a considerable change in the way video game consoles functioned.\n\nThe year 1992 saw the launch of the first CD console \u2013 Philips CD-i. The next year, Sega CD was launched. In 1993, Atari introduced the Atari Jaguar, which was aimed to declare war to the 16-bit consoles available on the market. Sad as it may seem, the Jaguar was the last console Atari has released.\n\nPhilips CD-i Sega CD\n\nAtari Jaguar\n\nAt that time, the console manufacturing was advancing with a tremendous speed. The Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation have quickly captured gamers\u2019 attention.\n\nPlaystation Sega Saturn\n\nLate 90\u2019s \u2013 Players Get Spoilt for Choice\n\nSega released the Genesis 2 console, followed by Genesis 3 (1997). It has also developed a new Saturn console to compete against the CD-based devices. Nintendo unleashed Nintendo 64 model. Nintendo\u2019s Virtual Boy, released in 1995 had a head-mounted display to view 3D graphics.\n\nSega Genesis 2 Nintendo 64\n\nNintendo Virtual Boy\n\nIn 1998, Sega released the Dreamcast. The latter provided Internet support via a built-in modem for online playing, which gave it a serious advantage over the competition.\n\nSega Dreamcast\n\nEarly 2000\u2019s \u2013 Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Enjoy International Fame\n\nThe beginning of the 2000s marked the arrival of Playstation 2. Nintendo has apparently realized that it was about time to unleash a device that can resist the tough competition. As a result, the Nintendo GameCube hit the stores in 2001. In the same year, Microsoft unleashed the Xbox console.\n\nPlaystation 2 Nintendo GameCube\n\nXbox\n\nThe Xbox arrived with a built-in hard drive enabling players to save games. The release of the Xbox Live allowed subscribers to team up and battle against others and download new content for their games.\n\nEssentially, after three decades of experiments, the beginning of the new century brought stability and outlined the brands that would dominate the market for the decades to come.\n\n2005-2010 \u2013 Reign of the Goliaths\n\nIn 2005, Microsoft released the Xbox 360. The year after, Sony released the Playstation 3. Both devices feature full 1080p HD graphics. The innovative remote of Nintendo Wii came to confirm that the console manufacturing has come a long way to provide players with unparalleled gaming experience.\n\nXbox 360 Playstation 3\n\nNintendo Wii\n\nIn 2006, Nintendo released the DS Lite. In 2009, players put their hands on the MotionPlus for Wii. The next year saw the arrival of Kinect for Xbox 360 and Move for PS3.\n\n2011- Today \u2013 Commemorating the Past and Looking towards the Future\n\nContemporary console players have a plethora of top tier devices to choose from. In 2012, Sony released PS Vita; Nintendo rolled out Wii U and Wii Mini, and Nintendo 2DS. However, the arrival of PS4 in 2013 was a standout success. The device features a refined controller and faultless console design as well as a range of connected services for online gaming and media streaming. Shortly after, Microsoft released the Xbox One, which became the main PS4 competitor.\n\nPS Vita Wii U\n\nWii Mini Playstation 4\n\nXbox One\n\nIn 2014, the New Nintendo 3DS XL had its debut followed by the introduction of the New Nintendo 3DS.\n\nNew Nintendo 3DS New Nintendo 3DS XL\n\nXbox One S\n\nA year ago, on August 2nd 2016, Microsoft released the latest console in its line-up \u2013 Xbox One S. The latter is a powerful console that has 4K capabilities and beautiful minimalistic design. Sony also offered Playstation fans an upgrade and launched the PS4 Slim console.\n\nOver the last couple of months, there has been a growing demand for retro gaming devices. The release of Nintendo Switch was a massive success. What is more, there have been serious supply issues as devices were sold out a way faster than expected. The return of the NES/ SNES consoles was also well-perceived by gamers whose nostalgia of the good old days once again led to supply shortages.\n\nNintendo Switch SNES\n\nNES Classic Edtion\n\nXbox One X\n\nAs for the upcoming video game console releases, the Xbox One X is to arrive with much fanfare on November 7th, 2017. Sony is reportedly working on a PS5 console.\n\nLast, but not least, the year 2017 will long be associated with the return of Atari. Yes, you read that right. Atari is making a major comeback with the Ataribox gaming console. Although there is no information about an eventual release date, players already know what to expect in terms of design and technical specs.\n\nIs there a best-selling video game console we have missed?

Yet, have you ever wondered what started all this, which game had people obsessing over it for them to make this an international phenomenon?\n\nA world without gaming cannot be imagined, and to do so is futile. Gaming has become such a staple part of people\u2019s childhoods, and growing up without a phone in hand is just bizarre in this day and age. People\u2019s worlds have always been surrounded by some sort of entertainment, and it did not take long for games to become a huge part of people's lives. In this article, we cover the very first console to be developed, what led to its development, and how video games have become the artistic creations with stunning graphics and beautiful storylines that we see today, from the two lines and one dot that games started with.\n\nAfter reading about Microsoft's Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Game Boy Color, and other consoles, also check out facts about video games and the first commercial video game here at Kidadl.\n\nOldest Videos Game Consoles In The World\n\nWould you believe that the first video game console was made in 1972 and the first video game in 1958? Magnavox released a series of home video game consoles, called the Magnavox Odyssey Consoles, later bought by Philips, with addendums of minute changes.\n\nThe Magnavox series was designed by Ralph H. Baer, a German-American inventor, and allowed the user to play several games off of one console. It is interesting to note that a program was not used to run this; instead, the hardware was connected by wires which, when connected, produced a game on the screen. A TV was also released with a built-in console after Philips purchased Magnavox.\n\nAs mentioned above, video game consoles have been around since 1972, with Magnavox revolutionizing the way we see gaming today. Pong also came out around this time, and Magnavox successfully sued them for trying to copy their model. Pong\u2019s parent company, Atari, was unsuccessful in patenting and selling a home Pong model, but the success of Magnavox and Pong continued. The Odyssey, was a brown box with flecks of white and black, connected to a television set with two controllers on the side. The brown box was a TV game and was capable of generating two lines and one dot according to the difficulty. Players could put plastic overlays on the brown box, adding visual elements to a simple game. It was a TV game that, despite its simplicity, was well-liked and provided people with hours of entertainment with lines and dots.\n\nFirst Generation Of Video Game Consoles\n\nWar and violence are what science has shown video game consoles to be excellent at, but one man decided to prove everyone wrong, starting a billion-dollar industry and a hobby that would last a lifetime, even becoming a career for some.\n\nWhen William Higginbotham presented his invention at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, a game called 'Tennis for Two', he did not expect it to be such a massive hit. A simple game, and the inspiration for Pong, years later, was an analog design, with players pushing a button and turning two knobs to simulate a game of tennis, on a bed of an oscilloscope. A hit since the very beginning, people lined up to play the game, and the creator started a movement that would only grow in the years to come. Sadly, the game\u2019s parts were taken out for other uses, and the flame of history was snuffed out just as quickly as it had been lit.\n\nForgotten almost completely, until the invention of Pong, nobody remembered that sunny day in Brookhaven where everything we knew about games changed. But we would be remiss if we did not mention a game that, even though purists do not consider it to meet the definitions of a video game, is still an invention that deserves a screen. Called 'Bertie the Brain', it was a game of tic tac toe on a monstrous machine invented by Josef Kates.\n\nPlayers in the Canadian National Exhibition were able to play against the \u2018electronic brain\u2019, so it was called, at several levels of difficulty. A delight to those there, it was unfortunately dismantled.\n\nIt would be a lie to say that arcade games were invented in the '60s and subsequently became a hit, as games with arcade-like qualities have been around since the '30s, but did not gain traction until the late 20th century.\n\nThe pioneer in the arcade was Atari back then, who released Pong, a game inspired by table tennis, and was loved across the US. In 1972, Pong was released to the world. A massive cultural impact was caused. The game featured two-dimensional graphics, which simulated a game of table tennis on the screen. A hit, it started a generation of video games, with other companies like Nintendo and such following suit. Nintendo\u2019s first arcade was a game called EVR Race, a game about racing.\n\nBut this massive company\u2019s introduction into gaming was actually through the Magnavox game itself, with its light gun gallery being manufactured (in the game) by Nintendo. Eventually, Atari deviated from the idea of Pong, inventing new games, and the world of video games was born.\n\nEvolution Of Home Video Game Consoles\n\nGames that can be played from the comfort of your own home were a concept that took time to find its wings. Mainstream popularity reached its peak almost 40 years ago, with companies like Nintendo finding their niche in it and releasing handheld consoles by the end of the '80s, along with a game called the Game Boy.\n\nAs mentioned above, home video games' consoles have been a staple, as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, for a while now, in every house. Be it a handheld console or a game that connects to the TV or your laptop. A home video game console, however, was an idea that took off with Nintendo. Dedicated consoles were made, like the first Nintendo console game, the EVR race as mentioned, and the release of the Game Boy in 1989, which saw commercial success worldwide.\n\nPopularity has only gone up since then, as the home video game market has seen worldwide fame. Video game history, however, does not let us go until we mention the release of the Fairchild Channel F. The first video game console to feature interchangeable cartridges, it had its advantages and disadvantages but was not the first console to feature a cartridge. The Atari games also used cartridges, which developed technologically further over time.\n\nVideo Game History\n\nThe first computer game, called 'Spacewar', was released in 1962, running on a PDP-1 computer. It was made at MIT, and had primitive graphics, although not more than some video games in the video game market in the \u201980s.\n\nThis game had a pretty interesting concept. It was a two-player game, where each of them controlled a spaceship that circled a planet. The players can shoot at each other, and the first one to die loses. However, as mentioned above, Pong was the first commercially available video game.\n\nSpacewar! was just the beginning. It was run on a computer the size of a large car! We have already mentioned Pong, but a game based on Spacewar! came out in 1971, a year before Pong. It was called 'computer space' and was the first commercial video game, but not as popular. Interestingly, they were the ones who left their parent company to start Atari, which produced Pong.\n\nStarting in the \u201950s, as we have detailed in the earlier parts of this essay, consoles have evolved into high-end graphics and thousands of games and have been a huge part of millennials and gen z\u2019s lives. Consoles have gone from barely six games fitting on a huge disc of hardware to a thousand games fitting in a tiny piece of software.\n\nWe have spoken about all the types of consoles that dominated the industry back in the \u201970s and \u201980s, but the golden age of gaming truly started in the early 80\u2019s with companies moving away from Pong-like games to other ideas, most notably, games like 'Legend of Zelda', 'Final Fantasy', 'Pac Man', 'Super Mario Bros', among others. There was a significant deviation from simple, two-player games to RPG, fighting, and platform games.\n\nThis was also the time where there was a move to go toward cartridge-based games, rather than a dedicated console with a couple of games in it. Sega launched the SG-1000 in 1983, which laid the foundation for the widely popular SEGA Master System. However, what truly stole the show was Nintendo, with the release of the NES, which completely takes the credit for making Nintendo the first name people think of when buying video games.\n\nA major console war occurred between SEGA and Nintendo, with simultaneous releases, with successful results. However, SEGA conquered, as the higher quality of the eventual Nintendo releases ensured a higher price, making it more unaffordable than the SEGA systems. The release of the SONY PlayStation and SEGA Saturn made sure that the only time Atari tried a comeback was not particularly well received.\n\nSONY also released the PlayStation in 1994, with Nintendo sticking to its cartridge system with the Nintendo 64, and SEGA\u2019s success grew with the Genesis Series being released in the \u201990s. The GameCube was introduced in 2001, with subsequent successful releases of the PlayStation and the Xbox, a Microsoft invention. Today, the dominating power lies with the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Wii, rivaling each other in graphics, playing power, and so forth.\n\nModern Age Of Gaming\n\nTo truly discuss the answer to this question, we must go back in time, 37 years ago to be exact, to look at the first game that was created that could be accessed through the internet.\n\nIt was created by BITNET, called MAD, a sci-fi driving and action game. As revolutionary as this idea was, this game did not take hold. However, in 1993, Doom was released and cemented this extremely popular game with deathmatches in the community.\n\nMore popular games during this period were RPGs, or role-playing-based games, with a significant impact on the Mackintosh. First-person shooter games were on the rise, with releases like Avalon MUD. But it would almost be a crime to not mention Warcraft, which, till today, is one of the biggest online gaming franchises. Later in the decade, Nintendo brought Super Mario online, and in 2002, Xbox Live was released.\n\nPopularity being an understatement, Xbox Live ensured communication between the people playing, and you could play with someone across the world without a hitch. The decade of mobile games has begun, and with the release of Pok\u00e9mon Go in 2015, the virality of other mobile running, RPG, and even shooter games are truly seen. Some examples include CS-GO, Valorant, and more. Virtual gaming has also taken hold, with headsets being made left and right, providing an even more real experience of gaming and its intricacies.\n\nOnline Gaming\n\nPlaying a casual game with your friends after school or work has become almost a daily routine now, with game slang being passed around in daily conversations. However, it took a while for online gaming to become as advanced as it is.\n\nThe first online game was mentioned in the previous topic, but as soon as PlayStation and Xbox took hold of the community, the gaming rage began. Hundreds of thousands of people across the world scrambled to buy these boxes that could provide you with hours of entertainment, and let you play with people halfway across the continent. Games like GTA, Runescape, and others dominated the market, with CS-GO and other shooter games coming later. This was not the only genre that creators dipped their feet into, as Lara Croft, Five Nights at Freddy's, and even Mortal Kombat became hugely popular to the point of having movies based on them.\n\nA lot goes into developing video games, with several steps to make a single frame of them. There is making the concept, idealizing it, the production of it, the designer, the artist, to name a few. The development process consists of the pitch to the company, the pre-production process, and the prototype, deciding whether it is marketable in the current era.\n\nStarting with the pre-production phase, the idea is first conceptualized for clear and easy documentation, resulting in a production plan. It evolves into the high concept, which is a short description. A pitch is prepared, looking at the profitability of the idea. The production process then starts, with the source code and assets for the game being made. There is level production, art production, testing of the game, and finally, the release of the game into the video game market.\n\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

Baer\n\nRalph Baer and The \u201cBrown Box\u201d (1968)\n\nAfter William Higinbotham\u2019s original Tennis for Two (1958), we had to wait ten years for another ilk of inventors to (re)explore the concept of video games.\n\nIn 1968, a team of engineers at Sanders Associates, Inc. led by Ralph Baer developed an inconspicuous device\u2014affectionately called the \u201cBrown Box\u201d\u2014that hooked up to a standard TV set and run several sport-themed \u201cTV games\u201d like ping pong or volleyball.\n\nAs Baer recalled in a Gamasutra interview:\n\n\u201cSo the idea came to me: \u2018Hey, maybe we ought to build something into a television set.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I thought about it as a game, but as something to fool with and to give you something to do with the television set other than watch stupid network programs.\u201d(2)\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #1: While only a prototype, the \u201cBrown Box\u201d came equipped with two controllers for multiplayer gameplay and several revolutionary add-ons like the \u201clight-gun\u201d Nintendo would popularize many years later.\n\nMagnavox Odyssey (1972)\n\nIn 1972, an electronics manufacturer Magnavox licensed Baer\u2019s tech and developed Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial device in the history of video game consoles.\n\nMagnavox Odyssey via Wikipedia(4)\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #2: Baer\u2019s \u201cBrown Box\u201d required users to press intricate combinations of switches to select one of the games loaded into the device. Magnavox improved the user experience by introducing swappable cartridges, a gold standard that would make console gaming so appealing for years to come.\n\nThe release of Magnavox Odyssey\u2014with lifetime sales of 350,000 units\u2014marked the beginning of the 1st generation of video game consoles.\n\n\u2604\ufe0f The Second Generation: Rise and Fall\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do a square ball in \u2018Pong\u2019 because we thought it was cool. We did it because that was all we could do.\u201d Nolan Bushnell, Co-founder and former CEO of Atari Interactive, Inc.\n\nAtari VCS/2600 (1977)\n\nIn 1977, Atari\u2014originally an arcade gaming company\u2014released Atari Video Computer System (VCS). The device launched with 9 games stored on swappable cartridges and featured a completely new controller design.\n\nAtari VCS/2600 via the Atari Museum(5)\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #3: VCS\u2019s elegant joysticks were a significant improvement over the bulky and unwieldy design of Odyssey controllers. Atari\u2019s console also included companion \u201cpaddles\u201d with potentiometers for extra control.\n\nVCS, later renamed to Atari 2600, expanded the sport-themed catalog of games and hit the market with now-classic titles like Combat, Asteroids, Pole Position, and River Raid.\n\nAtari wasn\u2019t the only company that wanted a share in the new market. Sometime after VCS\u2019s debut, two other competitors, Coleco and Mattel, released their own devices.\n\nIntellivision (1979)\n\nIntellivision, which was developed by a toy manufacturer Mattel\u2014hit the market two years after VCS. Most notably, the device featured a pair of remote-like controllers and a revolutionary 16-bit microprocessor which was well ahead of its time.\n\nIntellivision via Wikipedia(6)\n\nFollowing solid sales figures and several revisions of the device, the company fell into financial troubles and the IP was sold ultimately ending Intellivision\u2019s life.\n\nColecoVision (1982)\n\nDeveloped by a former leather goods company Coleco, ColecoVision was a black, rectangular device equipped with two, remote-like controllers. Interestingly enough, the system used a desktop-grade, 8-bit Zilog Z80A microprocessor.\n\nColecoVision with two controllers via Old-Computers.com(7)\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #4: ColecoVision introduced several expansion modules like the ADAM personal-computer kit, a roller controller (trackball) or an Atari 2600 adapter which was really \u201ca nearly complete Atari game system.\u201d(8)\n\nAlthough the fledgling video game market was picking up speed, the emergence of personal computing, among other reasons, led to its collapse.\n\nThe Video Game Crash of 1983 killed off the momentum and quenched the potential success of new, up-and-coming devices like Atari 5200 and Magnavox Odyssey 2.\n\n\u2694\ufe0f The Third Generation: New Players Enter the Arena\n\n\u201cVideogames weren\u2019t just for kids; they were for anyone who wanted to feel like a kid. Anyone who missed the freedom and innocence that comes with endless wonder.\u201d Blake J. Harris, Console Wars\n\nFamicon/NES (1983/1985)\n\nIn the same year the U.S. gaming market halted, the Japanese gaming industry began to flourish, most notably with the release of Nintendo\u2019s Famicon on July 15, 1983.\n\nFamicon (JPN) vs. NES (US)(9)\n\nUsing a tested recipe of its predecessors, Nintendo equipped Famicon with two permanently attached controllers and swappable cartridges. With solid games to match, the system quickly captured the hearts of Japanese gamers.\n\nIn October 1985, redesigned and rebranded as Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Nintendo\u2019s console launched in the U.S. becoming one of the most successful devices in the history of video game consoles.\n\nSEGA Mark III/Master System (1985/1986)*\n\nIn 1985, a video game developer SEGA entered the Japanese market with Mark III, an 8-bit console that was meant to compete with the widely popular Famicon.\n\nSega Master System (US) via Wikipedia(10)\n\nAlthough SEGA\u2019s device was more powerful than NES, it didn\u2019t really have the games to show its potential. In 1986, SEGA redesigned the console and released it in the U.S. as the Master System where it ended up as a runner-up to NES.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #5: The Master System wasn\u2019t revolutionary in its own right but it attempted innovation with a \u201ccard port\u201d which allowed users to hook up additional peripherals. The lineup of add-ons included the SegaScope 3D glasses that took a handful of games into a mock third dimension.\n\n\ud83c\udf0b The Fourth Generation: 16-Bit Worlds Explode\n\n\u201cYou were either a Sega person or a Nintendo person; you couldn\u2019t choose both.\u201d Blake J. Harris, Console Wars\n\nSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis (1988/1989)\n\nIn 1988, SEGA made a grand comeback with Mega Drive. The new console was meant to be SEGA\u2019s trump card in a grapple with Nintendo over the U.S./Japanese markets.\n\nSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis via SEGA Fandom(11)\n\nMega Drive\u2014later renamed to Genesis\u2014was the first true 16-bit system, a quality that gave it a substantial advantage over the 8-bit NES. With a powerful console and Sonic the Hedgehog as its mascot, SEGA quickly captured 60 percent of the U.S. market share.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #6: Although Mega Drive\u2019s 16-bit internals made the headlines in 1988/9, it wasn\u2019t the first console to explore the next-gen realm. Earlier devices like TurboGrafx-16 used similar albeit limited technology.\n\nSuper Famicon/SNES (1990/1991)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Nintendo entered the 16-bit space with Super Famicon (1990) in Japan and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in the U.S. one year later.\n\nSuper Famicon vs SNES via vgcollect.com(12)\n\nFamicon/SNES housed 16-bit internals, two redesigned, detachable controllers, a 32K color palette\u2014it could display 256 colors at the same time\u2014and sophisticated cartridges, some including SRAM for saving game state.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #7: A 2D console at heart, SNES featured an innovative Mode 7 display mode that simulated 3D graphics.\n\nAlthough SNES\u2014like Playstation 3 many years later\u2014was notoriously difficult to develop, it built its heritage on a rooster of exceptional games like Super Mario World, Zelda franchise, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and Street Fighter.\n\n\u26a1\ufe0f The Fifth Generation: The Dawn of a New Era\n\n\u201cNot only would Sony be entering the console market on their own, but they now had the advantage of knowing exactly what SEGA had up its sleeve.\u201d Blake J. Harris, Console Wars\n\nSony Playstation (1994/1995)\n\nOn December 3, 1994, Sony\u2014a newbie in the console market\u2014released Playstation. Compared to its 16-bit competition, the new console boasted powerful internals that could display full 3D graphics and generate a whooping 360,000 polygons per second.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #8: Playstation (PSX) was the first system in the history of video game consoles that, after several revisions, introduced a vibrating controller\u2014the Dual Shock. On top of two analog sticks, Dual Shock housed vibrating motors that reacted to in-game events.\n\nPlaystation (PSX) with a Dual Shock controller via Wikipedia(13)\n\nAs Sony proudly recalls on its website:\n\n\u201cThe game-changing PlayStation sported a sleek design and CD format, meaning games were bigger, 3D-capable and with superior sound to what came before it. Within a decade, PlayStation became the first games console in history to sell over 100 million units worldwide.\u201d(14)\n\nApart from beefy specs, the original Playstation boasted an all-star lineup of games like Ridge Racer, Crash Bandicoot, Tekken, Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, MediEvil, or Spyro, many of which became instant classics.\n\nSEGA Saturn(1994/1995)\n\nA few months before Sony made their grand entrance, SEGA had been prepping to debut their newest Saturn console. Although Saturn was originally a 2D system, SEGA decided to add 3D capabilities after Sony\u2019s bold claims about the power of PSX.\n\nSEGA Saturn via Computing History(14)\n\nIn a 2018 interview, former SEGA president and R&D director Hideki Sato recalled:\n\n\u201cThe Saturn actually had just one CPU at the beginning. Then Sony appeared with its polygon-based PlayStation. When I was first designing the Saturn architecture, I was focused on sprite graphics, which had been the primary graphics up to that point. So I decided to go with polygons (due to the PlayStation).\u201d(15)\n\nSEGA outrun Sony in the race to Japanese and U.S. markets but Saturn faced a fair share of hiccups. On top of its high price and lack of solid games to sell the system, the console didn\u2019t even get a new release of fans\u2019 favorite Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nNintendo 64 (1996)\n\nTwo years after Saturn\u2019s debut in Japan, Nintendo came up with its own 3D console, Nintendo 64 (N64). The system, codenamed \u201cProject Reality,\u201d was the last device from the Big N that used cartridges for storing games.\n\nNintendo 64 by Nintendo via VentureBeat(17)\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #9: One of the most notable design elements of N64 was its controller. Shaped like a beefed-up letter \u201cM,\u201d it allowed multiple holding positions, including using two controllers simultaneously, one for each hand.\n\nDespite using outdated and expensive cartridges that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to DVD\u2019s, N64 developers managed to deliver many instant classics like Super Mario 64, GoldenEye 007, Conker\u2019s Bad Fur Day, or The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n\n\u270a The Sixth Generation: Big Five\n\n\u201cI am not a huge gamer. My son knows a LOT more than I do about what is cool on Xbox [\u2026]\u201d Bill Gates\n\nSEGA Dreamcast (1998/1999)\n\nThe sixth generation in the history of video game consoles was by no means revolutionary. But it introduced some new names to the gaming business.\n\nOn November 27, 1998, SEGA made their last push with their most powerful console \u2014the Dreamcast. One look at the new device proved that SEGA learned some design lessons\u2014perhaps from Nintendo\u2014and gave Dreamcast a more \u201clikable\u201d attire.\n\nSEGA Dreamcast via Wikipedia.(18)\n\nAfter the interesting but underpowered Saturn, SEGA poured all its resources into the development of Dreamcast, and it showed. The first 128-bit console on the market, it packed specs like internet connectivity and VGA capabilities.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #10: SEGA made a lasting mark on the history of video game consoles by embedding a novelty, see-through slot at the top of the Dreamcast controller. The port was designed for connecting several expansions, including the Visual Memory Unit (VMU), a memory card/auxiliary screen.\n\nPotent hardware and innovative features could only get Dreamcast so far. Facing strong competition, dwindling sales, and soaring losses, Dreamcast ended up as the last SEGA device in the history of video games.\n\nSony Playstation 2 (2000)\n\nAfter a small revolution on the part of PSX, Sony wasn\u2019t going to let their virgin success go to waste. Soon after Dreamcast\u2019s U.S. debut, the company followed up with Playstation 2, a system that would become the best-selling console of all time.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #11: At some point, Sony developed a conversion kit that let users turn their PS2s into fully-fledged Linux machines. The kit included computer peripherals and targeted amateur programmers who wanted to develop games and software for the system.\n\nLike its predecessor, PS2 received a terrific lineup of system-sellers like Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid 2, Vice City, Gran Turismo, Silent Hill, Tekken Tag Tournament, Shadow of the Colossus, God of War, and ICO.\n\nGameCube (2001)\n\n2001 was an important year in Big N\u2019s history. On September 14, Nintendo released GameCube (a.k.a. \u201cDolphin\u201d), its first console that used mini discs instead of cartridges.\n\nGameCube via Den of Geek(19)\n\nWhile GameCube sported solid specs, four controller ports, and a gamepad design that built on Nintendo 64\u2019s heritage, the console didn\u2019t make a great splash.\n\nSome attribute GameCubes\u2019s lackluster performance to proprietary mini discs that had a much smaller capacity than Playstation 2 DVDs. On top of that, the system had a scant game library with only a handful of system-sellers.\n\nIf want to read more about the long and windy history of GameCube, be sure to read Emily Rogers\u2019s account A Dolphin\u2019s Tale: The Story of GameCube(20).\n\nXbox (2001)\n\nWith all the major players in the game (pun intended), Microsoft was the last company to enter the sixth generation with Xbox, and all the money they could pump into it.\n\nXbox via Wikipedia(21)\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s virgin console was unveiled\u2014with Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2019s help\u2014on November 15, 2001, at CES in Las Vegas. The new system had an 8GB HDD, Pentium 3 CPU clocked at 733 MHz, 64MB of RAM, and a 233 MHz GPU based on GeForce 3.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #12: Xbox was a noteworthy piece of technology but it was the Xbox Live that stole the show. Microsoft\u2019s online gaming service launched on November 15, 2002, and let players compete in games like Unreal Championship and NBA 2K3.\n\nDespite solid sales figures, Xbox wasn\u2019t exactly a money-making machine and ended up costing Microsoft a whopping $4 billion in four years.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 The Seventh Generation: Last In, First Out\n\nMicrosoft shoots for the moon. Sony shoots for the sun. Ken Kutaragi, \u201cThe Father of the PlayStation\u201d\n\nXbox 360 (2005)\n\nWith SEGA out of the battlefield and three major competitors left in the game, the next stage in the history of video game consoles started in 2005 with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360.\n\nXbox 360 lineup via LifeWife(22)\n\nOn the design/technical end, the console shipped with powerful IBM/ATI internals, much more elegant and ergonomic wireless controllers, matured Xbox Live service, upgradable HDD, and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #13: Five years after the launch of Xbox 360, Microsoft released Kinect, a groundbreaking motion sensor that enabled hands-free (literally) interactions with the device.\n\nWhile Xbox 360 was a solid piece of hardware, but its launch proved became one of the biggest blunders in the history of video game consoles. Similarily to Playstation 3 one year later, Xbox 360 suffered from overheating problems that materialized as the infamous Red Ring of Death (RRoD).\n\nPlaystation 3 (2006)\n\nAfter a series of setbacks, the third iteration of Sony\u2019s flagship console went live in Japan on November 11, 2006, and six days later, on November 17, in the U.S.\n\nThe original Playstation 3 and a revised \u201cSlim\u201d version via Wikipedia(23)\n\nLike its predecessor, PlayStation 3 featured online capabilities that could now take full advantage of the growing Playstation Network. Apart from the all-new motion-sensing controller, PS3 sported a blu-ray drive that helped market it as an entertainment center.\n\nInterestingly enough, the early models\u2014most notably the 20 and 60 GB versions for the Japanese market\u2014included more USB ports, a flash memory card reader, Linux support (!), and hardware backward compatibility with Playstation 2.\n\nLet\u2019s take a short break, shall we? \u23f1\n\n\ud83d\udc11 Video Games x Taskade\n\nAssembling teams, gathering resources, getting work done together\u2026 No, we\u2019re not talking about another record-breaking MMORPG. \u2694\ufe0f\n\nTaskade is an all-in-one communication and collaboration platform that lets remote teams work, plan, and chat in real time.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Brainstorm ideas\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Manage projects\n\n\u2705 Organize Tasks\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Track progress\n\n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Schedule work\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Create templates\n\nAnd more\u2026\n\nAnd just in case you missed it, our recent \u201cMultiplayer\u201d update added activity and status indicators so you always know what you\u2019re teammates are up to!\n\nJump over here to sign up.

It\u2019s wee enclosure\u2014see what we did there?\u2014housed an IBM 729 MHz CPU, 243 MHz ATI GPU and meager 24 MB of RAM. Compared to the spec\u2019d out PS3 and Xbox 360, it didn\u2019t impress.\n\nBut Wii had a secret weapon up its disc slot\u2014a sky-high \u201cfun\u201d factor:\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the on-screen game action that moved these people; it was seeing how much fun people were having as they played. That was something new, and it blew away the old stereotype of lonely gamers huddled over a controller in a dark room.\u201d Scott Pelland, former Publications Director at Nintendo of America(25)\n\nWhile the system had a fair share of \u201cmature\u201d games\u2014The Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade, Metroid, and even Resident Evil\u2014it built its heritage on casual, family-friendly productions like Wii Sports.\n\n\ud83d\udd79 Gaming UX Trivia #14: The Wii Remote (a.k.a. Wiimote) and its little sibling the Nunchuk gave gaming UX a completely new twist. On top of motion-sensing capabilities, the controllers paired with countless weird add-ons, including a golf club, steering wheel, balance board, and\u2026 an inflatable racing kart (yep).\n\n\ud83d\udc11 Conclusion\n\nAs the 8th Generation\u2014led by Playstation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch\u2014is slowly wrapping up, we should all take a moment to appreciate how much the gaming industry and the user experience have changed over the last 50 years.\n\nWhile many of the companies who blazed the trail and set the foundations for the gaming industry are no longer in the game, their heritage lives on. So, next time you pick up the controller and fire up a game, remember how it all started.\n\nTill next time! \ud83d\udc4a\n\n* Release dates for Japan and the U.S.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Resources\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/newzoo-forecasts-2020-global-games-industry-will-reach-159-billion/ https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/the-father-of-the-video-game-the-ralph-baer-prototypes-and-electronic-games https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6214/the_replay_interviews_ralph_baer.php?print=1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey#/media/File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Console-Set.jpg https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Intellivision_in_museum.jpg http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/atari2600.html https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=2&c=755 http://www.colecovision.dk/atari.htm https://blog.gameoverbox.com/2019/07/which-nintendo-consoles-are-region.html https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Sega-Master-System-Set.jpg https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Drive?file=RS39200+Megadrive.png https://vgcollect.com/forum/index.php?topic=8761.0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)#/media/File:PSX-Console-wController.jpg https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/ps4/playstation-through-the-years/ https://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?33506-Hideki-Sato-on-the-Sega-Saturn-(incredible-new-interview) https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-reportedly-suffered-a-significant-legacy-console-leak/ https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nintendo-64.jpg?w=1200&strip=all https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg https://web.archive.org/web/20190522133134/http://www.dromble.com/2014/01/07/dolphin-tale-story-of-gamecube/ https://www.denofgeek.com/games/how-the-gamecube-made-nintendo-cynical/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)#/media/File:Xbox-console.jpg https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ANY4P4LepNB5lxQ_8rgjt6UkHvk=/3468\u00d72312/filters:fill(auto,1)/Xbox3260s-5c5dc18a46e0fb0001ca86ec.jpg https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3#/media/File:PS3-Consoles-Set.jpg https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/05/random_in_japan_you_can_buy_a_nintendo_wii_for_50_cents https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ScottPelland/20091009/85687/A_Wii_Bit_of_History.php https://www.amazon.com/Console-Wars-Nintendo-Defined-Generation/dp/0062276700"}, {"url": "https://vglegacy.com/hardware/brown-box/", "page_content": "While waiting at a bus terminal for another Sanders engineer to arrive in town for a meeting with a client, Baer took the opportunity to write down some notes on the subject of using standard home television sets to play games. The following morning, he turned his notes that he written down into a four-page paper which described the idea of playing television games on a home television set. The document listed various types of games that might be playable using a standard television set, such as action games, board games, sports games, chase games and many others. Baer was creating what is now known as video game genres even before a system was created. The four paged document is now located at the Smithsonian along with all of the game hardware that was created over the next three years.\n\nWhat Baer originally had in mind was to develop a small game box that would play simplistic games and perhaps cost $25 at retail. He asked one of the engineers in his division at Sanders Associates to read, date and sign the document he created as this was a standard procedure to establish a legal record. This document was used years later in 1974 in Federal Courts in Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Ottawa and many other cities in pursuit of patent infringement which would result in millions of dollars changing hands.\n\nSanders Associates was a military electronics company and video games had absolutely nothing to do with the normal business of developing complex military electronic systems. At the time Baer was a Division Manager and Chief Engineer for Equipment Design at Sanders where he ran eight departments with up to 500 technical and support personnel. He also supervised much of the internal research and development work at Sanders. Baer was running a large operation at the time and could afford to utilize a technician to do some experimental work without affecting his division\u2019s productivity. After a few demonstrations to the Corporate Director of Research & Development at Sanders it wasn\u2019t long before the project became official and would eventually payoff very handsomely for Sanders.\n\nThe development of the gaming device continued through 1968 with most of the work being done by two engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. Both of these engineers made important contributions to the game concept as Baer supervised the activity which was being done at Sanders Canal Street building in Nashua, New Hampshire. Several game systems were developed which allowed them to play different types of sports games such as Ping-Pong, volleyball, handball, soccer, hockey and several others. They also developed a light-gun which could be used to shoot at targets on the screen of the television set. Though this was not the first light gun game it was the first light gun developed to work on a television set, the first to be used in a video game and was the first video game peripheral.\n\nBy late 1968 Baer finished building their final demonstration game system, the \u201cBrown Box\u201d. It was switch programmable and played a large number of sports, maze and quiz games. The system also had several games based on the light-gun which was created and gave the ability to shoot at stationary or moving targets displayed on the screen.\n\nThe system was finally complete and the technology that went into the system was something that could be massed produced at a reasonable cost to allow for it to be marketed to the general public. Baer tried to introduce video games to the cable television industry in 1968 but was not successful. He then proceeded to approach American television manufacturers throughout 1969 in hopes that they would be interested in this new concept. The \u201cBrown Box\u201d was demonstrated to representatives at RCA, Sylvania, GE and Motorola but no one was willing to take the risk involved in marketing the new concept to the general public.\n\nRepresentatives from Magnavox went to Sanders Associates in Nashua, New Hampshire where Baer and his team demonstrated the \u201cBrown Box\u201d for them. The reactions were overwhelmingly favorable but still it was seen as a large risk for Magnavox and they held off on moving forward. Two years later in 1971 Magnavox revisited the idea of television gaming and finally took a license from Sander Associates. Their 1972 Odyssey home video game system, a production engineered version of the \u201cBrown Box\u201d was the result. This was the first home video game console and was the beginning of the home video game market which is now a multibillion-dollar industry."}, {"url": "https://kotaku.com/remembering-the-first-console-to-use-cartridges-5791080", "page_content": "Today's video game news was tinged with sadness, as the world learned of the death of Jerry Lawson, the man who led the team behind the creation of the video game cartridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose cartridges were used in the Fairchild Channel F, the console Lawson helped develop along with Ron Smith and Nick Talesfore. While it never set the world on fire during its tenure on retail shelves, the Channel F's legacy means it's still worth taking a closer look at.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Channel F was released in 1976, and was originally called the Video Entertainment System. While never a huge success on the market, the VES spawned just under 30 games, all of them shipping on the console's revolutionary \"videocarts\", which were the world's first ever cartridge-based video games.\n\nAnother pioneering achievement of the VES was the fact its AI was powerful enough to allow a human to play against it; competing machines at the time of the VES' launch, like Atari's Pong units, could only support human vs human play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the VES had the edge over Atari in terms of available titles and horsepower, it's ironic that its most lasting legacy is that it basically \"inspired\" its competitor to release the Atari Video Computer System, or VCS, a year later in 1977. Not only was the name incredibly similar to Fairchild's VES, but Atari's machine - which also used cartridges - was reportedly \"rushed\" into the marketplace before other devices could make cartridge gaming popular.\n\nBecause of the similarity in name, Fairchild changed its console's name from VES to the Fairchild Channel F, in order to get out from under Atari's shadow. A second console, the The Channel F System II, was released in 1979, but by then Atari's new console - which we now know as the Atari 2600, and which was more powerful than the Channel F- had already cemented its place as the dominant system on the market. Fairchild pulled its system from the market, and despite some attempts at re-releases both overseas and in the US under different names, the Channel F was effectively dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile helping create the first video game cartridges was a pioneering achievement for Jerry Lawson, it's hardly the only mark he's left on the video game landscape. He helped develop one of the first arcade machine's ever released, 1977's Demolition Derby, a two-player racer. And after the Channel F went bust, Lawson founded Videosoft, and developed games for his one-time competitor, the Atari 2600.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was also, notably, the only black member of the \"Homebrew Computer Club\", a notorious group of software nerds and budding hackers who met in Silicon Valley in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of his peers in the group included PC pioneer Lee Felsenstein and Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\n[pics courtesy of Fairchild Channel F]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTotal Recall is a look back at the history of video games through their characters, franchises, developers and trends."}, {"url": "https://ultimatehistoryvideogames.jimdofree.com/brown-box", "page_content": "Brown Box\n\nTrivia:\n\n1) First game console prototype created by Ralph H.

The term \"video game console\" is used to distinguish a console machine primarily designed for consumers to use for playing video games in contrast to arcade machines or home computers. It includes home video game consoles, handheld game consoles, microconsoles and dedicated consoles.\n\n7) Light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games, shaped as a pistol. Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun, which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target(s). The first device of this type, the light pen, was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer. First ever mechanical light gun game was arcade game \"Seeburg Ray-O-Lite\" (1936).\n\n8) First official prototype of a console plays game of \"Ping Pong\" (it inspired arcade game Pong (1972).\n\n9) Game is not emulated."}, {"url": "https://www.alibabacloud.com/topic-center/knowledge/3/4jongl1kyv0-who-invented-the-first-gaming-console-alibaba-cloud", "page_content": "1.

Baer Brown Box Prototype Completed in 1968\n\nThis machine paved the way for the video games of today. In 1967, Ralph Baer and his colleagues at Sanders Associates, Inc. developed a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system. Since Sanders hoped to license the technology for a commercial venture, Baer understood that the games had to be fun or investors and consumers would not be interested. In an oral history interview, Ralph Baer recalled \ufffdThe minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren\ufffdt too sure.\ufffd\n\n\n\nOriginally called TV Game Unit #7, much like the \"Pump Unit\" before it, it became far better known by its nickname, \ufffdThe Brown Box.\ufffd The name comes from the brown wood-grain, self-adhesive vinyl used to make the prototype look more attractive to potential investors. The \"Brown Box,\" though only a prototype, had basic features that most video games consoles still have today: two controls and a multigame program system. The \"Brown Box\" could be programmed to play a variety of games by flipping the switches along the front of the unit, as can be seen in the picture. Program cards were used to show which switches needed to be set for specific games.\n\n\n\nBrown Box games included ping-pong, checkers, four different sports games, target shooting with the use of a lightgun and a golf putting game, which required the use of a special attachment. Sanders licensed the Brown Box to Magnavox, which released the system as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972."}]}
