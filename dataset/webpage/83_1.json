Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.\n\nWith speeds that can reach over 90 mph, luge is one of the most dangerous sports at the Olympic Games.\n\nAccidents and injuries are common during competition.\n\nTwelve years ago, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died before the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics after losing control of his sled on a training run and hitting a steel pole that was unpadded.\n\nThe International Luge Federation conducted an investigation where they determined that human error was the cause of the deadly training run crash. While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport. Austria\u2019s 22 total luge medals are the most in Olympic history for a non-German country.\n\nGerman Natalie Geisenberger is the two-time defending Olympic champion in women\u2019s singles entering Beijing and has continued her dominance in the sport with four world championship medals since the last Winter Olympics."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/saba-nodar-kumaritashvili-olympics-beijing-b2005629.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

You never want to see something like that happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I was never in a mindset that I wouldn\u2019t compete. I was comfortable on the track.\u201d\n\nThe same mentality appears to be true of Saba.\n\nMs Hamlin added: \u201cThere\u2019s risks every time you slide. I was never fearful about continuing to slide.\n\n\u201cThe track was definitely fast and challenging but it was new and most new tracks are challenging to figure out and come with risk. I enjoyed the track quite a bit.\u201d\n\nQuestions were instantly raised after Nodar\u2019s death about the safety of the track.\n\nThe Whistler course was the fastest track in Olympic history and speeds of 96 miles per hour had been recorded ahead of the Games.\n\nThe 16th curve where Nodar had flown off the track had earned the nickname the \u201cThunderbird\u201d.\n\nDavid revealed that his son had told him just three days before his death that he was \u201cvery scared\u201d of the turn where he flipped off the sled.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m very scared of this spot on the track,\u201d he recalled to ABC News .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very fast. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll handle it well.\u201d\n\nDavid said he urged him not to \u201crisk it\u201d but that his son was insistent that he was going to go for it.\n\n\u201cWhat will be, will be,\u201d he recalled him saying.\n\nNodar\u2019s father David Kumaritashvili at his son\u2019s grave in Bakuriani, Georgia, in 2014 (AP)\n\nIt was Nodar\u2019s fifth and final training run before he would have competed in the Games the following day when tragedy struck.\n\nThe track was hurriedly altered following the crash in time for the first race less than 24 hours later.\n\nThe start was lowered in an effort to reduce the speed.\n\nThe exposed metal poles which Nodar struck were covered with a 12-foot-high wall made of wood and padding.\n\nAnd the Thunderbird was reconfigured so that the sleds didn\u2019t slide too high on the walls.\n\nInternational Luge Federation officials said at the time that the changes were made with the \u201cemotional component\u201d of the athletes in mind and insisted that there were no \u201cdeficiencies in the track\u201d.\n\nInstead, they said that the crash was caused by errors made by Nodar when he \u201cdid not compensate properly to make correct entrance into Curve 16\u201d.\n\nFor several athletes, the last-minute change in start proved difficult.\n\nMs Hamlin had been expected to take home at least bronze but ended up missing out on the medal table. She won bronze four years later in Sochi.\n\nShe told The Independent that Nodar\u2019s death did lead to changes in the sport in terms of focusing on safety over speed.\n\n\u201cI think it was a movement where everyone stopped to look at ways we could try to see if it was possible to make the track safer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much that could be done other than moving the starts as it was kind of a freak accident.\n\n\u201cBut the trend of just building faster and faster tracks did change.\u201d\n\nNodar\u2019s sled is seen just after the fatal crash. It crossed the finish line moments after he was killed (AP)\n\nFor Saba, he feels he is now ready to represent his family - particularly his cousin - in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals\u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal.

Instead, he died.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, 12 years later, his cousin is.\n\nSaba Kumaritashvili thought about Nodar this week, as he prepared to slide down a rock-hard track here in Yanqing. He pulled his hips forward and clenched his lips, then pushed back, and flung himself into this treacherous, frozen strait. He careened around corners, and flirted with walls, and hit 78 miles per hour.\n\nBut he \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said after his second run.\u201d Tragedy never threatened to drive him away from the sport.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cafter Nodar, I didn\u2019t want luge to die in Georgia. I wanted to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo he did what so many members of his family had done for decades. His story, like Nodar\u2019s, is so much more than a crash or a single-minded Olympic pursuit. It begins with his great grandfather, Aleko, who laid the groundwork, literally. Aleko oversaw the construction of Georgia\u2019s first luge track in the 1970s. His son and grandson took advantage. Saba\u2019s grandfather, Felix, slid to the Junior European Championships a few years later. Saba\u2019s uncle \u2014 Nodar\u2019s father \u2014 then won a USSR youth championship in the final years before the Soviet split. Multiple family members, including Saba\u2019s father, have run the Georgian luge federation since.\n\nDavid Kumaritashvili, father of the Georgia luger Nodar Kumaritashvili who killed on an Olympic training run, shows a photo his son e-mailed from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. (AP)\n\nSo luge, naturally, entered Saba\u2019s life at an early age, just as it had Nodar\u2019s. His parents guided him into the sport. \u201cI think they wanted it more than me,\u201d he said. Nodar, he said, was also one of his reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cousins were 12 years apart. Saba was 9 in 2010 when Nodar did what so many other family members had dreamed of, and then what every luger fears. Saba doesn\u2019t \u201cremember much of him, only moments.\u201d But enough to have Nodar at the forefront of his mind when he posed with Olympic rings, and walked the Olympic track, and stepped into Friday\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nHis continued participation in luge made some family members apprehensive. But Saba never wavered.\n\nNodar had laid down a path. Saba followed it. Nodar was 21 when he qualified for the 2010 Olympics. Saba was 21 when he did last month, and when he completed his final run here on Sunday, with smile and a shake of his head.\n\nHe did not win a medal. He didn\u2019t come close, finishing 31st of 34 in the men\u2019s singles competition.\n\nBut he was here. He was emotional. He was proud of himself. And he was happy.\n\n\u201cVery happy,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019ve done what I needed.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2022/01/26/saba-kumaritashvili-nodar-luge-georgia-olympics/", "page_content": "Luge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2018s family business. His great-grandfather is credited with bringing the sport to their homeland, the former Soviet republic of Georgia, more than a half-century ago. His father runs the national federation, as his relatives have for decades.\n\nAt home, his family is synonymous with sliding.\n\nAt the Olympics, his family is synonymous with sadness.\n\nHe qualified for the Beijing Games with hopes of changing that.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since his cousin, Nodar Kumaritashvili, died in a training accident at the Vancouver Games, a death that still haunts the sport, especially so every four years when the Olympics roll around and the memories get rekindled. Nodar was 21 when he would have made his Olympic debut; Saba is 21 now, about to make his Olympic debut.\n\nPut simply, Saba slides for his country. For his family. And for Nodar.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d\n\nIt is that strength that got him here, even while he knows that some in his family are nervous whenever he takes the ice because of what happened to his cousin.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was killed Feb. 12, 2010, after losing control of his sled during a training run just hours before the Vancouver Games officially opened. He would have raced the next day, becoming the first in his family to compete on sliding\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHis cousin now has that chance.\n\n\u201cI am happy and proud that I have opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said. \u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nThat is what Nodar Kumaritashvili was trying to do 12 years ago.\n\nThe crash happened at 10:50 a.m. on a Friday, with most people already turning their attention to the opening ceremony taking place that night. The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph, which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2013 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. \u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2013 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2013 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance.

It will draw attention to complaints from other competitors about a facility that has stretched the boundaries of safety in what is already a dangerous sport. \"We are not crash-test dummies,'' an Australian competitor said on Thursday.\n\nYet if these are issues for the lawyers somewhere down the line, more immediate questions may be asked by the Canadians of themselves, who, in pursuit of their own Olympic dream \u2013 30 medals at least, with as many golds as possible \u2013 appear to have forgotten that national \u00adcharacteristic for which they are best known: politeness.\n\n\"Some say what defines us/is something as simple as please and thank you/and as for you're welcome/well we say that too,'' wrote Shane Kozycan in \"We Are More\", a poem he delivered during the opening ceremony.\n\nIn normal times perhaps, but in the run-up to these games, the hosts \u2013 or at least the Canadian Olympic Committee \u2013 seemed to have mislaid their manners. \"Own the podium,\" it implored its athletes in an initiative aimed at ensuring the host nation finishes at the top of the medals table at these games. Money has been poured into training, while a hard-edged approach has been adopted in dealing with other teams, most noticeably in granting them only limited access to facilities such as the sliding track.\n\nSuch behaviour is within the Olympic rules, but it came across as distinctly un-Canadian at the time, and in the context of Friday's death it seemed like a terrible misjudgment. Steven Holcomb of the US bobsleigh team said: \"This track is one of the fastest and most difficult in the world, so I think keeping it closed and not letting people have access\u2026 made it very difficult. Then you have Olympic ice, which is even faster. Little mistakes become big mistakes, and big mistakes end in tragedy.''\n\nKumaritashvili was one of those who had relatively limited experience on the track. He spent a week there in November during training, according to reports, and had gone down the track 26 times in total. He had crashed once, as had the double Olympic champion, Armin Z\u00f6ggeler of Italy.\n\n\"It would be speculation if I said the time period of practice was sufficient or was not,'' said Georgia's minister of sport Nikolos Rurua, before defending the luger against suggestions that he was inexperienced \u2013 or simply not good enough \u2013 to be competing at Olympic level. Rurua said: \"He was a very progressive, strong athlete. It was his wish to compete at the Olympics, and he underwent a rigorous qualifying process. He was 44th in world rankings.\"\n\nYet if the formalities of Olympic diplomacy required the minister to leave it at that, so sparing the feelings of the hosts, Holcomb felt no such compunction. \"They limited the amount of access and training time we had on the track, while they let Canadians train on it as much as they wanted,\" he said. \"There were smaller nations that have never been down here before. It is kind of unfair and now it is a tragedy.'' So much for the Olympic dream."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/sports/olympics/a-swift-and-fatal-luge-plunge-and-then-an-abyss-of-sorrow.html", "page_content": "BAKURIANI, Georgia \u2014 To reach this tiny skiing village, carved into the north side of the Trialeti mountain range, one must weave through a long progression of switchbacks rising more than a mile above sea level.

The video has since been yanked from Internet sites like YouTube.\n\n\"He was sliding and it looked like it was a pretty good time into his practice session and he went flying over the wall into the air and then hit a post,\" said Kriesel. \"When he hit the post he didn't really bounce off that much, he just stayed where he was and then officials came over and tended to him.\"\n\nRescue workers performed chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation less than a minute after the crash, and then quickly airlifted the luger to a trauma center in Whistler.\n\nThe head of Georgia's delegation, Irakly Japaridze, said in a press conference this afternoon that the country's team stay and compete in the Winter games despite the tragedy, according to ESPN.\n\n\"We are all in deep shock,\" Japaridze said. Kumaritashvili died just hours before the opening ceremony, which was dedicated to him and the seven remaining members of the Georgian delegation, who wore black armbands as they marched behind a black-trimmed flag.

There were also plans to lower the Olympic and Canadian flags to half staff.\n\nMore than 50,000 ticket-holders packed into the stadium for the evening extravaganza, the first Olympic opening or closing ceremony ever held indoors.\n\nLuge Track at Winter Olympics Breathtakingly Fast\n\nA joint statement from the International Olympic Committee, the Games' organizing committee VANOC and the International Luge Federation offered condolences to the luger's family.\n\n\"The whole Olympic family is struck by this tragedy, which clearly casts a shadow over these Games,\" said IOC President Jacques Rogge.\n\nAt a press conference late Friday, Rogge became emotional, taking off his glasses to wipe away his tears.\n\n\"Sorry it's a bit difficult to remain composed,\" said Rogge, adding that now is not the time to \"talk about investigations.\"\n\nSpeaking for the International Luge Federation, President Josef Fendt called the accident, \"The gravest thing that can happen in sport.\"\n\nThe statement also confirmed that there is an investigation underway into the circumstances of the accident and that training has since been suspended.\n\nEven before Kumaritashvili's tragic accident there was criticism brewing of the high speeds the luge track allows athletes to reach. There was also question as to how the unusually warm temperatures may have impacted the safety of the luge tracks.\n\nBut Gonzalez said that despite what the critics say, the higher the temperature, the easier the track is on a luger beacuse the ice is \"softer and easier to navigate.\" He added that he believes the real safety problem is the height of the wall on the side of the luge, which he says is not tall enough.\n\nMore than a dozen athletes have crashed during training runs here, including four Americans.\n\nIt was just a year ago, the International Luge Federation President said that the wooden protective devices near the track's curb are too short and that they needed to be lengthened to keep lugers from flying off the track.\n\n\"I agree one hundred percent,\" said Gonzalez about the President's comments, \"My response is, why didn't they do it?\"\n\nAn Australian athlete said late today, the track is too much. \"To what extent are we just...crash test dummies?\" asked luger Hannah Campbell-Pegg. \"I mean, this is our lives.\"\n\nSome of other lugers said that the breathtaking speed of the track surprised them when they first rode it.\n\n\"The track is super fast and I'll tell you, when I first got here it felt like a blur,\" said American luger Tony Benshoof. \"It took me about 10 or 12 runs before it started slowing down in my mind.\"\n\nBenshoof estimated that he and his fellow lugers will \"hit 100 miles per hour during the race\" which even the thrill-seeker admitted would be \"very very fast.\"\n\n\"Pretty much from the top down you've got your hands full. There's a lot of really tricky corners,\" said Benshoof.\n\nBut American luger Erin Hamlin told ABC News Radio that speed is part of the sport.\n\n\"The reason we do this sport is to go fast,\" said Hamlin. \"I think I can say that for everyone, and you've got to have the extreme factor in there sometimes.
