But Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits (more often associated with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra) took over baton duties from a self-isolating Simon Rattle, while Australian soprano Siobh\u00e1n Stagg covered for Lucy Crowe who had lost her voice. Meanwhile, Mark-Anthony Turnage, who was due to attend his premiere, was recovering from Covid. Mixed fortunes produced mixed results in an oddly proportioned programme in which the first half occupied 18-minute\u2019s worth of music. Little wonder the LSO\u2019s Manager Director Kathryn McDowell stepped onto the platform at the start to pay tribute to Haitink\u2019s six decades of music making and remind us of the great affection in which he was held by the players, and why Debussy and Mahler \u2013 his two great loves \u2013 featured in the evening.\n\nYet, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if he would ever have got excited over Debussy\u2019s Fanfare and Le sommeil de Lear which opened this concert \u2013 written as incidental music for a Parisian production of Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear in 1906 which never got beyond the two passages performed here. There was little to offer in the anonymity of its preliminary pageantry, but Lear\u2019s restless dreams subsequently generated more interest in the darker colours of muted strings and horns and two low flutes, its floating final chord deliciously unresolved.\n\nIf the power-crazed king didn\u2019t inspire Debussy to great heights, Berlioz drew on his own inner turmoil following his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s rejection to fashion a cinematic response to Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy which in Le Roi Lear burns with passion. From the glowering opening narrative, through the Allegro disperato (molten strings impressing) and the hysteria of the closing pages (brass not holding back), Karabits coaxed playing of superb vitality in a detailed and involving account. Only a gentle oboe, over a \u2018strumming\u2019 pizzicato, associated with Cordelia, and the warmth from four horns brought soothing balm to a work of operatic fervour and masterly orchestration.\n\nKirill Karabitts and the LSO (c) Mark Allan\n\nMark Anthony Turnage is another composer who is recognised for his imaginatively scored works and renowned for his integration of jazz, funk and soul. The world premiere of his new work, A Cort\u00e8ge for Bernard Haitink, brought an appropriate mellowing of his style, but no less resourceful use of his forces. Its title is not one you would have expected from someone hawking catchy names like Blood on the Floor, Drowned Out, or Barrie\u2019s Deviant Fantasy. Gone too is the abrasive manner found in his football-inspired Hammered Out. His Cort\u00e8ge pursues a single idea and explores it as far as it will go across its colourful 10-minute span. In a score of haunting beauty, we encountered vivid sonorities framing its sinuous melodic contours \u2013 the whole played with great affection.\n\nMahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony on the other hand felt harried. It\u2019s a work of extremes juxtaposing sophistication and naivety. Karabits found a point midway, downplaying charm and tenderness for garish colours (largely turning a blind eye to the work\u2019s chamber qualities) and favouring brisk tempi. Orchestral balance privileged horns and woodwind, and while there was some vernal promise in the first movement, it was an efficient, intense account, the composer\u2019s childlike visions faintly outlined.\n\nProblems with balance undermined the Scherzo, where one had to strain at times to hear the solo violin against competing forces. Mahler\u2019s devilry, however, was well served. Strings purred in the idealised Eden of the slow movement \u2013 intimate if not heart-easing \u2013 while the climax was blistering. It was left to the light silvery tone of Siobh\u00e1n Stagg to bring dignity and childlike innocence to the finale, its heavenly vision eloquently expressed in an angelic and aptly young voice that reconciled earlier tensions: paradise eventually gained.\n\nDavid Truslove\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Stagg (soprano) Kirill Karabits (conductor), London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDebussy \u2013 Fanfare and Le sommeil de Lear, Berlioz \u2013 Overture: Le Roi Lear, Turnage \u2013 A Cort\u00e8ge for Bernard Haitink, Mahler \u2013 Symphony No.4.\n\nBarbican Hall, London; Thursday 16th December 2021.\n\nABOVE: Siobh\u00e1n Stagg (soprano) and the LSO conducted by Kirill Karabits (c) Mark Allan."}, {"url": "https://seenandheard-international.com/2022/01/kirill-karabitss-mahler-is-an-encouraging-debut-with-the-london-symphony-orchestra/", "page_content": "United Kingdom Mahler: Lucy Crowe (soprano), London Symphony Orchestra / Kirill Karabits (conductor). Half Six Fix performance (8.12.2021) recorded (directed by Phil Glenny) at Barbican Hall, London, and streaming on Marquee TV from 6.1.2022. (JPr)\n\nMahler \u2013 Symphony No.4 in G major\n\nHalf Six Fix is a series of short early evening single work concerts beginning at \u2013 guess what? \u2013 six thirty! This was particularly interesting because it marked the debut of Kirill Karabits with the London Symphony Orchestra. He is Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and I have read much about him but never seen him before and it was good to see and hear him, at least, virtually. Karabits took over the baton for this concert from Sir Simon Rattle who was in Covid isolation at home in Berlin. Bernard Haitink \u2013 who had recently died in October \u2013 gave many acclaimed performances with the LSO and Mahler Four seemed to have been a favourite of his in his later years. A subsequent concert on 16 December which included this symphony in a fuller programme also premiered a short work by Mark-Anthony Turnage written as his gift to Haitink, with whom he had a significant musical relationship. (As an aside, I only had the pleasure of speaking at length to Haitink once and I recall that time even more fondly now and remain in awe that he actually knew who I was!)\n\nI suspect it is probably the fault of the symphony rather than the conductor and/or orchestra but I have previously suggested \u2013 even as co-founder of the UK\u2019s current Mahler Society \u2013 that I have found his Fourth Symphony to be often quite bland and even uninteresting. There have been notable exceptions: I remember in the distant past some totally convincing and very impressive Mahler from the BBC Symphony Orchestra under their then chief conductor, the late Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek, as well as those more recent ones from Haitink and the LSO. B\u011blohl\u00e1vek concentrated less on happiness and childlike innocence and more on \u2018Hades full of terrors\u2019 that Mahler said was there also. By contrast, with Haitink\u2019s Mahler Four the word that most came to mind was serene.\n\nThat there is a possible dichotomy of reactions to this symphony was confirmed by Karabits who in his filmed introduction said: \u2018There is no right or wrong story. Every listener has the right to create something, but to me the symphony represents contrast between the drama and emotional substance of life comparing to the possible heavenly existence of a human being or maybe another world which is different from the world we are living in.\u2019\n\nUnder Karabits the first two movements must have imbued those hearing it in the Barbican Hall with a cosy, warm feeling (I wrote Gem\u00fctlichkeit as a note about them). The first movement \u2013 marked \u2018Deliberate, not hurried \u2026 Very leisurely\u2019 \u2013 was all of that and overall it was joyful and innocent and even Mahler\u2019s \u2018mysteries and horrors\u2019 of the forest did not seem all that threatening when they intruded and \u2013 a dissonance notwithstanding \u2013 Mahler in Mozartian mood is soon re-established. This is not to belittle the complex orchestration, featuring as it does various percussion instruments including those wonderful opening sleighbells and subsequently lot of parts for the wind instruments who continued to make strong contributions throughout the symphony.\n\nIt is invidious to single anyone out as the LSO is so virtuosic, but it was impossible not be impressed by \u2013 amongst others \u2013 Julian Koch (oboe), Chris Richards (clarinet), Amy Yule (flute), Rachel Gough (bassoon), and elsewhere James Fountain (trumpet) and violinists Janice Graham and Sergey Ostrovsky (leader). It shouldn\u2019t need to be commented on but how refreshing it is to see so many talented women in the LSO after the dismal ten allowed on the platform surrounded by all the men of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra at the recent New Year\u2019s Day concert.\n\nThat second movement (\u2018At a leisurely pace. without haste\u2019) is a scherzo with two trios. The horn has introduced a short and more reflective motif answered by solo violin, before leading to a very lyrical passage. For me, there should be more tension right from the start and notably Ostrovsky\u2019s retuned violin created few chills. (I must admit I was listening to this through loudspeakers and it could have sounded differently in the Barbican Hall.). So, the world of \u2018Freund Hein spielt auf\u2019 \u2013 the pied piper whose beguiling fiddle playing leads the unwary to the land of \u2018Beyond\u2019 \u2013 seemed very far away. At times it did indeed sound like a slow(er) movement but with its sudden changes in tempo and dynamics, together with an abrupt ending, we are reminded that it is indeed a scherzo.\n\nThe third movement, which is the actual slow movement of the symphony (marked \u2018Restful\u2019) was beautiful and suitably elegiac. The theme started in the eight double basses at the rear and then spread through the entire orchestra, creating an appositely consolatory atmosphere. Mahler considered that this movement was inspired by \u2018a vision of a tombstone on which was carved an image of the departed, with folded arms, in eternal sleep\u2019. Themes looked forward and back and there developed a brooding threnody almost lulling us to sleep which involved xylophone, brass chorale and timpani solo before \u2013 with a sudden outburst of E major (this movement is in G major) \u2013 we arrive in Paradise, or at least a child\u2019s idea of it. The music then dies away to anticipate the novel way the symphony ends.\n\nThe last movement features a soprano part, inspired by Mahler\u2019s obsession with the Des Knaben Wunderhorn collection of poems; here he uses one he composed before (Das himmlische Leben) about the \u2018joys\u2019 of heaven. However, if we again look behind the mirror this apparently includes much slaughter, as well as the attractive \u2013 to some fanatics \u2013 prospect of \u2018eleven thousand virgins\u2019. The music is uncomplicated; the bells from the opening movement are heard again, there\u2019s an evocative tolling harp, before at the very end a quiet, orchestral postlude fades away because \u2013 for Mahler \u2013 heavenly bliss appears something that is not attainable. As elsewhere, the musicians of the LSO responded magnificently to Karabits\u2019s encouragement and I should have acknowledged earlier some wonderful string sounds which, as here, floated and shimmered gloriously.\n\nLucy Crowe sang with the wide-eyed expression of a child reacting to something wonderful. Mahler asks for this movement \u2018To be sung in a happy childlike manner: absolutely without parody!\u2019 but Crowe\u2019s words were rather indistinct and her well-rounded soprano sounded simply too mature. (Again, she may have been better if heard live, although it must be noted that by the time of the second Barbican performance she had lost her voice and was replaced by another singer.)\n\nJim Pritchard"}, {"url": "https://www.askonasholt.com/kirill-karabits-debuts-with-london-symphony-orchestra/", "page_content": "Tonight marks Kirill Karabits\u2019 debut with the London Symphony Orchestra in the first of four nights at the Barbican.

But as individuals go, has there ever been a greater influencer on the material that artists choose to work with than Shakespeare? When it comes to King Lear, however, one of the blackest things the Bard ever wrote, something approaching a curse seems to have been involved. Verdi struggled for forty years with a libretto and was in despair at the scale of the challenge. Debussy, tasked with creating incidental music for the play, found his inspiration thwarted by the demands of a penny-pinching impresario. What remains in his case are two short movements taking up no more than five minutes.\n\nKirill Karabits \u00a9 Mark Allan | LSO/Barbican\n\nIn this concert dedicated to the memory of Bernard Haitink, Kirill Karabits and the London Symphony Orchestra gave a festive edge to proceedings in the opening Fanfare, conjuring up scenes of a medieval feasting-hall, while in Le Sommeil de Lear the muted horns suggested an unruly sleep, even as the sounds ebbed away into silence.\n\nAll the sections of the LSO were on fine form in Berlioz\u2019 Le Roi Lear, which is more of a tone poem than an overture. In its fragmented episodes and wrenching dissonances this music breathes inner turmoil. Here a degree of self-identification between composer and tragic king is inescapable: whilst reading the Shakespearean work in 1831 Berlioz was in the midst of rejection by his fianc\u00e9e Camille Moke. Karabits brought out all the angriness in the frequent blasts from the brass (a tuba replacing the original ophicleide), the heightened emotions in the agitated writing for the strings, and gave the affecting oboe solos traditionally associated with Lear\u2019s misaligned daughter Cordelia time to breathe. In the richness and extroversion of the orchestration I heard more than a few pre-echoes of Verdi\u2019s Falstaff: Berlioz too was an influencer on composers who followed.\n\nKirill Karabits conducts the LSO \u00a9 Mark Allan | LSO/Barbican\n\nThere were echoes of a different kind in Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s A Cort\u00e8ge for Bernard Haitink which opened the second half: the economy of the material recalled the Second Viennese School, the transparency of textures Debussy and the calm unruffled air the master-conductor himself.\n\nMahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony is frequently regarded as his sunniest work. That clearly is the way Karabits sees it, though in any final analysis such an approach risks making it appear far too one-dimensional. The opening was startlingly brisk (the composer\u2019s instruction is not to hurry), primary colours to the fore, a jaunty ride in an open-decked sports car, eyes firmly ahead. As a consequence I found myself seriously short-changed. Though the playing was never less than technically secure, I missed any deeper engagement with the emotional undercurrents: no heartache in the strings, no heart-stopping moments when individual instrumental lines coalesce and the music becomes magically airborne. Mahler didn\u2019t only paint bucolic scenes.\n\nSiobhan Stagg \u00a9 Mark Allan | LSO/Barbican\n\nSkittishness had the upper hand in the second movement, in which the leader, given a scordatura notation for the second instrument, would normally have an opportunity to shine. Instead, Karabits gave repeated prominence to the solo horn, as was the case in the slow movement, where seamlessness and the radiance which then emerges from it were found wanting.\n\nIf the Finale brought amends, this was largely down to the young Australian soprano, Siobhan Stagg, replacing an indisposed Lucy Crowe. Her voice, though not large, had all the characteristics that matter in this child\u2019s view of paradise. Silvery-toned and with a wide-eyed innocence of expression, even of pitch and celestial in quality, her rendering of the Wunderhorn text called to mind those celebrated Meissen porcelain figurines: exquisite detailing and a perfect glaze.\n\n***11"}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/london-symphony-orchestra-kirill-karabits-review-mahler-wins-out-against-covid-cancellations-556q7bwxx", "page_content": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nSimon Rattle, the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s maestro, was in isolation at home in Berlin; composer Mark-Anthony Turnage was recovering from Covid; soprano Lucy Crowe had lost her voice.

It\u2019s repertoire that has featured regularly in his Bournemouth programmes throughout his tenure, and he included a sample of it in his guest appearance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

It\u2019s a noisy, bellicose piece, whose stylistic roots seem to stretch back into the 19th century as far as Mussorgsky. Violence and menace haunt all four movements, epitomised by a ubiquitous three-note motif, but even the big tune that emerges in the finale does not provide the catharsis and resolution that the title seems to demand. Nevertheless it was the finale that drew criticism from the Soviet authorities; Lyatoshinsky was accused of \u201cbourgeois pacificism\u201d and pressurised into revising it in 1954, so that the symphony\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d premiere did not take place until the following year, though Karabits opted to perform the original version.\n\nCertainly the BBCSO played it magnificently for him, letting as much light and air into the congested textures as possible, and their performance was greeted with great enthusiasm.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities.

Energised by conductor Kirill Karabits, the symphony hurtled along at speeds that might have made a professional orchestra hang on to their music stands. Nothing daunted, the NYO responded with tremendous verve and an all-for-one unanimity that made for a gripping performance.

Originally written for percussion ensemble, Dior added winds, brass and harps for this performance, tossed off with exhilarating precision by Kirill Karabits\u2019s forces.\u201d\n\n**** Geoff Brown, The Times, 7 January 2019\n\n\u201cTrust the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain to throw down a musical gauntlet to its professional peers like a New Year Resolution writ large. In this intriguingly programmed and invigoratingly performed concert, with Kirill Karabits, the 164 players gave the best possible musical start to 2019: a blast of orchestral excellence\u2026\n\n[In John Adam\u2019s Doctor Atomic Symphony] \u2018The Laboratory\u2019: a mechanistic soundscape that quickly settles into surging string figures of \u2018Panic\u2019, notable for its stand-out (in that principal Lawrence Schofield stood up for it) trombone solo \u2013 replicating the vocal part for General Leslie Groves \u2013 before finally quietening for trumpeter Holly Clark\u2019s adoption of Oppenheimer\u2019s aria, from John Donne\u2019s \u2018Batter my heart, three-person\u2019d God\u2019. It was good to hear this music again \u2013 especially as convincingly masterminded by Karabits \u2013 after better acquaintance with the opera itself.\n\nFollowing the interval, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony sounded noble and organic. Karabits kept things moving, particularly in the slow movement. The Scherzo was notably fleet-of-foot and the Trio \u2013 with its aching oboe opening \u2013 never cloying. The transition to the Finale was effortlessly natural and the repeated scalic surges, for once, didn\u2019t outstay their welcome.

But Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits (more often associated with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra) took over baton duties from a self-isolating Simon Rattle, while Australian soprano Siobh\u00e1n Stagg covered for Lucy Crowe who had lost her voice. Meanwhile, Mark-Anthony Turnage, who was due to attend his premiere, was recovering from Covid. Mixed fortunes produced mixed results in an oddly proportioned programme in which the first half occupied 18-minute\u2019s worth of music. Little wonder the LSO\u2019s Manager Director Kathryn McDowell stepped onto the platform at the start to pay tribute to Haitink\u2019s six decades of music making and remind us of the great affection in which he was held by the players, and why Debussy and Mahler \u2013 his two great loves \u2013 featured in the evening.\n\nYet, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if he would ever have got excited over Debussy\u2019s Fanfare and Le sommeil de Lear which opened this concert \u2013 written as incidental music for a Parisian production of Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear in 1906 which never got beyond the two passages performed here. There was little to offer in the anonymity of its preliminary pageantry, but Lear\u2019s restless dreams subsequently generated more interest in the darker colours of muted strings and horns and two low flutes, its floating final chord deliciously unresolved.\n\nIf the power-crazed king didn\u2019t inspire Debussy to great heights, Berlioz drew on his own inner turmoil following his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s rejection to fashion a cinematic response to Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy which in Le Roi Lear burns with passion. From the glowering opening narrative, through the Allegro disperato (molten strings impressing) and the hysteria of the closing pages (brass not holding back), Karabits coaxed playing of superb vitality in a detailed and involving account. Only a gentle oboe, over a \u2018strumming\u2019 pizzicato, associated with Cordelia, and the warmth from four horns brought soothing balm to a work of operatic fervour and masterly orchestration.\n\nKirill Karabitts and the LSO (c) Mark Allan\n\nMark Anthony Turnage is another composer who is recognised for his imaginatively scored works and renowned for his integration of jazz, funk and soul. The world premiere of his new work, A Cort\u00e8ge for Bernard Haitink, brought an appropriate mellowing of his style, but no less resourceful use of his forces. Its title is not one you would have expected from someone hawking catchy names like Blood on the Floor, Drowned Out, or Barrie\u2019s Deviant Fantasy. Gone too is the abrasive manner found in his football-inspired Hammered Out. His Cort\u00e8ge pursues a single idea and explores it as far as it will go across its colourful 10-minute span. In a score of haunting beauty, we encountered vivid sonorities framing its sinuous melodic contours \u2013 the whole played with great affection.\n\nMahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony on the other hand felt harried. It\u2019s a work of extremes juxtaposing sophistication and naivety. Karabits found a point midway, downplaying charm and tenderness for garish colours (largely turning a blind eye to the work\u2019s chamber qualities) and favouring brisk tempi. Orchestral balance privileged horns and woodwind, and while there was some vernal promise in the first movement, it was an efficient, intense account, the composer\u2019s childlike visions faintly outlined.\n\nProblems with balance undermined the Scherzo, where one had to strain at times to hear the solo violin against competing forces. Mahler\u2019s devilry, however, was well served. Strings purred in the idealised Eden of the slow movement \u2013 intimate if not heart-easing \u2013 while the climax was blistering. It was left to the light silvery tone of Siobh\u00e1n Stagg to bring dignity and childlike innocence to the finale, its heavenly vision eloquently expressed in an angelic and aptly young voice that reconciled earlier tensions: paradise eventually gained.\n\nDavid Truslove\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Stagg (soprano) Kirill Karabits (conductor), London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDebussy \u2013 Fanfare and Le sommeil de Lear, Berlioz \u2013 Overture: Le Roi Lear, Turnage \u2013 A Cort\u00e8ge for Bernard Haitink, Mahler \u2013 Symphony No.4.\n\nBarbican Hall, London; Thursday 16th December 2021.\n\nABOVE: Siobh\u00e1n Stagg (soprano) and the LSO conducted by Kirill Karabits (c) Mark Allan."}, {"url": "https://www.operaandballet.com/people/Kirill_Karabitz/?play_date_from=01-May-2023&play_date_to=31-May-2023", "page_content": "Named as Conductor of the Year at the 2013 Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards, Kirill Karabits studied conducting and composition at the Lysenko Music School and continued his studies at the National Tchaikovsky Music Academy and Vienna Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik.\n\nSince 2008 Kirill Karabits has held the position of Chief Conductor of Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.

That vote failed, but on June 22 the self-governed Philharmonic suddenly announced Kirill Petrenko as its new chief conductor designate, to replace Simon Rattle in 2018.\n\nThe 43-year-old, Siberian-born Petrenko is not a marquee name and was absent from many short lists of potential Berlin candidates. He has pursued his career relatively quietly, earning praise for conducting Wagner at Bayreuth and for his work at the Bavarian State Opera, which he has directed since 2013. He made his Berlin Philharmonic debut in 2006 and has conducted the orchestra on two more occasions.\n\nSince Petrenko is little-known (not to be confused with Royal Liverpool Philharmonic conductor Vasily Petrenko \u2014 no relation) and not yet giving interviews, I called Berlin Philharmonic horn player Sarah Willis to give us an insider's perspective on why the choice is a good fit for the orchestra. Willis has played with the Philharmonic since 2001.\n\nTom Huizenga: Some classical music fans, especially Americans, might say that they know very little about Kirill Petrenko. He's not really a big name conductor, so when the Berlin Philharmonic chose him as its next chief conductor, it might have been something of a surprise.\n\nSarah Willis: I think it seems to have been a surprise for a lot of people. On the other hand, for the people, especially in Europe, Kirill Petrenko is sort of a well-kept secret. Everything he does really turns to gold. He's so respected in the profession, but he's someone that doesn't do many interviews. He hasn't got a high media profile. So, yes, I expect that many people found that a very unusual choice, those who hadn't heard of him before, but I assure you, you will be hearing a lot about him.\n\nWas he on your or the other Berlin Philharmonic players' radar for a while?\n\nHe's been on our radar for a while. The first time I played with him was in 2009 and also that's when I got to meet him by interviewing him for the [Berlin Philharmonic's] Digital Concert Hall. I remember having to persuade him to do that one \u2014 I went in and practically begged and said, \"Please, maestro, please! I'll be very nice, I'll be very gentle.\" And he said \"Okay, well, only if Lars Vogt comes along as well.\" So we did the interview, all three of us, and it was great. But I remember asking him in that interview how he felt, and I remember him saying he was very shy standing there for the first time. But also I remember very strongly the feeling of seeing him right at the beginning of the rehearsal and just knowing that there's something very special. Most of my colleagues were all feeling the same thing. What usually happens when a new conductor comes is we all talk amongst ourselves during the coffee breaks about whether we're going to invite him back. But with Maestro Petrenko, it was like, \"When are you coming back?\" It was really love at first sight. We really appreciated what he was doing.\n\nHad you heard him conduct before he guest conducted the Berlin Philharmonic?\n\nI had, yes, because he was at [Berlin's] Komische Oper before, so he was known to Berliners. He had done some great productions at the Komische Oper, so I'd heard some of those things before.\n\nWas he always a leading candidate for the job?\n\nAll I can say is that we were obviously spoiled for choice. There are so many great conductors out there at the moment and everybody had their own favorite and everybody knew who they would like. It just was a question of finding out where the camps lay. And Kirill Petrenko's name came up and obviously people had been giving it a lot of thought. And he got the job, so obviously that shows there was a lot of support for him.\n\nThere's this interview that you did with Petrenko, that you talked about, and you tell him that the orchestra couldn't wait to invite him back. The musicians were smiling in rehearsals and your face, in the video, is just beaming with delight. Why all this joy over Petrenko?\n\nFor me, it was like playing chamber music with someone for the first time, and you just know it's going to work. And that's one of the most wonderful things about music, is that you can play with great musicians and it works well, but you have to work on little corners and the little things. But then comes along a musician where you just feel like he's speaking your language and it just clicks. That is really the feeling I had with Petrenko on the very first day he was there. I understood what he wanted. I appreciated the way he showed it.\n\nIn the concerts, if you look at the end of the Scriabin video \u2014 Le Po\u00e8me de l'extase \u2014 you will know exactly what I'm talking about. This guy gives his absolute all in concerts and my heart just burst. I knew it at the very beginning that this was something very special. He hasn't been there very often so we are taking, of course, a little bit of a chance. He's not a pop star, he's not someone who's been around for a long time. It's all about the music with him.\n\nYouTube\n\nSome of the things you just mentioned \u2014 this special feeling of music making \u2014 are important, but why do you think he's going to make a particularly good fit with the Berlin Philharmonic?\n\nI think he's going to bring all of his passion to our orchestra, which is a great thing. I think he's going to bring a lot of forward thinking to the orchestra. He's also going to bring a lot of discipline \u2014 the guy works all day. I never knew him to finish a rehearsal a second earlier than was planned. You know how orchestra musicians love to be let off five minutes early \u2014 that never happened with him. And he really takes it to different levels, and I think his ability to do that is going to be a great thing for us.\n\nYou talked a little bit about it already, but how do you know when a conductor is hitting it off good an orchestra? Is it like dating? Do you get some kind of undefinable giddy feeling, like there are these vibes?\n\nI like that comparison, that it's like dating. I can't really speak for myself because we're 128 musicians and everyone has their own very strong opinions in my orchestra. But, as you can see, we voted him in, so obviously the majority were feeling like I did. I think it is a little bit like dating and, like I said, with chamber music. You just sense right at the beginning if this is going to work, and it did. It's a great feeling when that happens. It doesn't always happen in music like that. You can meet someone, play for someone, who you think, \"Yeah, that's okay.\" Then they work very well but in the concert it's sort of maybe not quite as inspiring as you'd hope \u2014 or someone who doesn't work very well but then comes alive in concert. But with Petrenko, I had the feeling that it was really both. It worked really well, and the concerts were electrifying.\n\nIn a video interview that you gave for Deutsche Welle about Petrenko you say, \"He doesn't do much, but what he does do is perfect.\"\n\nYeah. He's not a showman. Petrenko doesn't think about whether this gesture will look good. At least, that's not the feeling I get. What he does just works. It's a question of body language and I think anyone who watches any videos of his will see what I'm talking about. The problem is there isn't much of him out there because he hasn't been the biggest media person up until now. I think he's very aware that that's all going to change, especially with the Digital Concert Hall and all the touring that we're going to be doing. As I say, we don't know him all that well yet, so I think it was a big surprise to us all that a lot of us felt like that.\n\nDo you get any sense of what his personality is like?\n\nI only met him personally for this [Digital Concert Hall] interview. Otherwise I was just in the orchestra. I found him very shy, very humble, but incredibly genuine. I found it very touching that he could be like that and be such a big maestro.\n\nWhat's his podium demeanor like? Is he easy to follow?\n\nHe's very easy to follow. But I've only played two or three concerts with him, so it's a little hard to say. I've watched some things he's done and in Bayreauth \u2014 they're all raving about him. He's very polite but knows exactly what he wants and he can explain that in very few words. He's not one of those conductors who will talk for hours so people stop listening. He really says what he needs very concisely and he doesn't have to say too much because he can show it. We like conductors like that.\n\nWell, it helps that he's conducting an orchestra like the Berlin Philharmonic ...\n\nYeah, but sometimes it's hard to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. Because the Berlin Philharmonic obviously has its own ideas of how a piece should be and if they feel like it, they can play a piece how they want. Obviously we make an effort to see what the conductor wants, but it's quite easy for us to play a piece the way we know it. It's important that a conductor comes in and then brings his version to it and also keeps us on the straight and narrow.\n\nI know that back when Simon Rattle was first appointed as the chief conductor, he told us here at NPR that conducting the Berlin Philharmonic was like conducting 128 Laurence Oliviers. All these superstars.\n\n[Laughs] I remember Simon at the beginning conducting a Bruckner symphony and he stopped, and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, it sounds absolutely amazing. And it's nothing at all like what I'm conducting.\" Another time, in a Mahler symphony, he tried to conduct a little rubato bit, and he stopped and said, \"I'm sorry, but you're playing for Claudio [Abbado].\" And we really were! We were playing the piece that way Claudio used to conduct it and Simon wanted to do something different.\n\nYouTube\n\nYou mentioned that you are looking forward to some changes that Petrenko could make as the next conductor. Any ideas about what changes he might make?\n\nI'm not sure whether I meant changes changes, because I don't know enough about him to know exactly what he will want to change, but obviously every new conductor will want to bring his own ideas into the orchestra. Petrenko, the way I can judge his character now, I think he's going to come in very respectfully. I don't think he's going to bring a thousand changes with him. He's going to come and see what it's all about and maybe introduce a few things. But I really don't know him well enough to say what they will be.\n\nWe just talked about the orchestra playing things how they want to ...\n\nI'm not saying that we play how we want to \u2014 we can play pieces how we know them. But that's why we appreciate it when conductors come and really show off what they want, because it's very easy to play how you know. I'm not saying we do it on purpose. That would be mean.\n\nHow would any conductor work with changing the sound of an orchestra like the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nI don't know many conductors that want to change the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic. I think that's what they enjoy. The Berlin Philharmonic has such a unique sound. This huge string body, which is just incredible. I've never heard a string sound like it \u2014 you can bathe in it. I don't think a conductor comes in with the intention to change it. They come in with the intention of making the best job with what they have and bringing their ideas into that. I've rarely found that someone wants to change the sound. Except when the brass are loud, but that's normal. Brass are always too loud.\n\n[Laughs] Well, what happens in the orchestra when a conductor wants things that maybe some of the players in the orchestra don't want? I'm sure not everyone was in love with every interpretation Rattle has made over the years.\n\nOf course, but that's normal. An orchestra is like a family. We spend most of our time together. When the head of the family wants something, some of the family will think it's great and the rest of the family may not think it's great from time to time, but it's the head of the family, so that's what happens.\n\nSo, a virtuoso orchestra like the Berlin Philharmonic ... can you be challenged these days? Is there anything that can mess with your heads musically?\n\nSure. We definitely have our challenges. For example, we just played an evening of film music in the Waldb\u00fchne, our open air concert, for the end of the season. I remember Simon telling us the week before, he said, \"Guys, get the music, you can't sight read this.\" And there were a few huffs, but he was absolutely right. We don't sight read very much in our orchestra. Our first rehearsals tend to be interesting. But what I admire so much about this orchestra is that the second rehearsal is always amazing, so much better.\n\nFor film music, it's stuff that you Americans can just play in your sleep \u2014 Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., all this wonderful John Williams stuff, Ben Hur, Robin Hood. You guys know all this, but we were lost! It took time and he was absolutely right. Everybody had to take away their parts and practice like crazy.\n\nSimon has brought amazing, fantastic modern pieces to us over the last 15 years, and that was something the orchestra hadn't done so much of before. And that was also a challenge but now it's sort of routine, that he brings these weird and wonderful pieces to us. Some of them I love, some of them I don't, but I'm just really happy that I've gotten to know so much. We had another challenge with Porgy and Bess, which is something you Americans can play in your sleep. For us, it was not so easy to do the \"swing.\"\n\nI'm so glad that Simon Rattle has been such a champion of Thomas Ad\u00e8s, because I really love his music. I wonder if you have any notion of what Petrenko, repertoire-wise, might bring to the orchestra at this point.\n\nI don't have any notion, to be perfectly honest. I played two Russian programs with him and then he did an Elgar symphony. He hasn't done that much Beethoven or Bruckner in his life, I don't think, so that will be really interesting to see his interpretations of these. I'm sure he'll be bringing the bread and butter, but I can imagine he'll be someone who will bring some new stuff. Also, what I'm really looking forward to is playing operas with him. He's going to be fantastic in the pit. They adore him at Bayreuth and I think he's going to be a wonderful addition for our opera repertoire.\n\nYouTube\n\nDo you think he might do what Alan Gilbert does in New York and bring some concert versions of opera to the Philharmonic?\n\nI would absolute adore that if he did, and I think it would be a wonderful thing for us. What Alan did with Sweeney Todd, for example, that was just unforgettable. That was such a wonderful thing. So, yes, please! Maestro Petrenko, bring us some concertante operas and musicals!\n\nYou say he might bring some Germanic bread and butter to the repertoire. And that got me thinking about the orchestra itself, so revered in the German repertoire \u2014 but how many musicians in the Berlin Philharmonic these days are actually German? Isn't it a truly global orchestra at this point?\n\nWe've turned into a truly global orchestra. I think we're still over half Germans, but only just. If you look only at our horn section, we have three Germans, a Scot, a Brit, a Slovenian. So yeah, we're very international. That's just the horn section alone. I love it. We always take people who play with a big, German sound. I'm English, but apparently I play with a big, German sound.\n\nAre there some pieces that you would like to play with Petrenko once he gets on board?\n\nI think with Petrenko it's going to be very interesting to see what he's going to bring. I couldn't say what I want to play. I am so grateful to Simon Rattle for all the pieces I've learned under his baton. He's brought things to the Berlin Phil that I wouldn't never have dreamed playing otherwise, for example Porgy and Bess and Thomas Ad\u00e8s, who I just adore \u2014 I studied with him, he was in my general musicianship class in college. Simon has just brought incredible repertoire \u2014 so much Jan\u00e1\u010dek and then Rameau. Which conductor offers such a wide palette of music? I don't think Petrenko's going to come with such a wide palette at the beginning. I think he's going to bring what he feels comfortable with and bring things that are very important to him. And until we see what he's bringing, he might totally surprise us. Who knows.\n\nIt's going to be an adventure, that's for sure.\n\nI think the Berlin Phil has sent out a really good signal into the music world. We've chosen to take a chief conductor who is not very showy, but he's all about the music, and he's also a bit unknown. It's an adventure for us \u2014 we're not quite sure what's going to come either, but we're all really looking forward to it. I must say, though, on a personal note, I still can't imagine the Berlin Phil without Sir Simon. It's going to be a very sad day when he leaves. I'll miss his humor more than anything \u2014 it's so great to have British humor in the orchestra.\n\nOkay, final question: Single best thing about Petrenko?\n\nThe single best thing up until now \u2014 because I don't know him that well \u2014 I would say is his passion for the music. It is so evident in everything he does, whether it is in the rehearsal or in the concert, his absolute, all-consuming passion for the music. It is very moving and very inspiring.\n\nYou can see that in the video clips, especially the Scriabin.\n\nI was very proud of my orchestra for posting that, because that actually says it all.\n\nThe music is so great itself, and then it's so well-played, and you see him kind of losing himself in it, with all this joy and ecstasy.\n\nBut also conductors can lose themselves and go into ecstatic places, but then they also lose their conducting, so you don't really know what's going on.\n\nSo true.\n\nThis is a well-known problem. I'm all for conductors giving their all and losing themselves, but we still need to have a beat. If you look at the Scriabin Le Po\u00e8me de l'extase video, you can tell Petrenko is totally into the music but we still know what's going on."}, {"url": "https://bsolive.com/people/kirill-karabits/", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Kirill Karabits fixes me with a characteristically deep stare and says, in his Ukrainian-hued English, \"You have to be careful with the music, or everything will fall apart. People get nervous with premieres and that gets in the way of the score.\" He's talking about his cast for Don Giovanni, but surely Karabits should be thinking about his own first-night wobbles.\n\nHaving been hyped to within an inch of his life when he started as music director at the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra last year \u2013 described variously as \"thrilling\", \"a star\" with \"rare ability\" \u2013 Karabits has eager London critics waiting to see how he handles the pressure of conducting one of the best-known works of the operatic stage: Mozart's Don Giovanni, opening this weekend at the Coliseum. But Karabits \u2013 lithe, young, with a magnetic gaze \u2013 believes in keeping your cool, of getting on with the task in hand. His attitude towards Mozart's score is one of deep reverence: \"It's like opening up a magical box that keeps revealing hidden drawers,\" he says. \"Every time you think you understand it, something else pops open and you realise there's more to the music than you ever thought possible.\"\n\nThat desire to best serve the music drives Karabits. It's not about commercial success, or the thrill of control and power that comes with being a conductor; it's about making room for something special to happen. \"If you can provoke things, push them to an interesting place, then that's great,\" he says. \"I'll go as far as I can. If I'm not pushing things I have a feeling that I'm wasting my time. I start to question everything: am I just doing this for the critics? For the money? For my agent?\"\n\nKarabits's dedication and focus is typical of the latest generation of super-talented conductors (many of them eastern European) working in major British orchestras. With Vasily Petrenko in Liverpool, Vladimir Jurowski in London and Andris Nelsons in Birmingham, it feels like a veritable invasion. Do they keep an eye on each other's careers? \"No, it's not competitive at all. I don't even know any of those guys personally.\" Although, he does concede, \"Maybe now and then I check for who's playing where.\"\n\nKarabits has quickly made a musical home for himself on the south coast in Poole, the home of the Bournemouth Symphony: he loves the players and they adore him right back. How did he end up there? \"I have to admit, when they first called and invited me to do Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony I had never heard of Bournemouth \u2013 I'd never even been to the UK before. I came on the train through all these little villages more and more away from London, and thought, what am I doing? Then, a surprise: I met this orchestra full of open-minded people. After two concerts, they voted for me to be music director. When I told Valery Gergiev, he said: 'Bournemouth? Where is that?' And he has conducted there! But all the players had said, 'We want this guy,' so how could I say no? I was very touched. I felt I could do something interesting here.\"\n\nHis was an unlikely journey into conducting. As a teenager in 1980s Kiev, he listened obsessively to Abba songs \u2013 \"a thousand times over on an old tape\". He loved something in their structure and shape, in the very sound. He moved on to Shostakovich (far from a logical step) and couldn't stop listening to the 11th Symphony with its blaring crazy fugue.\n\nKarabits comes from a musical family \u2013 his father was a composer \u2013 but the young boy's initial musical training, studying the piano, was not a happy experience.\"I hated those exams where you had to go on stage and play. I couldn't do it because it was a question of being perfect. When you ask me to do that I lose it, I start shaking,\" he says. \"But when you say to me, 'Think, improvise; do what you want,' then I'll do something nice,\" he grins. It was only when he picked up a baton, aged 13, that he found what he was looking for. His debut concert, at 19, included music by Schoenberg and Stravinsky.\n\nHis current invitation at ENO is bound to open doors, but for Karabits it's a mixed blessing: \"You start to think about why people book you. Because you've done a London opera debut? Or do people really like what you're doing? But I don't worry about the critics. If they hate you, maybe they have a point and you go away and work on things, or you disagree and say, 'I don't care; I thought what I did was good.'\"\n\nKarabits laughs a lot for someone who's so serious about what he does. He's about as far from the testosterone-fuelled, monomaniac conductors of yesteryear as it's possible to be. \"As a music director, do you choose to impose your will on people, or do you try to get the maximum you can out of everybody? I don't believe in shouting. It may be nice for you because you feel important, but behind your back everyone says you're an asshole. Can you make people give their best in that situation? I don't think so.\"\n\nFor now, the calls keep coming and his diary is full until 2014. What would he do, though, if it all ended tomorrow? Without a moment's hesitation he tells me: \"Fishing. I've been doing it since I was eight, always alone, out on the lakes in Kiev. There was a shop close to our house and I used to spend all my time there, looking at the fishing gear, collecting money to buy things.\" Let's hope he doesn't pack in the day job and head for that lakeside idyll just yet. Kirill Karabits may well turn out to be as big as everyone says he's going to be.\n\nDon Giovanni opens at ENO, London on 6 November, and is in rep until 3 December.

Future dates in the United States include concerts with the Minnesota, Washington and Indianapolis symphonies and a re-invitation to Houston Symphony in the 2010/11 season\n\nIn Europe, other highlights of this season have included debuts with Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI Turin (with Renaud Capu\u00e7on), SWR-Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden/Freiburg (with Janine Jansen), plus return visits to Luzerner Sinfonie Orchester and Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine (again with Capu\u00e7on). Next season he will debut with Basel Symphony, Iceland Symphony, Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, Danish National Symphony and Tokyo Symphony, as well as appearing at the Kissinger Sommer Festival with Bamberger Symphoniker. Following a successful debut with them last season, Karabits will also return to the Philharmonia in May 2010, alongside Gil Shaham.\n\nAn established opera conductor, Karabits opened Op\u00e9ra National du Rhin\u2019s 2008/9 season with Un Ballo in Maschera, and conducted a production of Pique Dame in January 2009 with Luxembourg Philharmonic and singers from Latvian National Opera.

His research has also led to the modern premiere of Telemann's unknown (and probably earliest existing opera) Pastorelle en Musique.

Johnson\n\nKirill Karabits conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in music of Prokofiev, Mendelssohn and Lutoslawski Thursday night. Photo: Anne Ryan)\n\nIt\u2019s not often that one encounters two artist debuts in a single Chicago Symphony Orchestra subscription concert. Nearly as rare are premieres of works by composers as frequently programmed as Mendelssohn and Prokofiev.\n\nYet such was the case Thursday night at Symphony Center where conductor Kirill Karabits made an impressive podium debut leading the CSO in a nicely varied program that avoided the usual repertorial suspects.\n\nIn what is becoming an unsettling trend at Orchestra Hall this season, turnout was again decidedly light. It seems like the most interesting programs presented by the CSO are drawing the smallest audiences, even with mostly familiar composer names on the menu.\n\nThe principal work of the evening was Witold Lutoslawski\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra.\n\nCompleted in 1954, the work is clearly modeled on Bela Bartok\u2019s mainstay of the same name, albeit often in less obvious ways. The work was written in the Polish composer\u2019s early, more nationalist style, wherein a traditional folk-based idiom was less likely to arouse official disapproval from the communist cultural commissars. (Lutoslawski\u2019s Symphony No. 3, commissioned by the CSO and given its world premiere under Georg Solti in 1983, reflects the composer\u2019s more improvisatory late style.)\n\nThe Concerto for Orchestra is not an outright crowd-pleaser like Bartok\u2019s concerto\u2014less indelible in its themes and offering fewer overt showy opportunities for front-desk players than its title suggests.\n\nYet Lutoslawski\u2019s work is surely crafted, substantial and compelling, a tough, spiky piece that can make strong impact with the right musicians. Such was the case Thursday night with the outstanding performance delivered by the CSO under Karabits\u2019 baton.\n\nThe opening movement can appear discursive\u2014as it does in Daniel Barenboim\u2019s uneven CSO recording\u2014but Karabits\u2019 firmly focused direction kept a strong sense of momentum. The various episodes were charted skillfully\u2014notable solo flute work by Stefan Ragnar Hoskuldsson\u2014and the Ukrainian conductor put across the score\u2019s punchy, mercurial brilliance with notably uninhibited climaxes.\n\nThe restless \u201cnight music\u201d movement is a far cry from Bartok\u2019s hushed nocturnal inspirations, here more one of quietly frenzied activity. Led by new principal Esteban Batallan, the trumpet section sounded unleashed in the Arioso section, pealing forth with flamboyant abandon.\n\nThe concerto concludes in a vast Passacaglia, longer than the first two movements combined. The theme was stated with forthright clarity in string pizzicatos, the ensuing closely knit 15 variations, unfolding with seamless logic under Karabits\u2019 direction.\n\nThe conductor underlined the folk-influence throughout, as with the woodwinds\u2019 chorale theme. There was fine airy delicacy in the high string writing and contrasting pages, Karabits ratcheting up the score\u2019s angular brilliance in a thrilling dash to the coda. Concertmaster Robert Chen and Jay Friedman and his trombone colleagues were among the standout contributors to this rousing, virtuosic performance.\n\nMozart is regarded as the great child genius of music but Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn was a prodigy on the same exalted level. Perhaps even greater, since the two masterpieces of his teen years\u2014the string Octet and Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream Overture are even more polished and individual in personality than Mozart\u2019s works written at the same age. Mendelssohn was enormously productive in his short life as composer and conductor before his early death at age 38.\n\nLess known today is Mendelssohn\u2019s equal acclaim in his lifetime as a blazingly virtuosic pianist. In an era of Chopin and rock-star keyboard artists, no less than Clara Schumann wrote \u201cWhen all is said and done, he remains the dearest pianist of all.\u201d\n\nMendelssohn write two showpiece concertos for himself to perform and his bona fides as a soloist are dauntingly manifest in his Piano Concerto No. 1, where the soloist is off to the races from the opening bars.\n\nSunwook Kim performed Mendelssohn\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 Thursday night. Photo: Anne Ryan\n\nSunwook Kim made a bravura CSO debut in this concise showpiece, throwing off the first movement\u2019s fistfuls of notes and runs up and down the keyboard while gently easing into the lilting second subject. Kim\u2019s digital virtuosity s not of the souped-up Lang Lang variety but more light-footed and silvery in its brilliance, which is more apt for this early 19th century score.\n\nKim brought a Chopin-like salon elegance to the cadenza and ensuing Andante, apart from a fractionally heavy left hand. The soloist romped through the finale\u2019s skittering main theme, the octave runs, triple trills and assorted fireworks tackled with vivacity and polished technique. Karabits ensured the orchestra kept pace every step of the way in the rapid back-and-forth between soloist and ensemble.\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s concerto is brief at just under 20 minutes, so Kim\u2019s debut was filled out with the composer\u2019s Capriccio brilliant, heard in its first CSO performance.\n\nThis ten-minute showpiece is cast in the same unapologetically glitzy style as the concerto. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not crafted on the same level, with the banal march-like second theme sounding like a pre-echo of Liszt\u2019s subgrade vulgarity. Kim threw off the Capriccio with even more freewheeling bravura, again with equally alert support from the orchestra under Karabits.\n\nThe evening began with another CSO premiere, Prokofiev\u2019s Overture on Hebrew Themes. More often heard in its chamber version, this slight item is not one of Prokofiev\u2019s most timeless works. Karabits led a trim, technocratic rendering, with Stephen Williamson contributing klezmer-like clarinet lines.\n\nThe program will be repeated 8 p.m. Saturday. cso.org; 312-294-3000.\n\n\n\nPosted in Performances\n\nLeave a Comment"}, {"url": "https://bsolive.com/people/kirill-karabits/", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Me neither. But I do have to admit that a constant diet of the composer\u2019s biggest hits, as offered in this 250th anniversary year, can dim one\u2019s appetite for yet more of the same. Fortunately, here\u2019s the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under its chief conductor, Kirill Karabits, to rekindle our interest. Karabits led the symphony in a spectacular tribute to Beethoven in Poole's Lighthouse. Broadcast through live streaming, observing social-distancing protocols, the program featured the UK premiere of Absence by Magnus Lindberg, commissioned for the Beethoven anniversary by four world-class orchestras, including the Bournemouth. The program concluded with the complete ballet, The Creatures of Prometheus, composed during Beethoven\u2019s exciting early years in Vienna.\n\nKirill Karabits \u00a9 Konrad Cwik\n\nRunning over an hour, Creatures is not performed as frequently as it should be. This is a work that brims over with youthful high spirits and self-confidence in the late Classical style, yet is able to sustain heart-wrenching bursts of lyricism foreshadowing the Romantic era to come.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the orchestra boldly sprawled across the entire vast breadth of the stage and was in its finest form as Karabits, an intense young man with an electrifying presence at the podium, began the evening with Lindberg\u2019s nine-minute salute to the Viennese master. The work was a glorious entr\u00e9e for the program, rich with complexity and a constant outcropping of ideas in an accessible style.\n\nUnlike some other new works I\u2019ve heard in which famous composers\u2019 themes are interwoven, Lindberg used this thematic material gingerly, not raising any alarms (\u201cListen up! I\u2019m about to quote from the Seventh Symphony!\u201d). There are snippets recalling Impressionism as well neatly stitched into the score. I enjoyed it all so much, I went back and listened to it again, thanks to the miracle of streaming, after the concert ended. By the way, the program notes by Andrew Burn for this selection were right on the money with accurate descriptions of key points in the work\u2019s continuity.\n\nCreatures may be an early work and one of the composer\u2019s few ballet scores, but it offers a glimpse of the Beethoven yet to be. To listen to its two acts divided into 18 sections is to hear the seed of everything that eventually would flower into the mature composer. Throughout the performance, Karabits conducted with unflagging energy and engagement, his face reflecting the nuances of each section\u2019s personality. While there is plenty of Sturm und Drang in this score, there are also passages of great tenderness. The interplay between cello and harp (an instrument rarely heard in Beethoven\u2019s works) was as lovely as any tender passage he ever composed, and there is some breathtaking music performed by oboe and basset horn.

I personally find that working with young musicians is all about sharing - sharing your experiences - and passing them to the young and future generations, which should be essential to every human being.\n\nAs a Ukrainian musician, what does Vladimir Horowitz represent for you? What impact did he have on your musical journey?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that Vladimir Horowitz was born in Kyiv. But thinking about his role in music, I believe that he became a man of the world, really. As a young musician I learned from him that as a pianist one can, and probably should, make music happen using exclusively their fingers and without drawing too much attention to the performer. The performer, in his case, is a sort of instrument that connects the audiences with the music itself. Of course, Vladimir Horowitz was serving the music in the first place.\n\nTo chair the Jury and conduct the Final round of the competition isn't common. How do you see this double role?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI have participated in a number of competitions as a conductor over the years but it will be my first experience of being also a chair of the jury.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}], "Kirill Karabits has conducted the San Francisco Symphony.": [{"url": "https://bsolive.com/people/kirill-karabits/", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

But he took his time showing the audience just what he could do.\n\nIt wasn't until after intermission, with a muscular and fluid rendition of Rachmaninoff's \"Symphonic Dances,\" that Karabits really came into his own. Here at last was the combination of technical precision and dramatic temperament that had been missing from the proceedings up to that point.\n\nAnd the \"Symphonic Dances\" from 1940, Rachmaninoff's final composition, was just the work to show off those qualities. It's a big, lumbering bear of a piece, more concerned with cramming in a lot of musical ideas than with giving them a clear or rhetorically cogent structure.\n\nKarabits seemed more than happy to take the music on its own terms - nudging it in this direction or that like a canny animal trainer, but for the most part letting the piece pursue its own willful course. The result was invigorating and very grand.\n\nKarabits, who is principal conductor with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in England, employs an unusually frank two-ply technique on the podium. He beats time rather crisply with the baton in his right hand, while keeping up a steady stream of balletic gestures with his left, as if to give the orchestra a fully stereophonic download of his requirements.\n\nSometimes, as in the music by Schumann and the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov that occupied the first half of the program, the two channels seem at odds with each other, and the performances that result can be an unsteady mix of effusion and restraint.\n\nBut for the Rachmaninoff, things were more reliably in sync. The opening movement was framed by a pair of robust, rhythmically forceful paragraphs, with plenty of shapely lyricism in between (especially from the woodwinds).\n\nThe central waltz movement danced suavely along, though without ever sounding like much more than a casual divertissement. But the finale was a powerhouse, driving sure-footedly toward its explosive last pages with their clangorous invocation of the \"Dies Irae\" chant.\n\nSchumann's Piano Concerto found Karabits' hands not only at odds with one another, but with the dry and blustery pianism of soloist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Grimaud. In this corner was Grimaud's pugnacious approach, all pounding chords and unyielding rhythms, and on the other was Karabits' swooning Romanticism, which only made for fuzzy ensemble playing. The two collaborators reached a sort of rapprochement in the central intermezzo, but it was brief.\n\nThe afternoon began with Silvestrov's six-minute \"Elegie\" for strings, premiered in 2002. I tried hard to detect something memorable or original in the score's funereal gestures - high keening violins, slightly dissonant harmonies and melodies with just the right touch of anguish - but the music sounded entirely generic and predictable.\n\nSan Francisco Symphony: 8 p.m. Sat., 2 p.m. Sun.

It was a sombre occasion in many ways, consolatory rather than optimistic, \u201ca reflection of the past year,\u201d as Karabits put it in an online programme note. Penderecki\u2019s Prelude for Peace, scheduled to mark the first anniversary of the composer\u2019s death, was followed by the original orchestral version of The Seven Last Words of Christ on the Cross, Haydn\u2019s severe set of meditations on the crucifixion, written to punctuate a (presumably lengthy) Good Friday sermon in C\u00e1diz Cathedral in 1786.\n\nThe past hangs heavy over Penderecki\u2019s Prelude, first performed in 2009, 70 years to the day after the Nazi invasion of Poland. Scored for brass and percussion, it\u2019s a brief work (five or so minutes, no more), in which a serene, timeless chorale gradually assumes prominence over the unnerving percussive roar from which it first emerges and the dissonant fanfares that initially impede its progress. Karabits, who knew and admired Penderecki, conducted with great nobility. It was superbly played by the BSO brass.\n\nHaydn\u2019s Seven Last Words, meanwhile, is an extraordinary piece in many ways, though difficult to perform successfully. Its seven slow movements are prefaced by a similarly slow introduction, before the work is rounded off with a violent depiction, to the only fast section of the score, of the earthquake following the crucifixion as described in Matthew\u2019s gospel. Until we reach that final cataclysm, everything hangs on interpretative understanding of subtle gradations of pulse, tempo and pace as the music gradually unfolds. Karabits\u2019s performance was finely judged and carefully controlled, at times almost hypnotic in its fervour. The all important woodwind solos were beautifully shaped and focused, while vibrato-less strings added immeasurably to the mood of devotional austerity."}, {"url": "https://www.womeninclassicalmusic.com/kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits\n\nConductor\n\nKirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 14 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Gil Shaham was the soloist in Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 35. It was a beautiful summer\u2019s eve, and there was a large audience enjoying the fresh air on the lawn, as well as in the Blossom pavilion.\n\nMr. Karabits opened the concert with an energetic reading of Glinka\u2019s Overture to Ruslan and Ludmila. The momentum never lagged, even in the more lyrical moments of the five-minute curtain raiser, whose eponymous opera is almost never performed in the West. Mr. Karabits was a model of efficiency in his conducting, with minimalist baton movements, nods and flicks of his fingers to communicate his directions.\n\nIn an interview last week with ClevelandClassical\u2019s Mike Telin, Gil Shaham expressed his enthusiasm for performing the Tchaikovsky concerto, one of the enduring favorites of the romantic violin repertoire. His enthusiasm was apparent in his performance at Blossom. His playing and stage presence showed his total involvement with the music. He sometimes grinned at the conductor or concertmaster; he turned to face the conductor for important cues. He moved around when he was not performing, taking in the orchestral sound.\n\nThis was not a \u201cblast through it\u201d performance; rather, the orchestra and soloist were integrated with great restraint, and the performance at times took on the delicacy and precision of chamber music. As is often the case at the brilliant end of the first movement of this concerto, the audience was carried away with enthusiasm, and there was hearty applause, which Mr. Shaham graciously acknowledged with a brief bow of his head.\n\nThe Canzonetta second movement\u2019s folk-like melody was played with ravishing beauty, and the entire movement rarely rose above a very quiet dynamic level. The end of the movement was so quiet as to be almost inaudible in the pavilion, but made the sudden jolting fortissimo into the third movement all the more striking. Mr. Karabits did not spare Mr. Shaham with the brutally fast tempo of the movement. In the hands of a lesser violinist or orchestra, there would have been enormous potential for disaster, but this was again performed with utmost virtuosity combined with sensitive musicianship. There was a thunderous ovation at the end, prompting Mr. Shaham to return for an encore, the Gavotte en Rondeau from Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s Partita No. 3 in E Major, BWV 1006, for solo violin. It was played with sharp rhythms and sense of forward movement.\n\nThe second half of the program was devoted to Sergei Prokofiev\u2019s Symphony No. 5 in B-flat Major, Op. 100. Prokofiev himself considered the fifth symphony his finest work. It was also his last great success; a few weeks after the 1945 premiere of the symphony, which he conducted, Prokofiev suffered a heart attack from which he never fully recovered. It was received at the time by the public and Soviet authorities as a great patriotic work celebrating Red Army\u2019s World War II battle victories.\n\nKirill Karabits abandoned all the restraint he had shone in the Tchaikovsky concerto, adopting a highly dramatic style, with a riot of orchestral color and gleaming climaxes, interspersed with introspective passages that showcased the Cleveland Orchestra soloists. The third movement adagio develops an expressive melody first appearing in the clarinet, eventually building to a grotesque climax, but eventually resolving to an unlikely major final chord. The last movement begins as a march, again with a clarinet tune, later becoming a \u201cperpetual motion,\u201d and ending with frantically, almost comically, but with the \u201cfree and happy\u201d spirit that Prokofiev desired.\n\nPublished on ClevelandClassical.com August 6, 2013\n\nClick here for a printable version of this article.\n\nReturn to the website."}, {"url": "https://www.womeninclassicalmusic.com/kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits\n\nConductor\n\nKirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 14 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://nospr.org.pl/en/kalendarz/artysci/kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 14 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://bsolive.com/people/kirill-karabits/", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

Energised by conductor Kirill Karabits, the symphony hurtled along at speeds that might have made a professional orchestra hang on to their music stands. Nothing daunted, the NYO responded with tremendous verve and an all-for-one unanimity that made for a gripping performance.

Karabits kept things moving, particularly in the slow movement. The Scherzo was notably fleet-of-foot and the Trio \u2013 with its aching oboe opening \u2013 never cloying.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities.

It will be conducted by Ukrainian artist Kirill Karabits, Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, who also assumes the role of Chair of the Jury. As the first in-person round was about to take place, he answered our 3 questions.\n\nThis year, the competition is being held in Geneva, hosted by the WFIMC, which embodies quite a symbol of international solidarity. In your view, in what way is this edition special for the 29 young selected participants? And on your side, how do you engage with young musicians?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m sure that this special competition will remain in history as a symbol of support and solidarity between Ukraine and Switzerland. Competitions are made to discover talent in the first place, and as there will be a lot of attention on this particular competition, it will surely serve the young participants and their future professional careers. I personally find that working with young musicians is all about sharing - sharing your experiences - and passing them to the young and future generations, which should be essential to every human being.\n\nAs a Ukrainian musician, what does Vladimir Horowitz represent for you? What impact did he have on your musical journey?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that Vladimir Horowitz was born in Kyiv. But thinking about his role in music, I believe that he became a man of the world, really. As a young musician I learned from him that as a pianist one can, and probably should, make music happen using exclusively their fingers and without drawing too much attention to the performer. The performer, in his case, is a sort of instrument that connects the audiences with the music itself. Of course, Vladimir Horowitz was serving the music in the first place.\n\nTo chair the Jury and conduct the Final round of the competition isn't common. How do you see this double role?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI have participated in a number of competitions as a conductor over the years but it will be my first experience of being also a chair of the jury. Hopefully this \u201cdouble role\u201d will help me to get to know the finalists better and help them to open up and conquer the new heights in the Final round.\n\nMusic Exchange\n\nThe Horowitz Competition Kyiv-Geneva\u2019s Final round will take place on 21 April 2023 at Geneva\u2019s Victoria Hall, featuring the Orchestra de la Suisse Romande under the baton of Kirill Karabits.

Founded in the 18th century and housed in St. Petersburg\u2019s famed Mariinsky Theatre since 1860, the Orchestra entered its \u201cgolden age\u201d in the second half of the 19th century under the musical direction of Eduard Napravnik, whose leadership for more than a half century (1863-1916) secured its reputation as one of the finest in Europe. Legendary artists who conducted the Mariinsky Orchestra and praised its outstanding musicianship included Berlioz, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Nikisch and Rachmaninoff.\n\nThe orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre enjoys a long and distinguished history as one of the oldest musical institutions in Russia. Founded in the 18th century during the reign of Peter the Great, it was known before the revolution as the Russian Imperial Opera Orchestra. Housed in St. Petersburg\u2018s famed Mariinsky Theatre (named after Maria, the wife of Czar Alexander II) since 1860, the Orchestra entered its true \"golden age\" during the second half of the 19th century under the music direction of Eduard Napravnik (1839-1916). Napravnik single-handedly ruled the Imperial Theatre for more than half a century (from 1863-1916) and under his leadership, the Mariinsky Orchestra was recognized as one of the finest in Europe. He also trained a generation of outstanding conductors, developing what came to be known as \"the Russian school of conducting.\"\n\nThe Mariinsky Theatre was also the birthplace of numerous operas and ballets which are meanwhile regarded as masterpieces of the 19th and 20th century. World premiere performances include Glinka\u2018s Life of a Tsar and Ruslan and Liudmila, Borodin\u2018s Prince Igor, Musorgsky\u2018s Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina, Rimsky-Korsakov\u2018s Maid of Pskov, The Snow Maiden and Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, Tchaikovsky\u2018s The Queen of Spades, Iolanta, Swan Lake, Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, Prokofiev\u2018s The Duenna, as well as operas by Shostakovich and ballets by Khachaturian.\n\nPeter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was closely associated with the Mariinsky Theatre, not only conducting the orchestra but also premiering his Fifth Symphony there, as well as the fantasy overture Hamlet and the Sixth Symphony. Sergey Rakhmaninov conducted the Orchestra on numerous occasions, including premieres of his Spring Cantata and the symphonic poem The Bells. The Orchestra also premiered the music of the young Igor Stravinsky, such as his Scherzo Fantastique and the suite from The Firebird ballet.\n\nThroughout its history, the Mariinsky Theatre has presented works by Europe\u2018s leading opera composers. In 1862, Verdi\u2018s La Forza del Destino was given its world premiere at the theatre in the presence of the composer. Wagner was a favorite at the Mariinsky Theatre, where his operas were frequently performed from the 19th through the beginning of the 20th century, including the first Russian performances of the complete Ring cycle, Tristan und Isolde, Die Meistersinger and Parsifal. The Ring cycle was conducted by Hans Richter, who was the first to conduct the complete Ring in Bayreuth and at Covent Garden.\n\nThe Mariinsky Orchestra also gave the first Russian performances of Richard Strauss\u2018 Elektra, Salome and Der Rosenkavalier, and Berg\u2018s Wozzeck in a production that took place two years after its world premiere in Berlin and twenty years before its premiere in Vienna.\n\nBy 1917 the orchestra\u2018s name had changed to the Royal Imperial Theatre Orchestra, and was regarded as St. Petersburg\u2018s leading symphony orchestra. Its repertoire - operatic and orchestral - has traditionally included not only music of Russian composers, but also of European composers. Numerous internationally famous musicians conducted the Orchestra, among them Hans von Bulow, Felix Mottl, Felix Weingartner, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Otto Nikisch, Willem Mengelberg, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter and Erich Kleiber.\n\nOn two occasions, in 1847 and 1867, Hector Berlioz conducted performances of his own works, including The Damnation of Faust, Romeo and Juliet, Symphony Fantastique and Harold in Italy. Hector Berlioz wrote in his memoirs \"Such an orchestra! Such precision! Such an ensemble!\". And in a letter dated December 1867, he stated: \"I don\u2018t think Beethoven ever had a better performance of his compositions!\" In March and April 1863, Richard Wagner visited St. Petersburg and led the Royal Imperial Theatre Orchestra in six programs of Beethoven Symphonies and his own compositions, including the world\u2018s first concert performance of Prelude und Liebestod. Gustav Mahler appeared with the Orchestra in both 1902 and 1907, conducting five concerts, including a performance of his Fifth Symphony. In 1912, Arnold Schoenberg conducted the premiere of his symphonic poem Pelleas and Melisande.\n\nRenamed the Kirov Opera during the Soviet era, the orchestra continued to maintain its high artistic standards under the leadership of Evgeni Mravinsky and Yuri Temirkanov. In 1988, Valery Gergiev was elected artistic director of the opera company and in 1996 the Russian Government appointed him as Artistic and General Director of the Mariinsky Theatre. Soon after the city of Leningrad was renamed St. Petersburg, the Kirov Theatre reverted to its original title of the Mariinsky Theatre, home to the Kirov Opera, the Kirov Ballet, and the Kirov Orchestra.\n\nUnder the leadership of Valery Gergiev, the Mariinsky Theatre has forged important relationships with the worlds\u2018 greatest opera houses, among them the Metropolitan Opera House, London\u2018s Royal Opera House, the San Francisco Opera, the Theatre Chatelet in Paris La Scala in Milan just to name a few. Besides extensive touring of the opera and the ballet company, the Kirov Orchestra has performed throughout world and has become one of the outstanding orchestras. The success of the orchestra\u2018s continual travelling has lead to the reputation of, what a journalist called, \"the world\u2018s first global orchestra\".\n\nIn 1998, the orchestra made its debut tour of China, an historic first, with a performance in the Great Hall in Beijing, broadcast to 50 million people, in the presence of President Jiang Zemin. It was the first time in 40 years that a Russian orchestra had been in China.\n\nUnder the baton of Valery Gergiev, the orchestra has recorded exclusively for Phillips Classics since 1989. Releases include the complete operas Khovanshchina, War and Peace, Sadko, Prince Igor, The Queen of Spades, Ruslan and Lyudmila, Iolanta, Fiery Angel (winner of the 1996 Gramophone \"Opera of the Year\u2018 award), La forza del destino, Boris Godunov (1869 and 1872 version), Mazeppa, Betrothal in the Monastery, Love for Three Oranges and Semyen Kotko. In addition the orchestra recorded the complete ballets Romeo and Juliet, Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker.\n\nIn July 2000, the orchestra and chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre recorded Verdi\u2018s Requiem and other releases of orchestral music include Shostakovich\u2018s Symphony No 8, Rakhmaninov\u2018s Symphony No2, Stravinsky\u2018s Firebird and The Rite of Spring, Skriabin\u2018s Poem of Ecstasy and Prometheus as well as the complete Piano Concerti by Prokofiev.\n\nThe Orchestra has performed every symphony by Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Mahler and Beethoven, Requiems by Mozart, Verdi and Tishchenko and works by Shchedrin, Gubaidulina, Kancheli and Karetnikov among many others. In 2008, according to results of a survey of leading music critics from major publications in America, Asia and Europe, the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra was one of the top twenty orchestras in the world, beating two other Russian orchestras also listed in the ratings."}, {"url": "https://www.anvilarts.org.uk/profile/kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years, and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.

As part of its ongoing commitment to supporting emerging musical talent around the world, EBU Music is proud to sponsor the Audience Prize, to be given after the Final round. It will be conducted by Ukrainian artist Kirill Karabits, Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, who also assumes the role of Chair of the Jury. As the first in-person round was about to take place, he answered our 3 questions.\n\nThis year, the competition is being held in Geneva, hosted by the WFIMC, which embodies quite a symbol of international solidarity. In your view, in what way is this edition special for the 29 young selected participants? And on your side, how do you engage with young musicians?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m sure that this special competition will remain in history as a symbol of support and solidarity between Ukraine and Switzerland. Competitions are made to discover talent in the first place, and as there will be a lot of attention on this particular competition, it will surely serve the young participants and their future professional careers. I personally find that working with young musicians is all about sharing - sharing your experiences - and passing them to the young and future generations, which should be essential to every human being.\n\nAs a Ukrainian musician, what does Vladimir Horowitz represent for you? What impact did he have on your musical journey?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI\u2019m very proud that Vladimir Horowitz was born in Kyiv. But thinking about his role in music, I believe that he became a man of the world, really. As a young musician I learned from him that as a pianist one can, and probably should, make music happen using exclusively their fingers and without drawing too much attention to the performer. The performer, in his case, is a sort of instrument that connects the audiences with the music itself. Of course, Vladimir Horowitz was serving the music in the first place.\n\nTo chair the Jury and conduct the Final round of the competition isn't common. How do you see this double role?\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nI have participated in a number of competitions as a conductor over the years but it will be my first experience of being also a chair of the jury. Hopefully this \u201cdouble role\u201d will help me to get to know the finalists better and help them to open up and conquer the new heights in the Final round.\n\nMusic Exchange\n\nThe Horowitz Competition Kyiv-Geneva\u2019s Final round will take place on 21 April 2023 at Geneva\u2019s Victoria Hall, featuring the Orchestra de la Suisse Romande under the baton of Kirill Karabits.

Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra\u2019s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned.\n\nIn fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius\u2019s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction.\n\nBefore the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends \u2013 Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn \u2013 but in Tintagel at least it\u2019s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 \u2013 three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion."}, {"url": "https://www.anvilarts.org.uk/profile/kirill-karabits", "page_content": "Kirill Karabits has been Chief Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for 13 years, and their relationship has been celebrated worldwide.
