He then pursued graduate studies at Yale University under the tutelage of American economist James Tobin. Monti taught briefly at the University of Trento (1969\u201370) and began a post at the University of Turin (1970\u201379) before returning to Bocconi University in 1971 as a professor of monetary theory and policy. He later directed (1985\u201394) the school\u2019s Institute of Economics. In 1989 he became rector of the university, and five years later he was named its president.\n\nAs a consultant to one of Italy\u2019s largest banks in the 1970s, Monti gained attention for publishing his own estimates of the country\u2019s money supply at a time when official figures were not publicly available. Beginning the following decade, he served on several committees of the Italian treasury and was president of SUERF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Universitaire Europ\u00e9enne de Recherches Financi\u00e8res; now the European Money and Finance Forum) in 1982\u201385. Also during this time Monti wrote commentaries on economics for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera (1978\u201394) and sat on a number of corporate boards.\n\nIn 1995 Monti, having been nominated by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, took a seat on the European Commission (EC), for which he oversaw issues relating to the internal market, financial services, and taxation. Receiving a second term in 1999, he became the European commissioner for competition, and in that capacity, he took a tough-minded approach to proposed corporate mergers and antitrust cases that won him wide respect. After his EC tenure concluded in 2004, he helped found Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank with a focus on economic globalization.\n\nIn November 2011, in the wake of a public debt crisis in Italy that weakened Berlusconi\u2019s grip on power, the politically independent Monti became a leading candidate to assume the country\u2019s premiership in a national unity government. (It was hoped that Monti\u2019s experience as a technocrat would prove beneficial in the implementation of urgent economic reforms.) On November 9 he was made a lifetime member of the Italian Senate, and four days later, upon Berlusconi\u2019s resignation, Pres. Giorgio Napolitano asked Monti to form a government.\n\nInitially serving as both prime minister and finance minister (he held the latter post until July 2012), Monti swiftly persuaded parliament to approve an austerity package that relied heavily on tax increases. In early 2012 a set of measures he introduced in an effort to liberalize the service sector was also passed. Although Italy continued to face economic uncertainty, Monti\u2019s decisive leadership was widely judged to have helped the country forestall disaster. As the year continued, he also emerged as a key player in international negotiations aimed at financially stabilizing the entire euro zone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He resigned from office shortly thereafter, remaining in a caretaker role until a new government could be formed. In early elections held in February 2013, Monti led an alliance of centrist political factions, but they failed to win enough parliamentary seats to play a significant role in the ensuing efforts to build a government coalition. After two months of political deadlock, Monti was finally succeeded by Enrico Letta, a Democratic Party (Partito Democratico) leader appointed by Napolitano."}, {"url": "https://fashionunited.com/education/schools/bocconi-university-appoints-new-president/2022093049963", "page_content": "Bocconi University in Milan has named Andrea Sironi president of the board after the current president of the university, Mario Monti, expressed he did not want to continue in his role for another term.\n\nThe Bocconi university board unanimously elected Mr Sironi, a professor at the Department of Finance at the university, as the new president as per a release on the university website.\n\nHe will take up his role as president on November 1 and will serve as head of the university board for a four-year term.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honour to succeed Mario Monti at the head of the Bocconi university board.

Having started out as a street peddler of fabrics in late 19th century Milan, with his brother he founded the prestigious \u201cAlle Citt\u00e0 d\u2019Italia\u201d stores, the first in the country to offer ready-made clothing and fashion items following the model of the large French and English establishments. At the turn of the century, in memory of his son who had gone missing in East Africa, Ferdinando decided to create a new educational institution in the field of economics bearing his name: Universit\u00e0 Commerciale \u201cLuigi Bocconi\u201d.\n\n\n\nLuigi Bocconi (1869\u20131896)\n\nFerdinando\u2019s first son, Luigi Bocconi, chose not to work in the family business. In 1896, his desire for independence and adventure led him to join the Italian troops leaving for Ethiopia as a correspondent for the newspaper \u201cLa Riforma\u201d. After the battle of Adwa he was reported missing in action. The institute his father created in order to raise business studies to university level is named after him.\n\n\n\nEttore Bocconi (1871\u20131932)\n\nOn the death of his father, Ettore Bocconi stepped in to manage both the family business and the University. He served as president of Bocconi from 1915 to 1932. In 1917 he ceded ownership of \u201cAlle Citt\u00e0 d\u2019Italia\u201d department stores, which would become \u201cLa Rinascente\u201d, still a central showcase for Milanese fashion and design today.\n\n\n\nFerdinando Bocconi jr (1873\u20131913)\n\nFerdinando Bocconi, Jr. was the younger brother of Luigi and Ettore.

In 1951, she established the \"Associazione Amici della Bocconi\" which, now under the name \u201cIstituto Javotte Bocconi Manca di Villahermosa \u2013 Associazione Amici della Bocconi\u201d, continues to play a fundamental role in the University\u2019s governance.\n\n\n\nLeopoldo Sabbatini (1861\u20131914)\n\nSecretary of the Milan Chamber of Commerce from 1888 and founder of the Union of Italian Chambers of Commerce, Leopoldo Sabbatini was keenly interested in the problems of education since his university years, and he was involved in the founding of the new university through his association with Ferdinando Bocconi.
