We caught up with Adam last week to talk about the genesis of Car Dogs, the diversity of his cast, and the excitement surrounding this week\u2019s world premiere.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to watch a movie that\u2019s set in Phoenix and was actually shot here, because there are so many shots in this film where I immediately recognize the area and the surroundings. As the director, why was it important for you to shoot here?\n\nAdam Collis: Well, the movie was always set in Phoenix, and it was written by a Scottsdale native, so it almost felt serendipitously destined to be shot here. The film started coming together when, as a professor at Arizona State University, my boss came to me and said that we needed to give internship opportunities to our students, so they could get some real-world experience. And I kind of jokingly said \u201cwell, we could make a feature film, and that would give them all great internship experiences,\u201d and he took me seriously and said \u201cis there a script that you could do?\u201d\n\nI had been here about a year and a half, and I kept thinking about this script by a former student, who I had taught in my very first class in Los Angeles. It was this script called Car Dogs, written by Mark King, a Scottsdale native, and it was set in this car dealership in Scottsdale. And I was thinking \u201cthis could be done relatively inexpensively.\u201d We had just had the financial collapse, so I knew there would be a lot of empty dealerships in the valley and we could get our location.\n\nSo I called Mark to find out if he had every done anything with it, because that was a hot script in Hollywood for awhile. There were names attached to it, and it had a big agency representing it, but like so many projects it came together and then fell apart, so when I called it was available. And I asked if he wanted to come back to his hometown, and make a movie drawn from his own life experiences, with students from his alma mater, and Mark said \u201cof course.\u201d\n\nAnd then we just started putting it together with all of these wonderful ASU connections. Like our casting director, John Jackson \u2013 he\u2019s an ASU alum \u2013 and he\u2019s really what led to the sort of outside-the-box casting of George Lopez. That part was originally written for like a young Ben Affleck type, but John really gets you to think about things in a different way, to think about casting roles in a way that feels real, but unexpected. Nobody was expecting me to cast a 50-year-old Mexican-American comedian in that role.\n\nYeah, he\u2019s fantastic. You almost kind of forget that it\u2019s George Lopez, because the role is so different from the stuff he\u2019s typically recognized for.\n\nAdam Collis: He was just so incredibly directable. He\u2019s such a talented and charismatic guy, he\u2019s the sort of guy you can just train the camera on and let it go. I\u2019m just so delighted, and it was very, very gratifying to be able to work with him.\n\nYou also have Octavia Spencer in this film for a brief role, and coming off this past year\u2019s award season, that\u2019s a pretty high-profile name. How did she get involved?\n\nAdam Collis: This is one of those stories where it\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know. Josh Hopkins, who plays Reynolds, is someone that I grew up with in Lexington, Kentucky. He\u2019s also an executive producer on the film, and he had known Octavia Spencer for a very long time. There\u2019s a really important, pivotal scene near the end of the film, and it called for someone with Octavia\u2019s gravitas, so I pitched the idea to Josh.\n\nHe reached out to Octavia, and then I had a call with her. We talked for about ten minutes, and she was in, so I thanked her and told her we would see her during production. Well, some time passed and things changed in her schedule, and she told Josh she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d be able to do it. So Josh came and told me that, and I said \u201cwell, did she tell you definitively that she couldn\u2019t be in the movie?\u201d And he said no, so I begged him to go back to her and explore it again.\n\nHe came back and told me that she wasn\u2019t sure it would fit into her schedule, and once again I said \u201cdid she tell you definitively that she couldn\u2019t be in the movie?\u201d And he said no, so I begged him to go back to her and see what they could work out. Then he comes back a third time and says \u201cOctavia wants to talk to you.\u201d I\u2019ve never shared the contents of that conversation with anyone, but by the end of that twenty minutes, she said \u201cI\u2019ll see you in Phoenix,\u201d so it all worked out for everyone.\n\nAnother great performance in this film comes from Chris Mulkey as the main character\u2019s father.\n\nAdam Collis: He\u2019s the best! Chris Mulkey is the bull, El Toro. You just let him in the ring, and you try your best the guide the bull with your red cape, but the bull probably has better ideas than you have.\n\nThere have been plenty of movies with this sort of villainous businessman archetype, but this guy is the upper echelon. He is such an asshole, and he\u2019s so despicable, but he\u2019s so charismatic that you can\u2019t take your eyes off him.\n\nAdam Collis: You know, when I saw Mulkey\u2019s reel, it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting initially. I think what the writer had in mind was someone much more stoic and stern and manipulative, But I think what Chris brought to it was so much smarter, this guy who\u2019s just such an overwhelming asshole that you\u2019re fascinated to see what he\u2019ll say or do next. Individual politics aside, does that remind us of anyone?\n\nI think there\u2019s something about the spirit of his performance that really speaks to our times. There\u2019s someone who\u2019s so strong in their point of view and so viciously committed to what he believes, regardless of whether or not it screws people over. He\u2019s justified it in his mind, and everything that character does, he believes is okay, because he\u2019s got his own justification and that\u2019s what fuels his intensity. The best bad guys always think they\u2019re the good guys.\n\nHow excited are you for Car Dogs to have its world premiere here in Phoenix?\n\nAdam Collis: Well, the thing I\u2019m most excited about is the thing I\u2019m the most nervous about, and that\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re launching this movie in a completely unique way that depends on the good people of Phoenix to rally around this movie. Movies don\u2019t launch a national release out of Phoenix \u2013 in fact, they don\u2019t launch national releases very often out of anywhere that isn\u2019t New York or Los Angeles. We\u2019re saturating theaters across the valley so we can truly test the market, and so we can truly give the people of Phoenix the chance to decide whether or not this movie goes national.\n\nThis project was born out of the culture of innovation that is Arizona State University. There\u2019s no question about that, and president Michael Crow has created this entrepreneurial, innovative environment, and out of that environment we created a new business model for financing an independent film, and a new professional immersion program. But the biggest innovation is this new way to launch a movie out of the Phoenix market, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for the people of Phoenix to come out and support the movie. If it goes national, everything points back here.\n\nThe world premiere of Car Dogs takes place on Monday, March 20th. The film opens in Harkins Theaters throughout the Phoenix area on Friday, March 24."}, {"url": "https://herbergerinstitute.asu.edu/news/film-professor-brings-hollywood-listers-tempe", "page_content": "Adam Collis, visiting professor of film directing at ASU, hates the word \u201cconnections,\u2019\u2019 but that\u2019s what the filmmaker and actor taps when he\u2019s lining up Hollywood A-listers to talk with students about filmmaking.
