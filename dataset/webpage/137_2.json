{"Paul Taylor is also a solo artist and has released two albums.": [{"url": "https://www.allaboutjazz.com/musicians/paul-taylor", "page_content": "Other key tracks include the EDM jam \u201cClub 702,\u201d a high energy tribute to the many successful DJs in Taylor\u2019s adopted hometown of Las Vegas (whose area code is 702); the spirited midtempo electronic funk piece \u201cKnocking At Your Door,\u201d featuring Taylor\u2019s backing vocals seductively repeating the title; and a whimsical \u201cRoundup\u201d of a lot of different styles, including the folksy, jangling guitar of Brian Monroney and touches of progressive EDM grooves and jazzy energy. One of the highlights of Taylor\u2019s Tenacity album was his cover of The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cWicked Games.\u201d Setting a precedent by re-inventing a tune by the same artist on consecutive albums, Taylor extends his love for the Canadian alt-R&B singer to his fresh and atmospheric, deep soul-jazz take on the #1 pop hit \u201cThe Hills.\u201d\n\nCountdown\u2019s first single, \u201cArrival\u201d is a spot on reflection of their multi-faceted freewheeling approach to stylistic fusion. The two also cite Paul\u2019s soprano led track \u201cTold Ya So\u201d as another prime example. \u201cIt\u2019s dancehall reggae the way artists like Drake and Rihanna do it,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to apply that contemporary pop current to my R&B/jazz sound.\u201d Another track that Taylor feels steps away from the usual urban jazz hitting the charts these days is \u201cCrossroads,\u201d Complementing these tracks are two infectious, in the pocket tunes which reveal Taylor\u2019s mastery of melody and easy flowing funk grooves \u2013 achieved here via seductive clapping percussion. The first is the opening track \u201cCountdown,\u201d which introduces the sizzling horn texture dynamic that drives many of the emotional high points throughout the set. Taylor says, \u201cThis one starts in a dreamy place, as if you\u2019re anticipating something big, and then it breaks through with beats and ambience, creating emotional power but in a subdued mystical way.\u201d The second is \u201cPolaris,\u201d one of the jazzier tunes on the album, a gentle soprano ballad featuring the subtle acoustic guitar graces of Peter White (providing harmonies and a transcendent solo).\n\nThe album\u2019s colorful fusion of grooves and styles was created by the saxophonist and his longtime collaborator, co-writer and producer Dino Esposito. The two share a dynamic several decade long history that began when they played in the same band while attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Esposito\u2019s collaboration as a co-writer, producer and sonic co-architect began with Paul\u2019s 1995 debut On the Horn and continued with Pleasure Seeker (1997), Undercover (2000), Hypnotic (2001), Nightlife (2005), Prime Time (2011) and Tenacity (2014).\n\nIn the first few bars of the title track to his new Peak Records/eOne album, Countdown, contemporary urban jazz\u2019 hit saxman Paul Taylor, ever the engaging showman, invites his legion of fans into the experience by counting off 5\u20264\u20263\u20262\u20261. He launches into his incredible third decade as a solo artist with a set that\u2019s fuses his trademark jazzy/funk/soul vibe with prominent elements of synthy dance pop/EDM, trancelike neo-soul, electronica, folksy lite rock, reggaeton, even a touch of blues.\n\n\u201cGetting the go-ahead for a new album is always the greatest news because we can toss around ideas and come up with fresh new ways to color around the edges of my core melodic horn vibe, staying true to my stylistic integrity,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cOur goal is always to do something we haven\u2019t tried before, and we have fun experimenting and being adventurous. On Countdown, we achieve that by trying new EDMish kind of mashups, trying to make two or three different styles mesh.\u201d\n\nEsposito agrees he and Taylor are so in tune and trust each other so implicitly that if the saxman shoots him an eight or 16 bar idea or vice versa, the other can pick it up and develop it exactly the way the other envisioned. \u201cPaul has never been afraid to step out of the box of the sound urban jazz artists usually conform to, and I\u2019m always pushing that envelope as well,\u201d he says. \u201cPaul\u2019s always hearing amazing new sounds and he\u2019s open to all the music I\u2019ve been immersed in like chill, hip-hop, EDM, electric soul and pop alternative. We\u2019re always thinking, what can we bring to the table, what can we explore and how can we fuse different touches of all we love without going too far out of the genre\u2019s mainstream\u201d\n\nThough Taylor has been a groundbreaking force among the sax elite in the genre since his hit 1995 debut On The Horn, his 2014 #1 hit \u201cSupernova\u201d continued the exhilarating upswing he has been enjoying since he started his second decade as an artist with Ladies\u2019 Choice (2007) \u2013 his first ever #1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums Chart. \u201cBurnin\u2019,\u201d the title track from his 2009 album, hit #1 on the airplay charts, and \u201cPush To Start\u201d from Prime Time (2011), hit the pole position on the Smooth Jazz Songs chart. Prime Time further lived up to its colorful name by reaching the Top Ten on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart.\n\nThe Denver native has been mesmerizing thousands of fans, headlining hundreds of shows and being part of exciting all-star tours \u2013 most recently doing dates with Peter White and Euge Groove in a lineup affectionately dubbed \u201cPeter, Paul and Euge.\u201d Before that he was part of the blockbuster summer tours Gentlemen of the Night (with Marion Meadows and Warren Hill) and Sax and the City (with Meadows and Vincent Ingala). Over the years, he has also hit the road with The Rippingtons and the acclaimed \u201cGroovin\u2019 For Grover\u201d tour.\n\nIn December 2012, the longtime basketball enthusiast achieved another longtime dream, performing the National Anthem in Madison Square Garden at a New York Knicks game; their coach Mike Woodson is a longtime fan. Taylor is now also an official endorsee of Vigilante mouthpieces and tenor and alto for Cannonball Musical Instruments.\n\nAfter over ten albums of non-stop hit making, thousands of charismatic performances worldwide and years of setting new standards for the sonic possibilities of contemporary urban jazz, Paul Taylor\u2019s still got his antenna up \u2013 ready to pounce on, absorb and be inspired by every vibe he hears that\u2019s fresh, hip and edgy. Now, with Countdown, he\u2019s blasting off into the next phase of his career, excited about the road ahead!

His reedy tone and warm, bright sound frame dynamic, danceable grooves and intricate pop shot through with electronica. He has been leading his own dates since 1995's On the Horn. 2000's Undercover spent 28 weeks on the Contemporary Jazz charts. 2007's chart-topper Ladies Choice crossed over to R&B thanks to hit singles \"I Want to Be Loved by You\" (feat. LaToya London) and \"How Did You Know\" (feat. Regina Belle). Taylor played sold-out houses on the Gentlemen of the Night tours with fellow saxophonists Marion Meadows, Michael Lington, and Warren Hill. Taylor's skillful collaborations with vocalists include charting appearances with Maxi Priest and Peabo Bryson. 2014's Tenacity also crossed over thanks to its first single, \"Supernova\" (feat. Jonathan Fritzen). 2021's And Now This was constructed from digital files exchanged between Taylor and longtime producer Dino Esposito during the pandemic; their goal was to create a beat-conscious set of club tracks and radio singles. The latter included \"Ride It,\" sung by All-4-One vocalist Jamie Jones.\n\nTaylor was raised in Denver. He took up the alto saxophone at the age of seven. He played in school bands, and in high school joined a Top 40 band called Mixed Company where he picked up the soprano horn as well. He attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on a full music scholarship. After graduating, jazz keyboardist Keiko Matsui and her producer husband Kazu Matsui, discovered him playing a gig at the Catalina Island Jazz Festival and hired him to back her on the spot. He spent two years with her road band before Kazu produced his 1995 debut solo album, On the Horn; it reached the jazz charts and spawned a radio hit in \"Til We Meet Again.\" Taylor worked with Keiko in the studio on 1995's chart-topping Sapphire, 1996's Dream Walk, and 1998's Full Moon and the Shrine, and remained a guest with her studio band through 2009's Moyo (Heart and Soul). Simultaneously, the saxist worked the road and in the studio with Casiopea drummer Akira Jimbo. He appeared on 1996's Flower and 1997's Stone Butterfly. Pleasure Seeker, Taylor's second solo album, followed in 1997 and was equally successful.\n\nIn 1999 he appeared on the Rippingtons' Topaz. He released his third album, Undercover, on Peak/N-Coded Music in February 2000 and toured as a special guest soloist with the Rippingtons. Subsequent albums Hypnotic (2001), Steppin' Out (2003), Nightlife (2005), and Ladies' Choice (2007), were all issued by Peak Records and registered high on the contemporary jazz charts -- Ladies' Choice went all the way to number one, crossed over to R&B, and landed well inside the Top 30. The album remained on the charts for 29 weeks. That year, Taylor played soprano on \"I Try,\" the Top Ten single from Peabo Bryson's Missing You.\n\nPeak released Taylor's eighth album, Burnin', in 2009. It spent 38 weeks on the smooth jazz charts and also peaked at number one. Two years later, Taylor returned with Prime Time; it went to number three on the contemporary jazz charts. In 2014, Taylor released Tenacity. With guest appearances from Jeff Lorber and vocalist Jonathan Fritzen, it too peaked at three, while spending 20 weeks on the jazz charts. In 2015, Taylor returned to working with Jimbo in the studio and on the road; he played alto and soprano on the drummer's acclaimed Groove of Life. Taylor's 2016 release Countdown cracked the Top Ten at jazz albums.\n\nAfter a long period of global touring with Jimbo, Matsui, and on his own, Taylor got an unintentionally extended break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the year he began trading digital files with Esposito, consciously crafting an album aimed at global dancefloors. In November 2021, And Now This appeared from Peak with its first single, \"Ride It, sung by All-4-One's Jamie Jones. Later that month, Taylor enlisted Twitch streaming host OriginalSnow to duet with him on the funky non-album single \"Share It with You.\""}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Taylor/+wiki", "page_content": "The name \"Paul Taylor\" is used for (at least) three different artists:\n\n(1) Paul Taylor - Jazz Musician\n\nPaul Taylor (born April 30, 1960) is an American smooth jazz saxophonist who has released eight albums since his debut On the Horn in 1995. He is signed to Peak Records. Although originally from Denver, Colorado, he is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also played as a special guest with the Rippingtons for a short time in 1999 and 2000, after Jeff Kashiwa left the group and before Eric Marienthal joined them.\n\nHe collaborated with many R&B vocalists such as LaToya London, Regina Belle, and Terry Dexter.\n\n\n\nExpanding upon the sensuous and romantic smooth jazz vibe that has made him one of the genre\u2019s most dynamic saxophonists, Paul Taylor makes his fourth Peak Records release a true Ladies\u2019 Choice; creating his most soulful instrumental tracks ever and keeping company with three of today\u2019s most acclaimed female R&B vocalists\u2014Regina Belle, La Toya London and Terry Dexter.\n\nCapturing all of the soulful grooves, dazzling melodies and seductive magic that have become his trademark, Ladies\u2019 Choice perfectly reflects the incredible synergy the charismatic Taylor has had for over a decade with his devoted audience, and takes his music to a whole new urban adult contemporary dimension. The collection is also the sax man\u2019s third in a row\u2014after 2003\u2019s Steppin\u2019 Out and 2005\u2019s Nightlife\u2013to feature tracks helmed by veteran R&B/jazz producers Barry Eastmond (Al Jarreau, Regina Belle, Jonathan Butler, Anita Baker) and Rex Rideout (Richard Elliot, Gerald Albright, Boney James, Najee). The title was inspired by a special moment that happened every night at clubs throughout the country in the 70s. The DJ would stop the music, take the mike and declare the next song to be \u201cLadies\u2019 Choice\u201d\u2014an invitation for the ladies to pick the guys they want to dance with.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got into the studio with Barry at his place in New York, we started completely from scratch and had no idea that the exciting Ladies\u2019 Choice idea would emerge,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cGenerally, he\u2019ll have some tracks worked up and I\u2019ll start with some melodic ideas and take it from there. When we listened back to the first song we wrote, its cool thumping old school vibe just reminded me of those 70s disco nights and the title \u2018Ladies\u2019 Night\u2019 just hit me as the right title to convey the blend of retro-soul, romantic music and contemporary edges we were going for. Once we had established this concept, we expanded on it by including songs sung by some of my favorite female artists. I\u2019ve included vocal tracks before on my recordings, but these ladies are taking my music to a whole new level.\u201d\n\nEastmond (who produced seven tracks), Rideout (four) and Taylor are all good friends, and Taylor\u2019s two producers have a friendly competition going each time the sax man asks them to come on board. \u201cThey want to know who\u2019s going to do the most tracks,\u201d Taylor laughs, \u201cand who\u2019s going to win out\u2014Barry, whom Rex calls \u2018the king of urban AC,\u2019 or Rex, whose trademark is creating subtle accompaniment that lets me grow and do my thing. I have a dynamic chemistry with both, and each in their own way brings out the essence of what I do with my melodies.\n\nI know their tracks and soundscapes are going to be amazing, and I look forward to what we\u2019re going to come up with together.\u201d The first five Eastmond-produced cuts on Ladies\u2019 Choice include the title track, \u201cHere We Go\u201d and \u201cStreamline,\u201d three co-writes by Eastmond and Taylor that blend old school soul atmospheres, bouncing bass grooves and the saxophonist\u2019s dashing flair for horn texturing. Taylor\u2019s powerful alto coloring and solo complement London\u2019s passionate voice on the dreamy late night ballad \u201cI Want To Be Loved By You\u201d; his alto also sways behind Belle\u2019s playful and sassy vocals on the crisp, sparsely arranged romance \u201cHow Did You Know\u201d (which she co-wrote with Eastmond).\n\nEastmond\u2019s other tracks include another lush Belle penned ballad, \u201cOpen Your Eyes,\u201d which features a searing vocal/sax duet energy; and the sweet and breezy, old school-vibin\u2019 \u201cSummer\u2019s End.\u201d Rideout produced the other two incredible vocals on Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sensuous, almost mystical \u201cLong Distance Relationship,\u201d which features beautiful voice texturing behind the lead of Terry Dexter, and the mid-tempo and brassy, classic blues and soul flavored \u201cA Love Of Your Own\u201d (a cover of an Average White Band classic) with vocalist Lauren Evans; Evans also co-wrote \u201cLong Distance Relationship\u201d with Rideout and guitarist Darrell Crooks. Rideout also helmed the sizzling, hard-edged disco-fied \u201cOverdrive\u201d and the funky; horn inflected closer \u201cPoint Of View.\u201d\n\nA native of Denver, Taylor has lived and worked in the thriving musical environment of Las Vegas since graduating as a music performance major from UNLV. He began playing sax at age seven and discovered his true calling while playing in a local high school garage band called Mixed Company, which played Top 40, funk and Crusader-styled fusion. Aiming to build his resume beyond the many dues-paying Vegas lounge gigs that marked his early professional life, he commuted often to Los Angeles and hooked up in the late 80s with (his later producer) Dino Esposito. Taylor did one of Esposito\u2019s sessions at Jeff Lorber's home studio; a few years later, in 1994, the popular keyboardist remembered Taylor and asked him to play with him at the Catalina Island Jazz Trax Festival. Popular keyboardist Keiko Matsui and her producer/husband Kazu liked Taylor\u2019s charismatic performance and soon offered him an audition with their band. He recorded and toured with the Matsuis for two years (appearing on Sapphire and Dream Walk), and Kazu Matsui eventually produced the sax man\u2019s debut On The Horn, which spawned the #1 radio hit \u201cTill We Meet Again.\u201d Taylor quickly found his own niche in the smooth jazz world, and his quick but well deserved popularity led Pleasure Seeker to the top of the radio charts. The #1 title track was one of Radio & Records most played genre cuts of the year.\n\nAlthough Taylor has since been one of the genre's most popular live attractions as a solo artist, he eagerly accepted Russ Freeman\u2019s invitation to tour with The Rippingtons as a special guest artist in 2000\u2014the year he released his third album Undercover\u2013after Jeff Kashiwa left the group. After making his Peak debut with 2001\u2019s Hypnotic, Taylor\u2019s career reached a fever pitch in 2004 when \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d the title track from his 2003 Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz album, became Radio & Records\u2019 third biggest genre airplay cut of the year. He also toured as a featured performer with the all-star \u201cGroovin\u2019 For Grover\u201d lineup (including Jeff Lorber, Richard Elliot and Gerald Albright) and performed and made his acting debut on the legendary ABC soap opera One Life To Live. The incredible momentum continued with his 2005 release Nightlife, Taylor\u2019s latest to hit the Top Five of Billboard\u2019s Contemporary Jazz Chart. After participating in Norman Brown\u2019s Summer Storm II tour in 2006, the saxophonist began 2007 aboard the Brian Culbertson All-Star Smooth Jazz Cruise as a featured headlining performer.\n\nThis year, he is looking forward to sharing numerous tour dates with Regina Belle. \u201cFor me, the whole music making process begins with me in a room with the sax, writing melodies from the heart,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIn addition to working with Barry and Rex again, it\u2019s been a great experience to work with these incredible ladies. The best part of this project was just being able to get in the studio and do it. It\u2019s easy to take this journey for granted, but I\u2019m grateful to be alive to share the music that\u2019s in my heart with the fans. I feel very lucky that I\u2019ve been able to make it happen for so long.\u201d\n\nOne of the high points of Taylor\u2019s live performances is the segment when he invites a handful of excited female fans onstage to sway along with him as he plays his hit song \u201cDeeper.\u201d With Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sweet ongoing seduction goes deeper still!\n\n(2) Paul Taylor - Psytrance DJ\n\nAlready well known internationally as a DJ with a unique ability to source and play the freshest sounds, Paul\u0081fs credentials are well documented. A veteran from Goa parties since the mid nineties, he was quickly noticed by TIP records and joined in 2001 as a label DJ along with Dimitri Nakov and Raja Ram. After two years in the London Tip Office, he then relocated to Ibiza where he soon began to co produce music with artists such as Earthling, Shanti and Bushman.\n\nIn 2002 he joined Spun Records as Ibiza label manager and A&R/DJ, compiling the very well received Spun Complilation: Tweakers\u0081. A regular at many of the bigger events in Europe, Mexico, South America, Israel and Japan, Paul is one of the most sought after Psy Trance DJ\u0081's around the world, having made his reputation for playing powerful sets of his own particular style of Hi Tech inspired Full On and continuously pushing the boundaries of the Psy Trance medium. His exacting taste, and ability to source music has led to five very successful V.A compilations so far, on labels such as Crystal Matrix, Spun, Sirius, & Sound Sorcery; all of which have been firm favourites with on the world DJ circuit.\n\n\n\nHis new record 'High Times' (Kundalini 2008) was originally meant as another V/A compilation. However Paul soon decided to craft his own sounds and the album soon became an artist album under his own name. With a focus on a more minimal sound 'High Times' reflects on the tech-trance of the late 90's but gives it a new fresh edge with some tight production and forward thinking.\n\n(3) Paul Taylor - Experimental Musician\n\nOne half of Sutcliffe J\u00fcgend and occasional solo artist."}, {"url": "https://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/artist/paul-taylor-piano", "page_content": "JMA TOP 5 Jazz ALBUMS\n\nRating by members, ranked by custom algorithm\n\nAlbums with 30 ratings and more"}, {"url": "https://www.starsinsider.com/music/454267/artists-who-have-released-two-albums-in-the-same-year", "page_content": "For most artists, a typical album cycle is about two years.

His first album, On the Horn, debuted in 1995, and he has released twelve albums throughout his 25-year-plus career. Constantly stretching his creative horizons, Taylor\u2019s eclectic styling of music reaches across the genres of urban jazz, smooth jazz, funk, and electronic/pop. With his newest album, And Now This, created via the exchange of digital files during the Pandemic, Paul Taylor and his collaborator, producer, and co-writer, Dino Esposito, have once again hit the charts with #1 songs. A graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas \u2013 Division of Jazz and Commerical Music, Taylor decided to make Las Vegas his home after graduation. He has toured extensively with top artists such as Keiko Matsui, The Rippingtons, Peter White and Euge Groove, Michael Lington, Marion Meadows, Warren Hill, and many more. He also tours as a solo act.\n\nPaul Taylor\u2019s 12th CD, And Now This\n\nWhile in Las Vegas, I sat with Paul Taylor, a recording artist and one of contemporary jazz\u2019s top performers as a sax player, and asked him about his new album, released in November 2021. Sheryl Aronson: What\u2019s the album\u2019s title? Paul Taylor: My 12th CD is called And Now This. I made the album remotely during the pandemic with my producer Dino Esposito. Sheryl Aronson: You have quite a history with him\u2014he\u2019s been your producer and collaborator for almost your entire recording career. Paul Taylor: I met Dino when I was just out of college. Dino was a successful pop artist in the late 80s and had a top-five single called \u201cI Like It.\u201d We met through a mutual friend, and he came to see my band play a few times. We clicked and kept in touch over the years. I knew I would have him produce /co-write my albums when I made it on the contemporary jazz scene. In the late 90s, we began collaborating, and Dino has been working with me since then. Sheryl Aronson: What is the meaning behind the title of your new album, And Now This? Paul Taylor: There are a few meanings: it\u2019s been a big break since my last album came out in 2016, and I wanted a strong title; instead of calling it one of the title tracks\u2019 names, l wanted something that sounded ambiguous and esoteric. I\u2019ve been moving forward in my personal and creative life, and as we\u2019re coming out of this pandemic, I feel I\u2019m kicking it into high gear! Then I had an epiphany in Macy\u2019s one day. My girlfriend and I were shopping back in November, and we saw a clothesline called And Now This, and it hit me\u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019m naming my album! Sheryl Aronson: I love the title, and you look great on the album cover. Your album is doing well, and some of your songs are charting on Billboard. Paul Taylor: The album was released on November 5th, 2021. My first radio single, \u201cStraight to the Point,\u201d reached #1 Most added on Billboard\u2019s Radio Chart. I was also excited to do a re-imagining of \u201cRide It,\u201d which was a big hit done by DJ Regard (2019 hit remix of Jay Sean\u2019s 2008 #1UK R&B hit). I enlisted Grammy-winning artist Jamie Jones to sing on \u201cRide It.\u201d The second single, \u201cFriday @ 5,\u201d has done well and hit #1 on Billboard. Sheryl Aronson: You\u2019ve been in the music industry for 20-plus years. How did you begin playing the sax? Paul Taylor: I grew up in Colorado, and when I was seven years old, my father asked both my brother and me if we wanted to play an instrument. We both said yes. I played throughout junior high and high school and participated in stage band, and took private lessons.\n\nSheryl Aronson: Who were some of your musical influences? Paul Taylor: Grover Washington, Jr., David Sanborn, Earth Wind & Fire, Brecker Brothers, Patrice Rushen, and Ramsey Lewis. I formed a band in high school, and we played funk, jazz, and Top 40 music. We played house parties and backyard parties and then worked our way up to nightclubs. I knew I wanted to be a professional musician and pursued that goal. When it was time to go to college, I applied to Berklee College of Music, Eastman, Julliard, and UNLV. Sheryl Aronson: You chose UNLV and are a graduate of their Division of Jazz and Commercial Music. Paul Taylor: I received a full-ride scholarship. UNLV has a great music program, and I played in their jazz band. I went there from \u201878 to \u201882. Our Jazz band went to Poland, South America, and Spain every other year and went on major trips overseas. Sheryl Aronson: Your background in performance and music theory has certainly contributed to a successful career. How did you transition from student to professional musician in Las Vegas? Paul Taylor: I played in lounges and clubs around town for about 15 years. There were lean periods and some good periods, but I always worked on my music. I just never gave up. My big break came when I played on one of Dino Esposito\u2019s sessions at Jeff Lorber\u2019s home studio. A few years later, in 1994, Jeff remembered me and asked me to play with him at the Catalina Island Jazz Festival. Keiko Matsui and her producer/husband Kazu liked my performance and offered me an audition with their band. I was hired and toured with the Matsui\u2019s for two years (appearing on Sapphire and Dream Walk). Kazu Matsui eventually produced my debut album, On the Horn, which gave me the #1 radio hit \u201cTill We Meet Again.\u201d My exposure to Keiko\u2019s band launched my career in the smooth jazz genre. I played with the Rippingtons for a short while from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, I signed with Peak Records, debuting my album Hypnotic, and in 2004, \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d the title track from my 2003 Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz album, became Radio & Records\u2019 third biggest genre airplay cut of the year."}, {"url": "https://jazztimes.com/features/profiles/paul-taylor-pleasure-seeker/", "page_content": "Netting a high chart debut in the competitive smooth-jazz realm is no easy feat. But Paul Taylor\u2019s new effort, Nightlife, debuted on Billboard\u2019s Top Contemporary Jazz Albums chart at No. 2 in April, confirming the saxophonist\u2019s power to motivate notoriously picky record buys. (At No. 1 was Kenny G, another of Taylor\u2019s notable influences.)\n\nThe Billboard showing overjoyed the soprano and alto saxophonist: \u201cI had an incredible week that week,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cIt\u2019s made my year already.\u201d\n\nActually, he\u2019s been running on a high for a while. In 2004, Taylor had a huge hit on smooth-jazz radio with the groove-filled \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d the title track from his 2003 release on Peak. Over the past year he\u2019s also received waves of acclaim from fans for his part on the sellout \u201cGroovin\u2019 for Grover\u201d tour, a traveling tribute to the music of the late Grover Washington Jr. that featured Taylor\u2019s sax skills alongside those of Richard Elliot, Gerald Albright and musical director Jeff Lorber. Cementing his popularity was a high-profile series of appearances recently as a musician character on one of daytime TV\u2019s highest-rated soaps, One Life to Live. That time on TV turned up the heat at his live shows, where throngs of female fans crowd the stage for a chance to dance with the saxophonist during his sultry dance-floor hit \u201cDeeper.\u201d\n\nWhile smooth-jazz radio has long been driven by a plethora of soulful sax stylists, Taylor has managed to emerge from the sea of pop and R&B instrumentalists in the last few years to become one of the format\u2019s tent-pole artists. He has a knack for staying on the contemporary edge while maintaining remarkable consistency over the course of six albums. The frequently touring Taylor is adept at fusing the contemporary and improvisatory, and he\u2019s never content to play sprightly and amusing solos over rote R&B flavored grooves; he\u2019s willing to explore grittier rhythms-hip-hop, dancehall, electronica and house music-to support his horn melodies. As such, Nightlife represents the biggest serving of his multispiced gumbo.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI try to keep my music current,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m about. I try to stay in step with the times. I want people to say, \u2018Oh, man, that\u2019s kickin\u2019!\u2019 I want them to nod their heads, even teenagers and older people. I want to capture all these things in my music and not be dated but contemporary and well-polished.\u201d\n\nA compact man with flowing dreadlocks, Taylor has a sunny, engulfing smile, and he oozes nervous and creative energy.\n\nIn other words, he looks and sounds like a star.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nKey to Nightlife\u2019s success is Taylor\u2019s choice of collaborators. Longtime R&B and pop producer and songwriter Barry Eastmond lends an East Coast smattering of soul to such numbers as the bluesy \u201cAround the Corner\u201d and sexy ballads like \u201cCandlelight\u201d and \u201cSilk \u2018n\u2019 Lace.\u201d He also cowrites tunes with Rex Rideout, best known for coordinating the Grammy-nominated tribute disc Forever, for Always, for Luther on which Taylor makes an appearance. The L.A.-based Rideout first collaborated with Taylor on the saxophonist\u2019s Steppin\u2019 Out and he also cowrote Nightlife\u2019s club-ready title track. \u201cWe have a special bond, a special kinetic thing going now,\u201d notes Taylor.\n\nAlso back is Taylor\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator Dino Esposito. Both went to University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), and when Esposito began pursuing a pop-vocal career during the \u201990s he pulled Taylor into the studio. Taylor\u2019s compositions with Esposito seem to bring out the wildest imaginations in both, with tunes reflecting the influence of world music, electronica, trance and straight pop. The two met with success on such previous Taylor albums as 1997\u2019s Pleasure Seeker, 2000\u2019s Undercover and 2001\u2019s Hypnotic. Esposito is responsible for having Taylor record the atmospheric tune \u201cThings Left Unsaid\u201d in 3/4 as well as for contributing the seeds of the album\u2019s only cover tune, a version of Force M.D.\u2019s \u201cTender Love,\u201d featuring Maxi Priest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done a couple of covers in the past, but I always thought \u2018Tender Love\u2019 was a great song,\u201d Taylor says of the New Jack Swing-era staple. \u201cIt\u2019s a Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production, so I\u2019ve always loved the song.\u201d He adds that he\u2019s always been a big fan of international reggae pop star Maxi Priest, whom he met just moments before recording in New York. \u201cI think his sound transcends over different formats,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cHe\u2019s not locked into one particular sound.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor all his success, Taylor seems reticent when it comes to talking about himself and his journey, preferring to let his music do the talking. Born and raised in Denver, Taylor made his acquaintance with a saxophone at 7. But as Taylor tells the tale with a laugh, saying he didn\u2019t seek out the sax-it was thrust upon him by a father concerned about filling the hours of his young boys\u2019 lives with something constructive: \u201cMy brother and I were sitting at home doing whatever, and my dad came home and said, \u2018You guys want to play a musical instrument?\u2019 And we said, \u2018Sure, why not? Sounds like fun.'\u201d\n\nNext thing the Taylor boys knew, they\u2019d been enrolled in Denver Youth Musicians, a nonprofit organization that taught music to kids and organized them into bands of increasing skill, ending with the Gold Sash Band for high schoolers. \u201cYou have a first meeting and the director looks at your height, your posture, and your hands. They looked at my brother and started him on the clarinet,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThen he looked at me and said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna start you on saxophone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know any better, so I went with it.\u201d\n\nTaylor kept up with the Denver Youth Musicians, eventually gaining first saxophone in the Gold Sash Band. While still underage he started to play gigs in local clubs with the local high school band Mixed Company, where they not only performed Top 40 and funk tunes but also a few jazz classics, including songs by the Crusaders, David Sanborn and Washington Jr.\u2019s \u201cMister Magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter enrolling at UNLV, Taylor began playing the city\u2019s numerous lounges in order to build his chops. Connecting with Esposito at school proved a valuable connection; he got invited to Jeff Lorber\u2019s L.A. digs to perform solos on Esposito\u2019s album, and Taylor kept in touch with the busy funk and fusion keyboardist. In 1994 Lorber invited Taylor to perform with him at the popular Catalina Island Jazz Festival. In another fortuitous turn of events, Japanese New Age pianist Keiko Matsui and her producer-husband, Kazu, caught Taylor\u2019s performance with Lorber, and they were so impressed they offered him an audition, which he aced.\n\nTaylor spent the next two years recording and touring with the Matsuis, appearing on Keiko\u2019s albums Sapphire (1995) and Dream Walk (1996). Kazu then showed further support of the young horn player by producing his debut solo set, On the Horn (1995), which yielded his first No. 1 smooth-jazz radio hit, \u201c\u2018Til We Meet Again.\u201d Taylor credits his time with Lorber and the Matsuis as the real boosts his career needed, and also with helping the nascent artist crystallize his sound.\n\nThough Taylor began to gain attention with other chart singles and was beginning to become a solo concert attraction at the dawn of the new century, in 1999 he took up an offer from Russ Freeman to join the Rippingtons after Jeff Kashiwa left. He joined the superpopular group for a tour and the Topaz album. \u201cI love being a sideman, because it\u2019s a little less pressure-of course, you have to do your part,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI like being a solo artist as well, but I like doing selective things like that, some guest appearances, at the right time in the right tune. Also, you have to worry about not competing with yourself if you have some songs out and you\u2019re gonna play with someone else in the same format-that all comes into play too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith the summer and fall touring season revving up, Taylor is looking forward to performing with his band to promote Nightlife. While the genre is exploding with package tours and cruises, after the \u201cGroovin\u2019 for Grover\u201d bonanza Taylor wants to focus on his own career development-with good songwriting his primary goal. \u201cThe experience of having chart hits over the course of making several albums, I\u2019ve gotten a good sense of what might be a good radio song,\u201d he says, \u201cbut other than that I don\u2019t make my whole album for radio. I just go in and try to make the best music I can.\u201d\n\nListening Pleasures\n\nTaylor has been listening to Seal IV and his iPod, which has more than 400 songs on it-a mixture of rap, smooth jazz, alternative, R&B and Top 40.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGearbox\n\nYanagisawa alto sax, with Guardala mouthpiece, Vandoren reeds (2 1/2 strength) and Olegature ligature.\n\nYanigisawa soprano sax with Dukoff D7 mouthpiece, Rico Plasticover reeds (3 1/2 strength) and Olegature ligature.\n\nApple Macintosh with Garage Band, Pro Tools and Logic Express.\n\nOriginally Published"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Taylor-choreographer", "page_content": "Paul Taylor, in full Paul Belville Taylor, (born July 29, 1930, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died August 29, 2018, New York, New York), American modern dancer and choreographer noted for the inventive, frequently humorous, and sardonic dances that he choreographed for his company.\n\nEntering Syracuse University in 1947 on a scholarship, Taylor took painting classes and joined the swim team.

He also played as a special guest with the Rippingtons for a short time in 1999 and 2000, after Jeff Kashiwa left the group and before Eric Marienthal joined them.\n\n\n\nHe collaborated with many R&B vocalists such as LaToya London, Regina Belle, and Terry Dexter.\n\n\n\nExpanding upon the sensuous and romantic smooth jazz vibe that has made him one of the genre\u2019s most dynamic saxophonists, Paul Taylor makes his fourth Peak Records release a true Ladies\u2019 Choice; creating his most soulful instrumental tracks ever and keeping company with three of today\u2019s most acclaimed female R&B vocalists\u2014Regina Belle, La Toya London and Terry Dexter.\n\n\n\nCapturing all of the soulful grooves, dazzling melodies and seductive magic that have become his trademark, Ladies\u2019 Choice perfectly reflects the incredible synergy the charismatic Taylor has had for over a decade with his devoted audience, and takes his music to a whole new urban adult contemporary dimension. The collection is also the sax man\u2019s third in a row\u2014after 2003\u2019s Steppin\u2019 Out and 2005\u2019s Nightlife--to feature tracks helmed by veteran R&B/jazz producers Barry Eastmond (Al Jarreau, Regina Belle, Jonathan Butler, Anita Baker) and Rex Rideout (Richard Elliot, Gerald Albright, Boney James, Najee). The title was inspired by a special moment that happened every night at clubs throughout the country in the 70s. The DJ would stop the music, take the mike and declare the next song to be \u201cLadies\u2019 Choice\u201d\u2014an invitation for the ladies to pick the guys they want to dance with.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I first got into the studio with Barry at his place in New York, we started completely from scratch and had no idea that the exciting Ladies\u2019 Choice idea would emerge,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cGenerally, he\u2019ll have some tracks worked up and I\u2019ll start with some melodic ideas and take it from there. When we listened back to the first song we wrote, its cool thumping old school vibe just reminded me of those 70s disco nights and the title \u2018Ladies\u2019 Night\u2019 just hit me as the right title to convey the blend of retro-soul, romantic music and contemporary edges we were going for. Once we had established this concept, we expanded on it by including songs sung by some of my favorite female artists. I\u2019ve included vocal tracks before on my recordings, but these ladies are taking my music to a whole new level.\u201d\n\n\n\nEastmond (who produced seven tracks), Rideout (four) and Taylor are all good friends, and Taylor\u2019s two producers have a friendly competition going each time the sax man asks them to come on board. \u201cThey want to know who\u2019s going to do the most tracks,\u201d Taylor laughs, \u201cand who\u2019s going to win out\u2014Barry, whom Rex calls \u2018the king of urban AC,\u2019 or Rex, whose trademark is creating subtle accompaniment that lets me grow and do my thing. I have a dynamic chemistry with both, and each in their own way brings out the essence of what I do with my melodies.\n\n\n\nI know their tracks and soundscapes are going to be amazing, and I look forward to what we\u2019re going to come up with together.\u201d The first five Eastmond-produced cuts on Ladies\u2019 Choice include the title track, \u201cHere We Go\u201d and \u201cStreamline,\u201d three co-writes by Eastmond and Taylor that blend old school soul atmospheres, bouncing bass grooves and the saxophonist\u2019s dashing flair for horn texturing. Taylor\u2019s powerful alto coloring and solo complement London\u2019s passionate voice on the dreamy late night ballad \u201cI Want To Be Loved By You\u201d; his alto also sways behind Belle\u2019s playful and sassy vocals on the crisp, sparsely arranged romance \u201cHow Did You Know\u201d (which she co-wrote with Eastmond).\n\n\n\nEastmond\u2019s other tracks include another lush Belle penned ballad, \u201cOpen Your Eyes,\u201d which features a searing vocal/sax duet energy; and the sweet and breezy, old school-vibin\u2019 \u201cSummer\u2019s End.\u201d Rideout produced the other two incredible vocals on Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sensuous, almost mystical \u201cLong Distance Relationship,\u201d which features beautiful voice texturing behind the lead of Terry Dexter, and the mid-tempo and brassy, classic blues and soul flavored \u201cA Love Of Your Own\u201d (a cover of an Average White Band classic) with vocalist Lauren Evans; Evans also co-wrote \u201cLong Distance Relationship\u201d with Rideout and guitarist Darrell Crooks. Rideout also helmed the sizzling, hard-edged disco-fied \u201cOverdrive\u201d and the funky; horn inflected closer \u201cPoint Of View.\u201d\n\n\n\nA native of Denver, Taylor has lived and worked in the thriving musical environment of Las Vegas since graduating as a music performance major from UNLV. He began playing sax at age seven and discovered his true calling while playing in a local high school garage band called Mixed Company, which played Top 40, funk and Crusader-styled fusion. Aiming to build his resume beyond the many dues-paying Vegas lounge gigs that marked his early professional life, he commuted often to Los Angeles and hooked up in the late 80s with (his later producer) Dino Esposito. Taylor did one of Esposito\u2019s sessions at Jeff Lorber's home studio; a few years later, in 1994, the popular keyboardist remembered Taylor and asked him to play with him at the Catalina Island Jazz Trax Festival. Popular keyboardist Keiko Matsui and her producer/husband Kazu liked Taylor\u2019s charismatic performance and soon offered him an audition with their band. He recorded and toured with the Matsuis for two years (appearing on Sapphire and Dream Walk), and Kazu Matsui eventually produced the sax man\u2019s debut On The Horn, which spawned the #1 radio hit \u201cTill We Meet Again.\u201d Taylor quickly found his own niche in the smooth jazz world, and his quick but well deserved popularity led Pleasure Seeker to the top of the radio charts. The #1 title track was one of Radio & Records most played genre cuts of the year.\n\n\n\nAlthough Taylor has since been one of the genre's most popular live attractions as a solo artist, he eagerly accepted Russ Freeman\u2019s invitation to tour with The Rippingtons as a special guest artist in 2000\u2014the year he released his third album Undercover--after Jeff Kashiwa left the group. After making his Peak debut with 2001\u2019s Hypnotic, Taylor\u2019s career reached a fever pitch in 2004 when \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d the title track from his 2003 Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz album, became Radio & Records\u2019 third biggest genre airplay cut of the year. He also toured as a featured performer with the all-star \u201cGroovin\u2019 For Grover\u201d lineup (including Jeff Lorber, Richard Elliot and Gerald Albright) and performed and made his acting debut on the legendary ABC soap opera One Life To Live. The incredible momentum continued with his 2005 release Nightlife, Taylor\u2019s latest to hit the Top Five of Billboard\u2019s Contemporary Jazz Chart. After participating in Norman Brown\u2019s Summer Storm II tour in 2006, the saxophonist began 2007 aboard the Brian Culbertson All-Star Smooth Jazz Cruise as a featured headlining performer.\n\n\n\nThis year, he is looking forward to sharing numerous tour dates with Regina Belle. \u201cFor me, the whole music making process begins with me in a room with the sax, writing melodies from the heart,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cIn addition to working with Barry and Rex again, it\u2019s been a great experience to work with these incredible ladies. The best part of this project was just being able to get in the studio and do it. It\u2019s easy to take this journey for granted, but I\u2019m grateful to be alive to share the music that\u2019s in my heart with the fans. I feel very lucky that I\u2019ve been able to make it happen for so long.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the high points of Taylor\u2019s live performances is the segment when he invites a handful of excited female fans onstage to sway along with him as he plays his hit song \u201cDeeper.\u201d With Ladies\u2019 Choice, the sweet ongoing seduction goes deeper still!\n\n\n\n(2) Paul Taylor - Psytrance DJ\n\n\n\nAlready well known internationally as a DJ with a unique ability to source and play the freshest sounds, Paul\u0081fs credentials are well documented. A veteran from Goa parties since the mid nineties, he was quickly noticed by TIP records and joined in 2001 as a label DJ along with Dimitri Nakov and Raja Ram. After two years in the London Tip Office, he then relocated to Ibiza where he soon began to co produce music with artists such as Earthling, Shanti and Bushman.\n\n\n\nIn 2002 he joined Spun Records as Ibiza label manager and A&R/DJ, compiling the very well received Spun Complilation: Tweakers\u0081. A regular at many of the bigger events in Europe, Mexico, South America, Israel and Japan, Paul is one of the most sought after Psy Trance DJ\u0081's around the world, having made his reputation for playing powerful sets of his own particular style of Hi Tech inspired Full On and continuously pushing the boundaries of the Psy Trance medium. His exacting taste, and ability to source music has led to five very successful V.A compilations so far, on labels such as Crystal Matrix, Spun, Sirius, & Sound Sorcery; all of which have been firm favourites with on the world DJ circuit.\n\n\n\nHis new record 'High Times' (Kundalini 2008) was originally meant as another V/A compilation. However Paul soon decided to craft his own sounds and the album soon became an artist album under his own name. With a focus on a more minimal sound 'High Times' reflects on the tech-trance of the late 90's but gives it a new fresh edge with some tight production and forward thinking.\n\n\n\n(3) Paul Taylor - Experimental Musician\n\n\n\nOne half of Sutcliffe J\u00fcgend and occasional solo artist."}, {"url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/g33240107/famous-musicians-songs-written-for-other-artists/", "page_content": "I hate to break it to you, but every single music artist doesn\u2019t actually write their own music (they can\u2019t all be Taylor Swift!!!).

Surveying great moments in Paul Taylor Dance Company history, the planned program of the masterworks Aureole, 3 Epitaphs, Piazzolla Caldera, and Esplanade is a treat for The Bend\u2019s dance lovers and a perfect Taylor primer for those new to dance.\n\n\u201cOne of the funniest dances anywhere. An essay on posture and gesture \u2014 and genius.\u201d \u2013 Newsday\n\nHis first major success, the sunny Aureole (1962) launched a golden age for Taylor\u2019s then 8-year-old dance career. He set his trailblazing \u201cloping antelope style\u201d (New York Post) of modern movement not to contemporary music but to baroque concertos composed two centuries earlier. The Post also wrote, possibly considering the weightless white costumes, \u201cThere is an interestingly variegated luminosity of spirit that recalls fluffy clouds on Shakespeare\u2019s summer\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s first professional work and his first collaboration with artist Robert Rauschenberg was Jack and the Beanstalk. Two years later Taylor choreographed 3 Epitaphs (1956) set to New Orleans jazz funeral music for his own troupe while dancing for Martha Graham; once again collaborating with Rauschenberg on costumes. Of it, Newsday wrote, \u201cOne of the funniest dances anywhere. An essay on posture and gesture \u2014 and genius.\u201d The piece 3 Epitaphs was also danced at Italy\u2019s Spoleto Festival a few years later during Taylor\u2019s first European tour.\n\nThe music of tango with its Spanish, Italian, Indian, African, and Jewish influences, was taken to new heights by Astor Piazzolla. Without a single authentic tango step, Paul Taylor captured the essence of tango culture. In a dimly lit dive, working-class men and women confront each other in sizzling sexual duets and trios in another Taylor runaway hit Piazzolla Caldera (1997). It had its creative process documented in the theatrical release Dancemaker, shown in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe exuberant Esplanade (1975) is the first work Taylor made after he retired from dancing and turned exclusively to choreography. Inspired by the sight of a girl running to catch a bus, he created a masterwork based on pedestrian movement. If contemporaries like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg could use ordinary found objects like Coke bottles and American flags in their art, Taylor would use such found movements as standing, walking, running, sliding, and falling. \u201cIt confers a mythic dimension on ordinary aspects of our daily lives. It\u2019s unfaked folk art,\u201d wrote The New Yorker. One of several Taylor dances set to music by Bach, it was immediately acknowledged by many critics and dance professionals as one of the greatest dance works ever created.\n\nThe venerable company is now led by Taylor\u2019s chosen successor, Artistic Director Michael Novak. Of his role Novak has said, \u201cLooking at this man\u2019s oeuvre, and deciding how to honor him, has been at the forefront of my mind. And, in taking a cue from our Founder, I decided to do what has never been done: launch a multi-year global celebration that brings together masterpieces in his great repertoire, all to create an unprecedented opportunity for audiences to connect with Paul\u2019s history \u2014 and the history of modern dance \u2014 like never before.\u201d\n\nCelebrate American master and dancemaker Paul Taylor at this once-in-a-lifetime tour to the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, a two-day event February 7\u20138 that brings down the curtain on the Presenting Series 2019\u20132020 season of dance."}, {"url": "https://americansongwriter.com/20-songs-you-didnt-know-richard-marx-wrote-for-other-artists/", "page_content": "To some, Richard Marx may be most known for his solo career, and a collection of hits, including late \u201980s smashers \u201cShould\u2019ve Known Better,\u201d \u201cHold On to the Nights,\u201d off his 1987 self-titled debut, and the ever-present Repeat Offender ballad \u201cRight Here Waiting.\u201d Throughout his career, the singer, songwriter, musician, and producer has even released 12 albums of his own, including his most recent Limitless in 2020.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nYears before his successful run as a solo artist, Marx was already an established session musician, backing vocalist, and songwriter, working and collaborating with Kenny Rogers and longtime co-writer and co-producer David Foster, and continuing to write and produce music for Madonna, NSYNC, Vince Gill, Josh Groban, Luther Vandross, Kenny Loggins, Barbra Streisand, Keith Urban, and more throughout his 40-plus year career.\n\n\u201cI think when you\u2019ve been writing songs as long as I have, you do find yourself convincing yourself that you have a formula, not to write hit songs,\u201d said Marx. \u201cI\u2019ve never written a song that I thought was a hit at the time. Every song that\u2019s become a hit, all of those songs that I wrote were just songs that I liked. \u2026 So I\u2019m never going to be somebody who is going to sit here and bullshit you and tell you that I think I know what a hit song is. \u2026 But along the way, when you\u2019ve been doing it for decades, you do fall into, not routines, but there\u2019s a way that I write songs, generally.\n\nMarx added, \u201cOnce in a while, you break out of that and that\u2019s when I think the magic happens, when you kind of break your own rules or you just don\u2019t pay attention to your own rules and that\u2019s kind of hard to do when you\u2019ve been doing it as long as I have.\u201d\n\nHere are 20 songs Marx wrote or co-wrote\u2014and sometimes produced\u2014for other artists since 1984.\n\n\u201cCrazy\u201d Kenny Rogers (1984)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Kenny Rogers\n\nReleased as the second single off Kenny Rogers\u2019 16th album What About Me? \u201cCrazy\u201d marked the 11th No. 1 hit for the country singer as a solo artist, after parting ways with the band First Edition in 1976. In addition to co-writing the song with Rogers, Marx served as a session musician and backing vocalist for the track, which was produced by David Foster and Rogers.\n\n\u201cWhat About Me?\u201d Kenny Rogers (1984)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx, Kenny Rogers, and David Foster\n\nA three-way love song, the title track off of What About Me? was recorded by Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes, and James Ingram after several pairs of artists backed out of the project for various reasons, including Lionel Richie and Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton-John and Jeffrey Osborne. Once released, the song was a hit, reaching No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n\u201cThe Best of Me,\u201d David Foster, featuring Olivia-Newton John (1986)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx, David Foster, and Jeremy Lubbock\n\nAlready a hit-making songwriter and producer, when it was time for David Foster to release his own debut The Best of Me, the album boasted a title track, originally co-written with Marx and Jeremy Lubbock in 1982. For the album, Foster called on Olivia Newton-John to single the song with him. Upon its release, \u201cThe Best of Me\u201d peaked at No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n\u201cSurrender to Me\u201d Ann Wilson and Robin Zander (1988)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Ross Vanelli\n\n\u201cSurrender to Me\u201d was a power ballad sung by Ann Wilson and Cheap Trick\u2019s Robin Zander and featured on the soundtrack to the 1988 romantic thriller Tequila Sunrise, starring Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Kurt Russell. By 1989, the song peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\u201cEdge of a Broken Heart,\u201d Vixen (1988)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Fee Waybill\n\nIt was still the heyday of metal, and Vixen\u2019s self-titled debut featured their triumphant power ballad \u201cEdge of a Broken Heart,\u201d written by The Tubes\u2019 Fee Waybill and Richard Marx, who also played keyboards on the track. The song reached No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and Marx even makes a cameo in the music video. Vixen later released an acoustic version of the song on their 2018 Live Fire album.\n\n\u201cSay It,\u201d Lisa Nilsson (1989)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Paul Anka\n\nSwedish singer and actress Lisa Nilsson\u2019s debut Lean on Love featured a song penned by Marx and Paul Anka, \u201cSay It.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only time Marx collaborated with Anka. The pair previously teamed up to co-write \u201cUntil the Day We Said Goodbye,\u201d off Anka\u2019s 1987 album Freedom.\n\n\u201cThe Last Words You Said,\u201d Sarah Brightman with Richard Marx (1998)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Janey Clewer\n\nOf the sixth album, Eden, by English soprano Sarah Brightman, \u201cThe Last Words You Said\u201d appeared on the international version of the album, which mixed Italian arias and English language songs. Marx also duets on the track with Brightman.\n\n\u201cIf You Ever Leave Me,\u201d Barbra Streisand and Vince Gill (1999)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and David Foster\n\nWritten and produced by David Foster and Richard Marx, the single, featuring a duet between Barbra Streisand and Vince Gill, appeared on Streisand\u2019s 28th album A Love Like Ours, and again on her 2002 Duets album.\n\n\u201cStill Holding Out for You,\u201d SHeDaisy (1999)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Kristyn Osborn\n\nThough the country group SHeDaisy, also known as The Osborn Sisters, disbanded in 2011, their 1999 debut The Whole SHeBANG boasted several singles, including the Richard Marx- and Kristyn Osborn-penned \u201cStill Holding Out for You,\u201d which reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song later appeared in the Disney\u2019s 2001 animated film Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp\u2019s Adventure.\n\n\u201cAngel on My Shoulder,\u201d Natalie Cole (2000)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Natalie Cole\n\nFirst released by Natalie Cole in 2000, the song accompanied the TV movie about her life Angel On My Shoulder. Marx also produced the album of the same name for Cole. \u201cWorking with her was a dream,\u201d said Marx in a 2021 Instagram post remembering Cole and their collaboration. \u201cLoved her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis I Promise You,\u201d N\u2019SYNC (2000)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx\n\nWhen A&R executive David Novik asked Richard Marx if he had a song for NSYNC, \u201cThis I Promise You\u201d came to mind. Initially, Marx had written the song with a trio girl group in mind but easily transitioned it to fit the boy band. The ballad reached No. 5 on the Hot 100 chart for NSYNC and appeared on their second album No Strings Attached. Marx even recorded the song himself on his 2010 acoustic album Stories to Tell and again as a duet with Asian artist Sabrina on Now and Forever: The Ballads.\n\n\u201cTo Where You Are,\u201d Josh Groban (2001)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Linda Thompson\n\n\u201cTo Where You Are\u201d spent 36 weeks, including two weeks at No. 1, on the Adult Contemporary chart\u2014not bad for a single off Josh Groban\u2019s self-titled debut. Groban even performed the song on the 2001 \u201cNine-One-One\u201d episode of the TV show Ally McBeal and again at the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. In 2019, Marx also recorded his own version of \u201cTo Where You Are\u201d on his acoustic album Stories to Tell.\n\n\u201cDance With My Father,\u201d Luther Vandross (2003)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Luther Vandross\n\nMarx and Vandross had already collaborated on several songs, first working on \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d off Vandross\u2019 1995 holiday album, This is Christmas then again on the track \u201cIsn\u2019t There Someone,\u201d for his 1998 release I Know. Co-written with Richard Marx, Luther Vandross\u2019 homage to his late father \u201cDance with My Father\u201d is the title track off the R&B singer\u2019s 2003 album. The song and album are dedicated to Vandross\u2019 late father, Luther Vandross, Sr., who died following complications of diabetes when the singer was only 8 and would dance with him and his mother.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of reasons why Luther asked me to co-write this song with him,\u201d said Marx. \u201cPart of the reason was because we were friends and our history of writing together. But more importantly, I think he remembered how very close I was with my own dad, who had died in 1997. In fact, Luther had helped me get through the rough time I had after my father died. \u2018Dance With My Father\u2019 was a personal song he was sharing with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDance With My Father\u201d earned Vandross and Marx a Grammy for Song of the Year and Vandross another for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2004, just a year before the artist\u2019s own untimely death at the age of 54.\n\n\u201cSomeday,\u201d Vince Gill (2003)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Vince Gill\n\nOff Vince Gill\u2019s 10th album Next Big Thing, \u201cSomeday\u201d was one of four singles released and reached No. 31 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. \u201cI\u2019m such a big fan of Vince\u2019s,\u201d said Marx. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest singers ever, and for the song to have come out so well, means a lot to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe One That Got Away,\u201d Kenny Loggins (2003)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Kenny Loggins\n\nWhen Kenny Loggins released his 12th album It\u2019s About Time, it was his first album after leaving his previous label Columbia and his first non-children\u2019s or holiday album in six years. For the 10 tracks, Loggins called on friends Clint Black, Michael McDonald, and Richard Marx to co-write songs. Marx wrote four tracks on the album, including \u201cThe One That Got Away.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m also proud of a song I wrote with Kenny Loggins, called \u2018The One That Got Away,'\u201d said Marx. \u201cKenny says that when he performs this song live, he gets a standing ovation. It\u2019s a very personal song for Kenny, about his estrangement from one of his sons from his first marriage. What I love, is that Kenny says this song helped bring them together.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter Life,\u201d Keith Urban (2004)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Keith Urban\n\nKeith Urban\u2019s fourth album Be Here, produced three No. 1 singles on the Hot Country Songs chart, including \u201cMaking Memories of Us,\u201d \u201cDays Go By,\u201d and the Marx- and Urban-penned \u201cBetter Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d Toni Braxton (2006)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx\n\nWritten and produced by Richard Marx, \u201cSuddenly\u201d was released on the European edition of Toni Braxton\u2019s 2005 album Libra. For his 2008 album Sundown, Marx later re-recorded the song as a duet with Braxton and later released it as a solo track on his album Now And Forever: The Ballads and again on his 11th album Beautiful Goodbye in 2014.\n\n\u201cHad Enough,\u201d Lifehouse, featuring Chris Daughtry (2010)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx, Jason Wade, and Chris Daughtry\n\nAlt-rockers Lifehouse released \u201cHad Enough\u201d off their fifth album Smoke & Mirrors and collaborated with singer-songwriter Kevin Rudolf as well as Chris Daughtry, who appears on the track, while making the album.\n\n\u201cLong Hot Summer,\u201d Keith Urban (2010)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Keith Urban\n\nPairing up again since Urban\u2019s 2004 album Be Here, Marx co-wrote \u201dLong Hot Summer,\u201d which was released as the third single off Urban\u2019s seventh album Get Closer. The song reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart. \u201cThe music is so easy for Keith and I to write together because we love the same kind of music and we are influenced by the same music,\u201d said Marx. \u201cWe love big hooks and great melodies. But then when we start writing lyrics, I want to kill him and me in a murder-suicide pact. It\u2019s a lot of staring into space and our laptops.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow You Wanna Know,\u201d Jennifer Nettles (2014)\n\nWritten by Richard Marx and Jennifer Nettles\n\nWhen Jennifer Nettles, lead vocalist of the country duo Sugarland, released her solo debut in 2014, it featured 10 tracks written or co-written by Nettles as well as a cover of Bob Seger\u2019s No. 1 hit \u201cLike a Rock.\u201d Produced by Rick Rubin, Nettles also collaborated with songwriters Butch Walker, Sara Bareilles, and more on the album, including Richard Marx, who co-wrote \u201cKnow You Wanna Know\u201d with her.\n\nPhoto by Jo Hale/Redferns"}, {"url": "https://www.musictimes.com/articles/81901/20200703/songs-paul-mccartney-wrote-other-artists.htm", "page_content": "Sir Paul McCartney first found fame as the bassist and co-lead vocalist for the Beatles. Moreover, he has established his songwriting prowess largely as a part of the Lennon - McCartney. Together with fellow Beatle John Lennon, they both did music and lyrics, contrary to the usual partnership of a composer and a lyricist.\n\n(Photo : Keystone via Getty Images)\n\ncirca 1960: Paul McCartney on stage at the Cavern nightclub in Liverpool during the early days of British beat group The Beatles.\n\nHowever, aside from being behind most of The Fab Four's successful hits, Macca himself also wrote songs for others aside from The Beatles. Here are four songs, mostly written by Paul McCartney himself, for other artists: \"I'll Keep You Satisfied\" (1963) This hit single from Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas is attributed to the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team. However, according to the Todd Compton book \"Who Wrote the Beatle Songs? A History of Lennon-McCartney,\" Paul has written most of the track. It was reportedly recorded on October 14, 1963, at the Abbey Road Studios, with John Lennon himself present during the session. Upon its release, it peaked at No. 4 in the UK charts and stayed for 13 weeks. It contended with The Beatles' \"She Loves You,\" another hit from the duo. \"Come and Get It\" (1969) Paul McCartney wrote this track for the 1969 film \"The Magic Christian,\" with the British band Badfinger performing it. \"Come and Get It\" marked the first single for the Welsh-English rock band under the name Badfinger. The Pete Ham-led group was formerly known as The Iveys. Actually, McCartney first recorded a demo of the track as he arrived early for a Beatles recording session for \"Abbey Road.\" The difference between Macca and the Badfinger version is that the commercially released version was slightly slower. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also entered the Top 5 in other countries such as the UK, Ireland, and Canada. \"Woman\" (1966) In the 1960s, the Lennon-McCartney duo has previously written three singles for the pop duo Peter and Gordon. \"A World Without Love,\" \"Nobody I Know,\" and \"I Don't Want to See You Again\" were all successful singles for the pop duo. In 1966, Paul wanted to test out if he can craft another hit for Peter and Gordon without the famous songwriter byline attached to it. In the book \"The Unreleased Beatles,\" writer Richie Unterberger included an anecdote where Paul commented at a press conference that the pop duo doesn't just get hits because of their songwriting tandem. In fact, McCartney wrote this song under the pseudonym Bernard Webb. While it only peaked at No. 28 in the UK singles chart, it topped the Canadian Top Singles and peaked at No. 14 in the Hot 100. RELATED: Meet Britain's Got Talent's Grandma Drummer Who Toured With The Beatles \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" (1963) While fans might debate over which is better: The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, the fact is that these two rock legends have worked together. In 1963, the Lennon-McCartney duo wrote \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" for the Rolling Stones. It would also be released by The Fab Four later, with their own version of the song. As the Stones second single on November 1963, it immediately became successful. It peaked at No. 12 on the British singles chart. In a 2016 interview with the Rolling Stone (the magazine, not the band), Paul McCartney recalled that his band was friends with Mick Jagger's group. Macca thought that the song would be good for them.\n\n\u00a9 2015 MusicTimes.com All rights reserved.

Well, spoiler alert: A lot of singers don't write their own songs. Shocking, I know. It's almost as if songwriting is a completely separate skill from singing! There are some truly shocking hit songs that were written by other artists when you take a look through songwriting history, though.\n\nFor example, did you know Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" isn't an original Whitney Houston song? I feel like this one is pretty well known at this point, but there are still those who don't know that Houston's arguably most iconic song is actually a cover of a song of the same name by Dolly Parton. Yup, \"I Will Always Love You\" was originally a country love song.\n\nSingers not writing their own music (especially in the pop genre) is actually really common. And frequently enough, songwriters end up becoming famous singers in their own right once they get to a point where they no longer want to simply sell the songs they write. But it is one hell of a lucrative line of work once you start making money off selling your tracks to big-name artists.\n\nHere are 27 hugely popular songs that were written by other famous artists:\n\n01 \"Party In The U.S.A.\" \u2014 Miley Cyrus Songwriter: Jessie J Before she rose to fame as a solo artist, Jessie J wrote one of Miley Cyrus' biggest hits, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She told Glamour U.K. in 2014 that she had originally written the song for herself with Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly, but ended up not recording it. She said the song ended up paying her rent for three years.\n\n02 \"Love Yourself\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran penned \"Love Yourself\" from Bieber's Purpose album, then he had Bieber on his own No. 6 Collaborations Project on the track \"I Don't Care.\"\n\n03 \"Make It Right\" \u2014 BTS Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran also contributed to K-Pop sensation BTS' 2019 album, Map Of The Soul: Persona, with the song \"Make It Right.\"\n\n04 \"Sorry\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Julia Michaels Julia Michaels has now made a name for herself as a solo artist, but she started out writing hits for other artists for a minute. She penned Justin Bieber's \"Sorry\" for his Purpose album, arguably the album's biggest hit.\n\n05 \"Baby\" \u2014 Justin Bieber Songwriter: Christina Milian Try not to let this blow your mind, but Christina Milian is responsible for Justin Bieber's first hit. Yes, it's true. She wrote \"Baby.\" She did that. Bieber has Usher to thank for discovering him, but he owes a heck of a lot to Milian.\n\n06 \"Irreplaceable\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Ne-Yo Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't write a lot of her own songs. Lots of mainstream artists don't, honestly. But Ne-Yo does! The \"So Sick\" singer wrote Queen Bey's early classic \"Irreplaceable,\" and reportedly regretted selling it afterwards. I would too! That song's iconic.\n\n07 \"Diamonds\" \u2014 Rihanna Songwriter: Sia Shine bright like... all the money Sia has in the bank thanks to writing Rihanna's \"Diamonds.\" The devil works hard, but Sia works harder.\n\n08 \"Hollaback Girl\" \u2014 Gwen Stefani Songwriter: Pharrell Williams I'm going to let you in on a little secret: Pharrell Williams is behind just about every iconic song you could think of. The list gets even more overwhelming when you factor in the songs he produced. Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\" is one of countless hit songs he penned.\n\n09 \"Pretty Hurts\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Sia Pharrell Williams and Sia have a lot in common in that they've grown successful for writing songs for big-name artists. Sia wrote \"Pretty Hurts,\" the opening song to Beyonc\u00e9's 2013 self-titled album.\n\n10 \"Breakaway\" \u2014 Kelly Clarkson Songwriter: Avril Lavigne I'll spread my wings and I'll... buy a song from Avril Lavigne! Clarkson's 2004 hit was actually written by emo queen Avril Lavigne. And then it was featured in The Princess Diaries 2. Yes, I remember that. No, I feel no shame.\n\n11 \"American Boy\" \u2014 Estelle, Kanye West Songwriter: John Legend John Legend wrote this classic hit with will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas.\n\n12 \"Better Man\" \u2014 Little Big Town Songwriter: Taylor Swift Swift returned to her country music roots to pen Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" in 2016.\n\n13 \"Forget You\" \u2014 Ceelo Green Songwriter: Bruno Mars Before he was a solo artist with an Album of the Year win under his belt, Bruno Mars penned Ceelo Green's stupidly catchy \"Forget You.\"\n\n14 \"Get Me Bodied\" \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 Songwriter: Solange Bey likes to keep it in the family. Solange Knowles actually wrote a lot of songs on Beyonc\u00e9's past albums! She wrote \"Get Me Bodied\" (and was featured in the music video), \"Upgrade U,\" and \"Why Don't You Love Me\" for her older sister.\n\n15 \"Till The World Ends\" \u2014 Britney Spears Songwriter: Kesha Kesha is a pop star in her own right, but she wrote \"Till The World Ends\" for the Princess of Pop herself.\n\n16 \"I'm A Slave 4 U\" \u2014 Britney Spears Songwriter: Pharrell Williams Who freaking knew that Pharrell wrote \"I'm A Slave For U?!\" He also wrote Snoop Dogg's \"Drop It Like It's Hot,\" Nelly's \"Hot In Herre,\" and Kelis' \"Milkshake.\" The talent this man has. The power this man has. The cultural impact this man has made.\n\n17 \"Little Things\" \u2014 One Direction Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Ed Sheeran is behind a lot of your favorite One Direction songs, \"Little Things\" being one of the not-so-little hits. Sheeran also wrote \"18,\" \"Moment,\" and \"Over Again\" for the group.\n\n18 \"Strip That Down\" \u2014 Liam Payne Songwriter: Ed Sheeran Sheeran continued his One Direction legacy by writing Liam Payne's debut solo single, \"Strip That Down.\"\n\n19 \"Rock Your Body\" \u2014 Justin Timberlake Songwriter: Pharrell Williams Did you think we were done with the Pharrell credits? Think again! Pharrell blessed Justin Timberlake by writing \"Rock Your Body\" and \"Se\u00f1orita\" for Timberlake's debut solo album, Justified.\n\n20 \"Bad Liar\" \u2014 Selena Gomez Songwriter: Julia Michaels Michaels wrote the bop that is \"Bad Liar,\" Selena Gomez's 2017 single. She also wrote Gomez's \"Hands To Myself.\" Now that she's a successful solo artist, I guess Michaels could stop writing hits for other artists. I mean, she could, but why would she want to?\n\n21 \"We Found Love\" \u2014 Rihanna Songwriter: Calvin Harris Rihanna found love in a hopeless place on her 2011 9x-platinum single, but it may not have been inspired by her own romantic endeavors after all. It was actually penned by Calvin Harris, who also appeared in several scenes of the music video.\n\n22 \"Elevator\" \u2014 Pussycat Dolls Songwriter: Lady Gaga The Pussycat Dolls\u2019 song \u201cElevator\u201d took their career to new heights, but what some fans might not have known is that the lyrics were the work of Lady Gaga. Yep, Little Monsters might take an extra liking to the song after learning that fun fact.\n\n23 \"Miss Movin' On\" \u2014 Fifth Harmony Songwriter: Julia Michaels Julia Michaels has written or co-written for dozens of artists aside from herself, including Fifth Harmony. The songstress penned the girl group\u2019s 2013 song \u201cMiss Movin\u2019 On,\u201d written about finding independence after a broken relationship.\n\n24 \"Fire Starter\" \u2014 Demi Lovato Songwriter: Julia Michaels Michael\u2019s long list of credits includes some seriously impressive names, and Lovato is undoubtedly one of the biggest artists she\u2019s written for. Michaels lent her skills on the pop star\u2019s 2013 year track \u201cFire Starter.\u201d\n\n25 \u201cWhataya Want from Me\u201d \u2014 Adam Lambert Songwriter: Pink Lambert\u2019s \u201cWhataya Want from Me\u201d took over airwaves upon its 2009 release. While the American Idol alum is an incredibly talented songwriter, even he gets a little help from friends. Pink was the mastermind behind this particular single.\n\n26 \"Unthinkable\" \u2014 Alicia Keys Songwriter: Drake If you take a look at the songwriting credits for Key\u2019s \u201cUnthinkable,\u201d they include the name Aubrey Graham, better known as Drake.\n\n27 \"Don't Cha\" \u2014 Pussycat Dolls Songwriters: CeeLo Green & Busta Rhymes It was not one, but two, superstar songwriters who hit the studio to write \u201cDon\u2019t Cha\u201d for the Pussycat Dolls.
