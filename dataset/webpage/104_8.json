{"Tony La Russa Jr. was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.": [{"url": "https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/la-russa-tony", "page_content": "For Tony La Russa, managing a Major League Baseball team was way down on his list of career goals.\n\nFirst, it was big league player. Then, he wanted to be a lawyer. But when he finally found his true calling, La Russa needed little time to establish that he was one of the best skippers the game has ever seen.\n\n\u201cEvery successful manager has players,\u201d La Russa said. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 message. Coaches and managers don\u2019t decide baseball. Players decide it. But what you do as a coach or coaching staff is you have a responsibility and opportunity to help put the players in their best position to compete.\u201d\n\nBorn Oct. 4, 1944, in Tampa, Fla., La Russa grew up on the ballfield in Florida\u2019s year-round warm weather. He was pursued as an infield prospect by most of the 20 big league teams, and signed as a $50,000 bonus baby with the Kansas City Athletics immediately following his high school graduation.\n\nBaseball\u2019s rules at that time mandated that La Russa \u2013 due to the size of his bonus \u2013 remain in the big leagues for one full season. That year \u2013 1963 \u2013 La Russa appeared in 34 games, recording 11 hits in 44 at-bats.\n\n\u201cHe made inquiries, studied the opposing batters and always tried to improve his fielding,\u201d said A\u2019s manager Eddie Lopat. \u201c(A\u2019s coaches Jimmie) Dykes and (Mel) McGaha would hit him grounders until they were nearly exhausted.\u201d\n\nBut following the season, La Russa injured his arm playing softball. He would not return to the big leagues until 1968, and he would appear in only 98 MLB games after the 1963 season.\n\n\u201cTony the manager would have really liked and respected Tony the player,\u201d La Russa told Coach and Athletic Director magazine in 2006. \u201cExcept he would have never played him because he was trying to win.\u201d\n\nLa Russa retired as an active player following the 1977 season, having posted a .199 career batting average. But starting in the 1973 offseason, La Russa enrolled in law school with the plan of practicing law after his playing days. He graduated from Florida State University in 1978 and passed the Florida bar in 1979, but by that time had been bitten by the managing bug.\n\n\u201cWith Chicago (in the White Sox\u2019s minor league system), I was a player/coach for a great man named Loren Babe, and it was just like an awakening,\u201d La Russa told The Riverfront Times in 1997. \u201cHe showed me things about managing \u2013 and I thought I was a player who paid attention over the years. I had no clue at all what was involved with managing.\u201d\n\nLa Russa managed the Double-A Knoxville Sox in the Southern League for half a season in 1978, spending the other half of the year as a coach with the White Sox. Then in 1979, La Russa managed the Iowa Oaks of the Triple-A American Association before taking over the White Sox from Don Kessinger on Aug. 2, 1979 \u2013 the day Yankees captain Thurman Munson died in a plane crash.\n\nAt 35, La Russa was the youngest manager in the game.\n\n\u201cHis intelligence was the thing that first attracted me,\u201d said White Sox owner Bill Veeck, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1991. \u201cAnd his dedication. I think we\u2019re going to find that he is one of the really outstanding managers before he\u2019s through.\u201d\n\nLa Russa led the White Sox to a record of 27-27 for the rest of the 1979 season, then guided the club to steady improvement over the next few seasons. Chicago finished with 87 wins in 1982 \u2013 the club\u2019s second full season above .500 in 10 years.\n\nIn 1983, the White Sox won 99 games and the American League West title before falling to Baltimore in the American League Championship Series. He was named the AL\u2019s Manager of the Year \u2013 the first of four times he would win his league's Manager of the Year Award.\n\nLa Russa managed the White Sox through the middle of the 1986 season, when Veeck\u2019s successors dismissed him on June 19. Less than a month later, La Russa took over the Oakland A\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI have never been in anything but an ideal situation. I\u2019m talking about the type of ownership, front office, scouting and development,\u201d La Russa said. \u201cMy friends in managing have only had that once in a while.\u201d\n\nIn Oakland, La Russa again turned around a franchise \u2013 leading the club to an 81-81 record in 1987, the team\u2019s first non-losing season in seven years. Then in 1988, La Russa piloted a young A\u2019s team to 104 wins and the AL West title. Oakland swept through Boston in the ALCS before losing the World Series against a determined Dodgers team.\n\nLa Russa was again named the AL Manager of the Year following the 1988 season.\n\nIn 1989, the A\u2019s returned to the World Series \u2013 and this team swept the Giants to capture the title. Oakland returned to the Fall Classic in 1990, winning 103 games and sweeping the Red Sox again before falling to the Reds.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1991, Oakland won the AL West again in 1992 \u2013 but lost the ALCS against the Blue Jays. It would mark La Russa\u2019s final postseason with the A\u2019s, who began a rebuilding program that eventually culminated in La Russa\u2019s leaving the team following the 1995 season.\n\nIn 1996, La Russa took over the Cardinals. He led St. Louis to the NLCS that year before losing in seven games to the Braves, and also piloted the Cardinals to postseason appearances from 2000-02 \u2013 with La Russa winning the NL Manager of the Year in '02.\n\nThe Cardinals won 104 games and the NL Pennant in 2004 before losing to the Red Sox in the World Series, and also advanced to the NLCS in 2005. Then in 2006, St. Louis rallied down the stretch to win the NL Central Division title with just 83 victories. La Russa, however, guided the Cardinals through the postseason with a flawless hand \u2013 beating Detroit in the World Series to take La Russa\u2019s second World Series title.\n\nLa Russa faced off against longtime friend Jim Leyland in the World Series.\n\n\u201cI have a sneaking suspicion that (La Russa) is the best (manager) of all time,\u201d said Leyland, the Tigers manager who served as a coach on La Russa\u2019s White Sox teams. \u201cI can\u2019t compare eras. In the last 30 years, he\u2019s been the best, there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals returned to the postseason in 2009 by winning the NL Central, then captured a Wild Card berth in 2011. That year, La Russa led his team to another World Championship \u2013 with St. Louis needing 18 of the 19 games available in the three series to win each round.\n\nFollowing the Cardinals\u2019 improbable seven-game win over the Rangers in the World Series, which featured two sequences where the Cardinals were down to their last strike, La Russa retired. His final record: 2,728-2,365 \u2013 good for a .538 winning percentage and the third-most wins all time behind Connie Mack and John McGraw.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s teams finished first in their division 12 times, winning six pennants and three World Series.\n\n\u201cI believe I\u2019m a players\u2019 manager, but only for the players who care about the team and how well we do,\u201d said La Russa, whose intense approach to the game was tempered by his genuine care for the men who played it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about those things, if you\u2019re not going to try hard and care about what we do, then I\u2019m not a players\u2019 manager.\u201d\n\nLa Russa returned to the dugout after a nine-year absence on Oct. 29, 2020, for his second stint as White Sox's manager.\n\nLa Russa was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2014."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/news/tony-la-russa-joe-torre-bobby-cox-elected-to-baseball-hall-of-fame-c64493980", "page_content": "\"When I think of these guys, I think of the respect they've had from their players, their fans and their organizations,\" said Phil Niekro, a Hall of Famer who pitched for both Cox and Torre, was briefly a teammate of La Russa's, and was a member of the election committee. \"They are men of integrity and character. I was honored and privileged to play for a couple of these guys.\n\n\"We're in Disney World right now. This is a Magical Kingdom. I think we just honored the three kings among the managers. It's a magical day for each and every one of them, and we're so excited about having them in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nCox's election is matched up with the candidacies on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot of two Braves pitchers, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who pitched together for Cox for a decade and between them spent 28 seasons with Atlanta. Maddux totaled 355 wins and Glavine won 305. Any electees from the BBWAA ballot will be announced in New York on Jan. 8.\n\n\"I'm still getting goose bumps,\" Cox said. \"I'm excited to be in Cooperstown in July and get inducted. It's the greatest honor you can have in baseball. I'm going in with great company. I'm just hoping that Glav and Mad Dog can be up there on the stage with me. They were two of the guys who got me there, or helped get me there. That would be the final, finishing touch, going in with those two.\"\n\nCox, Torre and La Russa were among 12 people on the Expansion Era ballot, which included another landmark skipper, Billy Martin; players Dave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Dave Parker, Dan Quisenberry and Ted Simmons; Marvin Miller, the influential executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association; and iconic Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nNone of the other nine received more than six of the 16 possible votes. Like all Hall of Fame elections, a candidate's name needs to appear on at least 75 percent of the ballots to be elected. On this committee, that was 12 votes. Each member could vote for a maximum of five candidates.\n\nMiller's name had previously been on ballots studied by several permutations of the Veterans Committee, and he missed election by a single vote on the first Expansion Era ballot three years ago. He died last year. Steinbrenner, Martin, Concepcion, Garvey, John and Simmons were also on the previous Expansion Era ballot.\n\nBut the selection of the three managers provided an epic highlight. Monday's announcement assured that the 2014 induction weekend will be one of the most widely attended and covered ever.\n\nTorre and Cox had each attended one recent induction each, while La Russa has never been to one.\n\n\"You realize you want to offer thanks to the people who made it possible,\" said La Russa, whose managing career began with the White Sox under owner Jerry Reinsdorf and is now a consultant to Major League Baseball on on-field issues. \"You want to thank the family. There have been a lot sacrifices by my wife and daughter. You go to the park early and you stay late. And finally, you realize who is sitting behind you. I can categorically state I don't think I will ever feel comfortable as a member of that club.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how I'm going to feel,\" said Torre, who also managed the Mets, Braves, Cardinals and Dodgers and is currently MLB's executive vice president of baseball operations. \"All I know, and Tony just said it, when you see who else is there, players who have obviously been inducted before you and come up every year. It's obviously special to them. I've admired these players even though I might have played or managed against some of them. So I don't know how I'm going to feel, but I can tell you it will be a feeling I've never had before.\"\n\nCox compiled a 2,504-2,001 (.556) record in his 29 seasons, which included four managing the Blue Jays. His Braves won the 1995 World Series while capturing five National League pennants during his 25 years with Atlanta. Cox led Atlanta to a record 14 straight division titles from 1991-2005.\n\nLa Russa had a 2,728-2,365 (.536) record in 33 seasons, winning the World Series with the A's in 1989 and the Cardinals in 2006 and '11. He also guided Oakland to three American League pennants (1988-90) in 10 seasons and the Cards to three NL pennants (2004, '06 and '11) in 16 years. La Russa also spent eight seasons managing the White Sox, taking them to the AL Championship Series in 1983.\n\nFollowing an 18-year playing career in which he had a .297 batting average and one batting title, Torre posted a 2,326-1,997 record, good for a .538 winning percentage. Torre led the Yankees to Series titles in 1996, '98, '99 and 2000 (in addition to 100-win seasons in 1998 and from 2002-04), and six AL pennants. He spent his first 14 seasons a manager with the Mets, Braves and Cardinals, and finished his career managing the Dodgers in 2010. Torre took his teams in New York and Los Angeles into the playoffs every year from 1996-2009.\n\nThe 16-member electorate charged with the review of the Expansion Era ballot consisted of Hall of Famers Rod Carew, Carlton Fisk, Whitey Herzog, Tommy Lasorda, Paul Molitor, Joe Morgan, Niekro, and Frank Robinson; Major League executives Paul Beeston of the Blue Jays, Dave Montgomery of the Phillies, Reinsdorf and Andy MacPhail, formerly of the Twins, Cubs and Orioles. They were joined by historians Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau, Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle, Jack O'Connell, secretary-treasurer of the BBWAA, and Jim Reeves, recently retired from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n\"It's a great day for baseball,\" said Robinson, MLB's executive vice president of baseball development. \"They are three outstanding, quality guys.\"\n\n\"It was amazing in our discussion,\" Reinsdorf said. \"Everyone said you could throw a blanket over them. It was almost like one. They're so similar.\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful, wonderful class,\" said John Schuerholz, the Braves' club president who was general manager beginning in 1990, when Cox returned to the Atlanta bench for the remainder of his career. \"I have a wonderful partner and dear friend elected to the Hall of Fame in Bobby Cox and two friends in Tony and Joe, who are on the instant-replay committee with me, so I've gotten to know them a lot better through that. I'm delighted for all of them.\""}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/10108269/joe-torre-tony-la-russa-bobby-cox-elected-hall-fame", "page_content": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Joe Torre, Tony La Russa and Bobby Cox, baseball's winningest managers over the past four decades, were unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame on Monday by the expansion era committee.\n\nAll three won more than 2,000 games and were selected on all 16 ballots when the committee met Sunday ahead of baseball's winter meetings.\n\nEx-managers, from left, Tony La Russa, Joe Torre and Bobby Cox, together at the MLB winter meetings in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., will be inducted July 27.

Elected with La Russa were former managers Bobby Cox and Joe Torre.\n\n\u201cThey both share so many common things about managing,\u201d La Russa told this newspaper. \u201cThings about the way they competed and got their teams ready to play.\u201d\n\nLa Russa\u2019s stint as the A\u2019s manager from 1986-95 was the middle stop of his career. He guided the Chicago White Sox from 1979-86 and the St. Louis Cardinals from 1996 until his retirement in 2011.\n\nIn looking back, it wasn\u2019t Torre and Cox to whom La Russa felt the closest bond. He shared that with former Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly and Detroit\u2019s Jim Leyland, who retired at the end of the 2013 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by seeing how guys run games,\u201d La Russa said. \u201cYou look at how hard teams play for them. Tom Kelly and Jim Leyland are my two closest friends in baseball. I was talking to Tom today and told him the reason I\u2019m here today is that I never had a day where I wasn\u2019t in a perfect situation.\u201d\n\nLa Russa was hired by the A\u2019s midway through the 1986 season, less than three weeks after being fired by the White Sox. The A\u2019s were 31-52, but they went 45-34 the rest of the way under La Russa. Oakland went 81-81 in 1987, and in \u201988 won 104 games en route to its first of three consecutive World Series appearances.\n\n\u201cTony is an old-school guy, but he was also open to innovation,\u201d said Wally Haas, whose father, Walter A. Haas Jr., owned the A\u2019s from 1980 until his death near the end of the 1995 season. \u201cMy father always said that once he met Tony La Russa, he didn\u2019t want anyone else managing his club.\u201d\n\nThat was put to the test after the 1994 season when the Boston Red Sox tried to lure La Russa away. The elder Haas, in failing health, wanted La Russa to stay. La Russa remained in Oakland, passing on a chance to manage one of baseball\u2019s iconic franchises. He wound up getting another iconic franchise when he took over the Cardinals in 1996.\n\nLa Russa\u2019s innovation was as legendary as his loyalty. Before the 1987 season, he and pitching coach Dave Duncan made Dennis Eckersley a reliever after years as a starter. Eckersley fought the change but became one of baseball\u2019s best closers, saving 320 games for the A\u2019s.\n\nThe year before, in one of his first moves as the A\u2019s manager, La Russa took little-used pitcher Dave Stewart and made him a regular in the rotation. Stewart went 9-5 for the A\u2019s in \u201986, then won 20 or more games the next four seasons for Oakland.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more than deserving,\u201d Stewart said upon hearing the Hall of Fame results. \u201cHe was a player\u2019s manager, someone who had everybody\u2019s respect. There were some big personalities on those teams, Jose (Canseco), Dave Parker, myself, Eck. Tony spent a lot of time communicating with every player, not just a certain group. I think what made him a Hall of Famer was his preparation. I don\u2019t think he ever entered a game where he wasn\u2019t prepared.\u201d\n\nIf anyone owes La Russa a debt, it is Mark McGwire. In 1987, McGwire was the last player to make the A\u2019s roster. Twenty-three years later, in 2010, his name sullied by baseball\u2019s steroids scandal, McGwire received new life in the game when La Russa made him the Cardinals\u2019 hitting coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled for Tony,\u201d said McGwire, now the Dodgers\u2019 hitting coach. \u201cHe was never one to sit down at the end of the day and say \u2018That\u2019s the best I can do.\u2019 He always was looking for ways to be better. He was able to get the best out of everybody.\u201d\n\nUnder La Russa, the A\u2019s went to the World Series in 1988, \u201989 and \u201990, winning in \u201989 against the Giants. They won the American League West in 1992.\n\nLa Russa was an infielder during his playing days, but he blew out his shoulder shortly after being drafted, and his playing career never amounted to much. He lasted six seasons and hit .199. He was 34 years old when the White Sox made him their manager in mid-1979.\n\nHe took the Cardinals to three World Series, winning in 2006 and 2011. At his side in Oakland and St. Louis was pitching coach Duncan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news about Tony,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThe one quality I saw as a manager that stood out to me was his ability to separate every day and approach every day as if it was something special. You know, with most people every now and then, you have a bad day and aren\u2019t into what\u2019s going on. That never happened with Tony. It was like a relentless pursuit of perfection on a daily basis.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-torre-tony-la-russa-bobby-cox-elected-to-hall-of-fame/", "page_content": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Joe Torre, Tony La Russa and Bobby Cox, baseball's winningest managers over the past four decades, were unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame on Monday by the expansion era committee.\n\nAll three won more than 2,000 games and were selected on all 16 ballots when the committee met Sunday ahead of baseball's winter meetings.\n\n\"Managing against them, you certainly learned things,\" said Torre, now an executive vice president for Major League Baseball. \"I am honored to go into the Hall with these two guys.\"\n\nInduction ceremonies will be held July 27 in Cooperstown, N.Y.\n\nTorre became the fifth manager to win four World Series championships, leading the Yankees to titles in 1996 and from 1998-00 - beating Cox's Braves twice.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nOrlando -- Tony La Russa's playing ability was so mediocre, baseball gained a Hall of Fame manager.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, the former A's manager - a three-time World Series winner who is still a Bay Area resident - was unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame by a 16-member expansion-era committee. Former Yankees manager Joe Torre and longtime Atlanta manager Bobby Cox also were named on every ballot in voting announced Monday, and the three will be inducted together in Cooperstown, N.Y., in July.\n\n\"The best way to describe the feeling is: stunned,\" said La Russa, who won six pennants and 2,728 regular-season games with the White Sox, A's and Cardinals. La Russa's victory total is the third-highest all-time behind Hall of Famers Connie Mack and John McGraw.\n\nLa Russa, 69, began his playing career as an 18-year-old with the Kansas City A's in 1963 and spent part of four seasons with the Oakland A's. He hit .199 as a big-leaguer, but his failures as a player served to hasten his managerial career.\n\n\"When I was around 20, 21, I played for a couple of managers, and they said, 'Start thinking about managing,' \" he said.\n\nLa Russa's less-than-successful playing days figured into his work with the clubs he managed, former Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach said. \"His insistence on detail was incredible. Everything was so regimented, starting in spring training,\" Steinbach said. \"When someone would ask, 'Why are you so anal about everything?' Tony would say, 'I couldn't really hit, I couldn't really throw or play defense. I can't hit or throw or play defense now. The only thing I can do is be as prepared as I can be.' \"\n\nAmong La Russa's outside-the-box strategies - now common - was the way he used the bullpen, particularly in assigning a one-inning role to the closer.\n\n\"There was a formula that Tony helped create,\" former A's first baseman Mark McGwire said. \"You look at what ... we did in Oakland with the middle guy, the setup guy and then your stopper, and how they managed the pitching. The game has really evolved because of Tony.\"\n\nIn reimagining bullpen roles, La Russa created a Hall of Famer reliever, Dennis Eckersley.\n\n\"Tony meant everything to my career,\" Eckersley said by phone. \"I wouldn't be in the Hall of Fame without Tony. I had to throw it, but he gave me the opportunity. And he was so competitive - he never took an inning off, he was so intense, every pitch.\"\n\n\"No one wanted to win as much as Tony did,\" Steinbach said. \"He wasn't going to leave a pebble unturned if it would help us win.\"\n\nWally Haas said his father, the late A's owner Walter A. Haas Jr., wanted no one but La Russa running his team.\n\n\"Walter made it clear to me that Tony would be the only manager we'd have as long as we owned the team,\" Haas said. \"Tony was old school and new school, an innovator and an incredible leader.\n\n\"This is a great day,\" Haas said of La Russa's election. \"It's wonderful. ... Tony wanted to win, and he brought that to Oakland in a big way.\"\n\nEckersley said La Russa long has downplayed any mention of the Hall of Fame as a possibility - even Monday, La Russa said that he is \"categorically\" uncomfortable with the notion.\n\nEckersley, a regular at the annual July induction ceremonies, loves the fact that La Russa is going into the Hall with two other great managers of the past two decades.\n\n\"It's so meant to be with the three of them, isn't it?\" Eckersley said. \"That's going to be one hell of a Hall of Fame ceremony.\"\n\nOne knock on the managers elected Monday is their connection with the steroid era, which has affected Hall of Fame player voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America in recent years.\n\nThough all three were elected unanimously, one member of the committee said the issue was a concern, particularly when it came to the Bash Brother-era A's. \"You can't tell me those managers didn't know they had steroid guys,\" the committee member said. \"Look at that Oakland team.\"\n\nLa Russa declined to say which team's logo will be on his Hall of Fame plaque - the smart money is on St. Louis, where he spent his final 16 years - but the Hall of Fame said the announcement will come in two weeks."}, {"url": "https://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/tampas-tony-la-russa-elected-to-baseballs-hall-of-fame/2156370/", "page_content": "LAKE BUENA VISTA\n\nThe dream was hatched on Sunday spring afternoons decades ago at diamonds in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Anthony La Russa taking a break after a long six-day week on his dairy delivery route to bring his son across town or over the bridge to watch actual major-leaguers playing exhibition games. \"Dream the big dream,\" the La Russas would tell their son, and he did.

During a 33-year career he won three World Series and 2,728 games, third most all time.\n\nMonday, La Russa received the game's ultimate honor, election to baseball's Hall of Fame.\n\n\"This,\" La Russa said, \"was never part of the dream.\"\n\nLa Russa, always methodical, had steeled himself for disappointment in the days leading up to the voting and Monday announcement by a 16-member committee.

Many of them are already planning to head to Cooperstown, N.Y., for the July 27 ceremony.\n\n\"We're all so excited,\" Fojaco said, fighting back tears during a midafternoon call. \"I can't even tell you what I feel.\"\n\nLa Russa, 69, was known for his intense personality and innovative methods, specifically for a then somewhat revolutionary handling of relievers on a matchup basis. Though he repeated his claim Monday that he was just doing what made sense, his mark on the game was indelible.\n\n\"The impact he's had on the game, all the different things he's done regarding the usage of the bullpen, lineups, situations \u2026 innovatively speaking, he has had as much influence as maybe any manager possibly,\" said Rays manager Joe Maddon. \"Then the record and the World Series on top of that.\"\n\nRealizing he wasn't going to make it as a player \u2014 with, he jokes, plenty of suggestions from his own coaches \u2014 La Russa started to plan for life after baseball. He earned a law degree from Florida State (to go with an industrial management degree from USF) during the offseason and then passed the Florida Bar with an eye toward opening a practice, probably in Tampa.\n\nBut La Russa had enjoyed managing in the minor leagues, and when he got the first of what he considers several doses of \"good fortune,\" the chance to manage the Chicago White Sox at age 34, he found a new career path.\n\nHe lasted 6\u00bd seasons \u2014 \"The stupidest thing I ever did was letting him get fired,\" Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Monday \u2014 then went on to Oakland, where he won three pennants and a World Series championship in 10 seasons, and then to St. Louis where he won two more championships, retiring, surprisingly, after the second in 2011.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

He'll thank his wife and daughters, for putting up with all the sacrifices, and the coaches and others who helped him along the way. He will look around, specifically at the Hall of Famers who will be seated on the stage behind him, and then, just maybe, he said he'll realize he really does belong.\n\n\"If you're a baseball fanatic, then playing in the big leagues, maybe part of a championship, that was a dream, and (I) pursued it.
