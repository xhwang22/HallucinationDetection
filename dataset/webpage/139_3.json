Surrounded by music from a young age, his grandfather first turned him onto Hank Williams, constantly playing the youngster a plethora of the honky tonk master\u2019s great recordings. Although Williams\u2019 voice came from another world in terms of time, geography, and class, Leger was intrigued by the ways that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. Other seminal influences were slowly added including John Lennon (and the Beatles), Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, the Everly Brothers, Tom Waits, and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005 as Leger turned nineteen he cut his first independently released album. In the sixteen years since then the multi-talented singer-songwriter has recorded nine additional studio albums as well as one live compilation under his own name. In 2014 he was signed to the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings, releasing the critically acclaimed Early Riser that same year. His second Latent release, Nonsense and Heartache, followed in 2017.

With his next Latent album, 2019\u2019s Time Out for Tomorrow, Leger began to receive positive notices in such high-profile music magazines as Uncut and Rolling Stone.\n\nA restless hungry spirit, when not performing and recording under his own name, Leger stays busy with a plethora of side projects including The Del Fi\u2019s (loose improvisatory rock and roll) and the Bop Fi\u2019s (Leger reciting his poetry over jazz accompaniment). He has also been known to work under the pseudonym Hank Holly (bonus points go to those who can figure out where that name came from!). Making the most of his time while off the road due to the pandemic, in 2020 Leger published his first book of poetry Just the Night Birds, made a film for his mailing list subscribers, The Apartment Show He Never Gave, while releasing what he terms a \u201csurprise\u201d album, Songs from the Apartment. In between all that activity, Leger also cut a handful of one-off singles. One of those tracks, \u201cHalfway \u2018Till Gone\u201d recorded with former Moby Grape member Don Stevenson, turned the Replacements\u2019 Tommy Stinson into a fan!\n\nSongs from the Apartment was a stripped-down lo-fi affair recorded in Leger\u2019s home using a cheap tape recorder with an internal microphone. Two songs from the current album, \u201cUnderground Blues\u201d and \u201cSinking In,\u201d were also recorded in Leger\u2019s home, this time using two SM58 microphones fed into his vintage 1981 Tascam 4-track tape recorder. The remaining nine tracks included on Nothing Pressing present Leger\u2019s work in two starkly contrasting soundscapes. \u201cNothing Pressing,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cStill Patience,\u201d are solo acoustic recordings cut live in the studio with little embellishment save Dan Mock\u2019s overdubbed harmony vocals and, on the title track, producer Michael Timmins\u2019 ukulele. The other six tracks are prime roots rock and roll featuring his long-time band The Situation (drummer Kyle Sullivan and bass player Dan Mock). Among the latter songs, \u201cKill It With Kindness\u201d and \u201cHave You Ever Been Happy?\u201d have the kind of drive, energy and spirit that are sure to make them highlights of his future live shows.\n\nLeger often times finds himself at a loss as to explain the source of his songs. He feels his songwriting, while clearly drawing on experiences filtered through a panoply of influences, often verges on being a supernatural experience. Over the course of the eleven songs on Nothing Pressing, the songwriter\u2019s songwriter engages with questions of existence, mortality, hope, trust and heartbreak while simultaneously conjuring feelings of isolation, reflection, longing and gratitude.\n\nPaired with such evocative lyrics are wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, comfortable in his skin and growing as an artist with every release. Nothing Pressing serves a wonderfully refreshing tonic in troubling times."}, {"url": "https://www.lyrics.com/artist/Jerry-Leger", "page_content": "Jerry Leger\n\nJerry Leger (born April 19, 1985) is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

Since 2005, he has released 13 albums (7 solo, 3 credited to Jerry Leger & The Situation and 3 with his side projects, The Del Fi's and The Bop Fi's). [1]\n\nLeger cut his first album when he was 19 in 2005, with frequent producer/musician, Tim Bovaconti. His sophomore record, Farewell Ghost Town, followed the next year. Produced by Don Kerr and Tim Bovaconti and featuring Ron Sexsmith on piano and Fergus Hambleton (of The Sattalites). Farewell Ghost Town was charming not only for its strong songwriting, but also in its unassuming approach.[3]\n\nIn 2007, Leger struck up a friendship with Skydiggers co-founder, Josh Finlayson. This resulted in the 2008 album, You, Me and The Horse, co-produced by Tim Bovaconti. You, Me and The Horse garnered rave reviews and pushed Leger's career forward with appearances on the popular CBC Radio show, Q, in-sessions on the legendary WSM Radio in Nashville and The WDVX concert series, Blue Plate Special in Knoxville, TN.[4]\n\nThe end of 2010 saw the release of Leger's 4th record, Traveling Grey. Ron Sexsmith remarked, \"Traveling Grey is probably Jerry's best record so far and he hasn't made any bad ones.[5]\n\nTraveling Grey is Jerry Leger's fourth album and found him poised to add his name to the roll call that has built Toronto's international reputation as a singer/songwriter Mecca.[6] During this time, Jerry appeared twice on Music City Roots, hosted by singer/songwriter, Jim Lauderdale, who called Leger a great young songwriter.\n\nIn 2011, Jerry released the digital only mini album, The Good Old Days are Back in Drag. Jason Schneider at Exclaim! said \"its seven tracks crackles with the raw energy of a Sun Records single.\" The album artwork is a sketch by Leger.\n\nSome Folks Know was released near the end of 2012, showcasing his longtime backing band, The Situation (James McKie, Dan Mock, Kyle Sullivan), Ron Sexsmith reprising his role on piano and a duet with Serena Ryder. Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star called the album \"the works of a young gifted storyteller\"[7] and \"some folks do indeed already know what he's up to. Time, Jerry. Give it time. It's coming.\"[8]\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Leger met up with Michael Timmins, member and main songwriter in the legendary band, Cowboy Junkies. This resulted in the 2014 album, Early Riser, produced by Timmins and released on the Junkies' own label, Latent Recordings. All Jerry's previous albums had been released independently on his own label, Golden Rocket Records. The album has received high acclaim from Exclaim!, NOW, The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail and CBC. Zachary Houle from PopMatters called the record, \"A commanding and astounding listen\" and \"deserving of any laurels and accolades thrown its way.\"[9]\n\nWinter 2015, the album Crowd Pleaser by his side project, The Del Fi's was released. It was recorded live off the floor in 10 hours with 13 musicians who barely knew or didn't know the material at all. Leger wrote all the songs, with most of them being written very quickly before going into the studio to maintain a spontaneous and loose rock 'n' roll sound. Kerry Doole at Exclaim! wrote, \"He regularly releases albums of a high quality, he's an engaging performer and he has earned major peer respect.\" Adding \"The record does a fine job of capturing the vitality of his band's live show...This is a crowd-pleasing addition to a worthy discography.\"[10] Another side project appeared in 2016 stemming from The Del Fi's called The Bop Fi's featuring poetry written and spoken by Leger with a backdrop of jazz, mainly in the bebop and cool jazz style.\n\nNonsense and Heartache, the Michael Timmins produced double album was released March 31, 2017 on Latent Recordings/Warner Music (in Canada) Proper Music (UK/Europe). It appeared on Polaris Music Prize longer list and Kyle Mullin from Exclaim! said of the album, \"there's no shortage of elaborate artistry on this double LP.\" Leger and the album received high praise in the German edition of Rolling Stone, where Nonsense and Heartache rose to #3 on the Rolling Stone album charts in Germany. The reaction to Nonsense and Heartache brought Leger through Europe and the UK twice in 2018 including the Take Root Festival alongside Kurt Vile, Neko Case, Father John Misty, Alejandro Escovedo, Shakey Graves, John Moreland and others.\n\nA 7-week tour in the Spring of 2019 coincided with the Europe-only release of the compilation Too Broke To Die: Retrospective 2005-2019 featuring studio cuts and two previously unreleased songs.\n\nNovember 2019 saw the release of Time Out For Tomorrow with Michael Timmins producing again. It was met with positive reaction from American Songwriter, Uncut Magazine, The Bluegrass Situation and more. Maik Br\u00fcggemeyer in the German edition of Rolling Stone gave it 4.5 out of 5, praising it a masterpiece while Andrew Frolish, writing for AmericanaUK awarded it 9/10, calling it \"a masterful example of Americana songcraft.\"[11]\n\nSpring 2020 was to see extensive touring behind Time Out For Tomorrow, starting with European and UK dates but all activity was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after the first \u201cstay at home\u201d lockdown in Toronto, Leger released the surprise album Songs From The Apartment in late March. A collection of lo-fi recordings recorded with one microphone in his Toronto apartment were originally used for demonstration purposes soon or immediately after a song was written. All of the songs had previously never been heard by the public except for a version of \u201cYou & Louise\u201d by Leger's side project, The Del Fi's. Leger explained in a press release, \u201cAll shows were cancelled or postponed and it was almost therapeutic for me getting this record together. It also went from being just a surprise record for the fans at a difficult time for all of us, to becoming a favourite of mine. I like having an album like this, completely solo, when you can hear songs recorded at home right after they were written. Not knowing if anyone beyond myself would hear it. It naturally allows a relaxed and uninhibited performance.\u201d [12]\n\nIn August 2020, Leger released the single \u201cHalfway 'Til Gone\u201d, a duet with Don Stevenson from the legendary 1960's San Francisco group Moby Grape, produced by Tim Bovaconti. Jedd Beaudoin, writing for PopMatters said, \u201cthe tune is a subtle but important reminder of Leger's prowess with the pen.\u201d[13] In the fall of that year, his first self-published collection of poetry titled Just The Night Birds was released.[14]\n\nJanuary 21, 2021, the new single \u201cJumped In The Humber\u201d produced by Michael Timmins and featuring Leger's band The Situation, was released. Along with it came news of a limited vinyl release of Songs From The Apartment and a Deluxe Edition of Time Out For Tomorrow, both slated for a March 26, 2021 release date.[15]"}, {"url": "https://tixel.com/au/music-tickets/jerry-leger", "page_content": "Here is a simple four-step procedure to purchase Jerry Leger Show Tickets:\n\n1.

For Earle, who is sixty-five, and Williams, who is sixty-seven, sitting still is anathema; both have been recording and touring since the late nineteen-seventies. They\u2019re both waiting out this strange season in Nashville, and considering, among other things, what the politics of this moment mean for the arts.\n\nEarle\u2019s most recent record, \u201cGhosts of West Virginia,\u201d centers on the Upper Big Branch coal-mine explosion, in 2010, one of the grisliest and most egregious mining disasters in American history. Twenty-nine miners were killed in the explosion, which created a blast that was felt for miles around the mine. Over the past four years, Earle collaborated with the playwrights Erik Jensen and Jessica Blank to develop a companion theatre piece, \u201cCoal Country,\u201d based on first-person accounts of the disaster. The show opened at the Public Theatre, in New York, on March 3rd, and, of course, closed shortly thereafter, as the city shut down to staunch the spread of the coronavirus. Williams\u2019s new album, \u201cGood Souls Better Angels,\u201d is dark, bluesy, and urgent; it was released in late April, and includes a scathing musical indictment of Donald Trump, a song pointedly titled \u201cMan Without a Soul.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon in early July, Earle and Williams met up in a Nashville studio, and I joined them remotely. We talked about songwriting, the legacy of Bob Dylan, the cruelty of online comments, protest music, poetry, compassion, and their decades-long friendship. Some of their music is explicitly political\u2014but even the songs that do not directly address a sitting President or narrate an industrial disaster have things to say about the state of the world; both Earle and Williams are world renowned for their storytelling and the ways in which they structure and refine tender narratives about people getting by, or failing to.\n\nDuring our time together, they both played a few new songs\u2014a tiny concert conducted via Zoom. You can see our conversation, and these performances, in the video above. They finished with a collaborative cover of \u201cDeportee,\u201d which features lyrics by Woody Guthrie. It\u2019s a brutal, heartbreaking song about what happens when we stop regarding one another as human. \u201cMaking art in the United States of America is a political statement in and of itself,\u201d Earle said. \u201cThis is the most hostile environment to art that\u2019s ever existed in the world.\u201d Yet Earle and Williams have kept going. That\u2019s a lesson for all of us."}, {"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lucinda-williams-steve-earle-dwight-yoakam-to-unite-for-lsd-tour-203189/", "page_content": "Three of the most acclaimed country and Americana artists of the past three decades are teaming for a North American tour this summer.

But this dressing-room footage shared by Yoakam, of the trio rehearsing before taking the stage recently, confirms otherwise.\n\nWith fiddle and mandolin accompaniment, and Yoakam on guitar, the three co-headliners harmonize on the country-bluegrass classic, \u201cDim Lights, Thick Smoke (and Loud, Loud Music),\u201d a song about the dizzying allure of a nightclub and its adverse effects on an otherwise-devoted family man, and his wife and children.

Trenton ON Cost: 25.00\n\nToronto-based Americana singer-songwriter Jerry Leger has a strong following in Europe\u2026These are the worn-in songs and poetic melancholia of a welcome stranger, with a laconic style that lives somewhere between Blue Rodeo and Lucinda Williams. \u2013Brad Wheeler, GLOBE & MAIL\n\nJerry Leger has that spark in him that all the great songwriters have. He\u2019s the real deal. \u2013RON SEXSMITH\n\nThe Gently sardonic, arch wordplay and country-rock twang recall Nick Lowe. \u2013Nick Hasted, UNCUT\n\nBorn in the mid-80s, singer-songwriter Jerry Leger came of age in the East End of Toronto. Surrounded by music from a young age, his grandfather first turned him onto Hank Williams. Leger was intrigued by the ways that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. Other seminal influences were added including John Lennon (and the Beatles), Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, the Everly Brothers, Tom Waits, and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005, a nineteen year old Leger cut his first independently released album. In the sixteen years since then the singer-songwriter has recorded 10 additional albums under his own name. In 2014 he was signed to the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings, releasing the critically acclaimed Early Riser that same year. His second Latent release, Nonsense and Heartache, followed in 2017. A year later the two-album set was picked up by Proper Records for distribution in the U.K and Europe, leading to extensive touring throughout the continent, in the process opening up a whole new audience for Leger\u2019s finely crafted songs. With his next Latent album, 2019\u2019s Time Out for Tomorrow, Leger began to receive positive notices in such high-profile music magazines as Uncut and Rolling Stone.\n\nReleased in March of 2022, Jerry\u2019s latest album Nothing Pressing (produced by Michael Timmins) presents his work in two starkly contrasting soundscapes; solo acoustic recordings (with little embellishment) and prime roots rock \u2018n\u2019 roll featuring his long-time band The Situation. Paired with such evocative lyrics are wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, comfortable in his skin and growing as an artist with every release.\n\nWith his band, Leger resumed touring Europe and the UK in support of Nothing Pressing, playing sold out shows in London, Groningen, Trondheim and receiving rave reviews everywhere they went. Upon returning to Toronto, they performed for a packed house at Paradise Theatre.\n\n\n\nGet Tickets\n\n"}, {"url": "https://bluesfesttours.com.au/artist/lucinda-williams-her-band-and-steve-earle-the-dukes/", "page_content": "Three-time Grammy winner Lucinda Williams will be touring Aus with her band on a double headline bill along with Steve Earle - Steve Earle is also a three-time Grammy winner.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ON SALE STARTS Thu 29 September 2022 - 12PM AEST\n\nLUCINDA WILLIAMS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all come full circle,\u201d says Lucinda Williams about her powerful new album, Good Souls Better Angels. After more than forty years of music making, the pioneering, Louisiana-born artist has returned to the gritty blues foundation that first inspired her as a young singer-songwriter in the late 1970s. And after spending the last year on her sold-out \u201cCar Wheels on a Gravel Road\u201d 20th Anniversary tour, Williams has reunited with that game-changing 1998 album\u2019s co-producer and engineer Ray Kennedy, recording Good Souls, Better Angels with her ace touring band at his Nashville studio. Joining them as co-producer is Williams\u2019 manager Tom Overby, to whom she\u2019s been married for a decade and who contributed lyrics to her masterful songcraft. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always dreamed of \u2013 a relationship with someone I could create with,\u201d Williams enthuses.\n\nThe result \u2013 Good Souls Better Angels \u2013 is the most topical album of Williams\u2019 career. The dangerous world we live in, the constant barrage of a frightening news cycle, depression, domestic abuse, a man without a soul \u2013 and, yeah, the devil \u2013 figure prominently among its twelve tracks. \u201cThe devil comes into play quite a bit on this album,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the imagery in Robert Johnson songs and those really dark Delta blues that are sort of biblical. I was inspired by Leonard Cohen \u2013 he dealt with that in his songs \u2013 and Bob Dylan and Nick Cave.\u201d While, Good Souls Better Angels reflects many dark realities that surround us, the album is tied together with themes of perseverance, resilience and ultimately, hope.\n\nSTEVE EARLE\n\n\u201cThis record completes the set, the work of my first-hand teachers,\u201d Earle writes in the liner notes. \u201cThe records were recorded and released in the order in which they left this world. But make no mistake \u2013 it was Jerry Jeff Walker who came first.\u201d\n\nJERRY JEFF is Earle\u2019s 22nd album. He\u2019s released nearly an album a year since getting sober in the mid 1990s, LPs ranging from bluegrass to blues to folk to country. One of America\u2019s most gifted living songwriters, he is singing better than he ever has, working harder. At the moment, he\u2019s writing two books, his second play, and hosts his long running The Steve Earle Show: Hardcore Troubadour Radio on Sirius XM. Throughout the pandemic, he also hosted Steve Earle\u2019s Guitar Town, a YouTube series about his massive instrument collection. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay out of trouble,\u201d says Earle with a laugh. \u201cIf I stay busy, then I\u2019m OK.\u201d\n\nEarle has the rest of 2022 mapped out.

The festival, a tag-team effort from Truideation with MusiCares and Twitch, goes live at 4 p.m. ET/1 p.m PT on Twitch. Subsequent shows will take place on May 13, 20 and 27.\n\nThe timing of the series is key: MusiCares, the charitable wing of the Recording Academy, which has raised nearly $14 million through its COVID-19 Relief Fund, has been forced to stop accepting new applications for the fund until it raises more money, the organization announced last week. MusiCares staff and executives have been hard at work fundraising, but until further notice, the need has outstripped the financial resources. Within days of the shutdown, the Academy and MusiCares formed the COVID-19 Relief Fund, which has become the de facto go-to charity for the music business, marshalling donations from nearly every major music company and distributing more than $14 million to a music community that continues to need aid \u2014 and has been receiving 500 applications per day.\n\nConfirmed guests for future episodes include Allie X, Bryce Vine, Cavetown, Dawes, Empress Of, Hanson, Julia Michaels, Kat Cunning, MAX, Randy Rainbow, Salt Cathedral, and more. The Festival will take place on the frontpage of Twitch (link HERE) and will feature four musical acts and host Matt Pinfield on a single screen.\n\nConversation, collaboration and performances will be intertwined, with each artist performing two songs and a guest DJ to kick off and close out each episode.\n\nViewers can contribute to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund via a \u201cDONATE HERE\u201d button or online at https://tiltify.com/@sessions/sessions. MusiCares was established by the Recording Academy as a safety net in times of need for the music community. MusiCares offers confidential preventive, recovery, and emergency programs to address financial, medical, and personal health issues.\n\nAudio sponsor Logitech, Audio-Technica and eSports Streaming Partner waveform.gg will ensure that the sound and visuals are optimal and broadcast standard."}]}
