He was educated at an endowed school in Alfreton, near Derby. He entered business in Ripley, Derbyshire, but in 1863 was sent to join the Wesleyan Conference of New South Wales and Queensland. After serving on several circuits in New South Wales, in April 1873 he joined the Brisbane circuit, where he quickly made an impact as a forceful and eloquent preacher. He became chairman of the Queensland district, where he was prominent in the formation of a strong loan fund which was to prove important in extending Wesleyan Methodist work in Queensland. He served also in the circuits of Fortitude Valley and Ipswich, and at the Ann Street Church in Brisbane, before a throat infection forced him to retire from the ministry in 1883.\n\nIn 1875, towards the climax of the education controversy in Queensland, Brentnall was instrumental with three other clergymen in establishing the Queensland Evangelical Standard, a journal dedicated to a system of secular education, and thus anti-Catholic in tone. Viewing the 'squatting party' as allies of the Catholics, the Standard adopted a clear political posture, championed the cause of (Sir) Samuel Griffith, a Liberal and son of a Congregational cleric, and poured invective on 'Land Rings and Railway Kings'. Brentnall used his pen with telling effect against the McIlwraith ministry in its handling of the steel rails contract of 1881 and soon afterwards of the land-grant railway proposal.\n\nBrentnall's activity in the business world seems to have been recognized as early as 1881. The Daily Observer, 28 February, openly attacked him in an advertisement: 'Wanted for the Christian Ministry \u2026 Special advantages are now offered to worldly-minded men to join the ranks \u2026 Men of business turn of mind specially eligible for this ministry, and always come to the front. \u201cFervency of spirit\u201d not at all necessary. Shareholders in gold mines, tin mines, newspaper companies, land speculating, and such like heavenly pastures, will always be accepted as specially qualified'. The Standard, smarting under the sarcasm, responded so sharply that its reply led to a libel case. On his retirement from the church Brentnall joined the Telegraph, in which he was a minor shareholder, as a journalist. In 1885 he greatly increased his holdings in the company and became chairman of directors, a position he retained until May 1893, after which he continued to hold a large financial interest. He became increasingly active in business affairs, his directorships included the Queensland Deposit Bank and Building Society, and the Queensland Trustees (later becoming chairman of directors of both companies), Queensland General Insurance, Finney Isles, Coolgarra Tin Mining, Queensland Exploration and Queensland Copper Freeholds. He speculated widely, sometimes successfully, sometimes disastrously, in Queensland mining ventures. He was one of the earliest settlers and landholders at Coorparoo and sold some of his blocks in the boom year of 1888 as it began to emerge as a prestige suburb. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board and for two years first chairman of the Coorparoo Shire Council, where he acted also as shire clerk in 1888-92. In 1886 he had been nominated to the Legislative Council, where he remained active until it was abolished in 1922; in 1893-1902 he was chairman of committees. His political views had gradually become more conservative since the Standard days, especially after the rise of the Labor Party, of which he was an uncompromising enemy. He vigorously opposed 'advanced' legislation and abolition of the Legislative Council. He became a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia (Queensland). He maintained his interest in church life, served on church committees, made settlements on various Methodist institutions, giving them an annual income, and in his will left substantial sums to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1867 he married Elizabeth Watson, daughter of a store-keeper in Mansfield, Nottingham. She had left her position as headmistress of a large Wesleyan day school for girls at Bacup, Lancashire, and followed Brentnall to Sydney to marry him. She was the first president of the Queensland Women's Christian Temperance Union, holding office in 1885-99, and then honorary president until her death in 1909. Brentnall died in Brisbane on 11 January 1925, survived by two daughters: Flora, who in 1893 married Edgar Bridal Harris, a shipping agent, and Charlotte Amelia. He left substantial holdings in the Telegraph Newspaper Co. to his family, and his grandson later became chairman of directors."}, {"url": "https://peopleaustralia.anu.edu.au/biography/brentnall-frederick-thomas-3050", "page_content": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be aware that this website contains names, images, and voices of deceased persons.\n\nIn addition, some articles contain terms or views that were acceptable within mainstream Australian culture in the period in which they were written, but may no longer be considered appropriate.\n\nThese articles do not necessarily reflect the views of The Australian National University.\n\nOlder articles are being reviewed with a view to bringing them into line with contemporary values but the original text will remain available for historical context."}, {"url": "https://popularbio.com/frederick-thomas-brentnall/", "page_content": "Updated On April 30, 2023\n\nFrederick Thomas Brentnall estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

The family lived at Eston, Yorkshire, and Brentnall was educated at private schools at Great Ayton and Darlington. He matriculated at the University of Durham but on leaving school joined the Middlesbrough branch of the National Provincial Bank of England. In 1874 at Bedford he married Caroline Crossley, and for the next few years they lived at Prestonpans, Scotland, where Brentnall worked for a colliery company.\n\nIn 1878 Brentnall decided to migrate to Australia and with his wife and small son arrived in Melbourne in November in the Loch Tay. He brought rigid standards of business ethics and social behaviour, combined with elegant good manners. After working briefly with the London Bank of Australia he established himself as a public accountant, and acquired two existing practices which brought him an immediate clientele of leading businessmen and pastoralists. Despite an early financial setback, owing to a defaulting partner whose liabilities Brentnall fully repaid, he developed sound and valuable connexions as an auditor. His firm was successively Brentnall & Riley, Brentnall, Norton & Co., and Brentnall, Mewton & Butler. In 1886 he helped to found the Incorporated Institute of Accountants, Victoria, becoming president in 1898. In 1907 he was first president of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants and in 1928, when a royal charter was granted, he became first president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. For many years he served the Victorian Companies Auditors' Board as examiner, director and chairman.\n\nBrentnall always loved music. As a boy he learned the violin and organ, and sang in choirs. In Melbourne he played his violin, a magnificent Andreas Guarnerius instrument, sang with the Metropolitan Liedertafel and in the Centennial Exhibition choir of 1888, and acted as organist for several local churches. He was president of the Melbourne Music Club and the Victorian division of the British Music Society, and ultimately was a financial guarantor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in the late 1920s. He welcomed visiting musical celebrities, often entertaining them at his home. On his several visits to London he attended a round of concerts and performances which he recorded in his copious critical diary and later described in his autobiography, My Memories (Melbourne, 1938).\n\nBrentnall was a keen golfer; as early as 1874 he had been a member of the Royal Musselburgh Club in Scotland. His friendship with J. M. Bruce led to the founding of the (Royal) Melbourne Golf Club. Brentnall was the third captain and at 85 claimed that for the previous thirty-five years he had played golf once a week. He presented a set of his early primitive sticks to the club.\n\nBrentnall was an active trustee and vice-president of the Melbourne Newsboys' Society; he was also a director of the Royal Humane Society for forty years, and president for eleven. From 1880 he lived at Newnham, Caroline Street, South Yarra. Predeceased by his wife in 1909 and survived by a son and daughter, Brentnall died at his home on 10 July 1937 and was buried in Boroondara cemetery."}, {"url": "https://kes.org.uk/", "page_content": "King Edward\u2019s School, an HMC independent day school for boys aged 11-18 founded in 1552.\n\n\n\nKing Edward\u2019s School has been at the heart of Birmingham life since it was founded in 1552.
