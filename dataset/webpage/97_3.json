However, his explosive dashes out of the half back line and ball carrying ability did catch the attention of North Melbourne recruiters, and after 43 senior games with the Boroughs between 1990 and 1993, King was taken at number 46 in the 1993 National Draft.\n\nAt North Melbourne, where he fitted seamlessly into an already strong line-up, King enjoyed a very solid first year before going from strength to strength. During the course of an 11-season, 241 game, 145-goal AFL career, he achieved virtually everything the modern game has to offer. A tough, pacy, relentlessly aggressive footballer, he was equally adept in a number of positions, including the wing, a back pocket or half back flank, and ruck-rover. He was a key contributor to the 'Roos 1996 and 1999 premiership victories, and made the AFL All Australian team in 1997 and 1998. He also represented Victoria.

He hung up a sign saying \"Direct To You\" to attract passing traffic.\n\n\u201cWe never wholesaled, we have always sold directly to our customers. This has given us the ability to learn what our customers want and respond directly through product design with solutions to their needs.\u201d\n\nSome 40 years later, French photographer Felix Forest stumbled across a rather slinky two-seater foam sofa in the warehouse that would eventually become his Sydney studio. Drawn to its undulating, continuous seat-back shape, he convinced the owner to relinquish it. Only later did he realise it was an original King Award sofa, vintage 1987.\n\nThe King 'Award' sofa in sculpted foam was designed in 1987. Felix Forest\n\n\u201cThe shape was intriguing and it was incredibly comfortable to sit on,\u201d recalls Forest, who shoots interiors for prestige lifestyle titles around the world. \u201cIt now serves as one of the furniture focal points within my studio space.\u201d\n\nThat Forest should be drawn to the Award is not too surprising, since in its organic allure it is reminiscent of 1960s French furniture by the likes of Pascal Mourgue and Pierre Paulin.\n\nBut while the Award is definitely sculptural, it\u2019s also quite sensible: key King Living attributes to this day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never called myself a designer,\u201d says King. \u201cI simply had the desire to create something meaningful, that would improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nNot long after setting up shop, King began scouring secondhand stores, keen to understand what kind of furniture people discarded. He noted torn fabrics and sagged webbing (both replaceable) but most importantly: broken arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRemember your grandmother saying, 'Don\u2019t sit on the arms of the sofa!'? I thought, why not? Sofa arms should be sturdy enough to be sit on.\u201d\n\nThus was born King\u2019s signature steel framed sofa system, the familiar riff behind most of the brand\u2019s greatest hits. There\u2019s the Polo couch, launched in 1979, the year King Furniture moved its manufacturing and flagship to Annandale, in Sydney's inner west.\n\nKing in his factory in Turrella in early March this year. Peter Braig\n\nThen came the Delta in 1998; its modular steel armature enabling it to mutate from chaise longue to three-seater bench sofa, to even a queen-size bed. (This slightly louche, lounge-y aspect inspired Vanity Fair magazine to install a series of Deltas in various formations for stars to repose upon during its Hollywood Oscars party in 2006.)\n\nIn 2003 King introduced the Jasper, which remains the brand's best-seller to this day. It\u2019s been remixed over the years; updated with extra storage, say, or extendable headrests, or recharging surfaces for mobile devices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flexible, like adult Lego,\u201d says King.\n\nAt the brand\u2019s current headquarters in Turrella, south of Sydney (there is still a showroom in Annandale), the in-house design team is a band of mostly 20-somethings fronted by David Hardwick, 41, who joined the company three years ago.\n\nDavid King with the King Living design team at the Turrella headquarters. From left to right: Stasie Panagopoulos, Bradley Saywell, Alinta Lim, David King, David Hardwick, Joseph Romano. Peter Braig\n\n\u201cThe studio includes designers, pattern-makers, a product manager and an engineer,\u201d says Hardwick, noting that several started out as interns. All are graduates of local design academies, including University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and the University of NSW.\n\nThe design team is responsible for researching and developing new pieces as the market evolves. Designer Alita Lin, for instance, recently nurtured the Issho dining table into being. A modular system based on fin-shaped legs that can be arranged in an open-ended formation or closed to create a single pedestal, it works equally well with round, oval or right-angled tops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the design studio, the operation includes textile experts, pattern makers, machinists and dispatchers. While a large part of the manufacturing now takes place in China (King established a factory there in the 2005) this is the beating heart of the business.\n\nThe new King Living Issho dining table sits on a modular, fin-shaped base. Felix Forest\n\nIt\u2019s here that Sydney designer Charles Wilson comes when he\u2019s got a product in development with King Living, as the brand has been known since 2015 as it began expanding its product portfolio into beds, tables, and home office furniture.\n\nThere\u2019s great respect for the intended design language ... a creative dialogue as to the functional potential. \u2014 Charles Wilson\n\nWilson's relationship with the brand began a decade ago, with the Andrea sofa. His most recent sofa, the Zaza, features fully adjustable back and arm structures atop a slender, sleigh-style base. King Living\u2019s expertise in steel frame manufacturing enables the precision engineering required to attain such flexibility, says Wilson, who has worked for international brands including Herman Miller and Menu.\n\nThe Zaza sofa, designed by Charles Wilson for King Living.\n\n\"King have a very sophisticated design culture now,\u201d he says Wilson. \u201cBetter, in fact than any company I have worked with. From the start of a project, there\u2019s great respect for the intended design language, and a creative dialogue as to what the functional potential is and how the design can best be resolved.\"\n\nFor his part, David King reckons Wilson is \u201cprobably the best sofa designer in Australia. Not only has a great eye for detail but a superb sculptural approach.\u201d\n\nWhile David King has nominally stepped aside from day-to-day operations (he appointed CEO Anna Carrabs in 2015), as the chairman he oversees international expansion and has recently opened showrooms in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai and Vancouver.\n\nAsked to sum up the brand\u2019s enduring appeal, King suggests it\u2019s because they \u201csit somewhere between the minimalist, European aesthetic and oversized American design.\u201d\n\nAnd that feels just about right."}], "David King won the Syd Barker Medal as North Melbourne's best and fairest player in 1998.": [{"url": "https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/234784/history-of-the-syd-barker-medal", "page_content": "As North Melbourne prepares to award the Syd Barker Medal to its best and fairest player of 2019, North Media takes a look back at the history of the distinguished award.\n\nSyd Barker\n\nSyd Barker was one of North\u2019s favourite sons in its early VAFA days, captaining the club for six seasons during his playing spell from 1909-1921.\n\nAs a player, Barker was a superb ruckman, and was recognised as a brilliant and fearless leader.\n\nWith North now in the VFL, Barker returned to the club in 1927 as captain-coach for one last season\n\nThe medal\n\nJust three years later, Barker died suddenly at age 42, and North paid the ultimate tribute to one of its early champions, naming the \u201cSyd Barker Memorial Trophy\u201d (now the Syd Barker Medal) after him.\n\nThe first Syd Barker Medal was awarded to Charles Cameron in 1929, and has been bestowed upon North\u2019s best and fairest player every year since 1935 (there was no medal awarded in 1930-31, and 1933-34).\n\nStream the Syd Barker Club Champion Dinner LIVE\n\nRecords\n\nThere have been 60 different winners of the Syd Barker Medal, with 18 winning multiple medals.\n\nBrent Harvey holds the record for the most Syd Barker Medals, with five.

It was said on his untimely death, (Barker had died suddenly while at work, at the Abbottsford Fire Station, from \u201can incurable disease\u201d), on 23 March 1930 at the age of just 42, that, \u201cfew men have left, or are likely to leave, their impression on Australian football to the same extent as the late Sydney Barker\u201d.\n\nIndeed, Barker holds a special place in the hearts of North Melbourne people, his name living on through the Syd Barker Memorial Trophy which, since 1937, has been awarded to North\u2019s fairest and best player each season. (Since 1970, it has been the Syd Baker medal). Although Barker only played nine VFL matches with North (in 1927), and those were at the end of his career, in the pre-VFL years (that is, the VFA, 1909 to 1921) he had been the club\u2019s, and the VFA\u2019s star ruckman during an era of North dominance. The best and Fairest award recognises his overall service to the club in those formative, and dominant, years.\n\nA quietly spoken man, with modesty to match, Barker was the ideal figure to lead North during the difficulties of the Great War. He was a fireman, a profession that required him to think clearly, and act decisively; attributes that were indeed transferable to the football field. And lead he did.\n\nHe began his football career with VFA club, Essendon, before joining Richmond for its first season in the VFL (1908). It was a short-lived relationship though, and Barker soon returned to the VFA, this time with North. North, during the period just before, and immediately after the war, was the finest team in the VFA. With Barker as its centrepoint in the ruck, ably assisted by follower George Rawle and rover Charlie Hardy, the club won 4 premierships (1910,1914, as well as 1915 and 1918 with Barker as captain)- including a remarkable run of 58 straight matches (which includes non-VFA games). No one encapsulated the invincible moniker more than the brilliant Barker, his ability as a boxer adding weight to his already imposing stature (183cm and 95kg). Barker\u2019s training with the fire brigade enabled him to ruck all day with North and, according to teammate Johnny Lewis, the ruckman would never ask a player to do something he wasn\u2019t prepared to do himself. Moreover, five-time premiership coach, John Worrall, described Barker as \u201ca splendid specimen of man hood.\u201d Worral said that \u201cstrength rather than dash made him famous as a player.\u201d\n\nIn 1921, it appeared that North would merge with nearby VFL club Essendon, and so Barker and Hardy joined the Dons in the belief that the two clubs would come together. But the deal fell through, and for the next four seasons Barker wore Essendon colours. By 1922 he was captain-coach, and with Hardy and Rawle again alongside him, he led the club to back to back premierships in 1923-24, before retiring from the game. However, he returned to North in 1927, the club having finally been accepted into the VFL two years earlier. As captain-coach, he played another nine matches, but was unable to lift the struggling side beyond 11th position.\n\nBarker saw the game in the late 1920s as being more scientific than it \u201cappears on the surface.\u201d He felt that kicking was the \u201cmost important factor of the game\u201d, and that being able to kick on each side was a critical tool in the footballer\u2019s armoury. He preferred a long-kicking game to one with a lot of handballing. And he would stress to youngsters the necessity for playing the game and \u201cleaving the umpiring to the umpire.\u201d He was inducted into the North Melbourne Hall of Fame in 2003."}, {"url": "https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/shaun-higgins-claims-syd-barker-medal-as-north-melbourne-2017-best-and-fairest-20170915-gyi3nw.html", "page_content": "In a year when North Melbourne began a rebuild, veteran midfielder Shaun Higgins helped to lead the way and was rewarded on Friday night by claiming his maiden Syd Barker Medal.\n\nThe smooth-moving Higgins polled 217 votes to be named best and fairest, ahead of hard-nut midfielder Ben Cunnington (211), key forward Ben Brown (209) and key defender Robbie Tarrant (204), the latter last year's winner.\n\nNorth's best: Shaun Higgins enjoyed a career-high average of 23.5 disposals and five tackles a game.
