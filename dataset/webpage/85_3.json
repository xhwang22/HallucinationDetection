Its formal name was the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party (Nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP). Nazi ideology was racist, nationalist, and anti-democratic. It was violently antisemitic and anti-Marxist.\n\nThe Nazi Party was founded in 1920, but won little popular support until the crisis of the Great Depression. In 1933, the German president appointed Hitler Chancellor. At the time, non-Nazis dominated Germany\u2019s government. However, the Nazis used emergency decrees, violence, and intimidation to quickly seize control. The Nazis abolished all other political parties. They declared Germany a one-party state with Hitler as its supreme leader.\n\nOrigin of the Nazi Party\n\nAfter World War I ended, Germany experienced great political turmoil. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) imposed harsh terms on Germany, which had lost the war. In addition, the country saw the overthrow of its monarchy. In its place was the new Weimar Republic, a democratic government. Racist and antisemitic groups sprang up on the radical right. They blamed Jews for Germany\u2019s defeat in the war. These groups opposed the Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles. They were against democracy, human rights, capitalism, socialism, and communism. They advocated to exclude from German life anyone who did not belong to the German Volk or race.\n\nIn September 1919, Hitler attended a meeting of one of these groups in Munich, the German Workers\u2019 Party. This small political organization sought to convert German workers away from Marxist Socialism. At the meeting, Hitler\u2019s public speaking skills attracted notice. He was recruited to a leading role.\n\nIn 1920, Hitler changed the Party\u2019s name to the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cNational Socialism\u201d was a racist and antisemitic political theory. It had been developed in Hitler\u2019s native Austria as the antithesis of Marxist Socialism and Communism. Marxists, for example, advocated for the global solidarity of the world\u2019s workers. They called for the abolition of nation states. National Socialists, however, sought to unify members of the German Volk in complete obedience to the state. They called for a strong state to lead the \u201cmaster race\u201d in the \u201cracial struggle\u201d against \u201cinferior races,\u201d especially the Jews.\n\nHitler formulated a 25-point program in 1920. The program would remain the Party\u2019s only platform. Among its points, it rejected the Versailles settlement. It also demanded to unify all people of German \u201cblood.\u201d The program called for a Greater Germany ruled by a strong central state. The country was to acquire new lands and colonies. The program would deny citizenship and rights to all non-Germans, particularly Jews.\n\nThe Nazi Party grew steadily under Hitler\u2019s leadership. It attracted support from influential people in the military, big business, and society. The Party also absorbed other radical right-wing groups. In 1921, Hitler organized a paramilitary force called the Storm Troops (Sturmabteilung, SA). SA members were war veterans and members of the Free Corps (Freikorps), paramilitary units that battled left-wing movements in postwar Germany.\n\nThe Beer Hall Putsch\n\nOn November 8-9, 1923, Hitler and his followers staged a failed attempt to seize control of the Bavarian state. They believed this would trigger a nationwide uprising against the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe uprising began in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4u Keller, a Munich beer hall. World War I hero General Erich Ludendorff, Hitler, and other Nazi leaders led the march. About 2,000 Nazis and sympathizers followed. City police clashed with the marchers, leading to an exchange of gunfire. Four police officers and 14 Nazis were killed. After the putsch, German authorities banned the Nazi Party. Several of its leaders were arrested and charged with high treason. Hitler was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in jail. After only eight months, he was released for \u201cgood behavior.\u201d\n\nWhile in prison, Hitler began dictating his book, Mein Kampf. The book set out his world view and personal mission. Hitler believed he was destined to lead the German \u201cmaster race\u201d in the battle between races to control land and resources. He would achieve this by creating a racially pure state and conquering Lebensraum (living space) in the Soviet Union. Further, he would destroy the Germans' ultimate enemy, the Jews, and their most dangerous weapon: Judeo-Bolshevism. Mein Kampf was published after Hitler\u2019s release. It did not become a bestseller in Germany until after he became Chancellor.\n\nThe Rise of the Nazi Party\n\nAfter the putsch failed, Hitler concluded that the way to destroy the Weimar Republic was through democratic means. In 1925, he persuaded Bavaria\u2019s leaders to lift the ban on the Nazi Party. Hitler promised that he would seek power only through elections. He then reestablished the Nazi Party under his complete control. What came to define the Party was not its 25-point program, but rather complete loyalty to its F\u00fchrer or Leader, Hitler.\n\nThe Nazi Party prepared to stand in the elections. It organized branches in each German state. These branches worked to establish cadres in regions, cities, towns, and villages. The Nazi Party had a rigid top-down command structure. Officials were appointed from above rather than elected by members. In each region, a Gauleiter or District Leader served as head. This position was appointed by Hitler and answered directly to him.\n\nThe 1928 Reichstag Elections\n\nThe Nazi Party's membership had quadrupled by the 1928 elections for the Reichstag, Germany's parliament. However, it won only 2.6% of the votes and 12 seats.\n\nDespite its name, the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party won little support from industrial workers. This did not concern Hitler, who was seeking to create a mass movement. He aimed to appeal to the many groups that disliked the Weimar Republic and feared socialism and communism.\n\nHitler emphasized propaganda to attract attention and interest. He used press and posters to create stirring slogans. He displayed eye-catching emblems and uniforms. The Party staged many meetings, parades, and rallies. In addition, it created auxiliary organizations to appeal to specific groups. For example, there were groups for youth, women, teachers, and doctors. The Party became particularly popular with German youth and university students.\n\nThe 1930 Reichstag Elections\n\nWhat most contributed to the Nazi Party\u2019s success was Germany\u2019s economic collapse during the Great Depression, beginning in 1929. The crisis resulted in widespread unemployment and poverty. It also led to an increase in crime. Germans\u2019 resulting anger and fear left them vulnerable to arguments from the extreme right and left.\n\nThe 1930 elections saw a sharp rise in support for both the Nazis and the Communists. The Nazis had more support, though, winning 18.3% of the vote and 107 seats. With this outcome, they became the second largest party in the Reichstag. President Hindenburg and his conservative advisers did not want the largest party, the Socialists, to form a government and so tried to rule by presidental decree. They hoped in time to amend the constitution and establish authoritarian rule.\n\nThe 1932 Reichstag Elections\n\nIncreased political divide led to increased violence. The SA was especially violent. By 1932, it had amassed 400,000 members. That summer, there were deadly street battles and daily assassinations. More and more Germans came to agree with Hitler\u2019s argument that parliamentary democracy was destroying Germany by catering to special interests. Hitler asserted that the nation needed a strong leader to unite Germany and rule in the national interest. The Party did not emphasize antisemitism in its general campaign messaging.\n\nIn the July 1932 elections, the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag. The Party had won 37.4% of the vote and 230 seats. Hitler, however, refused to join a coalition government unless he was appointed Chancellor. Hindenburg opposed this demand.\n\nThe Reichstag elections had to be held again in November 1932. The Nazi Party remained the largest party, but had won two million fewer votes than in July. The Party dropped to 196 seats, with 33.1% of the vote. By this time, Germany\u2019s economy was on the mend and the Party\u2019s popularity was receding. The odds for the Weimar Republic\u2019s survival appeared to be improving.\n\nThen, on January 30, 1933, Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in a coalition government. It was not dominated by Nazis, but rather by members of the conservative German National People\u2019s Party and non-partisan professionals from the bureaucracy. Hindenburg took this step after his advisers assured him that the conservative members could control Hitler. They believed they could use Hitler\u2019s mass following to amend the constitution and create an authoritarian state.\n\nGermany becomes a one-party dictatorship under Hitler\n\nOnce he became chancellor, Hitler moved quickly to bring the government under Party control. He persuaded Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and announce new elections. The Nazis\u2019 campaign platform called to unify all good Germans in the fight to eradicate \u201cMarxism,\u201d meaning both communism and socialism. The Nazi Party saturated Germany with its propaganda. Meanwhile, the government restricted the opposition press. In much of Germany, SA and SS (Schutzstaffel) members were deputized as auxiliary police. They used their powers to attack, arrest, and kill communists.\n\nOn February 27, 1933, there was a fire in the Reichstag building. The fire provided the excuse to declare a state of emergency. This allowed the government to abolish civil liberties and take over state governments. In the March 5 Reichstag elections, the Nazi Party won 44% of the vote. Together with its coalition partner, the Party barely won a majority of seats. Hitler used arrests, intimidation, and false promises to get the necessary votes to pass the Enabling Act on March 23. This \u201cenabled\u201d Hitler and his cabinet to dictate laws without approval from the Reichstag or President.\n\nThe Nazi Party did not only seize control of all levels of government. It also worked to control all aspects of German economic, social, and cultural life. This process was called Gleichschaltung, or \"coordination.\" All other political parties were abolished by July 14, 1933. Germany was declared a one-party state under the Nazi Party. Government, legal, and educational institutions were purged of Jews and suspected political opponents. Workers, employers, writers, and artists came under control of Nazi organizations. Sports and leisure activities, too, fell under Nazi control. Only the military and the churches escaped \u201ccoordination.\u201d\n\nThreat from Within\n\nBy 1934, the main threat to Hitler\u2019s continued control of the government came from within the Nazi Party, specifically the SA. SA men were eager to punish enemies and cash in on the Nazi takeover. Their violence and intimidation was met with increasing public disapproval. To reassure the nation, Hitler announced that the revolutionary phase of the \u201cnational uprising\u201d had ended. Among the SA, however, there was talk of a second revolution. This was to be led by SA commander Ernst R\u00f6hm. By this time, the SA had 4.5 million members. It far outnumbered the Reichswehr, Germany\u2019s armed forces. R\u00f6hm made no secret of his desire to subordinate the military to the SA. In June 1934, Germany's generals made clear to Hitler that he had to tame the SA or face a military coup.\n\nOn June 30, 1934, Hitler executed a bloody purge of the SA. The purge became known as the \u201cNight of the Long Knives.\u201d The estimated 150 to 200 victims included R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders, as well as conservative figures who had earned Nazi displeasure. Though subordinate to the SA, the SS carried out most of the murders. As reward, Hitler made the SS an independent Nazi organization. Its leader Heinrich Himmler answered directly to Hitler.\n\nOn August 2, 1934, President Hindenburg died. Every member of the German armed forces was then ordered to swear an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler. German military leaders had welcomed the slaughter of SA leadership. Without opposition, Hitler abolished the separate position of Reich President. He declared himself F\u00fchrer and Reich Chancellor, the absolute ruler of the German people.\n\nThe Nazi Party in Power\n\nAll \u201cAryan\u201d Germans were expected to participate in organizations run by the Nazi Party. However, the Party itself remained elite by limiting its membership. According to the \u201cleadership principle,\u201d it retained its top-down command structure. There were leaders at every level: regional, county, municipal, precinct, and neighborhood. Leaders were appointed from above and oversaw popular conformity to Nazi standards. Before it came to power, the Party had also created a government-like apparatus. Departments were responsible for the same areas as government ministries. For instance, there were departments for foreign policy, justice, labor, and economics. This structure never replaced the German bureaucracy. However, it acted alongside it and in continual competition with it.\n\nHitler transformed one party office into a government agency when he made propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels, head of the new Propaganda Ministry. Goebbels created a cult of personality that glorified Hitler as Germany\u2019s infallible savior. Nazi propaganda became inescapable in Germany. It dominated the press, film, radio, and public spaces. Portraits or statues of Hitler appeared everywhere. Every city and town renamed a street or public space to honor him. In public, ordinary Germans were expected to praise Hitler and give the so-called German greeting (\"Heil Hitler!\"). Propaganda permeated school curricula as well. Children, for example, learned odes praising Hitler\u2019s leadership in public schools. Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s film \u201cTriumph of the Will\u201d vividly portrays the image of Hitler as an almost divine leader. The film is based on one of the Party\u2019s massive rallies at Nuremberg.\n\nThe Nazi Party\u2019s control of every level of government allowed it to pursue its antisemitic agenda. The central government enacted sweeping antisemitic decrees. Even before that, though, Nazi officials persecuted Jews at the local level. Jews were excluded from professions, businesses, and public spaces. Propaganda portrayed Jews as poisonous vermin plotting to destroy the German Volk though capitalism and bolshevism. Nazi leaders claimed that \u201cthe Jews\u201d started World War II. The war was portrayed as a struggle for German survival. The Nazi claim that the Jews intended to destroy the Germans became the excuse for the Germans to destroy the Jews.\n\nDefeat of Nazi Germany\n\nBy the late 1930s, the vast majority of Germans supported Hitler and the Nazi state. The only organized attempt to oust Hitler and the Nazi Party occurred on July 20, 1944. By this time, Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II appeared inevitable. Following Hitler\u2019s suicide on April 30, 1945, Germany surrendered and was occupied by Allied forces.\n\nThe Allies banned the Nazi Party and declared it a criminal organization. They tried top Nazi leaders for crimes against humanity, among other crimes. To this day, the Nazi Party is banned in Germany.\n\nLast Edited: Jun 25, 2020"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazi-Party", "page_content": "Nazi Party , byname of National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party , German Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP) , political party of the mass movement known as National Socialism . Under the leadership of Adolf Hitler , the party came to power in Germany in 1933 and governed by totalitarian methods until 1945.\n\nFounding of the Nazi Party and the Beer Hall Putsch\n\nThe Nazi Party was founded as the German Workers\u2019 Party by Anton Drexler, a Munich locksmith, in 1919. Hitler attended one of its meetings that year, and before long his energy and oratorical skills would enable him to take over the party, which was renamed National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party in 1920. That year Hitler also formulated a 25-point program that became the permanent basis for the party. The program called for German abandonment of the Treaty of Versailles and for the expansion of German territory. These appeals for national aggrandizement were accompanied by a strident anti-Semitic rhetoric. The party\u2019s socialist orientation was basically a demagogic gambit designed to attract support from the working class. By 1921 Hitler had ousted the party\u2019s other leaders and taken over.\n\nUnder Hitler the Nazi Party grew steadily in its home base of Bavaria. It organized strong-arm groups to protect its rallies and meetings. These groups drew their members from war veterans groups and paramilitary organizations and were organized under the name Sturmabteilung (SA). In 1923 Hitler and his followers felt strong enough to stage the Beer Hall Putsch, an unsuccessful attempt to take control of the Bavarian state government in the hope that it would trigger a nationwide insurrection against the Weimar Republic. The coup failed, the Nazi Party was temporarily banned, and Hitler was sent to prison for most of 1924."}, {"url": "https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/germany-1933-democracy-dictatorship/", "page_content": "The rise of the NSDAP\n\nThis was the backdrop to the rise of the German National Socialist Workers' Party (NSDAP). When it was founded in 1920, it was only a small party. But Hitler used his oratory talent to attract more and more members. The party was characterised by extreme nationalism and antisemitism.\n\nIn November 1923, Hitler even led a coup attempt. It was a complete failure. Hitler ended up behind bars and the court banned the NSDAP. At the end of 1924, Hitler was released after serving a relatively short sentence. However, his political career was not over.

They benefited from the economic crisis that began by the end of the 1920s. The Nazis used the crisis to condemn the government and the Versailles peace treaty. Their strategy was effective. In the 1928 elections, the NSDAP gained 0.8 million votes; in 1930, the number had increased to 6.4 million."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/nazi-party", "page_content": "The National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party, or Nazi Party, grew into a mass movement and ruled Germany through totalitarian means from 1933 to 1945 under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Founded in 1919 as the German Workers\u2019 Party, the group promoted German pride and anti-Semitism, and expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the 1919 peace settlement that ended World War I. Hitler joined the party the year it was founded and became its leader in 1921. In 1933, he became chancellor of Germany and his Nazi government soon assumed dictatorial powers. After Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II, the Nazi Party was outlawed and many of its officials were convicted of war crimes related to the Holocaust.\n\nNazi Party Origins\n\nIn 1919, army veteran Adolf Hitler, frustrated by Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I\u2014which had left the nation economically depressed and politically unstable\u2014joined a fledgling political organization called the German Workers\u2019 Party.\n\nFounded earlier that same year by a small group of men including locksmith Anton Drexler and journalist Karl Harrer, the party promoted German nationalism and anti-Semitism, and felt that the Treaty of Versailles, the peace settlement that ended the war, was extremely unjust to Germany by burdening it with reparations it could never pay.\n\nHitler soon emerged as a charismatic public speaker and began attracting new members with speeches blaming Jews and Marxists for Germany\u2019s problems and espousing extreme nationalism and the concept of an Aryan \u201cmaster race.\u201d In July 1921, he assumed leadership of the organization, which by then had been renamed the Nationalist Socialist German Workers\u2019 (abbreviated to Nazi) Party.\n\nDid you know? Sales of Hitler's political autobiography \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d sometimes referred to as the bible of the Nazi Party, made him a millionaire. From 1933 to 1945, free copies were given to every newlywed German couple. But after World War II, the publication of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany became illegal.\n\nThrough the 1920s, Hitler gave speech after speech in which he stated that unemployment, rampant inflation, hunger and economic stagnation in postwar Germany would continue until there was a total revolution in German life. Most problems could be solved, he explained, if communists and Jews were driven from the nation. His fiery speeches swelled the ranks of the Nazi Party, especially among young, economically disadvantaged Germans.\n\nMany dissatisfied former army officers in Munich also joined the Nazis, including Ernst R\u00f6hm, the man responsible for recruiting the Sturmabteilung (SA) \u201cstrong arm\u201d squads that Hitler used to protect party meetings and attack opponents.\n\nHISTORY Vault: Third Reich: The Rise Rare and never-before-seen amateur films offer a unique perspective on the rise of Nazi Germany from Germans who experienced it. How were millions of people so vulnerable to fascism? WATCH NOW\n\nBeer Hall Putsch\n\nIn 1923, Hitler and his followers staged the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, a failed takeover of the government in Bavaria, a state in southern Germany. Hitler had hoped that the \u201cputsch,\u201d or coup d\u2019etat, would spark a larger revolution against the national government.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler was convicted of treason and sentenced to five years in prison but spent less than a year behind bars (during which time he dictated the first volume of Mein Kampf, or My Struggle, his political autobiography).\n\nThe publicity surrounding the Beer Hall Putsch and Hitler\u2019s subsequent trial turned him into a national figure. After his release from prison, he set about rebuilding the Nazi Party and attempting to gain power through the election process.\n\nNazi Rise to Power\n\nIn 1929, Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic entered a period of severe economic depression and widespread unemployment. The Nazis capitalized on the situation by criticizing the ruling government and began to win elections. In the July 1932 elections, they captured 230 out of 608 seats in the \u201cReichstag,\u201d or German parliament.\n\nIn January 1933, Hitler was appointed German chancellor and his Nazi government soon came to control every aspect of German life. Under Nazi rule, all other political parties were banned.\n\nIn 1933, the Nazis opened their first concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, to house political prisoners. Dachau evolved into a death camp where countless thousands of Jews died from malnutrition, disease and overwork\u2014or were executed.\n\nIn addition to Jews, the camp\u2019s prisoners included members of other groups Hitler considered unfit for the new Germany, including artists, intellectuals, Roma, the physically and mentally handicapped and homosexuals.\n\nNazi Foreign Policy\n\nOnce Hitler gained control of the government, he directed Nazi Germany\u2019s foreign policy toward undoing the Treaty of Versailles and restoring Germany\u2019s standing in the world. He railed against the treaty\u2019s redrawn map of Europe and argued it denied Germany\u2014Europe\u2019s most populous state\u2014\u201cliving space\u201d for its growing population.\n\nAlthough the Treaty of Versailles was explicitly based on the principle of the self-determination of peoples, he pointed out that it had separated Germans from Germans by creating such new postwar states as Austria and Czechoslovakia, where many Germans lived.\n\nGermany Invades Poland\n\nFrom the mid- to late 1930s, Hitler undermined the postwar international order step by step. He withdrew Germany from the League of Nations in 1933, rebuilt German armed forces beyond what was permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, reoccupied the German Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938 and invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939.\n\nWhen Nazi Germany moved toward Poland, Great Britain and France countered further aggression by guaranteeing Polish security. Nevertheless, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. Six years of Nazi Party foreign policy had ignited World War II.\n\nNazis Fight to Dominate Europe\n\nAfter conquering Poland, Hitler focused on defeating Britain and France. As the war expanded, the Nazi Party formed alliances with Japan and Italy in the Tripartite Pact of 1940, and honored its 1939 Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact with the Soviet Union until 1941, when Germany launched a massive blitzkrieg invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the brutal fighting that followed, Nazi troops tried to realize the long-held goal of crushing the world\u2019s major communist power. After the United States entered the war in 1941, Germany found itself fighting in North Africa, Italy, France, the Balkans and a counterattacking Soviet Union.\n\nAt the beginning of the war in 1939, Hitler and his Nazi Party were fighting to dominate Europe; five years later they were fighting to survive.\n\nThe Holocaust\n\nWhen Hitler and the Nazis came to power in 1933, they instituted a series of measures aimed at persecuting Germany\u2019s Jewish citizens. By late 1938, Jews were banned from most public places in Germany.\n\nDuring the war, the Nazis\u2019 anti-Jewish campaigns increased in scale and ferocity. In the invasion and occupation of Poland, German troops shot thousands of Polish Jews, confined many to ghettoes where they starved to death and began sending others to death camps in various parts of Poland, where they were either killed immediately or forced into slave labor.\n\nIn 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Nazi death squads machine-gunned tens of thousands of Jews in the western regions of Soviet Russia.\n\nIn early 1942, at the Wannsee Conference near Berlin, the Nazi Party decided on the last phase of what it called the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d of the \u201cJewish problem\u201d and spelled out plans for the systematic murder of all European Jews in the Holocaust.\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Jews in the western occupied countries including France and Belgium were deported by the thousands to the death camps mushrooming across Europe. In Poland, huge death camps such as Auschwitz began operating with ruthless efficiency.\n\nThe murder of Jews, communists, homosexuals, political prisoners and other people in German-occupied lands stopped only in last months of the war, as the German armies were retreating toward Berlin. By the time Hitler committed suicide in April 1945, some 6 million Jews had been killed.\n\nDenazification\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, the Allies occupied Germany, outlawed the Nazi Party and worked to purge its influence from every aspect of German life. The party\u2019s swastika flag quickly became a symbol of evil in modern postwar culture.\n\nAlthough Hitler killed himself before he could be brought to justice, a number of Nazi officials were convicted of war crimes in the Nuremberg trials, which took place in Nuremberg, Germany, from 1945 to 1949.\n\nSources\n\nThe Nazi Party.

In the course of his career, he held a number of important German state and Nazi Party posts.\n\nBackground\n\nBorn in Reval, Russia (today, Tallinn, Estonia), to an Estonian mother and Baltic German father, Rosenberg studied architecture in Riga and Moscow before fleeing revolution-torn Russia in 1918 for Germany. Already a committed anti-Bolshevik and antisemite, he became heavily involved in the post-World War I ultra-nationalist scene in Munich. In early 1919 he became an early member of the Nazi Party's predecessor organization, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or DAP). Gaining renown as the author of antisemitic tracts, he quickly made the acquaintance of Dietrich Eckart, one of the early, influential promoters of Adolf Hitler. In an article published in Eckart's own journal, Auf gut Deutsch (In Plain German), Rosenberg made clear a key component of his ideology: the equation of Jews with Bolshevism and communist revolution (\u201cJudeo-Bolshevism\u201d). At Eckart's encouragement, Rosenberg joined the fledgling Nazi Party and began writing for its flagship newspaper, V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter. He became the newspaper's senior editor in 1923.\n\nAntisemitic diatribes featured prominently in Rosenberg's writings. His efforts helped spread The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Germany and denounce the Weimar Republic as an aberration born from defeat and manipulated by \u201cJewish traitors.\u201d\n\nIdeology\n\nOn November 9, 1923, Rosenberg participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, which resulted in Hitler's arrest. Tasked by Hitler as interim leader of the Nazi Party, Rosenberg struggled to prevent the Nazi movement's disintegration. After Hitler's release, Rosenberg returned to journalism and began his chief work, The Myth of the Twentieth Century (Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts), published in 1930. Though neither officially translated into another language nor endorsed by Hitler as the authoritative expression of Nazi ideology, the book sold approximately one million copies by the late war years and boosted Rosenberg's standing as Party ideologue.\n\nBased on a selective reading of earlier works of philosophers, neo-pagan authors, and racial theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the volume embodied a dichotomist world view that positioned the \u201cAryan\u201d and the Jewish \u201craces\u201d irreconcilably against one another. All the fruits of Western culture, Rosenberg posited, had evolved solely from the Germanic tribes; yet the Roman \u201cpriestly caste\u201d which had arisen with Christianity had combined with Freemasons, Jesuits, and \u201cinternational Jewry\u201d to erode this culture and with it German spiritual values. While Rosenberg's v\u00f6lkisch arguments and his emphasis on Lebensraum (German \u201cliving space\u201d in the East) corresponded with Party ideology, many fellow Nazis found his mystical constructs and his prose hard going. Hitler himself held political reservations about Rosenberg's anti-Christian rhetoric. Until the end of his life, however, Rosenberg remained convinced his racist utopia would provide a recipe for Germany's future as the leading European power.\n\nBefore World War II\n\nFollowing his election to Germany's national parliament (Reichstag) in 1930, Alfred Rosenberg tried to broaden his skill-base by serving as the Nazi Party's expert on foreign policy. Shortly after Hitler's appointment as Reich Chancellor in 1933, Rosenberg took charge of the Nazi Party's foreign policy office (Aussenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP). More party appointments followed, among them membership in the circle of the Party's top leadership as Reichsleiter (1933), and plenipotentiary for supervising the Party's ideological training (1934).\n\nCompared to other members of the Nazi elite like Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, or Joseph Goebbels, Rosenberg before the war lacked the executive authority that came with a cabinet portfolio. His burning ambition for higher office was undermined by his frequent squabbles with competitors, his inability to forge alliances, and his reputation as an inept administrator. A stepping-stone towards greater political power came in 1938 when Hitler approved Rosenberg's idea for a new, fully Nazified university system (Hohe Schule) that would ground the Party's and the nation's future elite in racist ideology.\n\nWartime\n\nPart and parcel of this system was the \u201cInstitute for Research into the Jewish Question\u201d (1941), designed to provide legitimacy for the regime's antisemitic policies by proving the existence of a \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d on the basis of books and archival materials confiscated from Jewish organizations at home and abroad.\n\nThe war greatly facilitated such activities, for it allowed the organized looting of Jewish libraries, art collections, and other such assets in the countries overrun by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces). It was in this area that Rosenberg first acquired executive authority. Founded in October 1940, his \u201cEinsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg\u201d [Task Force of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg, or ERR] became the most successful Nazi organization engaged in art plunder. By the end of war, the ERR had shipped almost 1.5 million railcar-loads of artwork and artifacts from German-controlled Europe to the Reich.\n\nIn early 1941, Rosenberg moved closer to Hitler's inner circle in preparation for the German attack on the Soviet Union. His upbringing in Russia combined with his unrelenting anti-Communism gave him an air of authority on the Soviet Union that seemed useful to ensure the long-term German domination of this vast region and its systematic exploitation. On July 17, 1941, Hitler appointed him Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories [Reichsminister f\u00fcr die besetzten Ostgebiete], in charge of an area\u2014yet to be occupied\u2014stretching from the former Polish border in the west to the Ural mountains in the east.\n\nAs the Wehrmacht advance stalled before Moscow in late 1941, the actual realm of Rosenberg's influence remained much reduced, yet still comprised the Baltic States and parts of Belorussia (today Belarus) and Ukraine. In the occupied regions not under military rule, his ministry installed Reich Commissioners (Reichskommissare) and a complex civilian administration with representatives down to the level of rural districts.\n\n\u201cFinal Solution\u201d\n\nFrom his ministry's headquarters in Berlin, Rosenberg could hear daily reports of the havoc wreaked upon the local population by ruthless German policies aimed at \u201cpacifying\u201d and exploiting the occupied territories. While he criticized the over-harsh treatment of non-Slavic peoples by his subordinates as counterproductive to the goal of winning the war, Rosenberg, as a firm believer in the myth of \u201cJudeo-Bolshevism,\u201d had no problem in targeting members of Soviet elites and indigenous Jews for destruction. The area under his authority was the first to see the \u201cFinal Solution of the Jewish Question\u201d carried out through the systematic murder of Jewish men, women, and children. By the end of 1941, more than half a million Jews had been annihilated; Estonia, part of the \u201cReichskommissariat Ostland\u201d was the first German-occupied region declared to be \u201cfree of Jews.\u201d Since November 1941, trains with Jews deported from the Reich arrived in the \u201cOstland.\u201d SS and police officers together with Rosenberg's officials made sure that the deportees were either killed immediately on arrival or exploited in forced labor projects few could survive.\n\nThe importance of the events in the occupied Soviet Union for the history of the Holocaust can hardly be overestimated. Despite its constant power struggles with the SS and other German agencies, Rosenberg's ministry played a key role in the evolution of the \u201cFinal Solution.\u201d His Reich Ministry was the only government agency to send not one, but two representatives to the notorious Wannsee Conference convened by Reinhard Heydrich on January 20, 1942, to coordinate the next steps towards the mass murder of Jews in German-controlled Europe. When increasingly sidelined from 1942, Rosenberg tried to protect his turf in the face of the Wehrmacht's retreat from Soviet territory.\n\nInternational Military Tribunal\n\nRosenberg was arrested at the end of the war, tried at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, and found guilty on all four counts of the indictment for conspiracy to commit aggressive warfare, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death. Rosenberg was hanged on October 16, 1946."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-political-violence-in-1933", "page_content": "The Nazi use of force to intimidate, injure, or even kill foes was not new. It dated back to the early days of the Nazi Party. In the final years of the Weimar Republic this violence increased. In Prussia, Germany\u2019s largest state, at least 105 people were killed in clashes between the Nazis and their Leftist political rivals in June and July of 1932, when the Reichstag elections campaigns were in full swing. Hundreds of others were injured.\n\nAfter January 30, 1933, Hitler\u2019s coalition government acted to effectively give Nazi paramilitary units control of the German streets. The SA, which had dramatically increased in size with Nazi electoral success, numbering some 3 million members by mid-1934, disrupted or shut down Leftist assemblies and protests, often with police support. In mid-February, Hermann G\u00f6ring, the newly named Prussian Minister of the Interior, ordered the police not to hinder SA and SS actions, but to help them. Shortly thereafter, he created an auxiliary police force out of these two Nazi orders. As a result, their violent actions were given state sanction.\n\nWithin days of the Reichstag Fire, and the resulting presidential decree for the Protection of the People and State (February 28), the SA and SS escalated the violence against Nazi political opponents. Thousands of Communists and Social Democrats were arrested and jailed. In March\u2014April 1933, an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 political foes were taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d (Schutzhaft) and imprisoned in concentration camps. The SA and SS routinely beat up and tortured political opponents and vandalized, looted, or destroyed leftist parties\u2019 offices. Sometimes, individuals were murdered.\n\nNot even individuals holding political office at the local or national level were safe from such violence. Some 500 municipal administrators and 70 mayors were forcibly removed from their positions by the end of May 1933. By the end of spring the violence had spread to non-leftist political figures. On June 26, Heinrich Himmler, the head of Bavaria\u2019s political police and the head of the Nazi SS, ordered his forces to place all Reichstag and state assembly representatives from the Bavarian People\u2019s Party in \u201cprotective custody.\u201d\n\nOn July 14, 1933, Hitler\u2019s government passed a law prohibiting all other political parties, except the Nazi Party, and banning the formation of new political parties.

This meant they were able to convey policies to a wide range of people, while appearing to be competent and able to run the country:\n\nThe Nazis were present in many German cities and towns with many local offices\n\nNazi party members worked efficiently to spread policies through propaganda\n\nthe SA appeared to be a strong organisation which could protect Germany from its enemies \u2013 internal as well as external.\n\nWhen social unrest increased, after benefits were cut in 1930, Hitler used fear of Communism to get support from indutrialists. Alfred Hugenberg, an industrialist who owned a chain of newspapers ,and Fritz Thyssen, a steel manufacturer, along with other industrialists formed the Harzburg Front.\n\nThe Harzburg Front helped finance the Nazi election campaigns in 1932-1933. This ensured the Communists were defeated."}, {"url": "https://www.gedenkstaette-flossenbuerg.de/en/history/flossenbuerg/ss-personnel", "page_content": "Administrative routine shaped daily life in the Kommandant headquarters of the camp SS.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.\n\nThese recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.\n\nListed here are the 280 Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"F\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 12 of these listings. Georg-Wolfgang Feller, a 13th doubted recipient, is listed by the AKCR. However, the AKCR itself challenges his listing. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized.\n\nRecipients\n\nService Number of presentations Posthumous presentations Heer 179 13 Kriegsmarine 17 0 Luftwaffe 65 7 Waffen-SS 19 1\n\nThe Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists, one for each of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. Of the 280 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \"F\", 25 were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and three the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords; 21 presentations were made posthumously. Heer members received 179 of the medals; 17 went to the Kriegsmarine, 65 to the Luftwaffe, and 19 to the Waffen-SS.\n\nThis along with the + (plus) indicates that a higher grade of Knight's Cross was awarded as well.\n\nThis along with an * (asterisk) indicates that the Knight's Cross was awarded posthumously.\n\nThis along with the !

He studied medicine first at Bonn, later at Berlin and Leipzig, and finally graduated in Hamburg in 1938. He joined the SS SS Nr 203.578, in 1934 (ultimately reaching the rank of Sturmbannf\u00fchrer and became a member of the NSDAP in June 1937 NSDAP Nr 4.945.298.. On 01-11-1939, he was assigned to the Waffen-SS of the SS-Department of the Hohenlychen Sanatorium as a physician and SS Second Lieutenant. In 1940, he became troop physician of the SS Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler under SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Sepp Dietrich. After having been wounded he was posted back to Hohenlychen and worked in the camp hospital of the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp as a surgical assistant to Karl Gebhardt .\n\nHe participated in the surgical experiments carried out on concentration camp inmates there. They both tortured and killed women (mainly Polish) in Ravensbr\u00fcck for pleasure.\n\nAfter World War II, he was tried in the Doctors\u2019 Trial in Nuremberg, convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity, He declared: In addition to my normal duties as surgeon at the SS Hospital. at Hohenlychen, on or about 12-07-1942 I was ordered by Professor Gebhardt to begin medical experiments in my capacity as assistant surgeon to Professor Gebhardt. Professor Gebhardt was a Gruppenf\u00fchrer SS, a confident of Heinrich Himmler, supreme clinical physician on the staff of the Reichsarzt der SS and Polizei (Oberster Kliniker im Stab Reichsarzt SS and Polizei), and was Chief of the SS Hospital at Hohenlychen\n\nThe prisoners at Ravensbruck Concentration Camp learned to fear Dr. Fritz Fischer once they put two and two together, for each time Fischer and his boss Dr. Gebhardt came from Hohenlychen Sanitarium women suddenly disappeared. Lists of prisoners were called to the Revier, the camp clinic, and it was soon full of women lying in casts or paper bandages. The gossip network at the camp was stronger than the German camp administration ever realized and before long the whole camp knew the doctors were operating on healthy women. Fischer and Gebhardt also removed healthy limbs from prisoners for use at the sanitarium. In Fischer\u2019s trial testimony he describes in detail how he removed a prisoner\u2019s arm, including the scapula, wrapped it in a clean sheet and drove with it back to Hohenlychen to surgically attach to Germans man named Ladisch. It is interesting to note that Fischer himself lost an arm on the battlefield. The purpose of, the proposed experiments was to determine the effectiveness of sulfanilamide, which I was informed at that time was a matter of considerable importance to military medical circles. In this photo Fischer is seated in the second row, far right, next to his colleague Herta Oberheuser\n\n. Herta Oberheuser was the only female defendant in the Nuremberg trial, where she was sentenced to 20 years in prison\u2014a sentence later reduced to five years. Oberheuser was released in April 1952 for good behavior and became a family doctor in West Germany. She lost her position in 1956, after a Ravensbr\u00fcck survivor recognized her, and her license to practice medicine was revoked in 1958. She died on 24-01-1975, age 66 in Linz. The press dubbed Fischer, Oberheuser and Gebhardt \u201cThe Hohenlychen Three\u201d since all three worked at the sanitarium at one point and had also participated in the experiments. Though Fischer testified in detail about his part in the operations, he was one of the few doctors who showed remorse at the trial and openly talked about how he felt badly operating on healthy young women. His attitude may have helped him live, for unlike Gebhardt, Fritz Fischer was one of the most feared doctors at Ravensbruck, he was judged in the Doctors Trial in Nuremberg and he began his lecture with the following words:\n\n\u201cI carry the full human, surgical, and political responsibility for these experiments.\u201d\n\nFischer was condemned to life imprisonment, but his sentence was reduced to 15 years in 1951 and he was released in March 1954. Fischer subsequently regained his license to practice medicine and started a new career at the chemical company Boehringer in Ingelheim, where he stayed until his retirement.\n\nDeath and burial ground of Fischer, Fritz Ernst.\n\nLiving in Ockenheim Fritz Fischer died at the very old age of 91 in 2003 and is buried with his wife Magdalena who died age 87 in 2006 on the Friedhof of Ockenheim,Gaulsheimer Strasse, Section 6, Grave Nr. 29.
