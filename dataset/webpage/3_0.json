{"James Blair was a lawyer.": [{"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-frontline-interview-jim-blair/", "page_content": "by Callie Wiser\n\nAs a lawyer in Fayetteville, Arkansas, Jim Blair met Hillary Clinton when she taught law at University of Arkansas Law School. Clinton and Blair played tennis together, and when she met Diane Kincaid, whom Jim would later marry, Hillary Clinton had found a kindred spirit in Arkansas. The two women\u2019s shared interest in politics made them \u201cstrangers in a strange land,\u201d Blair explains. While Diane Blair worked for both of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns and served in other advisory roles, Jim Blair advised Hillary Clinton in what would become one of the early controversies of her public life: commodities trading. \u201cI talked her into it,\u201d Blair says.\n\nIn his interview, Blair recalls the Hillary Clinton who arrived in Arkansas, discusses the commodities trading controversy and explains what Hillary Clinton\u2019s reaction to Diane Blair\u2019s cancer diagnosis and death reveals about the woman he has called a friend for more than 40 years.\n\nThis is the transcript of a conversation with FRONTLINE\u2019s Gabrielle Schonder held on July 15, 2016. It has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nI\u2019m going to start by asking you about Hillary\u2019s relationship with Diane. Can you give me a sense of how important that friendship was to the both of them?\n\nWhen Hillary came to Arkansas, Sara Ehrman drove her down here. She didn\u2019t know anybody except Bill Clinton. He was the only person she knew in the entire state of Arkansas, and she was very much alone and very much an outsider when she arrived. She found Diane, who had been born in Washington, D.C., had gone to Woodrow Wilson High School, had been educated at Cornell, had worked on the Hill for Stuart Symington when he was a U.S. senator from Missouri, [had] written part of his foreign policy speeches.\n\nIt was an instant recognition that they were both a little bit strangers in a strange land. And they had an awful lot in common. The more they visited with each other, the deeper the friendship became. They became very important people in each other\u2019s lives.\n\nAnd she became my friend. I had been teaching on a part-time basis at the law school, just until they could find somebody to teach some courses they were shorthanded on.\n\nHillary and I actually played a couple of tennis tournaments together and were friends and hung out some together, and Diane was Bill Clinton\u2019s friend. When he was running the South for [George] McGovern, he would always come through Fayetteville and check with Diane, and they would visit a lot. He would tell her about this wonderful woman that he wanted to come to Arkansas, but if she came to Arkansas, she would be subordinating her possible political future, which he thought was a brilliant prospect, to his own. He felt guilty about it, but he still wanted her to come.\n\nWhen she did come, somehow the friendships switched, and she became more Diane\u2019s companion; Bill became more perhaps mine. We used to double-date some together. But the desire to really help people that Diane and Hillary both had bonded them closely.\n\nYou said strangers in a strange land? What was strange about Fayetteville?\n\nFayetteville is a little unique part of Arkansas in that it, being the most northern part of Arkansas, is a little more Midwestern-y than the rest of Arkansas. But it\u2019s still more southern than Midwestern. The culture [was] then and [is] still now less progressive than most of the rest of the country. H.L. Mencken said, back in the \u201920s, that if the world was going to come to an end, he wanted to be in Arkansas, because it wouldn\u2019t happen there for another 20 years.\n\nHillary, although with a Midwestern background, is coming out of the East, coming out of Boston in effect, out of Wellesley, with an eastern education. The speed at which the Easterners talk and process information doesn\u2019t fit very well with the slow Arkansas drawl and the more methodical way we process information.\n\nWhat was her life like here? Did she go to football games?\n\nShe did some of that. She did a little bit of everything. She occasionally would go to the Elks Club. There would be a dance or something. She actually liked to dance. She would do a lot of concert-type activity if it was available. But she did a little bit of everything. And you know, Fayetteville had \u2014 it was in the \u201920s and \u201930s called the Athens of the Ozarks. It did have a little more culture than the rest of the state.\n\n\u2026 Were you at their wedding in 1975?\n\nI was at the reception. \u2026 I saw them immediately after the wedding. I felt like I was a participant in the process.\n\nI had advised Hillary early on, when she said Bill had asked her to marry him again, and she had turned him down twice. She didn\u2019t want to get married right now. When she got married, she wanted it to be to Bill. She was afraid to turn him down a third time because she was afraid he\u2019d never ask her again. So I gave her terrible advice and said, \u201cGo ahead and marry him.\u201d\n\nWhy was it so bad?\n\nWell \u2013 (laughs) \u2014 think of all the difficulties I could have spared her if I had said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Hillary.\u201d No, she loved him then; she loves him now. No, I think I gave her good advice, actually.\n\nLet me ask you a little bit about their union, because it\u2019s more than just the romance. There is this political partnership that they have. There is this symbiosis that they have that I\u2019d love your help to describe.\n\nHillary is very analytical about her desire to maximize her drive to do good. Bill is more spontaneous. As a consequence of that, they come to almost any political problem, any political process, any political solution from two different directions. It\u2019s very interesting to see them engage and see her shoot down some of Bill\u2019s ideas because he hadn\u2019t thought them through, for Bill maybe to shoot down some of her ideas because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s warm and fuzzy enough to grip people\u2019s attention. They both would call themselves policy wonks, but they don\u2019t come in the same door.\n\nWho\u2019s better suited for the battle?\n\nBill Clinton is the better candidate; Hillary Clinton will probably be the better president. It\u2019s one thing to go out and create friendships on the campaign trail and empathize with everybody, and it\u2019s another thing to sit in the seat in the White House and have to make the tough decisions between competing interests.\n\nThe campaign didn\u2019t bother Bill. He loved the campaign. The making the tough decisions between competing interests caused him lots of agony because he had empathy for everybody. Hillary is not a natural campaign person, has more difficulty on the campaign trail, but sitting in the seat that makes the decisions, [she] would have less problem reaching the weighing of values and picking the right solution to a problem that involved competing interests.\n\nYou\u2019re describing her a lot like her friends from childhood and from college do. She is prepared.\n\nBeen that way all her life, I think. But another interesting facet of that is you have no idea how quickly she can get prepared. She is very, very quick to pick up the weak spots in any new thing she encounters. And she can get immersed in a subject she doesn\u2019t know anything about, and it\u2019s incredible how quickly she becomes extremely confident with it.\n\nDo you remember seeing that with a particular experience?\n\nOh, I\u2019ve seen it a lot of times. One of the worst things I ever did to her is [when] I was having to give a trial practice seminar for a continuing legal education course, and I was going to give a demonstration of cross-examination of a doctor under trial conditions. Whoever was supposed to do the other side, something happened to them and they couldn\u2019t do it, and I drafted Hillary at the last minute to fill in on that, which she thought was very unfair, but she did it. She was a good sport, and she did it extremely well, because she caught up and caught on very quickly.\n\nWho told her to go into corporate law? Was it you, or was it Diane?\n\nShe didn\u2019t go into corporate law. \u2026 When she was with the Doar committee on Nixon\u2019s impeachment, there was a very, very good trial lawyer there named Bert Jenner, the head of Jenner & Block law firm in Chicago. This was before she even came to Arkansas. And he said, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d This [the Doar committee] came to an unexpected end when Nixon resigned. She said, \u201cWell, I want to be a trial lawyer like you.\u201d And he said, \u201cHillary, you can\u2019t be a trial lawyer.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And he said: \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have a wife. A trial lawyer has to have somebody else maintain their life while they go about the business of litigation. That\u2019s where the wife comes in, and you don\u2019t have a wife.\u201d\n\nBut when she went to Little Rock with Bill, and he was going to be the attorney general, Phil Carroll said, \u201cCome over here to the Rose Firm and join our litigations section, and you can be a trial lawyer.\u201d That\u2019s where she bonded with Vince Foster and with Webb Hubbell and worked with some really top-notch people there at the Rose Firm.\n\nWas she the breadwinner for the family at that time?\n\nI\u2019m sure she made a whole lot more money than Bill was making as attorney general, because at that time it paid virtually nothing. It pays a little more now, but it didn\u2019t pay anything then.\n\nDid she talk about thinking about financially providing for the family and looking for opportunities to be more secure in their finances?\n\nThere were three or four of them there in Rose Firm [who] did a little stock trading and things, did a little investment stuff. I don\u2019t remember how successful it was. But I think she was conscious of the fact that her husband would probably never make any money and never care. I mean, Bill Clinton has never been interested in money. Money has no interest for him.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think it has a lot of interest for her, except as a means to do something else with. Her deep core is steeped in John Wesley Methodism. His mantra, which I can\u2019t recite accurately because I\u2019m not a Methodist, but is \u201cDo all the good you can to as many people as you can, everywhere that you can, for as long as you possibly can.\u201d And I think she has believed that all of her life.\n\nThe difference between that and the typical idealistic good-doer is that she has a practical bent to it. She knows she could do more good if she had more resources. She knows she could do more good if she had an organization behind her. She knows she could do more good if she could involve more people in her project. Her love of political solution and her desire to help particularly children and women measures on that level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see them engage and see her shoot down some of Bill\u2019s ideas because he hadn\u2019t thought them through, for Bill maybe to shoot down some of her ideas because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s warm and fuzzy enough to grip people\u2019s attention. They both would call themselves policy wonks, but they don\u2019t come in the same door.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Pretty soon after she starts working at Rose Law Firm, Bill becomes the youngest governor in the country. Can you tell me a bit about her approach to becoming first lady of Arkansas?\n\nShe came to Arkansas wearing heavy horn-rimmed glasses, with frizzy hair, wearing what I would call hippie dresses. That\u2019s not the southern Arkansas image of a lady that is the first lady of the state. I think she recognized that, and I think she knew that she would have to give up the hippie dresses, give up the heavy horn-rimmed glasses, even give up the frizzy hair.\n\nThe issue came up: Does she give up her name? She was very, very loyal to her father and her mother and the Rodham name, and she wanted to be known as Hillary Rodham. Her mother, Dorothy, didn\u2019t want her to do that. And boy, her mother-in-law sure didn\u2019t want her to do that, Virginia.\n\nIt was an issue, and we discussed it. I had such an elegant solution. I said, \u201cHillary, what you need to do is just go out on the State House Capitol steps and lie down on the steps and have Bill put his foot on your neck and say, \u2018Woman, take my name.\u2019\u201d And I said: \u201cThe people will love it. It will all be over.\u201d Well, she didn\u2019t think that was nearly as funny as I did. But eventually, she did see that everybody in the state was going to feel better if she did this, and it was a price she could pay.\n\nWhat was her reaction?\n\nShe wanted women to be judged on their own abilities, women to be judged for their own skills. She didn\u2019t want women to be accessories to their husband, and that is usually what a political wife is, is an accessory to her husband. And it didn\u2019t fit well. And the name issue was just an effort to hang onto her ideas about being accepted for who she was and what she could do and what her abilities were.\n\n\u2026 At this time, how is she managing in Little Rock? She\u2019s in the spotlight, and she\u2019s pretty exposed. Do you remember how she\u2019s handling the public and private life that she\u2019s defining for the first time in her career?\n\nShe\u2019s having to live in the governor\u2019s mansion, which is maybe out of her comfort zone initially. She is still trying to go to work and take depositions and appear in court and do the things that trial lawyers do. And at the same time, she had to be a hostess at events at the mansion, and she was more interested in participating in policies. She wanted to help Bill on educational reform and things of that nature. So she had her plate full; I will say that.\n\nIn 1980 they lose. He loses. Do you remember if that was a big surprise to her?\n\nIt certainly was a big surprise to him, and it was a big surprise to a lot of his staff, who were my close friends. I\u2019m not sure it was that big a surprise to her.\n\n\u2026 His opponent, Frank White, was running those ads that were targeted toward Hillary\u2019s maiden name.\n\nHe did some of that because he saw that as a vulnerability. Frank was not unskillful in his political approaches.\n\nDid people buy into that, though? Was it successful?\n\nI don\u2019t think it was a big part of it. What I really think part of it was, was they felt like Bill Clinton and his staff were young know-it-alls who tried to do too much too soon. A lot of the votes against him didn\u2019t want him to lose. They wanted it to be close. They wanted him to be humbled a little. But they really didn\u2019t want him defeated. I think, in some ways, his defeat was an accident.\n\nAfter the loss, Hillary takes charge. She\u2019s already involved in campaign work, but she really becomes involved in this re-election effort. My reading into this is that she\u2019s really the fighter between the two of them at this stage, because he\u2019s devastated by this loss.\n\n\u2026 I told them, and particularly Bill, that he needed to not run for re-election; he needed to go out and make some money, live in the real world, and he had a theoretical job with the Wright firm. And he told me that there was nothing else he wanted to do.\n\nBut Hillary changes her look a little bit during this time period.\n\nShe does.\n\nAnd she changes her name. Can you tell me a little bit about that decision?\n\nInsofar as some people blame that for part of Bill\u2019s loss, which I don\u2019t think is legit or fair, but people did blame him, insofar as that existed, she was going to do her best to repair that. She was not going to bear that onus, if that\u2019s the proper word.\n\nI think you have said that she was willing to make that sacrifice for political expediency.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not as blunt and as cynical as I would express it, but it gets into semantics. She didn\u2019t want Bill to think that she wasn\u2019t 100 percent there for him. She didn\u2019t want anybody else to think that she wasn\u2019t 100 percent there for him. If that\u2019s political expediency, it is a gentler, kinder, sweeter kind of expediency than we usually mean when we say those words.\n\nFair enough. They both threw themselves into this next race, and they do win. And she becomes heavily involved in policy work. I wonder if you think that that is a little bit of a foreshadowing of what\u2019s to come.\n\nShe loves policy, and she wants to be involved in policy. That would be true if she wasn\u2019t married to the governor of the state of Arkansas. So as long as she is married to the governor of the state of Arkansas, how easy can it be for the camel to get her nose in the tent, so to speak?\n\n\u2026 Let me ask you about the \u201992 campaign when it\u2019s announced. The idea of a co-presidency comes up pretty early in that campaign. How do you think they decided about the division of labor, of what Hillary would do and how she would do it?\n\nWhen they decided \u2014 and I say \u201cthey\u201d like it was a collective decision \u2014 when they decided that Bill would run for president, Diane took a leave of absence from her job as the university political science professor and went to Little Rock. I got her an apartment. She went on the staff as a researcher and adviser without portfolio or something like that. \u2026 But the role early on became something of a fire extinguisher or counterinsurgency research strategist, because very early on fire rained down on the campaign like a meteor shower, and they had to play a lot of defense.\n\nOne of those meteors that year was Gennifer Flowers. There had been rumors about women going around Arkansas for a little bit of time. Were you aware of some of those rumors?\n\nHe\u2019s very charismatic, and women fawned over him. I mean, in any gathering, there are women leaning on him; there are women pawing at him. That\u2019s kind of fun if you\u2019re the recipient of it if you don\u2019t take it too seriously. I never felt like he was taking it all that seriously.\n\nHe loved people in general. In my personal conversations with Bill Clinton, he\u2019s one of those few people who stood inside my comfort zone. He always stood too close to me. (Laughs.) I\u2019d want to push him back a little. I want to back off. But he\u2019s very comfortable in close physical proximity with anybody he\u2019s talking to. I\u2019m not saying I know enough about it to talk rationally about it; I\u2019m just saying there was always a press of women and men, but the men couldn\u2019t get there because the women were in the way. They were always closer to him than I\u2019d be comfortable with, but he wasn\u2019t uncomfortable with it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for a lot of people to understand this part of their marriage, because how does a brilliant woman like Hillary balance this out?\n\nI think that she has answered it. I think the answer was truthful, and I believe it. And I think what the answer is, is that she loves Bill Clinton. He makes her laugh. He is the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with. She does not want to not be a part of his life, and she does not want him not to be a part of hers.\n\nNow, does she get highly angry when he does something she regards as highly stupid? Yes, she does. And as his good friend have I gotten angry with him when I\u2019ve thought he did some things that were unnecessarily \u2014 \u201cstupid\u201d is a strong word, but I don\u2019t know a better one. But I think she always knew, and I have always known, that Bill Clinton\u2019s heart is good. Bill Clinton at heart is a really good person. And you can take a person that\u2019s as celibate as St. Augustine and he can live a life as virtuous as the snow on the top of Mount Everest, and you can know sometimes there\u2019s no heart there; there\u2019s no warmth there. There is not a good person there.\n\nThis gets extremely complex in the field of human emotions and relations, and an awful lot of the pressure that gets put in situations like this is external, because people that don\u2019t know anything about their marriage think they know what men and women ought to always do under those circumstances. And I think any marriage counselor, any psychiatrist, any psychologist that\u2019s worth their weight in salt would tell you that\u2019s not true. I mean, it\u2019s more complicated than that, and there are a lot of factors to be weighed.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton\u2019s life, when he has done some of the most unthoughtful things, it\u2019s been when he has been under particularly unusual stress and usually some kind of depression \u2014 his mother\u2019s death, whatever it is. When he\u2019s knocked off his rails, so to speak, it\u2019s not a good thing. But he finds his way back. If there is ever any malice in Bill Clinton, I\u2019ve never seen it.\n\n\u2026 That year she and he appear on 60 Minutes, but everyone really remembers her, because she \u2014\n\nOh, the Tammy Wynette remark.\n\nYeah, but also the assertiveness, the strength and the determination. I go back to this idea of her fighting again, because she is unbelievable in that interview.\n\nShe operates from a strong moral core. And having herself centered there, the idea of never giving in, never giving up, never giving out, is a legitimate focus and strategy.\n\nDo you remember watching it?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nI thought at the time that she did an outstanding performance. I thought she really was good. And when she made the Tammy Wynette remark, I thought, well, that might not have been the best choice. We call it the Tammy Wynette remark. It\u2019s from a song. She was standing by her man, but she\u2019s also standing by her convictions that, if she\u2019s going to do the maximum good she can for the most people she can, and as many ways as she can, there\u2019s no better way to do it than to stay tied to Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cBill Clinton is the better candidate; Hillary Clinton will probably be the better president.\u201d\n\nCan you describe election night, the mood, especially after that campaign? When they win, what is that night like?\n\nEverybody thought it was a long shot. A lot of people were saying, \u201cBill is just doing this to position himself for \u201996.\u201d And there were a lot of people, and I might be one of them, that think there was a lot of luck involved. This wasn\u2019t all just Bill Clinton\u2019s skill or George Stephanopoulos\u2019 skill or even the Ragin\u2019 Cajun\u2019s [James Carville] skill. But it was euphoric. I mean, we\u2019ve got it; we\u2019ve got it. Here\u2019s our chance. Here\u2019s all this wonderful stuff we can do. What nobody realized is, the meteor strikes weren\u2019t going to stop.\n\nWhat were those expectations that you\u2019re alluding to?\n\nThey really thought they were going to help equalize opportunity for the less fortunate people, to strengthen the middle class, to take care of children and give children a chance for success, and to reform medical health care and be sure that everybody had insurance coverage. There was a huge policy banquet in front of them, and you\u2019re going to do all this in the first 100 days \u2014 that became the magic formula. Three and a half months, and you\u2019ve changed the world.\n\nPretty soon into the new administration, Sally Quinn wrote a very harsh op-ed attacking the Clintons\u2019 idea that Washington is getting two-for-one with Bill and Hillary. Sally Quinn, who represents the Washington establishment, writes that the word \u201cwe\u201d is the kiss of death.\n\nThere are some people that believe that Hillary didn\u2019t initially respond to Sally Quinn\u2019s overtures in the way that [Sally Quinn] wished she had, and Hillary got punished for it.\n\nHow did Hillary make sense of it?\n\nShe may feel a little bit that way.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to spend her time doing the Washington society bit. She wanted to work on policy. So the people that wanted to manage her in the Washington society life, and thereby get additional brownie points for being the person that really had the closest access to the first lady and could get the first lady to do whatever they wanted her to do, responded in a highly negative way when she didn\u2019t seem to be champing at the bit to do what they wanted her to do.\n\nThe decision is made to move on and involve Hillary more in the West Wing than the East Wing, where first ladies usually have offices. Hillary is given health care reform, a major policy. How important was this to her?\n\nYou go back and look at beginnings of her career, Marian Wright Edelman, the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. She went to work for her really before she did anything else, and was very influenced [by] that. She comes to Arkansas and cofounds the Arkansas Advocates for Children [and Families]. So I think she thought this is a great opportunity for her to really unleash her focus and her effort because they knew the insurance companies were going to oppose it, and they knew that the insurance companies would fight back.\n\n\u2026 1993 was a year in which the meteors really started flying. There was scandal and personal tragedy. In April, Hugh Rodham passes away. In May, there\u2019s the travel office and Travelgate and the subsequent investigations. In July, Vince Foster dies, one of Hillary\u2019s closest friends and mentors who had come to Washington with them from Little Rock. Later, she would describe this time period as tied to a \u201cright-wing conspiracy.\u201d But at the time, how does she understand all of what is happening?\n\nWell, in 1993, I\u2019m not sure she did. Vince Foster was one time my law clerk. I knew Vince well. And Vince was as noble and righteous as a human could be. But that creates an area of vulnerability. He lacked the Marcus Aurelius-type ability to disregard what everybody else thought about you and do the right thing. He wanted to do the right thing, but he didn\u2019t want people to think badly about him.\n\nI don\u2019t think anybody picked up on how much anguish he was in, particularly with the Wall Street Journal article. I think Hillary certainly felt terrible that she didn\u2019t pick up on it. That was a huge blow.\n\nThe Travelgate thing was just one of these exercises in stupidity, to me. They had the right to replace anybody they wanted to in that department. They didn\u2019t have to give any reason for it. Why explain to everybody? So this is a person that had petted the media, petted the press, and the media and the press didn\u2019t like him being replaced. You\u2019re the president, and it\u2019s your job to staff that. And you don\u2019t have to explain it to anybody. I was frustrated that they would even try. The justifications were not appropriate.\n\nAnd Hugh [Rodham]\u2019s death \u2014 you know, girls and their fathers have different relationships than girls and their mothers, or sons and their fathers. And Hugh and Hillary always had a relationship that had its difficulties. Hillary goes to a school and makes straight A\u2019s, and he says, \u201cThat must be a really easy school if you got straight A\u2019s.\u201d I mean, gets no credit for her effort, no credit for her work. But she loved her father.\n\nAnd it was a huge blow. It was making things function less well at a time when, you know, the worst thing happens, and they let the special prosecutor law go through, the worst thing happens. And then the fallout from that just gets tidal-wave sized.\n\n\u2026 Let me ask you about two stories in particular. I want to ask you about the commodities trading and about Whitewater. I hope that you can help me handle these two subjects.\n\nI hope I can, too, because both of those have been so inaccurately represented. I\u2019m delighted to have a chance to explain.\n\nSo let me ask you first about the commodities trading. Why did she do it?\n\nLet me put it in context, may I?\n\nPlease.\n\nI ran $40,000 into $1.4 million net after taxes after an extensive tax audit and after a little bit of litigation for myself. I had 11 other people that were close to me that I talked into getting into this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, including my ex-wife, my fianc\u00e9e, my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children, my law partners, my close business associate, and Hillary. Hillary was one of those 11 people. And I talked her into it. I mean, we\u2019re talking about possible investments into things. And I said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a situation where it is a one-time-in-a-lifetime shot. It\u2019s an 11-year cycle culmination in the cattle market, and there are people trading it that are sharing information. That gives us an edge. There\u2019s no such thing as insider information in commodity markets unless you steal the government report.\u201d So I talk her into it.\n\nPeople think that she put in $1,000 and made $100,000 overnight. It was 18 months or something like that of hard trading, and a lot of losses were taken in all of the accounts. You cannot trade on 20-to-1 leverage, which is what commodity trading is, and survive if you aren\u2019t nimble and willing to take quick losses if you make a mistake.\n\nThe thing that broke the banks in \u201909 is they were trading on other people\u2019s money, on depositors\u2019 money, on 50-to-1 leverage. And it\u2019s impossible not to make a 2 percent mistake, which wipes you out.\n\nI don\u2019t think people ever understood that this was an 18-month slog. It was a brilliant opportunity. It had a lot of people sharing information. As her longtime friend and sometime adviser, I have certainly helped, strongly helped talk her into it. But I was not, at that time, an employee of Tyson Foods. I was in general law practice. I had a lot of clients. The guy who was the commodity broker for Ray Friedman & Co. that she was trading through had in effect been fired by Tyson. He was not a Tyson connection, yet somehow they think Tyson had something to do with it. They didn\u2019t know anything about it.\n\nI could talk about that for a long time. But I know you want to go on.\n\nHelp me understand the bigger question, which is, why was she trying to make money investing?\n\nI think the answer to that is, why does anybody? They see a need down the road for money. In her case, remember she\u2019s a Methodist do-gooder; she has to have resources if she\u2019s going to maximize what she can do. The central basic Protestant religion is built on the Calvinistic principles of, there\u2019s nothing wrong with making money. Money is not the root of all evil; it\u2019s the love of money that\u2019s the root of all evil. It\u2019s what you do with it. And she wanted it \u2014 I\u2019m totally convinced \u2014 for good purposes. Did she want to have a child, and did she want to be sure this child was taken care of? Of course.\n\n\u201cShe wanted women to be judged on their own abilities, women to be judged for their own skills. She didn\u2019t want women to be accessories to their husband, and that is usually what a political wife is, is an accessory to her husband.\u201d\n\nLet me switch now to Whitewater. Why do you think she became involved with somebody like Jim McDougal?\n\nIt is the exact same thing. McDougal came to them and said: \u201cHere is a chance to make some money. Why don\u2019t you put some money in this real estate project?\u201d McDougal had been around the political life forever. He had worked for [Sen. J. William] Fulbright [D-Ark.]. If you recall, Bill Clinton at one time drove Fulbright around the state. They have known each other forever. They were friends. And I\u2019ve known McDougal since he was 16 years old. I was president of the student body at the University of Arkansas when his parents brought him to Fayetteville, and I personally took them on a tour of the campus to see if that\u2019s where he wanted to go to school.\n\nMcDougal was brilliant, but he was an alcoholic, and he was a manic depressive. Not everybody knew that at the time. And McDougal ran off the rails. I have looked at every Whitewater document, every check stub, every check, every deed. I have looked at everything there is, and the ultimate conclusion is, McDougal stole the Clintons\u2019 money, and the Clintons never made anything out of it. They were betrayed by a person they thought was their friend. And the reason he betrayed them is probably because he was mentally ill. And that\u2019s about all there is to it.\n\nHow much did Hillary know about this at the time?\n\nShe had never been to the Whitewater Real Estate Development, which I had. And there\u2019s nothing there to amount to anything. It was a very incidental thing. McDougal used to go around to the political people \u2014 and Fulbright was one of them \u2014 and he would have a tract of land he was going to buy, and then he was going to break it into smaller tracts. The sum of the parts was going to be greater than the whole, and he was going to sell it for more money than he paid for it and split the money with everybody.\n\nBasically that\u2019s what Whitewater was, except it was a little fancier, in that they were going to build some roads and subdivide and build some lots in a place where there was virtually no demand for it.\n\nAt the time were you surprised that she was getting hammered for this?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat surprised you about it?\n\nThe fact that there was just no basis to it. I mean, there never was any basis to it. But you had an independent prosecutor run wild, and that\u2019s very easy to do. And he\u2019s certainly not the only one that ever did. They have an unlimited budget. There are over 50,000 federal laws on the books that are crimes to violate. If you give me an unlimited budget of millions of dollars and ask me to prove that you violated one of those, I guarantee you I can do that. You have violated some of these laws. You\u2019re a criminal. You just don\u2019t know it. And most people are. Maybe everybody is. The process was out of control.\n\nThere was an opportunity around this time period to release some information to satisfy the press, to satisfy critics, and the decision is made not to. Do you think that was the right thing?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t. I think the reason that people usually don\u2019t lay it all out is they\u2019re afraid of, when they know they\u2019re totally innocent, is they\u2019re afraid of misinterpretation. They\u2019re afraid that somebody will go through and nitpick little things, blow them out of proportion, so they\u2019re afraid to lay it all out. I think the best course, history has proved, is probably to lay it all out. Stonewalling virtually never works. You have an empty box; somebody says, \u201cWhat\u2019s in that box?,\u201d and you say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you; it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d \u201cOh, well, I\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s in that box.\u201d And then there it goes.\n\n\u2026 Let me ask you about 1998 and Monica. When that story breaks, she had a previous interview scheduled on the Today show, and she ends up going through with that, and she defends the president on the Today show. Was that surprising to you at the time?\n\nWell, yeah. Am I surprised she went? Yes.\n\nAre you surprised she \u2014\n\nAnd am I surprised she defended Bill? Yes. But one of the things that I think is, she hadn\u2019t had time at that point to really think things through. I think she was operating on gut instinct. And sometimes you have to trust your gut. Bill\u2019s in one of his depressive states, and he isn\u2019t making good decisions. You know, Virginia [Bill Clinton\u2019s mother] has died. It was a bad time.\n\n\u2026 When Bill admits having the affair, how hard was that for Hillary?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t right, it wasn\u2019t proper, and it was stupid. And she has a hard time tolerating any of those things.\n\n\u2026 Let me ask you a little bit about the impeachment, because at this point she goes to the Hill; she fights for his presidency. At the same time, she\u2019s looking at maps of New York state and thinking about a Senate run. Do you remember discussing what the approach was?\n\nThe Bill Clinton presidency was soon going to be over. It was soon going to be history. Thanks to Franklin Roosevelt, we have an amendment to the Constitution that says you can\u2019t be elected a third term, so his time is over, and if she\u2019s going to pursue the things she cares about, and pursue her dreams, she\u2019s got to have a new base. Why shouldn\u2019t it be hers? And a good place to start, Ted Kennedy thought, was to go to New York and run for Senate. \u2026\n\nThe thing about the New York Senate race is, it took so much money to make a credible race, there were not a lot of people that could raise that much money. She could come to Arkansas and run for the Senate, and there would be 100 people running against her, and they could all raise enough money to make a credible race. Well, in New York, it worked to her advantage to have a very expensive race because by then, she was a star quality, and she could raise money.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty sure that she can take a very serious shot and pretty sure she can win this. And as this starts out \u2014 I mean, the tragedies in my personal life. In 2000, in March, Diane is told that she has stage 4 lung cancer. She didn\u2019t even know she was sick. And Hillary is right in the middle of this Senate race, and Diane is her best friend. Hillary calls Diane every day the last 90 days of Diane\u2019s life. Hillary leaves New York and comes to Fayetteville, Ark., to see Diane four times in that 90 days. And Hillary comes to Arkansas and emcees Diane\u2019s memorial service.\n\nYou know, people [who] say Hillary is not loyal, that she doesn\u2019t have a heart, that she\u2019s not a real friend, don\u2019t know Hillary. I just think that was incredible on her part. She\u2019s running the race of her life. She\u2019s got to put every ounce of energy she\u2019s got in it. She is not going to leave a dying friend.\n\nThis is her closest friend in the world. I mean, this is her confidante. I mean, Diane is really her most trusted ear.\n\nI believe that to be true.\n\nIt must have been absolutely devastating.\n\nI believe that to be true.\n\nDid it ever surprise you that, at 52, 53 she\u2019s stepping out on her own, and she\u2019s beginning a political career?\n\nI think that she would have begun it earlier if she hadn\u2019t been married to Bill and he hadn\u2019t won his races. She could have been married to Bill, and if he lost his races, she might have done it on her own. So no, I don\u2019t think I was surprised.\n\n\u2026 I imagine, when you hear people talk about the email servers story, that that\u2019s got to be frustrating to you.\n\nIt is highly frustrating. \u2026 It is an area of vulnerability that they can strike at, and she is somewhat responsible for having given them an area of vulnerability. Now, did she have advice of counsel, and no one stepped forward to admit that? I don\u2019t know. But I would think she would have had. I would think that this was not as lightly taken. I would think that the efforts to make it work where she could preserve her private and personal email without putting it in the Freedom of Information Act was something that was important to her, and that could have been done. Obviously, in retrospect, it wasn\u2019t worth it. It wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\nIt seems to me like it\u2019s a theme that sometimes follows her, which is that she has this complicated interest in maintaining her privacy. That\u2019s what this comes back to. Can you help me understand that?\n\n\u2026 Anytime somebody has found something that they think could hurt Hillary, they\u2019ve tried to hurt her with it. Well, after you have been stabbed with 1,000 spears, do you want to leave the 1,001st spear laying out there, where somebody can pick it up and stab you with it? I think you don\u2019t. You know, I think people have abused her privacy so much that she\u2019s gotten overly defensive about it.\n\n\u2026 Is there anything that we didn\u2019t talk about that you wanted to?\n\nThe one thing I would do is sum up Hillary\u2019s character. People say they don\u2019t trust her. Do they not trust her to do a better job with American foreign policy than her opponent? Do they not trust her to do a better job with domestic policy than her opponent? Do they not trust her to do more for their lives than her opponent? What is it they don\u2019t trust her about? I don\u2019t see the trust issue the way they portray it on national television. Hillary Clinton has the temperament, the ability, to make a really, really great president. And that doesn\u2019t happen very often. We don\u2019t often get a candidate that good.\n\nHere is a person who has no real selfish interests at heart. All she has at heart is to do good for the most people in the most ways, for the longest time that she can do it.\n\n\u2026 How is she different today than that child of the 1960s that you first met?\n\nShe is different in the way almost every baby boomer who was there in the \u201960s in the culture wars is different. They\u2019ve grown up; they\u2019ve matured; they\u2019ve gained judgment. There are some people who say good judgment comes from exercising bad judgment. They made mistakes, and they have learned from them. She always, even at Wellesley, they said she was always looking at the big picture. Well, I think she looks at a bigger picture. She looks at the biggest picture."}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/blair-sir-james-william-5266", "page_content": "by J. C. H. Gill\n\nSir James William Blair (1870-1944), politician, barrister and judge, was born at Coalfalls, Ipswich, Queensland, on 16 May 1870, younger son of Gordon Blair, a Scots customs officer, and his wife Julia, n\u00e9e Droughton. Educated at first by his Irish mother\u2014a strong personality\u2014he later attended Ipswich West State School, then Ipswich Grammar School from 6 March 1882 to the end of 1888 when he passed the University of Sydney senior public examination. In 1889 he was reading in Brisbane for the preliminary Bar examinations with F. ff. Swanwick, a barrister and schoolmaster who had been a member of parliament. He lived with Swanwick, published some newspaper verse and was admitted to the Queensland Bar on 6 March 1894 on the motion of Dr A. H. Boone.\n\nBlair made friends in 1894 with another 'native son', the then attorney-general T. J. Byrnes, and the two shared chambers until Byrnes's death in 1898. Over twenty years later Blair said, 'I was a hero-worshipper. Byrnes was my hero'. Already considered a master of both written and spoken English, Blair also possessed other attributes valuable in public speaking: he could be forceful, his voice was particularly pleasant and he had many 'graces of speech'. He was junior counsel for the Crown in prosecuting directors of the Queensland National Bank, and was briefed in the libel actions, Hoolan v. Directors of the Eagle and Jarvis v. Charters Towers Evening Telegraph. In the criminal jurisdiction he was counsel on appeal in the Kenniff trial. He had laid the reputation for the later widely held belief in his profession that, 'if the need arose, Jimmy Blair could make a jury weep'.\n\nAssociation with the politicians Swanwick and Byrnes had its effect. On 11 March 1902 Blair contested a general election as an independent candidate for Ipswich which then returned two members to the Legislative Assembly. He was placed second to T. B. Cribb, a member since 1896 who had been treasurer from February 1901. Blair achieved some notoriety by papering Ipswich with heart-shaped cards about an inch square: some said 'In the hearts of the people', others bore the humble legend 'Give Jimmy a vote'. There was only one Jimmy on the ballot paper and sufficient electors gave him a vote.\n\nFor one who subsequently gained a reputation as something of a bon viveur, Blair's parliamentary policy suggested either that the crusading zeal of a young man had not yet faded or that he could shrewdly assess his strongly Nonconformist constituents. He opposed Sunday opening of public houses and favoured rigorous enforcement of the Licensing Act and the introduction of local option without compensation; bars should be restricted to the hours imposed on shops by the Factories and Shops Act and should be closed on polling days. He also favoured more stringent enforcement of the Gambling Act, the minimization of Sunday labour, suppression of Sunday trading and prohibition of the sale of tobacco to children. His education policy sought to restrict government scholarships to State grammar schools, and envisaged a take-over by the State of the grammar schools and the grant to them of more scholarships. State-school parent-committees should not have to contribute to the repair of schools and school-residences. In other fields he sought extension of the Factories and Shops Act to the whole State, and the opening of polls under the Act not only to ratepayers but to all electors.\n\n(Sir) Arthur Morgan formed a coalition government with Labor's W. H. Browne on 17 September 1903. Needing a lawyer for attorney-general, he invited Blair, who thus became a minister at 33 and ex officio leader of the Queensland Bar. He was given the additional portfolio of mines on 27 April 1904 and retained both offices under Kidston. He was out of office during the brief reign of the Philp government from November 1907 but he regained his former portfolios when Kidston resumed power on 18 February 1908.\n\nBlair's first major bill became the Worker's Compensation Act of 1905\u2014a useful protective addition to the industrial laws. It was published with annotations in 1906 with Blair, T. W. McCawley and Thomas Macleod as joint editors. The preface claimed that the Act introduced a principle well known in the United Kingdom but hitherto unknown in Queensland law. In 1905 he and Macleod had revised and edited R. A. Ranking's Queensland Police Code and Justices' Manual of the Criminal Law. Blair had little success with his mining legislation: the 1905 Mining Act amendment bill was rejected, and a 1906 bill to consolidate and amend the laws relating to mining fields, mines and mining lapsed after the second reading. His Children's Court Act of 1907, which took offenders under seventeen into special closed courts, was a success, but his technical instruction bill of the same year was not returned by the Legislative Council.\n\nIn the first session of the seventeenth parliament in 1908 Blair produced and steered through parliament two measures that were to play a part nine years later in the T. J. Ryan government's efforts to abolish the Legislative Council. In November 1907 the council had refused to pass a trades disputes bill and an election Act amendment bill. Kidston sought to appoint enough councillors to have these measures passed. Lord Chelmsford, the governor, refused this on the ground that Kidston had no mandate to increase the size of the Upper House. Kidston asked for a dissolution, was refused, and resigned. Philp tried to form a government, was defeated, and thereupon sought and, to Kidston's consternation, was granted a dissolution. On Kidston's return to power with a large following in February 1908, he sought to resolve future conflicts with the Upper House by constitutional means. First, Blair brought down an amendment of the Constitution repealing the clause in section 9 (amendment of the Constitution) which required a two-thirds majority on the second and third readings of bills for amendment. This paved the way for a further amendment\u2014the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act\u2014under which measures rejected by the council, or which it refused in two consecutive sessions to pass in the form which the assembly desired, could be submitted to the people by way of referendum and, if approved, automatically become law.\n\nDuring the parliamentary recess in 1908, Blair made a 3500 mile (5632 km) motor trip in his 1905 Panhard with four companions through outback Queensland. It enabled him to educate himself in the needs of remote districts, and attracted world-wide interest as automotive pioneering. Given the condition of the roads\u2014where they existed\u2014it was a remarkable achievement; Blair felt he had demonstrated 'the utility of motor transit in the heart of Queensland'.\n\nKidston had spent the recess in the United Kingdom. On his return, he decided that the government could survive only by a fusion with the Opposition. Some Opposition members had to be brought into the cabinet and Blair was one of the ministers displaced. It was said that Kidston promised to compensate him with a seat on the southern Supreme Court bench, and that he had accepted, but he was in fact offered a seat on the northern bench so that C. E. Chubb, who had been there for over fifteen years, could be transferred to Brisbane. Blair refused and had to wait fourteen years for another approach. With Peter Airey and George Kerr, who had also lost portfolios, Blair then led what was called 'the Independent Opposition'. He could have been a thorn in Kidston's side, but came to his rescue in October 1910 when Ryan and Edward Macartney were hammering home the auditor-general's criticism of government expenditure on the University of Queensland. He was unable, however, to stomach Kidston's offer to bear the cost of opposition by the Queensland Tramway Employees' Association to an application for registration under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act by the rival Australian Tramway Employees' Union; the latter ceased work on 19 January 1912. As other unions became involved, the dispute escalated into a general strike. Although Blair actively preached moderation throughout, and persuaded the Ipswich railway workers to go back, his mining constituents and the waterside workers remained out some time longer.\n\nD. F. Denham, who had succeeded Kidston as premier in February 1911, called a general election for 27 April 1912 as soon as the strike had collapsed. A requisition signed by nearly a thousand voters invited Blair to accept nomination as the government candidate for Ipswich. He accepted and worked with a committee of crusty conservatives and former Labor supporters who had 'thrown off the Trades Hall yoke', and who admired his stand in the strike.\n\nHaving been re-elected, Blair returned to the ministry on 3 September as secretary for public instruction, replacing K. McD. Grant who had resigned on a point of principle. He held office until 1 June 1915, usually deputizing on legal matters for Attorney-General T. O'Sullivan who sat in the council. In this last phase of his political career, Blair was responsible for further social legislation. The Criminal Code was amended in 1913 to raise the age of consent from 14 to 17 and to provide elaborately for the protection of girls. The Testator's Family Maintenance Act (1914) gave the court discretion to prevent unjust disinheritance of immediate family. The Friendly Societies Act was also amended that year to permit them to become the only corporate owners of pharmacies in Queensland. State secondary school scholarships, instead of being awarded by competition, went to all those who qualified, and scholarship-extensions were granted to those who passed the junior public examination.\n\nAfter Labor's sweeping victory in the general election of 22 May 1915, the government majority of 22 became a minority of 18. Blair, who had declined Denham's endorsement, stood again as an independent and lost his seat to D. A. Gledson, a Labor candidate, by 400 votes. The mining areas of his electorate abandoned him completely. He claimed to have been sick throughout the campaign and, when it ended, he spent several days in hospital.\n\nHenceforth Blair concentrated on his legal practice. In 1917 he appeared with Ryan for the government in the Legislative Council referendum case, arguing the validity of the constitutional legislation he had had passed in 1908. The State Full Court declared both Acts invalid. The High Court of Australia unanimously reversed this decision and declared that the Legislative Council could be abolished by an Act in accordance with the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act. Blair was also in great demand as a counsel in criminal cases.\n\nThe Judges Retirement Act (1921) removed a number of over-age judges, and Blair accepted the position on the northern bench offered him by Labor Premier E. G. Theodore in 1922. He and his wife moved their home to Townsville. On 24 January 1923 he was transferred to the central bench at Rockhampton. When McCawley died prematurely on 16 April 1925, Blair succeeded him as chief justice on 24 April, spending his first few days of office arranging a memorial fund. From 1930 he acted as deputy governor for brief periods, served as administrator in April 1932 pending the arrival of Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, and was formally appointed lieutenant-governor on 23 May 1933. On 1 June 1930 he had been knighted on the instigation of the A. E. Moore government, and on 3 June 1935 was appointed K.C.M.G.\u2014seemingly directly by the King whose jubilee year it was, for his name did not appear on the Commonwealth list and the W. Forgan Smith government made no recommendations.\n\nThere were three classic cases in Blair's term as chief justice. In 1929 the Country National Progressive ministry set up a royal commission to investigate the purchase by its Labor predecessors of two mines at Mungana in North Queensland. The report condemned W. McCormack and Theodore, both former premiers, and the government immediately proceeded against them and two others for conspiracy, seeking \u00a330,000 in damages. Although complex and highly technical, the case created intense interest and political passion because it was said to be designed expressly to destroy the career of Theodore, then Federal treasurer. The trial lasted twenty-one days before Blair and a jury of four, and was decided in favour of the defendants. Newspapers of all political colours agreed that his 4\u00bd-hour summing-up was extremely fair. The suggestion, under a thin fictional veil, of his venality in Frank Hardy's political novel Power without Glory rests on no more than malicious contemporary gossip.\n\nIn October 1939 Blair presided over an extraordinary criminal trial. On 4 August 1937 members of the League for Social Justice had invaded a Labor caucus meeting in the old Legislative Council chamber at Parliament House, armed with batons, coils of barbed wire and hammers. They were committed for trial on charge of 'assembly in such a manner as to cause fear that they would tumultuously disturb the peace'. With so many accused, the trial had to be held in the Brisbane City Hall. Although Blair made it perfectly clear to the jury that he believed all the accused to be guilty, they were all found not guilty.\n\nBlair's third cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre is known as the Ithaca election petition. Edward Hanlon, a Labor minister and member for Ithaca, was opposed in 1938 by George Webb of the Protestant Labour Party and won by only 456 votes. Webb appealed to Mr Justice Edward Douglas, sitting as an elections tribunal, that Hanlon in his campaign had distributed illegal leaflets: the appeal was upheld. Hanlon's counter-appeal to the Full Court was sustained and Webb's application for leave to appeal to the High Court was refused. Douglas felt aggrieved by the removal of judicial pension rights in 1922 by the Labor government and was concerned at what he saw as threats to judicial independence. Resentment at the reversal of his decision in the Ithaca petition case and suspicion of Blair's attitude over the pensions issue finally boiled over into a statement published in the Brisbane Truth on 22 October 1944. He asserted that Blair had suppressed a pension plan for judges submitted to him for consideration by the government, had received a salary as lieutenant-governor, and had been given large undisclosed payments by the government without statutory authority. Other judges united in condemning Douglas but Blair, now retired, maintained a dignified silence. Questions asked in parliament and statements in the ensuing controversy made in clear that Douglas was mistaken on the pensions question, that Blair had not received any salary as lieutenant-governor, and that the alleged undisclosed payments were in fact the salary equivalent of accumulated periods of sabbatical leave.\n\nIn the parliamentary debates on the establishment of the University of Queensland, Blair had argued unsuccessfully for the waiving of all fees and in 1915-16 became a member of the senate. He was reappointed in 1926 and was elected chancellor in 1927. He moved immediately to improve the university's primitive accommodation and by 1930 had accepted a gift of 200 acres (81 ha) at St Lucia from Dr J. O. Mayne. The work of creating a new campus occupied much of his time, but World War II prevented its completion before his death.\n\nIn 1912-13 Blair was a committee-member of the Ipswich Grammar School Old Boys' Association and became joint patron of its Brisbane branch in 1932. He held office also in both the Queensland Scottish Union and the Queensland Irish Association. A notable athlete in his youth, he was later president of the Queensland Rugby Union. Ipswich district cricket competitions of the early twentieth century included a team called Blair's. In his later years he became more interested in the turf and was president of Tattersall's Club in 1911-22. He was also a member of the Queensland and Johnsonian clubs.\n\nOn 16 May 1940 Blair retired from the bench but remained lieutenant-governor and chancellor of the university. He died of cerebro-vascular disease on 18 November 1944 at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in South Brisbane, leaving an estate valued for probate at \u00a33718. After a service at St John's Cathedral, the state funeral proceeded to Bulimba cemetery. He was survived by his wife May Christina, n\u00e9e Gibson, nineteen years his junior, whom he had married on 29 February 1912 at St Andrew's Church of England, South Brisbane; they had no children.\n\nBlair was regarded as something of a dandy: he frequently wore a 'white gardenia in his buttonhole and a silk handkerchief peeping from his breast pocket'. Like all public men he had his detractors\u2014he was venal, he was weak, he 'married beneath him' because of that weakness, and he lacked dignity. Others saw outstanding gifts which took him, a native son of the people, to some of the highest offices in the State, and delighted in his colourful personality, his gift of ready and apt speech, his wit and love of humour, his kindness of heart and genuine interest in his fellow men."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Blair", "page_content": "James Blair, (born May 1656, Banffshire, Scotland\u2014died April 18, 1743, Williamsburg, Va. [U.S.]), clergyman and founder (1693) of the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va., the second oldest institution of higher learning in the United States.\n\nBlair was ordained in the Church of England (1679) but was deprived of his parish in Edinburgh in 1681 for refusing to take an oath supporting the legitimate claim of the Roman Catholic duke of York (afterward James II) as heir to the throne. In 1685 he left for North America, where he was elected rector of Varina parish, Henrico county, Va.\n\nAppointed bishop\u2019s representative in Virginia in 1689, Blair proposed (1691) the founding of a college. With the endorsement of the Virginia General Assembly he returned to England to secure from the English sovereigns William III and Mary II a charter and a grant of funds for the college, which was named for its royal patrons.

John Blair his executor\n\nNov. 1773\n\nMarriage had been solemnized between the complainant and Dr. Blair but no consummation had followed. A hatred irreconcilable and separation had taken place. The complainant, on a bond given by Dr. Blair before marriage to a trustee, had thereon in his lifetime sued for a separate maintenance but the court had refused it. Dr. Blair died and she now brought her bill in chancery for dower in his slaves.\n\nThe evidence was voluminous and indecent. That of the defendant tended to prove on the complainant original hatred, ill-temper, disobedience, refusal of conjugal rights, departure not without some hint of adultery, that of the complainant to fix on Dr. Blair impotence and hidden causes of disgust, and it was difficult to say on which side the evidence preponderated. The suspicions of adultery were with Lord Dunmore, who, presiding at the court at the hearing of the cause, might be the reason why those suspicions were not urged.\n\nJohn Randolph, Attorney General, for the complainant, chose to remove some objections before he entered on the substance of the present demand.\n\nHe thought that the former proceedings for separate maintenance ought not to influence the present case. Those were founded on a contract expressed in a bond. That contract was executory only and therefore absolutely subject to a court of equity. The court too hoped that by refusing it a reconciliation would be forced. Besides, their remedy was properly at law and therefore might well be rejected in chancery, but as is said in Banks v. Sutton, 3 P.W. 632, dower is a legal, moral and equitable right, and a court of equity will assist a wife in claiming it. The distinction, therefore, is plain between an executory and a vested right. Our remedy formerly laid in a court of law, but the proceedings in writs of dower being tedious and not well adapted to the nature of slaves, the act of assembly gave us suit in this court. Still however it is to be considered as a common law claim and to be determined in principles of law.\n\nI suppose too it will be urged that the widow has not renounced the will which seems to be required by the act of 1727 which gives us the suit in chancery, to which I give the previous answer, that the will having given her nothing, there was of course nothing to renounce or, in other words, no renunciation to be made. Besides, the act of 1705 had given us dower, and that of 1727 only changed the mode of demanding it.\n\nHe then reads the act of 1705, c.33, sec. 8: the widow of any person dying intestate shall be endowed of one third part of all her husband\u2019s lands, tenements and other real estate (and this very act had just made slaves real estate) as is directed by the laws and institutions of England. This he thought authorized him to consider the present demand under the laws of England and to inquire\n\nI. What is a marriage by those laws?\n\nII. What are the rights of marriage?\n\nIII. How those rights may be forfeited?\n\napplying the doctrine under each head to the present case.\n\nI. Marriage is a civil and religious institution introduced for the propagation of the species and for the society and happiness of individuals in particular. It is civil, insomuch as it is a contract including a number of civil obligations; it is religious as having been approved by heaven itself, and as, when the priest has pronounced two man and wife, the bond is indissoluble by human authority. The essence of this contract is the consent of the parties and clerical attestation, and these render it forever obligatory on all. Two things, therefore, are only requisite to constitute a marriage, (1) consent, and (2) solemnization in facie ecclesiae.\n\nThe defendants will probably add consummation as a third requisite, but this I shall endeavor to show is not an essential. Consummation is a venereal commerce between the man and woman after the espousals have been pronounced by a priest. It is an act which the habits of society and perhaps dictates of nature have banished from public sight. Ideas of decency require it to be secret. It cannot therefore be brought into proof but on the evidence of the parties themselves, and their evidence is rejected in law whenever any accident has produced between them an opposition of interests. In lieu of evidence, the law of England establishes a presumption. This is carried so far that if the husband be within the four seas, let his distance be what it will, a cohabitation is presumed. Latterly, indeed, this presumption has been restrained by the admission of evidence that there could be no access of the husband. Pendrell v. Pendrell, 2 Str. 925. But let our case be argued before an English tribunal and we should be told that no evidence could overweigh this presumption where the parties as in ours bedded together, lived together at first, and afterwards in the same town.\n\nDr. Blair, indeed, in his answer to the bill for alimony, says there was no consummation, but were his testimony admissible in the present case, yet he lived long in the same town after the date of that answer and so might have access and cohabitation afterwards. Mrs. Blair too has said (as appeared in the depositions) that she was still a vestal, but she means in mente tantum, as Lucretia did. \u201cCorpus est tantum violatum, animus insons.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a general maxim that a negative cannot be proved and therefore that the affirmative must be; but how indecent, how impracticable, how cruel a task would this impose on female modesty and delicacy, should the proof of consummation be always called for from the wife on her demand of dower. That law is therefore virtuous, tender and delicate, which shields their modesty under a presumption, derived from the circumstances of consent, solemnization, and retirement into secret. What follows is presumed and therefore need not be proved.\n\nBut though the consummation be presumed, yet is its actual existence unnecessary. Neither the canon nor common laws require it to validate the marriage. The law of the church does not require it. Turn to our ritual which is by a statute engrafted into the common law and made a part of it. That tells us that marriage \u201cis not to be enterprised to satisfy man\u2019s carnal lusts and appetites.\u201d This then cannot be of the essence of marriage. And having told what is not, it afterwards says what is of its essence: \u201cforeasmuch as N. and N. have consented together in holy wedlock, etc., I pronounce that they be man and wife together.\u201d\n\nThe common law knows but two pleas in demand of dower, to wit, \u201cne unques accouples,\u201d and \u201cne unques seisie.\u201d The former is the one which agrees substantially with the present defense, but this is one, being made up at law, the judge writes to the ecclesiastical court to be certified whether there was a marriage or not. And on this application, does the bishop send about the country to find out whether there were consummation? No. He turns to his register, certifies what is found there, viz., that the parties were accoupled according to the usual rites, but he will find there no record of consummation and therefore will not certify it. This shows that it is an immaterial circumstance.\n\nNor by the laws given to the Jews by God himself was consummation requisite to constitute a marriage. By that a man lying with a married woman was to be stoned; so if he lay with a virgin betrothed to an husband he was to be stoned, but if he lay with a virgin not betrothed, he paid 50 shekels of silver only. Deuteronomy 22:22\u201329. Here then the virgin betrothed is put on a footing with the married woman though this very appellation excludes the idea of consummation. So in the case of Rebecca we are told (Genesis 24:67) that Isaac \u201cbrought her into his mother Sarah\u2019s tent, and took her and she became his wife.\u201d The circumstance of consummation is not noted, as being immaterial to the making her his wife. In the New Testament also, 1 Matthew 18, we are told that Mary the mother of Jesus was espoused to Joseph, but before they came together, was found with child. Had consummation been necessary to make her his wife, Joseph would have had nothing to do but refuse her, but we find that he was going about to divorce her. She was Mary his wife though they had not come together. That procreation is not the only purpose of marriage is evident from the legal validation of marriages where the parties are past the age of procreation, and in which case the rubric directs that the prayer that they may be fruitful in procreation shall be omitted.\n\nAs it appears then that the canon law does not require consummation to perfect a marriage, so will it that the common law does not. Thus Coke on Littleton: \u201cHere Littleton \u2026 \u2018consensus non concubitus facit matrimonium, etc., lawful marriage quoad dotem.'\u201d And Blackstone tells us, first volume, 434, this was a maxim of civil law adopted by our common lawyers. Thus we find the very point now in question between us is so absolutely established as to be a maxim of the common law.\n\nHe cites [from] The Cases of Impotence, a book he says [is] often cited, Sir George Downing and Mrs. Forrester\u2019s case. He was only 15 and she 13 years of age. They were put to bed in the day time. It appeared that they never touched one another, that they then separated and never again came together, yet was their marriage so firm that they were obliged to apply to Parliament for a divorce.\n\nBaron and Feme, 4. \u201cIt is agreed as well by common lawyers as civilians, that persons mutually contracting spousals in words of present time are very man and wife before God in what manner soever they are performed, for nothing but a full, free and mutual consent is of the essence of matrimony.\u201d\n\nHence it is that precontract was good cause of divorce. And indeed so firmly is marriage effected by contract alone that it was held that, on pronouncing a divorce for this cause, the parties precontracted were man and wife without solemnization, and also that if, after the second marriage the parties precontracted were espoused, the second marriage was null without a divorce. Baron and Feme, 431. And such would have been the law still had not the statute 32 Henry 8, c. 38, which enacted that all marriages between lawful persons (i.e. such as are not prohibited by God and law to marry) solemnized in the face of the church and consummate with bodily knowledge shall be indissoluble notwithstanding any precontract not consummate with bodily knowledge. Thus we find that parties are by their consent only rendered man and wife, the case of precontract excluding the idea of consummation. To entitle the wife to dower, indeed, there must follow a celebration in facie ecclesiae. 3 Bacon\u2019s Abridgement 375.\n\nTo all this let us add Dr. Blair\u2019s own testimony that the complainant was his wife, by which appellation he calls her in his will\n\nII. Proceeding secondly to enquire what were the rights of marriage, we may say in a few words that dower, the subject of the present demand, follows marriage as a shadow does its substance. Whether this right arose from the canon, the common, or statute law seems not well settled, but the laws, having given to the husband the absolute property in his wife\u2019s slaves and personal estate and his life [estate] in her lands, could do no less in retribution than give her a life estate in one third of his slaves and lands. It is to be noted, too, that dower is one of the things said to be favored by the law; these are three: life, liberty and dower; and a strong reason for placing the dowress among the favorites of the court is that she cannot again be put into the same situation in which she was before marriage.\n\nIII. It remains now only to inquire whether the complainant has done anything to forfeit her right of dower? Will it be said that she has refused consummation? It has been before observed that this has not been proved, that the contrary is presumed by law, and that whether it took place or not is totally immaterial. Will it be said that she has eloped? But who eloped first? Dr. Blair left the house first in which they were; finding that he had deserted her, she then removed to another house, but not 100 paces off, whither he also might have gone. But suppose her eloped; this alone is no cause of forfeiture. At the common law, elopement accompanied with adultery was no bar of dower. 2 Inst. 435. The Statute of Westminster 2 c. 34 indeed made them so, but still required both. Lord Coke tell us that adultery alone is no bar of dower, and indeed the words of the statute are evidently copulative: \u201cSi uxor sponte reliquerit virum suum & abierit & moretur cum adultero suo, amittet dotem.\u201d He tells us, Coke on Littleton 33.6, in a writ of dower the bishop ought to certify [blank space in the manuscript] his distich shows also that there must be adultery as well as elopement: \u201cSponte virum mulier fugiens, et adultera facta,\n\nDote sua caveat, nisi sponsi sponte retracta.\u201d\n\nIn The Cases of Impotence, we have Serjeant Wright\u2019s opinion on an elopement, how to secure the husband from the contracts of the wife, and that should he die first the wife will be entitled to dower, \u201cnotwithstanding her elopement unless she can be convicted of adultery.\u201d\n\nHe then reads the case of Sidney v. Sidney, 3 P.W. 269, and insists there was never an instance of chancery depriving a woman of her dower; but in our case there is no charge of adultery and Dr. Blair himself acquits her of it. Nothing is complained of but her misbehavior, which brings Sidney\u2019s case to be in point. Indeed, it is not so strong as ours, because that was a case of articles in which a chancellor may go farther than he can in controlling a general law. A gift of the law is of higher dignity than that of an individual. \u201cDispositis legis fortiori est quam hominis\u201d is a maxim of law. Thus where lands come to the same person both by descent and devise, the title by descent as being given by the law is the one which vests in him and supersedes the other which is the gift of man. The case of Moore v. Moore, 1 Tr. Atk. 273 is to the same effect as that of Sidney, that the chancellor will not interfere to take away the rights of the wife secured to her by marriage contract; and concludes therefore, as I observed before, a fortiori in favor of dower.\n\nHad the defendant intended to object adultery as well as elopement he should have pleaded it, by which it would have been fairly put in issue, and we should have known on what point to prepare our defense, but this not having been done, it is to be hoped that no insinuations will impress the ear of the court.\n\nHenry for the plaintiff avoided, as was his custom, entering the lists of the law, running wild in the field of fact. He adduced however one new and pertinent observation, which was that if between the hours of solemnization and retirement to his nuptial bed, Dr. Blair had died, his widow would have been endowed. He applied to this case the doctrine of tender and refusal, endeavoring to show that his client had been toujours pr\u00eate but that there was a want of readiness in the doctor.\n\nPendleton for the defendant states and considers the evidence, discrediting the deposition of Mrs. Eustace, mother of the complainant, which principally endeavored to fix the want of consummation on Dr. Blair\u2019s impotence and not on the obstinacy of her daughter. He insisted that Dr. Blair\u2019s answer to the bill for alimony was proper evidence that there was no consummation, that the presumption of law on which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel so much relied was like all other presumptions\u2014good till contradicted by positive proof. \u201cStabitur praesumptioni donec probetur in contrarium.\u201d He admits the indecency and hardship of calling on the wife to prove consummation in all cases, but replies that the want of it is proved in the present case on the part of the husband. That this presumption may be set aside by sufficient proof, the Attorney General has admitted by citing the cases where proof of no access by the husband has been permitted to be introduced, and that issue thereby has [blank space in the manuscript] That the want of consummation being proved by Mrs. Eustace and admitted by Mrs. Blair, he would consider this fact as established and proceed to lay down two important positions.\n\n1. That in all contracts founded on mutual covenants, performance or at least a readiness to perform must be shown by him who seeks redress against the breach of contract.\n\n2. That marriage is founded on the consent of the parties though the law for wise purposes has directed the church ceremony; that according to that ceremony, the priest only pronounces after the parties have consented. He observed that the cases of marriage under age, of forced marriage, of marriage de facto, proved that consent alone was the operative circumstance. That, in the marriage under the age of consent and the forced marriage, the want of consent renders it null in opposition to the formulary used; and in that of marriage de facto, where the form is not used, consent establishes the marriage. That in the former cases, all the vows are repeated, yet all are vain because the mind does not assent. So if, as in our case, she repeats them hypocritically, with design never to fulfill them, the same want of assent produces the same nullity. It would be strange indeed if want of assent should be less effectual to defeat the marriage because coupled with a wicked and cruel fraud in the plaintiff.\n\nThe purposes of marriage, we are informed by the church ritual, to which the plaintiffs have appealed, are (1) for the procreation of children, (2) for a remedy against sin and to avoid fornication, and (3) for the mutual society, help and comfort of the parties. The first and second of these make it a duty in the wife to yield herself to her husband, according with 1 Corinthians 7:4, which says, \u201cThe wife hath not power of her body, but the husband.\u201d The third obliges her to be a social companion and useful housewife in domestic affairs. These are the essential objects of the contract. He examines Mrs. Blair\u2019s conduct by these and declares her to be disobedient, contemptuous, utterly determined against the nuptual rites, and to have performed not a single condition either expressed or implied in the ceremonies of marriage. That at there being so total a failure of compliance with the contract on her part, it is impossible she can be entitled to demand its advantages from the other party.\n\nHe admitted that at the common law both elopement and adultery were requisite to defeat the right of dower, but [argued] that the law supposes the right to have been first vested, whereas no such right had ever vested here, the marriage having been incomplete for want of consent.\n\nThat it was also incomplete for want of consummation. In every contract there is an inception, progression and completion. He produces instances of explanation from cases of lands and personalities. In the present case, courtship, betrothal and the church ceremony are inception and progression; and consummation is completion. Then alone the dominion of the husband becomes complete.\n\nHe urges that the contract between these parties was void\n\n1. from fraud in the wife,\n\n2. error in the husband.\n\nThus Pufendorf, 3.6.6.: Another thing which invalidates consent, and, by consequence, the pacts that are built on it, is error; through which it comes to pass, that the understanding is cheated in its object, and the will in its choice and approbation \u2026 we may lay down this for a certain rule, that if a promise be grounded upon belief and presumption of some fact, action, or quality, without regard to which I should never have given my consent, my promise is naturally null and void, provided it appear evident from the nature and circumstances of the business that I agreed to the proposal purely on account of that fact, or quality, which I took for granted. and section 8: Much more ought a mistake to render a pact invalid if it were occasioned by the fraud of one of the parties. and he [Pendleton] applies to these deductions from the law of nature and reason the circumstances of the present case, showing the hypocrisy of Mrs. Blair and deceit on Dr. Blair, who certainly expected from his contract an acquisition of a nature very different from what it proved. He supported this doctrine of Pufendorf by appealing again to the marriage ritual, which calling solemnly to the parties to testify if either of them knows any impediment \u201cwhy they may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, reminding them that those who are coupled together otherwise than God\u2019s word doth allow are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.\u201d This shows there are cases in which the marriage is not lawful. Such are those of incest, polygamy and precontract, yet in all cases the parties are pronounced man and wife.\n\nIn further proof of the same point, he cites Milton on Divorce, Book 2, chapter 16: Lastly, Christ himself tells us who should not be put asunder, namely, those whom God hath joined. But whom hath God joined? The same author, Tetrachordon, page 357 [244], in his comment on these words: \u201cWhat therefore God hath joined let no man put asunder,\u201d Matthew 19:6. But here Christian prudence lies to consider what God hath joined; shall we say that God hath joined error, fraud, unfitness, wrath, contention, perpetual loneliness, perpetual discord, whatever lust, or sin, or witchery, threat, or enticement, avarice or ambition hath joined together, faithful with unfaithful, christian with antichristian, hate with hate, or hate with love, shall we say this is God\u2019s joining? And again, ibid., on Genesis 2:24, page 339 [226]: Cleave to a wife, but let her be a wife, let her be a meet help, a solace, not a nothing, not an adversary, not a desertrice; can any law or command be so unreasonable as to make men cleave to calamity, to ruin, to perdition? And ibid., 365 [252], on Matthew 19:9, on these words, \u201chis wife,\u201d he says: This word is not to be idle here, a mere word without a sense, much less a fallacious word signifying contrary to what it pretends; but faithfully signifies a wife, that is, a comfortable help and society, as God instituted; does not signify deceitfully under this name, an intolerable adversary, not a helpless unaffectionate and sullen mass whose very company represents the visible and exactest figure of loneliness itself. Such an associate, he who puts away, divorces not a wife, but disjoins a nullity which God never joined, if she be neither willing, nor to her proper and requisite duties sufficient, as the words of God institute her. and 403 [289], in the 39th chapter taken from Bucer, after saying that the full and proper and main end of marriage is the communicating of all duties, both divine and human, each to other with utmost benevolence and affection, he says: By which addition we may know that God esteems and reckons upon these four necessary properties to be in every marriage: (1) that they should live together; (2) that they should love one another to the height of dearness; (3) that the husband bear himself as the head and preserver of his wife. \u2026 that the wife also be to her husband a help, according to her place, especially furthering him in the true worship of God, and next in all the occasions of civil life; and (4) that they defraud not each other of conjugal benevolence. \u2026 Hence it follows, according to the sentence of God \u2026 that between those who either through obstinacy or helpless inability, cannot or will not perform these repeated duties, between those there can be no true matrimony, nor ought they to be counted man and wife.\n\nBut consummation is requisite, we are also authorized to say, from the common law itself; for Lady\u2019s Law 33 says in express words, \u201cConsummation is necessary to [blank space in the manuscript] a marriage,\u201d and Pufendorf, 6.1.14: We are obliged to explain that common maxim of the lawyers, that consenting and not bedding makes a marriage \u2026 to make a wife, it seems necessary, that the woman deliver herself as it were into the possession of the man, for the common ends of matrimony. \u2026\n\nObjections to this doctrine have been drawn from the Jewish law, and particularly from the punishment of a person having carnal knowledge of a woman betrothed, to which this is the true answer, that from the time of the contract they have so much interest in each other as that a third person shall not interpose; but as between themselves, that interest is not complete till consummation. So Rebecca did not become Isaac\u2019s wife till he carried her to his mother\u2019s tent, which implies what decency would not permit to be expressed. Yet both parties had consented before\u2014Isaac in demanding her, and Rebecca in choosing to go to him.\n\nObjection: Coke on Littleton 33. Answer: that was the case of a husband died before the age of consent, but in our case there had been neither consent nor consummation. There, too, there was no fault in the wife; therefore it cannot be urged as authority in favor of a wife who has been in fault.\n\nIt has been urged from the case of Banks v. Sutton that dower is a legal, moral and equitable right, and that a court of equity will assist the wife in obtaining it; but she must be a wife in Milton\u2019s emphatical sense. This court will never assist a claim which answers not every principle of morality and equity, and is out of the intention of the law itself.\n\nIn the cases of Sidney v. Sidney and Moore v. Moore, the marriages were complete and no objection against the wives as having refused obedience altogether. This only alleges that they had withdrawn themselves and lived separately.\n\nAn objection has been foreseen on the other party, because it was known to lie, that though a demand of dower is sent by the law in to this court, yet it is to be determined on principles of law and not of equity; but I make a very different inference. I conclude that by this the law meant to restrain demands of dower in slaves to those cases only where it might be supported on principles of equity, and that none should have dower but those whose cases were fit for a court of equity. Certainly this court is to decide by the rules of equity, and will not depart from its principles because the law has sent a suitor here.\n\nWe have been told, too, that only two pleas are known in cases of dower, to-wit, \u201cne unques accouples\u201d and \u201cne unques seisie.\u201d The first of these, which corresponds to our defense, is decided on the bishop\u2019s certificate, which would be framed from his register and not from the fact of consummation. These indeed are the pleas where those are the objections and the issue a general one; but where the case is special, the defendant may plead specially. Besides every precedent must have a beginning. The demandant of dower has been but newly introduced into a court of equity, and the principles of the court but lately begun to be applied to her. No wonder, then, that cases should arise in which pleas have not yet been formed. If the present case be new, the court will be pleased to consider that their decree is to become a precedent, and to say what is fit to be made a precedent.\n\nAnother objection is that dower is favored because the party cannot be put into the same situation; but no consummation having taken place, she may be put into the same situation. Had she acted as a wife this objection would have been real and forcible. If it cannot avail her in the present case, she may thank herself. Dower is the pretium pudonis, but that having not been violated, the demand is premature.\n\nII. He insisted that, setting aside all the preceding reasons, she could not recover her dower for want of a renunciation of the will, this being expressly required by the act of assembly which says that after such renunciation, she shall have the dower. It has been said indeed that the will left her nothing to renounce, but the act does not say that she shall renounce in those cases only where a provision has been made for her by the will, but in all cases whatsoever. Besides, it may often be a very moot point whether the widow be entitled to anything under the will.\n\nMercer for the defendant considered this demand under two heads: (1) whether one who does iniquity shall have equity, and under this cited Francis\u2019 maxim II.6.8, and (2) whether her demand was good in chancery. But the whole matter having been taken up before him by Pendleton, it is unnecessary to state his arguments.\n\nThe court decreed for the complainant."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/james.blair/1258429", "page_content": "JAMES BLAIR Edit Profile\n\nlawyer\n\nJAMES BLAIR, American Lawyer, Partner of BLAIR, WOLF, KUNKEL, KAISER & SUNDERMAN Colorado., Legal Professional Association, specializing in the field of General Practice.

The prosecution\u2019s evidenceshowed that, in 1984, defendant deliberately poisoned Green and Green\u2019s friend,Rhoda Miller, by placing cyanide in a gin bottle and giving the bottle to Miller todeliver to Green. The apparent motive was to obtain money that defendantbelieved was owed to him by Green. Green drank more of the gin than Miller, fellinto a coma that lasted for several months, and sustained brain damage. Greensurvived for almost two years and then died from pneumonia in 1986. Medicalexperts testified that the cyanide poisoning caused the brain damage, which thencaused the pneumonia that led to Green\u2019s death.Defendant was tried and convicted in 1985 for the attempted murder ofGreen and Miller. He represented himself and was convicted. After Green died,he was tried in the present case for the first degree murder of Green with thespecial circumstance of murder by the administration of poison. Defendantinsisted on representing himself, as he had in the earlier proceedings. Heattempted, unsuccessfully, to establish that cyandide poisoning was not the causeof Green\u2019s death. At the penalty phase, the prosecution\u2019s evidence in aggrevationconsisted principally of proof of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, and defendantpresented no witnesses and only a few college transcripts as evidence inmitigation.1. The prosecution\u2019s casea. ThepoisoningIn 1984, defendant lived in an apartment complex located at 5542 SierraVista Avenue in Hollywood. Dorothy Green shared apartment 209 in the samecomplex with a man named Goretha Murphy. One evening, a man whom Murphybelieved was defendant came to their apartment. After Murphy let the man in,Murphy overheard the man tell Green that he wanted his money back and wasgoing to get it. The man then left. On another occasion, the same manapproached Murphy and told him that he had \u201cbetter do something\u201d about havingGreen return the money. Murphy then heard this man tell another person that hewas going to \u201cget\u201d Green and Murphy. This led to a scuffle between Murphy andthe man on the walkway near Green\u2019s apartment.On September 24, 1984, Rhoda Faye Miller, a former resident of the SierraVista apartment complex, and her eight-year-old son, William, went to visitMichelle Dubois in apartment 203.Defendant was at Dubois\u2019s apartment whenMiller and her son arrived. Defendant had a briefcase with him. After a while,Miller went to a store and returned with some food, soda, and a pint of rum.Miller, Dubois, and defendant consumed drinks of rum and cola.About 40 minutes after Miller returned, defendant asked to speak with herprivately in the kitchen. There, defendant asked Miller to do him a favor bydelivering to Dorothy Green a tall box wrapped in butcher paper and a ribbon,which he explained contained a bottle of gin. Defendant said he did not want todeliver the package himself, because Green\u2019s \u201chusband,\u201d Murphy, did not likethem drinking together. Miller agreed and left Dubois\u2019s apartment with thepackage, leaving William and defendant with Dubois.When Miller arrived at Green\u2019s apartment, she told Green that she hadbrought a bottle of gin as a gift from defendant. Green said \u201chow nice,\u201d andinvited Miller in for a drink. Once Miller was inside, Green took the bottle out ofDubois died in 1985, before defendant\u2019s murder trial.the box. To Miller, the seal on the cap of the bottle appeared to be intact, exceptfor one spot that was not completely sealed. When Green opened the bottle, itmade a \u201cswish\u201d sound as if it had been sealed. Green poured a six-to-eight-ounceglass of gin for herself. Miller put about two inches of gin into her own glass andmixed it with water.Green then drank her full glass of gin straight down, immediately said thegin did not \u201ctaste right,\u201d and asked where defendant was. Miller took a swallowfrom her own glass. Miller thought the gin tasted like kerosene. As Green wasreturning from her bedroom, where she had gone to get her slippers, she began tofall. Miller caught her so she would not hit her head, and then Miller herselfbegan to feel woozy. Both of them fell to the floor. Green was vomiting, soMiller turned her on her side to prevent her from choking, then called theparamedics, and told them she believed she and Green had been poisoned.Meanwhile, Dubois sent Miller\u2019s young son, William, to Green\u2019s apartmentto look for Miller. William and defendant left Dubois\u2019s apartment at the sametime; as William headed to Green\u2019s apartment, defendant left the complex. WhenWilliam arrived at Green\u2019s apartment, he saw Miller on her knees by the telephoneand Green lying on the floor on her side, barely moving. Miller told William toreturn to Dubois and tell her that she and Green had been poisoned. Miller thenpassed out.When Miller regained consciousness, several paramedics were in theapartment. Miller told one of the paramedics, Robert Miller (who was norelation), that she and Green had drunk some gin, and that possibly the gin hadbeen poisoned. It appeared to Robert Miller that Green was in a more seriouscondition than Miller. Green was unconscious and \u201ccritical.\u201d The paramedicsinserted an \u201cI.V.\u201d into Green\u2019s arm and took her, Miller, and the gin bottle (whichthey had found in the apartment) to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital. At thehospital, the paramedics gave the gin bottle to the police. Later tests of samples ofgin from the bottle revealed that it contained sodium cyanide, at a quantity of 5percent of the solid material.b. Defendant\u2019sarrestA few days after the poisoning incident, William was playing with somefriends outside the Sierra Vista apartment complex. He saw defendant, who wascarrying the same briefcase that was in his possession on the day of the poisoning.Defendant asked William where his mother was.Officer Keith Moreland arrested defendant at the Sierra Vista apartmentcomplex on October 2, 1984. At the time of his arrest, defendant was carrying abriefcase. Officer Moreland took defendant to the Hollywood police station andturned him and the briefcase over to the investigating officer, Detective RichardJackson, and his partner, Detective Michael Thrasher.In an interview room, Detective Jackson searched the briefcase. Inside, hefound an envelope with writing on it. Among such entries as \u201cmagic shave,\u201d\u201csoap\u201d and \u201cReader\u2019s Digest law book\u201d were the words \u201cget cyanide.\u201d DetectiveJackson also searched defendant\u2019s wallet and found several items, including: (1) apiece of paper with \u201cChem Lab Supply\u201d and a telephone number and addresswritten on it; (2) another piece of paper with \u201cRJM Lab,\u201d \u201cChem Lab Supplies,\u201dand corresponding addresses and phone numbers written on it; (3) and a businesscard with \u201cChem Lab\u201d and \u201cHaw\u201d written on it. Detectives Jackson and Thrasherlater visited Chem Lab Supply and RJM Lab in Hawthorne, but no one thererecognized a photo of defendant as someone who had purchased cyanide.On October 3, 1984, Miller, who had been released from the hospital,identified defendant from a photo line-up as the person who had handed her thegin bottle to give to Green.A police handwriting analyst compared the writing on the envelope foundin defendant\u2019s briefcase with handwriting exemplars taken from defendant on theday of his arrest in October 1984, in October 1986, and again in April 1989.Theanalyst was able to state that the writing on the envelope matched that of the firstand third of defendant\u2019s exemplars, but not the second. The analyst testified thatthe handwriting in the second exemplar had been \u201cdisguised,\u201d that is, the persongiving the exemplar had attempted to change the characteristics of the writing.c. Green\u2019s illness and deathMeanwhile, Green remained at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital. Whenfirst admitted she was in a coma and unable to breathe, with a blood pressurereading as low as 33, indicating shock. This condition had to be reversedimmediately to avoid death. An intratracheal tube was placed in her throat, and amachine helped her breathe for the first few days. When she regained the abilityto breathe on her own, a tracheotomy was performed so that a tube could be placeddirectly in her trachea, bypassing her nose and throat. Without breathingassistance, she would have died. Toxicology screens performed on Green\u2019s bloodand urine when she was admitted to the hospital revealed the presence of cyanide,as well as amphetamine and Valium.Green remained in a coma for approximately three months. She was fedand medicated through tubes connected to her nose and stomach. During thattime, she developed pneumonia, a common complication for patients in hercondition. When she awakened from the coma briefly, she showed signs ofmental impairment.The original exemplar taken in 1984 was lost during defendant\u2019s trial on theattempted murder charges.Dr. Henri Becker, a specialist in the critical care of patients whose lives arein danger due to heart attack or other trauma, participated in Green\u2019s care atHollywood Presbyterian and reviewed her medical records. Dr. Becker explainedthat cyanide causes brain damage by binding with hemoglobin to prevent thetransport of oxygen to the brain and other tissues. In Dr. Becker\u2019s opinion,Green\u2019s ingestion of cyanide caused her coma and the resulting complications.Green\u2019s daughter, Caron Green, had seen her mother regularly before thepoisoning, when Green was in excellent health. Caron visited Green frequentlywhile Green was at Hollywood Presbyterian. For about the first three months,Caron could not speak to Green because of the coma. When Green came out ofthe coma, she could not see and did not have control of her bodily functions.After several months, Green was transferred to Glendale AdventistHospital. Caron continued to see her mother regularly. Green was unable to walk,see, converse, or feed herself. Later, she was moved to a hospital in Michigan,where her other daughters lived. Her condition steadily deteriorated, and she diedon July 26, 1986.Dr. Jerry Gray, a pathologist, performed an autopsy on Green. Green diedfrom another bout of pneumonia attributed to \u201ctoxic brain damage\u201d caused by thecyanide poisoning. The cyanide prevented oxygen from reaching Green\u2019s brain,thus killing her brain cells. Dr. Gray testified that pneumonia is common after thistype of brain injury because the patient cannot breathe and cough normally andtherefore cannot tolerate secretions in the lungs.2. The defense caseActing as his own counsel, defendant re-called Detective Jackson, whotestified that he never had spoken to Green\u2019s daughter Caron. Dell Freeman, afingerprint expert, compared defendant\u2019s fingerprints to photographs offingerprints taken from the gin bottle, the gift box, and the wrapping paper.Freeman could not identify the prints on the bottle as defendant\u2019s.Dr. Mohamad Abdel Latif, the director of the intensive care unit atHollywood Presbyterian Hospital, treated Green on September 24, 1984, the dayshe was admitted. In Green\u2019s stomach, Dr. Latif found Darvon, the drug Atropine,and bleach. These three substances could cause brain damage or respiratory arrestif they reached the bloodstream in significant amounts, but blood tests indicatedthey had not. Alcohol at a level of 0.123, as well as valium and amphetamine,were found in Green\u2019s blood. Dr. Latif testified that theoretically, the combinationof alcohol, amphetamine, Valium, and bleach could cause respiratory arrest andbrain damage. On cross-examination, however, he agreed that the most likelycause of Green\u2019s condition upon her arrival was cyanide poisoning. The cyanidelevel in Green\u2019s blood 16 hours after her admission to the hospital was 20micrograms per millileter, an \u201cextremely high\u201d amount.Dr. Hideo Itabashi, a neuropathologist employed by the County of LosAngeles, without having read any of Green\u2019s medical records or the autopsyreport, testified that theoretically a combination of alcohol, Darvon, and Valium insignificantly high amounts in a person\u2019s blood could cause respiratory arrestleading to hypoxia and brain damage. Cyanide poisoning also could cause suchhypoxia. Dr. Itabashi testified that a physician examining a patient could notdistinguish between hypoxia caused by cyanide and hypoxia caused by Darvon,Valium, and alcohol. He was aware that Green had a blood-alcohol level of 0.123,but was not told the amounts of the other drugs that were present. He could notsay what had caused Green\u2019s death.3. The prosecution\u2019s rebuttalDr. Irving Root, a pathologist who had conducted approximately 20,000autopsies, reviewed Green\u2019s medical records and autopsy report. In his expertopinion, Green died from complications of cyanide poisoning \u2015 that is,pneumonia resulting from brain damage caused by cyanide. The amount ofcyanide in Green\u2019s blood, 20 micrograms per millileter, was an extremely highlevel and normally would cause a very quick death, absent immediateresuscitation. In Green\u2019s case, Dr. Root explained, emergency personnelresuscitated Green in time to keep her alive, but not soon enough to avoid thebrain damage that eventually caused her death.1. The prosecution\u2019s caseDefendant was convicted of first degree robbery and assault with a deadlyweapon in Orange County in 1959. In 1963, defendant was convicted of seconddegree robbery in San Bernardino County. Defendant was incarcerated for theseoffenses. In 1985, defendant was convicted of the attempted murder of Green andMiller.Over defendant\u2019s objection, Emily Maverick, a professor of chemistry atLos Angeles City College (formerly Los Angeles Community College), testifiedconcerning an experiment involving cyanide that defendant had conducted whenhe was a student in one of her chemistry classes in 1982.2. The defense caseStill acting as his own counsel, defendant called no penalty phase witnessesin mitigation. The parties stipulated to the admission in evidence of defendant\u2019sacademic records from Los Angeles City College.1. Knowingandintelligent waiverDefendant contends the trial court erred in permitting him to representhimself pursuant to Faretta v. California (1975) 422 U.S. 806 (Faretta) without,he asserts, obtaining a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to the assistanceof counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.a. FactsAt his trial for the attempted murder of Green and Miller, defendant movedfor permission to represent himself. The court, Judge Clarence A. Stromwallpresiding, orally quizzed defendant concerning his knowledge of the charges, thepossible penalties, and courtroom procedures, warning defendant of the pitfalls ofself-representation and informing him that he would be \u201cprosecuted by aprofessional prosecutor.\u201d The court cautioned defendant: \u201cHow would you like toget into the [boxing] ring with Joe L[ou]is in his h[e]yday? . . . [T]hat\u2019s whatyou\u2019re asking to do.\u201dUltimately, the court granted defendant\u2019s request, anddefendant represented himself through trial and in posttrial proceedings followingthe guilty verdict.Shortly after defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal in June of1986,Green died, and defendant was charged with her murder. OnThe transcript of the trial in the attempted murder case was made part of therecord in this appeal.We granted respondent\u2019s request for judicial notice of the June 26, 1986,unpublished opinion of the Second District Court of Appeal in case No. B016044,affirming defendant\u2019s conviction for the attempted murder of Green and Miller inthe Los Angeles County Superior Court, case No. A-757679. (Evid. Code,\u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a).)10September 19, 1986, defendant appeared with counsel for arraignment in themunicipal courtroom of Judge Glenette Blackwell. Defendant soon indicated thathe wished to represent himself. The court warned defendant: \u201cSir, the State isasking for your life. I think you need all the help you can get. It\u2019s always unwiseto represent yourself. I don\u2019t know if you do your own medical surgery. I don\u2019tthink that would be wise. I read the report on you. I don\u2019t think you have thattype of educational background, but you can think about it, fill out the appropriateform.\u201dThe court then gave defendant a written \u201cPro. Per. Advisement Form\u201d tocomplete. On the form, defendant wrote that he had completed 12 years ofeducation. Defendant also responded to nine questions asking whether heunderstood his rights as a defendant and the responsibilities he would beundertaking as his own attorney.Although the form instructed defendant to placehis initials in the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d column in response to each question, defendantinstead placed an \u201cx\u201d in each box in the \u201cyes\u201d column. Defendant also placed anSpecifically, the form required a yes or no response to the followingquestions: \u201c1. Do you understand that you have a right to have a lawyer of yourchoice, and that if you cannot afford a lawyer the Court will appoint one torepresent you at no charge to you? 2. Do you understand that that the PublicDefender is a lawyer who must have the same qualifications and education as anyother attorney? 3. Do you know that you will receive no special consideration ortreatment by the Court because you have chosen to represent yourself? 4. Do youknow that the prosecutor is an experienced lawyer and will have an advantageover you at trial? 5. Do you understand that you will be expected to follow allrules of evidence and procedure just as if you were an attorney? 6. Do youunderstand that there are pre-trial motions that may be filed in your case? 7. Doyou know what things must be proved in Court before you can be found guilty ofthe offense charged? 8. Do you know what the legal defenses are to the chargeagainst you? 9. Do you understand that you cannot later come back to Court andsay \u2018I should have had a lawyer\u2019, or \u2018I did not do a good job of representingmyself\u2019?\u201d11\u201cx\u201d in the \u201cyes\u201d column next to the question \u201cUnderstanding all that you have readhere, and all that the Court has told you, do you still wish to give up your right tohave an attorney, and to represent yourself?\u201dWhen defendant returned to court with the form, Judge Blackwell stated:\u201cSir, let me ask you. I have your pro. per. form filled out here. Do youunderstand that in your case that the prosecutor is an experienced lawyer andpossibly may have an advantage over you? Do you understand that?\u201d Defendantresponded in the affirmative and also stated he understood it was unwise torepresent himself. The court then denied defendant\u2019s request for self-representation on the ground that defendant\u2019s responses on the Pro. Per.Advisement Form, where he had marked an \u201cx\u201d instead of placing his initials,indicated he could not read and understand simple English. Although the courtstressed to defendant that this was a special circumstances case in which the statewas asking for his life, defendant refused to waive time. The court then entered anot guilty plea on defendant\u2019s behalf and set the preliminary hearing forOctober 1, 1986.On October 1, 1986, defendant appeared with a deputy public defenderbefore another municipal court judge, Judge Xenophon F. Lang. Counsel told thecourt that defendant wished to represent himself, explaining that defendant hadrepresented himself at the earlier trial. Judge Lang stated: \u201cI see that JudgeBlackwell, in Division 30, had Mr. Blair fill out a form and she still denied themotion; however, I don\u2019t think that those questions are necessary now. They wereseveral years ago; but in the last several years, if the defendant wants to representhimself, he has a perfect right to do so. Isn\u2019t that your understanding?\u201d Theprosecutor agreed that defendant had an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to represent himself \u201cifhe meets the basic criteria of Faretta,\u201d and reminded the court that defendant hadrepresented himself in the previous jury trial. The court then stated: \u201cThe public12defender is relieved,\u201d and continued the preliminary hearing until October 3, 1986,to give defendant time to prepare.Defendant appeared in propria persona for the preliminary hearing inmunicipal court on October 3, 1986, before Judge Ronald S. Coen. At thebeginning of the hearing, the following exchange occurred:\u201cThe Court: You are representing yourself?\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.\u201cThe Court: You have been told earlier, I take it, the pain and pitfalls ofself-representation and the warnings about it?\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.\u201cThe Court: Is it still your desire to represent yourself?\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.\u201cThe Court: Very well.\u201dThe court then read defendant a statement of rights, which included thefollowing: \u201cYou have the right to be represented by an attorney at all phases of theproceedings. At this time you have chosen to represent yourself. You have beengranted that right.\u201d Defendant indicated he understood his rights. Thereafter,defendant represented himself throughout the preliminary hearing, at the end ofwhich he was held to answer on the capital murder charges.Defendant appeared for his arraignment in the superior court before JudgeAurelio Munoz on October 21, 1986. Judge Munoz stated that he was awaredefendant was representing himself, and asked defendant whether he wanted to berepresented by an attorney, to which defendant answered: \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t, yourhonor.\u201d When the court noted that this was a \u201cdeath case,\u201d the prosecutor statedthat a final decision concerning whether the death penalty would be sought had notyet been made. The court stated: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let somebody walk into adeath case pro. per. without making very sure that we aren\u2019t going to be trying this13case again.\u201d The prosecutor replied: \u201cWe have had three hearings on this alreadyand I understand the court\u2019s concern.\u201d The court then had defendant fill outanother, more extensive form, entitled \u201cPetition to Proceed in Propria Persona.\u201dOn this form, defendant stated that he could read and write; that heunderstood his constitutional rights to a speedy and public jury trial, tocompulsory process, to confrontation and cross-examination, to testify or refuse totestify, to bail, and to appointed counsel; that he understood that if he waspermitted to represent himself, he would be giving up his right to be representedby counsel and would have to conduct his own defense; that he was a high schoolgraduate; that he understood that by representing himself he would be giving upthe right to the assistance of an experienced public defender; that he would have to\u201cfollow all of the many technical rules of substantive law, criminal procedure, andevidence;\u201d that he would not be entitled to any special consideration from thecourt; and that the district attorney would be experienced in both court and jurytrials. Defendant correctly identified the charge against him, stated that the crimewas a specific intent crime, and acknowledged that if he represented himself itwould be necessary for him to handle all pretrial motions, plea negotiations, juryselection, opening and closing statements, presentation and cross-examination ofwitnesses, objections, and motions. Defendant further acknowledged that heunderstood he would have to participate in the formulation of jury instructions,conduct any necessary penalty phase, and prepare and submit posttrial motions.On several places on the form defendant correctly noted that the possible penaltiesincluded the death penalty. Finally, defendant acknowledged that the form wouldbecome part of the case file and would be considered by an appellate court indetermining whether he had knowingly and intelligently waived his right tocounsel, and that by acting as his own lawyer he was giving up any possible claimof ineffective assistance of trial counsel.14When defendant returned to court later in the day, the following exchangeoccurred:\u201cThe Court: Now, the People are deciding if this is a death penalty. Okay.[\u00b6] Do you understand, of course, that you are not going to get any breaks or anyhelp simply because you are a layman? You are aware of that?\u201c[Defendant]: I understand that.\u201cThe Court: And there is a saying in the law \u2018that a lawyer who tries hisown case has a fool for a client.\u2019\u201c[Defendant]: I have heard that.\u201cThe Court: Do you know what it means?\u201c[Defendant]: I heard that before.\u201cThe Court: Do you know what it means?\u201c[Defendant]: Do I know what it means?\u201cThe Court: Yes. What it means, you can\u2019t be objective when you aretrying your own case. And a lawyer\u2019s job, above all, is to be objective. And that\u2019sone of the dangers. [\u00b6] Do you understand that?\u201c[Defendant]: Yes.\u201dThen, after ascertaining that defendant had been represented by lawyerspreviously, had had troubled relationships with each, and did not want a lawyernow, the court stated: \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll allow the defendant to proceed in pro. per.He did fill out the pro. per. petition. Apparently he has represented himself beforein this identical case. So you may arraign the defendant.\u201dJudge Munoz arraigned defendant a few days later, on November 4, 1986.When the prosecutor informed the court that the prosecution would be seeking thedeath penalty, the following exchange took place:\u201cThe Court: Okay. Mr. Blair, I know you were representing yourself pro.per. in the previous trials . . . . [\u00b6] Okay. It\u2019s one thing to represent yourself at a15trial. At this point, the stakes have just gone up quite a bit. Now, you are alayman, and you really need a lawyer. It\u2019s your life. [\u00b6] I\u2019ll guarantee one thing.The way things are going now, just based upon what I\u2019ve seen and heard thismorning, you\u2019re going to lose that life. Now, I\u2019m not denying you the right to beyour own counsel. I\u2019m not denying you appointed counsel. I\u2019m not denying youanything. I\u2019m telling you you have the right to have one. [\u00b6] So you\u2019re not goingto be able to go up and say that you were denied counsel. You are not going to beable to go up and say that you were ineffective. Now, don\u2019t you really think youought to reconsider your decision to proceed in pro. per.?\u201c[Defendant]: No, your honor. I want to go pro. per. It\u2019s my decision.\u201cThe Court: Would you like to have advisory counsel?\u201c[Defendant]: No.\u201cThe Court: You realize, of course, you will get no special considerationfrom the court. And chances are it\u2019s going to be somebody just like me sentencingyou to death. I\u2019m being realistic. Do you understand, sir?\u201c[Defendant]: Yes, I understand.\u201dLater, in the same hearing, Judge Munoz inquired again whether defendantwanted advisory or associate counsel. When defendant said he did not, the courtstated: \u201cAll right. It\u2019s your life. I will state for the record that I think Mr. Blair ismaking a conscious choice. He appears to be in full control of his faculties. [\u00b6] Ithink it\u2019s probably a game that he\u2019s hoping that even if he does get the deathpenalty, that some court is going to look at this and say it isn\u2019t fair.\u201dLater that same day, defendant indicated that he wished to have AttorneyRay Newman appointed as \u201cassociate counsel.\u201d Newman appeared in thecourtroom, and after ascertaining his availability, Judge Munoz appointed him as\u201cassociate counsel\u201d and \u201cstandby counsel.\u201d After it became clear that Newmanwould be unable to attend all court sessions during the trial, the trial judge, Judge16Jerold A. Krieger, appointed Lonzo Lucas as defendant\u2019s additional advisorycounsel.b. DiscussionA criminal defendant has a right, under the Sixth Amendment to the federalConstitution, to conduct his own defense, provided that he knowingly andintelligently waives his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.(Faretta, supra, 422 U.S. at pp. 835-836; People v. Bradford (1997) 15 Cal.4th1229, 1363.) A defendant seeking to represent himself \u201cshould be made aware ofthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record willestablish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019[Citation].\u201d (Faretta, supra, 422 U.S. at p. 835.) \u201cNo particular form of words isrequired in admonishing a defendant who seeks to waive counsel and elect self-representation.\u201d (People v. Koontz (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1041, 1070.) Rather, \u201cthetest is whether the record as a whole demonstrates that the defendant understoodthe disadvantages of self-representation, including the risks and complexities ofthe particular case.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, People v. Lawley (2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 140;People v. Marshall (1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 24.)Here, the record is replete with instances in which defendant was warned ofthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, both orally and in writing, inboth the municipal and superior courts. For example, defendant was orally warnedthat representing himself was unwise, that the prosecutor was an experiencedlawyer who would have an advantage over him, that as an in propria personadefendant he would receive no special consideration from the court, that he wouldbe unable to claim ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, that as his ownattorney it would be difficult to be objective, and that a death penalty case17involved special risks. These oral advisements sufficed to apprise defendant of thedangers and disadvantages of self-representation.Further, defendant in writing expressed his understanding, on the \u201cPro. Per.Advisement Form\u201d and \u201cPetition to Proceed in Propria Persona,\u201d of the chargeagainst him and the possible penalties, including death. He further acknowledged,in writing, that he would have to handle pretrial, trial, and many posttrial mattershimself without the assistance of an attorney, and that he would have to complywith all substantive and procedural rules, which could be quite technical. He thusdemonstrated an understanding of the risks and complexities of his case.That these latter warnings and understanding were expressed only inwriting makes no difference in our determination. (Cf. People v. Marshall, supra,15 Cal.4th at p. 24.) The Los Angeles County Superior Court\u2019s in propria personaadvisement form (sometimes referred to as a Faretta form) serves as \u201ca means bywhich the judge and the defendant seeking self-representation may have ameaningful dialogue concerning the dangers and responsibilities of self-representation.\u201d (People v. Silfa (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1322.) The courtmight query the defendant orally about his responses on the form, to create a clearrecord of the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel. (Cf. People v.Koontz, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1071.) The failure to do so, however, does notnecessarily invalidate defendant\u2019s waiver, particularly when, as here, we have noindication that defendant failed to understand what he was reading and signing.To the contrary, defendant demonstrated his ability to read and write in numerousDefendant left blank the part of the \u201cPetition to Proceed in Propria Persona\u201dasking about his awareness of possible defenses. Although the court might havequeried defendant concerning his understanding of potential defenses, the failureto do so does not invalidate defendant\u2019s waiver.18pro se filings before the court. Defendant also appeared to be of at least normalintelligence and spoke articulately in court. The last superior court judge whoconsidered defendant\u2019s request for self-representation, Judge Munoz, found thatdefendant was \u201cin full control of his faculties\u201d and was making \u201ca consciouschoice.\u201d We have no reason to question these findings.In sum, the record as a whole reflects that defendant was familiar both withthe facts and the difficulties of his particular case and with the risks he faced inrepresenting himself against an experienced prosecutor in a capital case. Hedemonstrated considerable legal knowledge, and had represented himself at hisprevious trial on the attempted murder charges involving the same underlyingevents. These facts support the conclusion that defendant understood the Farettawarnings. (See People v. Lawley, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 142 [relying in part onthe defendant\u2019s experience in prior trials to find his waiver knowing andintelligent].) Under the circumstances, we have no difficulty in concluding thatdefendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent.Defendant contends nonetheless that no judge in either the municipal courtor the superior court conducted the kind of \u201csearching inquiry\u201d that is required tosupport a valid waiver of counsel. He claims that no court inquired whether heunderstood the nature of the charged offense, including the grave risk arising fromthe special circumstance allegation, or the nature of a capital proceeding, includingthe possibility of a separate penalty phase. But defendant stated on the \u201cPetition toProceed in Propria Persona\u201d that he understood that he was being charged withspecial circumstances murder under section 190.2, subdivision (a)(19) (murder bythe administration of poison), that death was a possible penalty, and that if hecontinued to represent himself he would be required to handle any separate penaltyphase. Further, both Judge Blackwell and Judge Munoz warned defendant that adeath penalty case requires the expertise of a lawyer. Judge Blackwell told19defendant: \u201cSir, the State is asking for your life. I think you need all the help youcan get.\u201d And after the prosecution announced its decision to seek the deathpenalty, Judge Munoz told defendant: \u201cAt this point, the stakes have just gone upquite a bit. Now, you are a layman, and you really need a lawyer. It\u2019s your life.\u201dNo more was required. (Cf. People v. Lawley, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 142[defendant\u2019s waiver knowing and intelligent even though court did not advise himregarding the possibility of a second phase of the trial to determine penalty].)Defendant further argues that the court made no attempt to determinewhether he understood there would be limitations on his ability to investigatedefenses and arrange for the assistance of experts. But again, we have rejectedcontentions that such detailed advisements are necessary. (People v. Koontz,supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 1072-1073 [failure to advise defendant regardingrestrictions on library privileges and investigations did not vitiate waiver];People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1042 [noting lack of authority fordefendant\u2019s claim that trial court must advise a defendant seeking in propriapersona status \u201cof each limitation upon his ability to act effectively as counsel thatwill flow from security concerns and facility limitations\u201d].) Further, as discussedmore fully below, defendant received library privileges as well as the services ofinvestigators, a legal \u201crunner,\u201d and experts. Nothing in the record suggests thatdefendant\u2019s decision to proceed in propria persona depended on his understandingof his library privileges or his ability to consult with experts. (See People v.Koontz, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1073; People v. Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p.1042.)2. Trial court\u2019s failure to declare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019scompetence to waive counselDefendant contends that his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rightsto the assistance of counsel and to due process and a fair trial, as well as his rights20under state statutory law, were violated when, at two points in these proceedings,the trial court failed to declare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence towaive his right to counsel and failed to conduct a hearing into defendant\u2019scompetency. First, defendant contends that Judge Henry P. Nelson (who hadpresided over his trial in the attempted murder case, and who briefly presidedduring pretrial proceedings in the present case) should have declared a doubtconcerning defendant\u2019s competence, based solely on knowledge about defendantthat Judge Nelson had gained during the attempted murder trial. Second,defendant contends that the judge who presided at the trial under present review,Judge Jerold A. Krieger, should have declared a doubt when, during proceedingsthat occurred between the guilt and penalty phases, defendant\u2019s advisory counsel,Newman and Lucas, questioned defendant\u2019s competence. As we shall explain, wereject both contentions.Both the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution and state law require a trial judge to suspend proceedings andconduct a competency hearing whenever the court is presented with substantialevidence of incompetence, that is, evidence that raises a reasonable or bona fidedoubt concerning the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. (\u00a7\u00a7 1367, 1368;Drope v. Missouri (1975) 420 U.S. 162, 181 ; Pate v. Robinson (1966) 383 U.S.375, 384-386; People v. Welch (1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 737-738.) Failure todeclare a doubt and to conduct a competency hearing when there is substantialevidence of incompetence requires reversal of the judgment. (Ibid.)Whether the question for the trial court is competence to stand trial orcompetence to waive counsel and represent oneself, the competence standard isthe same: the defendant must have \u201c \u2018a sufficient present ability to consult with hislawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and . . . a rational aswell as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d (Dusky v.21United States (1964) 362 U.S. 402, 402 ; see also Godinez v. Moran (1993) 509U.S. 389, 399-400; People v. Stewart (2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 513.) The focus ofthe inquiry is the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to understand the nature and purposeof the proceedings against him or her. (Godinez v. Moran, supra, 509 U.S. atp. 401, fn. 12; People v. Koontz, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1069.) The defendant\u2019s\u201c \u2018technical legal knowledge\u2019 \u201d is irrelevant. (People v. Bradford, supra, 15Cal.4th at p. 1364, quoting Faretta, supra, 422 U.S. at p. 834.)a. Judge Nelson\u2019s failure during pretrial proceedings to declare adoubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence and to conduct acompetency hearingAs mentioned above, defendant premises his first claim that the court erredin failing to declare a doubt about his competence to waive his right to counselsolely on knowledge concerning defendant that Judge Henry P. Nelson, whobriefly presided over pretrial proceedings in this case long after defendant hadbeen granted the right to represent himself, had gained during defendant\u2019s earliertrial on the attempted murder charges.Judge Nelson presided over defendant\u2019s 1985 trial for the attemptedmurders of Green and Miller. After the jury found defendant guilty on both countsin that case, but before defendant\u2019s sentencing, Judge Nelson received andDefendant phrases this claim in terms of Judge Nelson\u2019s failure to \u201cconductan inquiry\u201d into defendant\u2019s competence to waive counsel. Any duty under stateor federal law to conduct such an inquiry or a hearing into a defendant\u2019scompetence arises, however, only if the trial court is presented with substantialevidence raising a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s competence. (\u00a7\u00a7 1367,1368; Drope v. Missouri, supra, 420 U.S. at p. 181; Pate v. Robinson, supra, 383U.S. at pp. 384-386; People v. Welch, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 737-738.) Wetherefore shall consider defendant\u2019s contention as a claim that Judge Nelsonerroneously failed to declare a doubt and to hold a hearing regarding defendant\u2019scompetence to stand trial.22reviewed a probation report.The report discussed defendant\u2019s employmenthistory (none) and military service (he was discharged for being absent withoutleave (AWOL) on an excessive number of occasions), and noted that in 1972 inRiverside County defendant was \u201carrested by the sheriff\u2019s office in regards to a\u2018sanity hearing.\u2019 \u201d The probation report also stated: \u201cDuring that same yeardefendant was a patient at Atascadero State Hospital from March until July for1026 Penal Code \u2014 Forgery \u2014 Steal car.\u201dAt the sentencing hearing on August 16, 1985, Judge Nelson remarked thathe believed the maximum available sentence of 14 years and four months was toolenient for defendant\u2019s crimes. Judge Nelson explained:\u201cApparently you are what is called in the trade a psychopath, Mr. Blair. Inother words, you just don\u2019t have any kind of human feelings for anybody else.That\u2019s apparently your situation now.\u201cThere\u2019s some indication that you\u2019ve had some previous bouts withpsychiatric disability, and that\u2019s not surprising.\u201cYou\u2019re 45 years old, and by your own statement you\u2019ve never held apermanent job in your life, and apparently you were fooling around doing somestudying on student loans. Apparently did some flitting around at some school.We granted defendant\u2019s request for judicial notice of the probation report inthe attempted murder case, Los Angeles County Superior Court caseNo. A-757679. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a).)We have received and reviewed certified copies of both the probation reportand the opinion of the Court of Appeal in the attempted murder case. (See fn. 5,ante.)Section 1026 provides for the confinement in a \u201cstate hospital for the careand treatment of the mentally disordered\u201d of any person who is found legallyinsane in a criminal proceeding. (\u00a7 1026, subd. (a).) Atascadero State Hospital isone such hospital for the care and treatment of mentally disordered criminaloffenders. (See Stats. 1982, ch. 1549, \u00a7 37, p. 6045.)23\u201cApparently the military, the Marine Corps discharged you, and accordingto you, for too many [AWOL\u2019s]. So maximum sentence in this case is not enough.[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\u201cYou, who ruined one woman\u2019s life, put her in a vegetative state, ruinedanother woman, the most you can get is 14 years and 4 months . . . .\u201cBut all this is just a joke to you, and I can see that\u2019s true. Because, as Isay, that\u2019s your problem.\u201dJudge Nelson then imposed the maximum sentence.Nearly two years later, as a result of defendant\u2019s statutory peremptorychallenge (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170.6) to the judge then presiding, Judge RogerW. Boren, the present capital case was assigned to Judge Nelson for a brief periodbeginning on May 1, 1987. As described in the previous part, defendant had beenrepresenting himself since October 1986, having been questioned and admonishedby various judges regarding his self-representation. In an answer to a challengefor cause filed against him by defendant, Judge Nelson acknowledged havingexpressed \u201cregret\u201d during the attempted murder sentencing \u201cthat the sentencecould not have been longer, since the evidence indicated a cold, calculated attemptto kill one woman, and almost causing the death of another woman through thatattempt. The Defendant\u2019s actions, as well as his demeanor before me (he secretedan exhibit into the holding tank and flushed it down the drain), indicate adangerous psychopath, and I did say so.\u201dSome time later that summer, Judge Nelson was reassigned to anotherdepartment. During the brief period Judge Nelson presided over this case, theissue of defendant\u2019s competence to waive counsel or to represent himself neverarose. Judge Nelson did not preside over any further proceedings in this case.Defendant contends that because Judge Nelson had presided overdefendant\u2019s attempted murder trial in 1985, he was aware in 1987 \u2014 when he was24assigned to this capital case \u2014 of facts that should have raised a bona fide doubt inhis mind whether defendant was competent to waive counsel and represent himselfin the capital trial. Therefore, defendant claims, Judge Nelson erred in failing todeclare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence and to conduct a competencyhearing in 1987. Defendant observes that Judge Nelson was aware, from theprobation report in the attempted murder case, that defendant had been: (1) foundinsane in a criminal proceeding in 1972 and confined to Atascadero State Hospitalfor several months; (2) unable to hold a job during his adult life; and(3) discharged from the military for being AWOL on an excessive number ofoccasions.We disagree that the foregoing amounted to substantial evidence thatdefendant was incompetent to waive counsel at the time of the capital trial.Nothing about defendant\u2019s discharge from the military or his inability to hold a jobindicated that he did not have the mental \u201c \u2018capacity to understand the nature andobject of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d (See Godinez v. Moran, supra, 509 U.S.at p. 401, fn. 12; see also People v. Koontz, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1068 [evidenceof defendant\u2019s inability to \u201c \u2018function socially\u2019 \u201d was not substantial evidence ofdefendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trial, to waive counsel, or to representhimself].)Similarly, the evidence of defendant\u2019s possible mental instability did notamount to substantial evidence of incompetence to waive counsel at the time ofthe capital trial. Defendant\u2019s confinement at Atascadero State Hospital in 1972suggested that he might have been suffering from a mental illness at that time, andJudge Nelson noted that defendant appeared to have had \u201cprevious bouts withpsychiatric disability.\u201d The Atascadero confinement was in 1972, however, 12years before the present crimes took place, and there was nothing in the record ofthis case pertaining to the period between 1972 and 1987 to indicate that defendant25might be mentally ill at the time of the capital trial. (See People v. Stewart, supra,33 Cal.4th at pp. 516-517.)Moreover, even a history of serious mental illness does not necessarilyconstitute substantial evidence of incompetence that would require a court todeclare a doubt concerning a defendant\u2019s competence and to conduct a hearing onthat issue. (See, e.g., People v. Ramos (2004) 34 Cal.4th 494, 508 [defendant mustexhibit more than a preexisting psychiatric condition to be entitled to acompetency hearing].) We have found that evidence of more serious mentaldisturbances than defendant displayed did not amount to substantial evidence ofincompetence requiring a competency hearing. (See, e.g., People v. Ramos, supra,34 Cal.4th at pp. 508-511 [defendant\u2019s death wish, history of psychiatrictreatment, planned suicide attempt, propensity for violence, and psychiatrictestimony that defendant was physically abused as a child and suffered from aparanoid personality disorder did not constitute substantial evidence ofincompetence requiring court to conduct a competency hearing].) Here, thecircumstance that defendant had been found insane in a criminal proceeding andhad been confined to a mental hospital for an unspecified period approximately 15years prior to the present trial, without more, was insufficient to compel a doubtwhether defendant had the mental capacity to understand the proceedings againsthim in the current prosecution.Nor did Judge Nelson\u2019s 1985 statement that defendant was a \u201cpsychopath\u201dindicate that Judge Nelson entertained or should have entertained a doubtconcerning defendant\u2019s competence in 1987. Defendant notes that one definitionof \u201cpsychopath\u201d is \u201ca mentally ill or unstable person.\u201d Thus, he contends, JudgeNelson must have recognized that defendant was mentally ill.We disagree. The term \u201cpsychopath\u201d (or \u201csociopath\u201d) commonly is used todescribe individuals with \u201cantisocial personality disorder,\u201d defined as \u201ca pervasive26pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.\u201d (See Am.Psychiatric Assn., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (20004th rev. ed.) pp. 701-702.) It appears that Judge Nelson intended this meaningwhen he used the term \u201cpsychopath,\u201d for he immediately explained: \u201cIn otherwords, you just don\u2019t have any kind of human feelings for anybody else.\u201d Hefurther explained that it was defendant\u2019s cold and calculated crime and hisdestruction of evidence in the attempted murder trial that had prompted him tolabel defendant a \u201cdangerous psychopath.\u201d Thus, Judge Nelson\u2019s use of the term\u201cpsychopath\u201d in describing defendant apparently did not indicate a belief, even in1985, that defendant was psychotic, out of touch with reality, or otherwise unableto understand the proceedings against him.Defendant also contends that the following additional evidence should haveraised a doubt in Judge Nelson\u2019s mind regarding defendant\u2019s competence: (1) at atime when Judge Stromwall was presiding over the attempted murder case, theCourt of Appeal had issued a pretrial ruling finding good cause for a continuanceDefendant cites People v. Rhinehart (1973) 9 Cal.3d 139, overruled onother grounds in People v. Bolton (1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, and People v. Teron(1979) 23 Cal.3d 103, disapproved on other grounds in People v. Chadd (1981) 28Cal.3d 739, for the proposition that the trial court should have declared a doubtconcerning defendant\u2019s competence to waive counsel. In People v. Rhinehart,supra, 9 Cal.3d at pages 149-150, we upheld a trial court\u2019s denial of thedefendant\u2019s request to represent himself on the grounds that: (1) the request waspremised upon the defendant\u2019s belief that there were no competent lawyers in thepublic defender\u2019s office; and (2) the defendant was on the verge of makingdamaging admissions in open court. In People v. Teron, supra, 23 Cal.3d at page114, we suggested that a court should order a psychiatric examination of a self-represented defendant if there is any indication that the defendant might bementally ill. Both of these cases were decided before the high court in Godinez v.Moran, supra, 509 U.S. at pages 399-400, clarified the standard of competencerequired in order to waive the right to counsel. Rhinehart and Teron thus nolonger accurately reflect the law.27to allow defendant\u2019s counsel to investigate the possibility of an insanity defense;(2) in the capital case, Judge Blackwell found that defendant could not read andunderstand simple English, and Judge Munoz assertedly found he could notunderstand the saying, \u201ca lawyer who tries his own case has a fool for a client\u201d;and (3) defendant told Judge Munoz that he was unable to get along with theattorneys appointed to represent him. Nothing in the record, however, indicatesthat Judge Nelson was or should have been aware of these facts at the time hepresided over pretrial proceedings in the capital case in 1987. They therefore haveno bearing on whether Judge Nelson should have declared a doubt regardingdefendant\u2019s competence. (See People v. Jones (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1115, 1152 [dueprocess requires a competency hearing if defendant presents substantial evidenceof incompetence]; People v. Castro (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1402, 1415 [dueprocess requires competency hearing when trial court becomes aware ofsubstantial evidence of incompetence].)We also note that defendant overstates what is reflected in the record. Afterfully exploring a possible insanity defense in the attempted murder case,defendant\u2019s counsel informed Judge Stromwell that the insanity issue \u201cis no longerinvolved in this matter\u201d and stated his belief that there was nothing that wouldimpair defendant from representing himself. Further, although Judge Blackwelldenied defendant\u2019s request for self-representation on the ground that defendantcould not \u201cread or write simple English\u201d (because he did not follow all theinstructions in filling out the pro. per. advisement form), that finding appears to beincorrect, in view of defendant\u2019s demonstrated ability, which we already havenoted, in the preparation of numerous pro se filings. Moreover, Judge Munoz didnot find that defendant could not understand the saying about a lawyer trying hisown case being a fool. Accordingly, none of these asserted facts compelled theexpression of a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence to waive counsel.28Finally, we note that defendant\u2019s advisory counsel did not advise JudgeNelson that defendant\u2019s competence might be in issue. In sum, there was nosubstantial evidence of incompetence requiring Judge Nelson to declare a doubtconcerning defendant\u2019s competence and to conduct a competency hearing at hiscapital trial. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1367, 1368.)b. Judge Krieger\u2019s failure between the guilt and penalty phases todeclare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence and toconduct a competency hearingDefendant\u2019s second claim of error is premised upon the failure of the trialjudge, Judge Kreiger, who had observed defendant\u2019s performance at the guiltphase, to declare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence when defendant\u2019sadvisory counsel raised the issue between the guilt and penalty phases.At an ex parte hearing on May 8, 1989, after the guilt verdict had beenrendered but before the penalty phase began, defendant\u2019s additional advisorycounsel, Lucas, informed the court that the defense was preparing to have apsychiatrist interview defendant. Lucas added that he believed defendant mightnot be competent to represent himself or to stand trial. The court disagreed:\u201cHaving seen [defendant] in the past month and a half, I don\u2019t find that he\u2019sincapable of standing trial, at least from a judicial \u2014 a psychological lay person\u2019spoint of view. [\u00b6] He\u2019s a lot more competent than most pro. per.\u2019s I\u2019ve seen.\u201dThe court refused to find that defendant\u2019s decision to represent himself wasgrounds \u201cper [se] . . . for some type of psychological finding.\u201dThe next court day, May 10, 1989, Lucas again raised the issue ofdefendant\u2019s competence to represent himself. Lucas explained that, havingobserved defendant through the guilt phase, he did not believe that defendant was\u201ccompetent legally to undertake the representation he\u2019s done.\u201d When the courtasked him to clarify this statement, Lucas replied: \u201cI\u2019m talking about his legal29competency . . . I\u2019m not saying that he has a mental problem at this point, and Ihaven\u2019t raised that issue.\u201d Newman, however, added: \u201cI would be inclined to saythat a lot of it is mental, too. I don\u2019t think [defendant] \u2014 though him and Idisagree on that \u2014 is mentally competent to represent himself.\u201d The court againdisagreed with both attorneys, finding defendant possessed a \u201cgood grasp of a lotof legal issues\u201d and appeared \u201cmentally stable.\u201d Newman observed that there hadbeen \u201can incarceration of [defendant] at Atascadero State Hospital\u201d and asked thecourt, over defendant\u2019s objection, to declare a doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency.The court replied: \u201cI have no doubt as to his competency, his mental capacity andhis sanity.\u201d Newman then said that over the years he had tried to persuadedefendant to be examined by a psychiatrist, but defendant had refused. When thecourt asked defendant whether he was requesting the appointment of apsychiatrist, defendant stated: \u201cNo. I made my position clear . . . to both advisorycounsel, that I am not \u2014 I\u2019m not raising an incompetency hearing nor aninsanity \u2014 nor an insanity issue.\u201d Defendant reiterated that he wished to representhimself at the penalty phase as well, and that he understood \u201cthe drawbacks\u201d ofthat course of action.Later that day, during an in camera hearing regarding defense strategy heldin the prosecutor\u2019s absence, Newman stated for the record that he and Lucas hadadvised defendant to be examined by a psychiatrist, to consider calling familymembers or friends as penalty phase witnesses, and to consider introducing hisAtascadero State Hospital records, but that defendant had refused to do so.Newman told the court that there were \u201crecords from Atascadero State Hospitalthat I think would have a bearing \u2014 I think would have had a bearing also as faras the guilt phase and the penalty phase.\u201d Newman said he had long believed \u201cthatMr. Blair might have some mental deficiency that would have been to the benefitat least as to the guilt phase and definitely of some benefit as to the penalty30phase.\u201d Lucas added that defendant had \u201cspent 95 percent of his time writingwrits, writing and thinking writs. He has spent absolutely no significant time inpreparation of this case.\u201dDefendant confirmed that he had instructed his advisory attorneys not tocontact his family members or friends, that he did not want to introduce theAtascadero records, and that he did not want to put on, in his words, a \u201cdiminishedcapacity or an insanity defense.\u201d When the court asked whether there would beany mitigating evidence, defendant stated: \u201cI am not sure. I have to do someresearch on that, just what is mitigating evidence. It may be my defense will bethat the district attorney shouldn\u2019t be allowed to put on aggravating evidence. I\u2019mnot sure what mitigating evidence would be \u2014 there would be. I do know thatthe \u2014 the insanity or diminished capacity is out, and I do know that \u2014 thatcompelling my family members to \u2014 to attend is out.\u201dDefendant contends that Judge Krieger had before him substantial evidencethat defendant was unable to consult with his lawyers or to rationally understandthe nature of the proceedings. Defendant asserts that he did \u201calmost nothing\u201d toprepare for the guilt and penalty phases, prevented his advisory counsel frominvestigating and presenting mental health evidence, prevented advisory counselfrom investigating any kind of mitigating evidence, and spent most of his timeresearching and writing writs instead of preparing for trial. Defendant contendsthat these actions were the product of his mental illness and should have alertedthe trial court to his possible incompetence. But nothing concerning defendant\u2019sfailure to prepare indicated that he did not understand the proceedings against him.Further, we have rejected the notion that a defendant\u2019s choice not to present adefense, even at the penalty phase, amounts to substantial evidence ofincompetence. (People v. Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1373 [defendant\u2019schoice not to present a defense at the penalty phase did not compel a doubt as to31his competence to stand trial and represent himself].) Defendant further claims therecord demonstrates that he did not understand the nature of mitigating evidence.Defendant\u2019s technical legal knowledge, however, was irrelevant to thecompetency inquiry. (See People v. Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1364, citingFaretta, supra, 422 U.S. at p. 834.)Defendant further contends there were other signs of mental illness, whichincluded his hospitalization at Atascadero State Hospital, the irrational nature ofthe crime, and his insistence on self-representation in this capital case. But wehave rejected the notion that the existence of Atascadero records raised areasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s competence.Further, the circumstance thatthe crime itself was irrational does not raise a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019scompetence; the same could be said of many murders. Moreover, we agree withthe trial judge that the fact that a defendant represents himself or herself cannot bethe basis, in itself, \u201cfor some type of psychological finding,\u201d because such a rulewould require a competency hearing in every case in which a defendant exerciseshis or her right of self-representation \u2014 a standard that neither the high court northis court has adopted.Defendant further observes that his advisory counsel expressed doubtsconcerning defendant\u2019s competency. Lucas clarified, however, that he wasquestioning only defendant\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d competency, not any possible \u201cmentalproblem.\u201d Again, defendant\u2019s legal knowledge was irrelevant to the competencyinquiry. (See People v. Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1364, citing Faretta,supra, 422 U.S. at p. 834.) Further, Newman\u2019s general opinion that defendantDefendant contends the trial court was or should have been aware of anadditional \u201chistory of psychiatric commitments,\u201d but we do not find in the recordany evidence of hospitalization other than the Atascadero commitment.32might be incompetent, although relevant, did not compel the court to declare adoubt or to order a competency hearing. (People v. Welch, supra, 20 Cal.4th atpp. 738-739, fn. 7; People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1112; People v.Howard (1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1164.) Newman did not explain the basis of anybelief on his part in defendant\u2019s possible incompetence other than to highlight theAtascadero hospitalization, defendant\u2019s refusal to be examined by a psychiatrist,and defendant\u2019s insistence on remaining in propria persona and filing numerousmotions and writs. As we have explained, those circumstances did not compel adoubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence. Further, the trial court had ampleopportunity to observe defendant personally. (See People v. Ramos, supra, 34Cal.4th at p. 509.)In sum, whether the facts outlined above are considered separately orcumulatively, \u201cthe record in the present case does not indicate that a reasonabledoubt existed [or should have existed] as to defendant\u2019s ability to understand theproceedings against him.\u201d (People v. Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1373.)Defendant further contends that the court erred in allowing him to decidewhether or not to request the appointment of a psychiatrist. Defendant, however,was acting as his own attorney. Because the court did not find reason to doubtdefendant\u2019s competence, it properly deferred to defendant\u2019s wishes on that score.Defendant finally contends that the trial court \u201cutterly failed to follow therequirements\u201d of section 1368 when it failed to appoint counsel for him, to solicitcounsel\u2019s opinion as to his competence, to order a competency hearing, and toappoint a psychiatrist or psychologist to examine him.Those statutory dutiesDefendant does not contend that, even if a competency hearing was notmandatory under section 1368, the trial court abused its discretion in failing toorder such a hearing in the face of the less than substantial evidence casting doubt(footnote continued on next page)33arise, however, only if the court entertains a doubt as to the defendant\u2019scompetence. (\u00a7 1368, subd. (a) [requiring the trial judge to declare a doubtconcerning the defendant\u2019s competence, appoint counsel if the defendant isunrepresented, and solicit counsel\u2019s opinion as to competence \u201c[i]f, during thependency of an action and prior to judgment, a doubt arises in the mind of thejudge as to the mental competence of the defendant,\u2019 \u201d italics added]; id., subd. (b)[requiring the trial judge to order a competency hearing \u201c[i]f counsel [appointedpursuant to subdivision (a)] informs the court that he or she believes the defendantis or may be mentally incompetent\u201d]; \u00a7 1369 [outlining the procedure for a hearingordered under section 1368, including the appointment of a psychiatrist orpsychologist to examine the defendant].) Because the court here never entertainedor declared such a doubt, it was not obligated to appoint counsel or to take theother steps outlined in sections 1368 and 1369.3. Asserted ineffective assistance of advisory counselDefendant contends he was deprived of the effective assistance of hisadvisory counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United StatesConstitution, and thus that reversal of the guilt and penalty judgments iswarranted.(footnote continued from previous page)on defendant\u2019s mental competence. (Cf. People v. Welch, supra, 20 Cal.4th atp. 742.)Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to declare a doubt and ordera competency hearing violated his right to a reliable penalty determination underthe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because defendant doesnot explain how the analysis of his Eighth Amendment claim differs from his dueprocess claim, we reject the claim for the same reasons that we rejected the dueprocess claim.34a. FactsAs noted above, the master calendar judge, Judge Munoz, appointed RayNewman as associate counsel and standby counsel on November 4, 1986.Thereafter, Newman appeared in court with defendant during all pretrialproceedings. Between November 1986 and May 1987, defendant, Newman, andthe court occasionally referred to Newman as \u201cassociate counsel,\u201d \u201ccocounsel,\u201d or\u201cauxiliary counsel.\u201d Newman also filed several motions as attorney for defendant.In early May 1987, defendant\u2019s case was assigned to Judge Nelson. At theMay 4, 1987, hearing, the court made clear that it would not permit defendant andNewman to share defendant\u2019s representation. On one occasion, when Newmanattempted to object to the prosecution\u2019s argument regarding a requestedcontinuance, the court cut him off: \u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s remember your status in thecase. The defendant is acting in pro. per., as I understand.\u201d In response toNewman\u2019s explanation that he was \u201cassociate\u201d counsel, the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019tsee how a pro. per. can be chief counsel and . . . have a lawyer in effectrepresenting him. . . . I\u2019m not going to permit the defendant to be in pro. per. andin effect represented before the court by a lawyer. If he\u2019s going to be in pro. per.,he\u2019s going to be in pro. per. \u00b6 If the defendant wants to be represented by alawyer, he has that right. If the defendant wants to go in pro. per., he has thatright. I see nothing wrong with having a lawyer assist the defendant in a deathpenalty case, but I\u2019m not going to have a pro. per. in effect being represented by alawyer in these proceedings. \u00b6 Make the choice. Does he want to be representedby an attorney? If that\u2019s the case, fine; I\u2019ll appoint you counsel, Mr. Newman, andyou can go ahead and represent the defendant. If he wants to be pro. per., youmay remain as advisory counsel, but you won\u2019t be co-counsel to a pro. per.\u201d Aftermore discussion, the court addressed defendant: \u201cNow, make a decision, Mr.Blair. Do you want to represent yourself? If so, fine. You may have an advisory35counsel. If you want to have Mr. Newman represent you, you may not be pro. per.And we\u2019ll go from there. . . . So let\u2019s make a decision, Mr. Blair. . . . Do youwant to be pro. per., or do you want a lawyer representing you?\u201d Defendantresponded: \u201cI\u2019m pro. per.\u201d The court replied: \u201cAll right. Then, Mr. Newman,you may remain as advisory counsel.\u201d At another hearing a few weeks later,Judge Nelson reiterated that Newman was not defendant\u2019s attorney, and directedNewman to \u201clet the defendant represent himself in pro. per., please.\u201dJudge Nelson remained assigned to this case until some time later thatsummer, when another judge was assigned. After that time, the court, theprosecutor, and the defense resumed occasionally referring to Newman as\u201cassociate counsel.\u201d Subsequently, the case was assigned to Judge CandaceCooper in January 1988. Judge Cooper initially expressed some confusionconcerning Newman\u2019s status. For example, on February 26, 1988, she said toNewman: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s cocounsel or advisory counsel [capacity] that youare working in.\u201d Then again on January 10, 1989, she asked Newman \u201cis itadvisory or cocounsel technically?\u201d Newman responded: \u201cIt\u2019s been both. I\u2019m notsure which one.\u201d At all times, however, Judge Cooper made clear that defendantwas his own attorney. For example, on March 11, 1988, she stated: \u201cMr. Blair,you are your own counsel in this matter. You have cocounsel with you.\u201d Andagain, on January 10, 1989, she said: \u201cNonetheless, Mr. Blair is pro. per. I expectthis matter to move along.\u201dFinally, on March 6, 1989, Judge Cooper denied a further continuance thatdefendant had requested based on Newman\u2019s involvement in another trial. Indefendant\u2019s presence, the court addressed Newman: \u201cI understand that. You are,however, advisory counsel, not trial counsel. Mr. Blair can try this matter. He hasbeen pro. per. and advisory counsel is not standby counsel. It is not backupcounsel. It is advisory counsel.\u201d When Newman again began to argue in favor of36a continuance, Judge Cooper stated: \u201cMr. Newman, with all due respect, you keeptalking like you are going to try this case [but] you are advisory counsel.\u201dUltimately, the parties appeared for trial on March 17, 1989. Judge Cooperwas unavailable, so the case was assigned to Judge Krieger. Because Newmanwas involved in another capital trial, the court agreed to continue the matter for afew days to allow Newman to locate additional advisory counsel. The court,however, denied a lengthy continuance, reasoning that defendant, not Newman,was counsel of record. The court reiterated to defendant, \u201cYou\u2019re still pro. per.status. He [Newman] is only advising.\u201d The court also indicated it would grant acontinuance if defendant gave up his in propria persona status, but defendantrefused. The court explained to defendant: \u201cWell, it seems to me that with yourpro. per. status then you\u2019re not engaged in another trial. If you relinquished yourpro. per. status and Mr. Newman were your attorney of record, then the attorney ofrecord is engaged in another trial or will be and, therefore, there is that distinctionto be made.\u201dA few days later, the court appointed Lonzo Lucas as additional advisorycounsel. The court later denied a 60-day continuance to allow Lucas to familiarizehimself with the case, reasoning that defendant, as counsel, was prepared to try thecase.Jury selection began on March 22, 1989. Thereafter, either Newman orLucas, or both, was present in court on each trial day, except during jurydeliberations when counsel were on call. The court ruled that only defendantwould be allowed to address the court when the jury was present, and toldprospective jurors that defendant was representing himself \u201cassisted\u201d by Lucas andNewman.Upon defendant\u2019s request, the court permitted Newman to deliverdefendant\u2019s guilt phase closing argument, but only after defendant expressly37waived \u201cany objection to any change in tactics or emphasis\u201d that Newman mightmake. Again upon defendant\u2019s request, and after defendant again waived his rightto object to any change in tactics, defendant\u2019s additional advisory counsel, Lucas,presented the defense penalty phase closing argument. Lucas also argued theautomatic motion to modify the verdict.b. DiscussionUnder the Sixth Amendment, \u201c[d]efendants who have elected self-representation may not thereafter seek reversal of their convictions on the groundthat their own efforts were inadequate and amounted to a denial of effectiveassistance of counsel. [Citation.] This rule applies whether or not the self-represented defendant has been assisted by an attorney acting as advisory counselor in some other limited capacity. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Bloom (1989) 48Cal.3d 1194, 1226; accord, People v. Pinholster (1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 930.)\u201cWhile the Sixth Amendment guarantees both the right to self-representation andthe right to representation by counsel . . . a defendant who elects self-representation \u2018does not have a constitutional right to choreograph specialappearances by counsel\u2019 (McKaskle v. Wiggins (1984) 465 U.S. 168, 183 [79L.Ed.2d 122, 104 S.Ct. 944]). Thus none of the \u2018hybrid\u2019 forms of representation,whether labeled \u2018cocounsel,\u2019 \u2018advisory counsel,\u2019 or \u2018standby counsel,\u2019 is in anysense constitutionally guaranteed.\u201d (People v. Bloom, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 1218;accord, People v. Stewart, supra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 518-519; People v. Bradford,supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1368.)Accordingly, \u201c[t]o prevail on a claim that counsel acting in an advisory orother limited capacity has rendered ineffective assistance, a self-representeddefendant must show that counsel failed to perform competently within the limitedscope of the duties assigned to or assumed by counsel [citations], and that a more38favorable verdict was reasonably probable in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings[citations]. A self-represented defendant may not claim ineffective assistance onaccount of counsel\u2019s omission to perform an act within the scope of duties thedefendant voluntarily undertook to perform at trial.\u201d (People v. Bloom, supra, 48Cal.3d at pp. 1226-1227, italics in original.) However, \u201c[a]s to those aspects ofthe representation over which counsel retains control, counsel remains responsiblefor providing constitutionally effective representation, and the defendant mayassert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d (People v. Mendoza (2000) 24Cal.4th 130, 157.)Defendant contends that Newman was effectively \u201cassociate counsel\u201d untilthe eve of trial when, on March 6, 1989, the court denied the defense request for acontinuance based on Newman\u2019s involvement in another trial. Defendant arguesthat forcing him to go to trial without Newman\u2019s assistance was analogous toremoving a represented defendant\u2019s chosen attorney on the eve of trial in violationof the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. We disagree.\u201c[T]he powers and responsibilities which attend the representation of acriminally accused person should never be conferred jointly and equally on theaccused and the attorney. Rather, in all cases of shared or divided representation,either the accused or the attorney must be in charge. Stated otherwise, at all timesthe record should be clear that the accused is either self-represented or representedby counsel; the accused cannot be both at once.\u201d (People v. Bloom, supra, 48Cal.3d at pp. 1218-1219; accord, People v. Stewart, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 518;People v. Bradford, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 1368.) Responsibility for clarifying therecord in this regard rests with the trial court.Here, the record unfortunately reflects some initial confusion as to thescope of Newman\u2019s role when the court first appointed him in November 1986,because the court used both the term \u201cassociate counsel\u201d and the term \u201cstandby39counsel.\u201d Any initial confusion was dispelled, however, in May 1987, when JudgeNelson clarified that the court would not permit defendant and Newman to sharedefendant\u2019s legal representation, and that Newman was solely advisory counsel.The record suggests that defendant understood the limits of advisory counsel\u2019srole, because in arguing for a continuance based on Newman\u2019s unavailability,defendant cited People v. Bigelow (1984) 37 Cal.3d 731, in which we explainedthat advisory counsel acts as an advisor or consultant only.Thus, from May 1987 forward, the record reflects no reasonable basis fordefendant to have believed that he would not be expected to try the case himself.Although various judges may have expressed confusion concerning Newman\u2019sstatus, at each point it was made clear that defendant alone was counsel of record.As early as March 11, 1988, more than a year before the trial began, Judge Cooperemphasized that defendant was his own counsel and was therefore responsible fordetermining which defense motions to bring. On January 10, 1989, she reiteratedthat she expected the case to \u201cmove along\u201d despite Newman\u2019s possibleunavailability, because \u201cMr. Blair is pro. per.\u201d And Judge Krieger, who presidedover the actual trial, made it crystal clear that defendant was in charge. JudgeKrieger gave defendant the option of relinquishing his in propria persona status inexchange for a continuance to allow Newman to assume defendant\u2019srepresentation, but defendant refused.That the court granted several continuances based on Newman\u2019sunavailability is not inconsistent with a proper understanding of Newman\u2019s limitedrole as advisory counsel. Before delivering the guilt phase closing argument,Newman confirmed that defendant had been in charge of trial strategy all alongand that Newman, as advisory counsel, had not had the power to subpoenawitnesses or to tell defendant which witnesses to call. Thus, there is no merit in40defendant\u2019s contention that he somehow was deprived of appointed counsel at thelast minute.Defendant contends that even if Newman was solely advisory counsel, heperformed incompetently \u201cwithin the limited scope of the duties\u201d he had assumed.(People v. Bloom, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 1226, italics omitted.) Below we addresseach of defendant\u2019s contentions that either Newman or defendant\u2019s additionaladvisory counsel, Lucas, performed incompetently.i. Newman\u2019s absence from the trialDefendant contends that Newman could not possibly have renderedeffective assistance, because he was absent from the courtroom for more than halfof the trial. We disagree. We never have held that advisory counsel must bepresent during the entire trial. In any event, here defendant had the assistance ofadditional advisory counsel, Lucas, at trial; the court appointed Lucas as additionaladvisory counsel specifically to assume Newman\u2019s role in Newman\u2019s absence.Lucas was present on each of the days that Newman was not, and defendant pointsto nothing in Lucas\u2019 representation on those days that was not competent.Relying upon State v. Parson (Minn. Ct. App. 1990) 457 N.W. 2d 261, 263,defendant contends that advisory counsel at a minimum should be present in courtduring the trial. That case, however, dealt with standby counsel, not advisorycounsel. The two roles are distinct. \u201cStandby counsel\u201d is an attorney appointedfor the benefit of the court whose responsibility is to step in and represent thedefendant if that should become necessary because, for example, the defendant\u2019sin propria persona status is revoked. (People v. Clark (1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 149;People v. Hamilton (1989) 48 Cal.3d 1142, 1164, fn. 14.) \u201cAdvisory counsel,\u201d bycontrast, is appointed to assist the self-represented defendant if and when thedefendant requests help. (People v. Hamilton, supra, 48 Cal.3d at p. 1164, fn. 14;41see also Littlefield v. Superior Court (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 856, 858; People v.Kurbegovic (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 731, 757.) Here, whatever Newman\u2019s statuswhen he initially was appointed, the court subsequently made clear that he wassolely advisory counsel. As such, there was no requirement that he be present ateach court session, particularly because additional advisory counsel Lucas waspresent when Newman was not.Defendant next contends that \u201cit was Newman\u2019s job to prepare the defenseexperts for trial,\u201d yet Newman did so ineffectively, with the result that \u201cthedefense that was supposed to be asserted, that the cause of death was not thecyanide but some other intervening cause, was never presented.\u201d In this regard,defendant observes that Judge Krieger denied defendant\u2019s request to instruct thejury on \u201cintervening cause,\u201d because there was no evidence presented to supportthat instruction.We first note that nothing in the record supports defendant\u2019s contention thatNewman assumed full responsibility for preparing defense experts. Evenassuming he had done so, defendant\u2019s claim would fail. Defendant contends ineffect that Newman failed to meet in advance with the defense experts \u2014 Dr. Latifand Dr. Itabashi \u2014 and failed to provide them with sufficient information totestify effectively for the defense.\u201cWe have repeatedly stressed \u2018that \u201c[if] the record on appeal sheds no lighton why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged[,] . . . unlesscounsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless theresimply could be no satisfactory explanation,\u201d the claim on appeal must berejected.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Mendoza Tello (1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266.) \u201cBecauseclaims of ineffective assistance are often more appropriately litigated in a habeascorpus proceeding, the rules generally prohibiting raising an issue on habeas42corpus that was, or could have been, raised on appeal [citations] would not bar anineffective assistance claim on habeas corpus.\u201d (Id. at pp. 266-267.)Here, the record on appeal does not explain why Newman prepared theexperts as he did, and there could be a satisfactory explanation for Newman\u2019sconduct. For example, Newman\u2019s failure to give Dr. Itabashi any of Green\u2019smedical records to review before testifying could have been a deliberate defensestrategy to keep Dr. Itabashi in the dark about defendant\u2019s case so that he couldtestify only about a hypothetical situation. In any event, defendant does notdemonstrate that he was prejudiced by any failure to prepare the experts. The jurywas instructed that a proximate cause of death is \u201ca cause which, in the natural andcontinuous sequence, produces death and without which the death would not haveoccurred.\u201d Defendant does not explain how, even had the defense experts beenbetter prepared, they could have persuaded the jury that the cyanide given toGreen was not a proximate cause of her death.Defendant also contends that Newman\u2019s absence from the trial made itimpossible for him to give a \u201ccoherent\u201d guilt phase closing argument. Becausedefendant expressly waived any objection to Newman\u2019s closing argument, wedecline to reach this claim. In any event, we would find the claim meritless. Wenote that Newman had available the daily trial transcripts for preparation of hisargument. Although Newman\u2019s argument elicited objections from the prosecutionfor misstating evidence, on the whole Newman presented a coherent argumentbased upon an effort to persuade the jury to find a reasonable doubt that defendant43could have placed cyanide in a sealed gin bottle or that Green died of cyanidepoisoning.ii. Newman\u2019s failure to keep confidential the appointment ofDr. RootDefendant next contends that, in seeking the appointment of Dr. Root as thedefense pathologist, Newman failed to follow the procedures set forth in section987.9, which allow the defense to apply to the court on a confidential basis forfunds for the payment of experts. Defendant contends that Newman\u2019s failures inthis regard permitted the prosecution to learn of Dr. Root\u2019s unfavorableconclusions and to call him as a rebuttal witness at the guilt phase, withdevastating results.At the time of defendant\u2019s trial, section 987.9 provided, as it does today insubdivision (a), that \u201cthe fact that an application [by an indigent defendant forreasonably necessary funds for the payment of experts] has been made shall beconfidential and the contents of the application shall be confidential.\u201d Theconfidentiality provision evidently was intended to prevent the prosecution fromanticipating defense strategy. (People v. Anderson (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1132.)Despite the existence of this confidentiality provision, Newman requestedthe appointment of Dr. Root in open court in the presence of the prosecutor, whoinformed the defense and the court that he knew Dr. Root on a social basis and hadcalled him as a witness several times. Newman also filed an unsealed, writtenmotion requesting the appointment of Dr. Root. After the defense had presentedits case-in-chief, however, Newman informed the court that the defense would notDefendant also complains that Newman apologized to the jury for havingbeen absent during the trial. We find nothing unreasonable or prejudicial inNewman\u2019s acknowledging to the jury that he had been absent.44be calling Dr. Root. The prosecutor then stated: \u201cDr. Root is here. The defensetold Dr. Root to leave. But I had a chance to talk to Dr. Root briefly, and I intendto call Dr. Root.\u201d Dr. Root then testified in the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal case that,contrary to the defense position, cyanide poisoning caused the brain damage andpneumonia that led to Green\u2019s death. Newman later informed the court that hehad advised defendant against calling Dr. Root to testify, but defendant hadsubpoenaed him anyway.The record does not reflect whether Newman had a tactical basis fordeclining to keep Dr. Root\u2019s appointment confidential, and it would be proper forus to reject defendant\u2019s contention on this basis. (People v. Mendoza Tello, supra,15 Cal.4th at pp. 266-267.)In any event, defendant fails to establish that the failure to keep Dr. Root\u2019sappointment confidential prejudiced him. It was defendant\u2019s own choice tosubpoena Dr. Root against Newman\u2019s advice, and it was that subpoena thatbrought Dr. Root to court and resulted in the prosecutor\u2019s interview with him.Moreover, even had the prosecutor never learned of Dr. Root\u2019s opinion concerningdefendant\u2019s case and never called him to testify, it is not reasonably probable thatthe outcome of the guilt phase would have been different. (See People v. Bloom,supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 1226-1227.) The prosecution presented the testimony ofGreen\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Becker, who testified that cyanide poisoningcaused her brain damage and resulting complications. Dr. Gray, who hadperformed the autopsy on Green, testified that Green died of pneumonia, acomplication of the brain damage caused by the cyanide poisoning. The testimonyof defendant\u2019s own experts was not to the contrary. Dr. Latif agreed with Dr.Becker concerning the cause of Green\u2019s condition, and Dr. Itabashi could not saywhat had caused Green\u2019s death. Under these circumstances, it does not appear45that a more favorable result was reasonably probable had Dr. Root not testifiedthat cyanide poisoning caused Green\u2019s death.iii. Lucas\u2019s asserted ignorance about the caseDefendant next contends that Lucas, who was appointed the day before juryselection began, \u201cknew nothing about the case or the defense.\u201d Defendant pointsto various instances in the record in which Lucas professed his ignorance about thecase or acknowledged his lack of preparation. For example, after the guilt verdictwas rendered, Lucas admitted to the court that he was unprepared to handle thepenalty phase because he \u201ccame in on this train when it was already moving.\u201dWe decline to presume that Lucas was ineffective merely because he wasappointed as additional advisory counsel one day before jury selection began. Toestablish ineffectiveness, defendant must point to specific acts within the scope ofthe duties assumed by Lucas that both amounted to deficient performance andresulted in prejudice to defendant\u2019s case. (People v. Bloom, supra, 48 Cal.3d atp. 1226.) Defendant does not identify any such specific act or failure to act.Defendant complains that Lucas did not conduct any penalty phase investigation,but there is no showing that defendant assigned, or that Lucas assumed,responsibility for that function. Indeed, the record is to the contrary: defendantwas in charge of strategy at the penalty phase, and defendant prevented hisadvisory attorneys from sending the defense investigator to interview defendant\u2019sfamily members and other potential mitigation witnesses. Defendant alsoDefendant does not claim on appeal that permitting Dr. Root to testify onbehalf of the prosecution violated the work product rule. In any event, any suchclaim would appear to have been forfeited due to defendant\u2019s failure to object toDr. Root\u2019s testimony on this ground. (See People v. Combs (2004) 34 Cal.4th821, 863-864.)46complains that Lucas began his penalty phase closing argument by reminding thejurors that they had not \u201cheard from\u201d him yet, and told the jury that he would not\u201cbeg and plead for mercy and pity and sympathy\u201d for defendant. Becausedefendant waived any objection to Lucas\u2019s handling of the closing argument, thisclaim is waived. In any event, no prejudicial deficient performance appears tohave taken place. (See People v. Bloom, supra, 48 Cal.3d at pp. 1226-1227.)iv. Counsel\u2019s failure to present evidence regardingdefendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trialDefendant next contends that Newman and Lucas both failed to present tothe court evidence in their possession that would have raised a doubt concerningdefendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. As noted above, during hearings held onMay 8 and 10, 1989, outside the presence of the jurors and the prosecutor,defendant\u2019s advisory counsel Newman and Lucas expressed their belief thatdefendant might not be competent to waive counsel or to represent himself, andmentioned the existence of records from defendant\u2019s confinement at AtascaderoState Hospital in 1972. Nonetheless, neither Newman nor Lucas submitted to thecourt any records or other evidence to substantiate these claims.The record reflects that defendant did not want to be examined by apsychiatrist and prevented his advisory attorneys from investigating a mental statedefense. Further, in response to the court\u2019s question whether defendant wanted thecourt to appoint a psychiatrist to examine him, defendant specifically stated that hewas \u201cnot raising [sic] an incompetency hearing.\u201d Assuming for the sake ofargument that it is within advisory counsel\u2019s role to bring to the court\u2019s attentionevidence in support of a finding of incompetence even over a self-representeddefendant\u2019s objection, on the present record we discern no prejudice from advisorycounsel\u2019s failure to do so. The Atascadero records are not before us in the recordon appeal. We thus have no way to determine whether those records would have47caused the trial court to declare a doubt concerning defendant\u2019s competence tostand trial or to waive counsel. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention.4. Asserted denial of access to ancillary defense resourcesDefendant claims a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equalprotection of the laws, his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, and hisFifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law and a fair trial, dueto the trial court\u2019s alleged denial of reasonable ancillary defense resources such asinvestigators, experts, and legal materials.a. FactsAt defendant\u2019s first appearance in the superior court on October 21, 1986,he requested $2,500 for an investigator and for travel and supplies. Judge Munozdenied that request but ordered that defendant be provided with the \u201cnormal\u201dindigent funds and supplies. The court also agreed to appoint an investigator fromthe superior court panel, but defendant did not select an investigator at that time.At defendant\u2019s November 4, 1986, arraignment, Judge Munoz appointedDonna Brooks as defendant\u2019s legal \u201crunner\u201d \u2014 that is, an individual designated tomake deliveries to and from the court on defendant\u2019s behalf. The court alsoordered $40 in in propria persona funds placed in defendant\u2019s inmate account, aswell as $50 for his runner at $5 per visit.In late January 1987 defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence,asserting that Detective Jackson\u2019s search of defendant\u2019s briefcase and wallet in1984 was unreasonable. The hearing on this motion was continued numeroustimes until it was finally heard in April 1989. In the meantime, on March 4, 1987,Judge Roger Boren, to whom the case had been assigned, ordered a reporter\u2019stranscript of the attempted murder trial delivered to defendant for his use inpreparing for the hearing on the motion to suppress. At an ex parte hearing held in48early April, Judge Boren ordered certain legal and medical books and articlesprovided to defendant. On April 24, 1987, defendant\u2019s advisory counsel,Newman, stated that defendant was having difficulty accessing his in propriapersona and investigation funds. Judge Boren issued an order clarifying thatdefendant was to receive a total of $40 for telephone and stamps, payable at $10per week, as well as \u201cthose supplies regularly and normally . . . provided withoutcost to other persons who are in propria persona.\u201d The order allowed defendant todirect any request for additional funds or supplies to the court.On May 4, 1987, defendant advised Judge Nelson, to whom the caserecently had been transferred, that he recently had received the transcript of theattempted murder trial. When defendant complained a few days later in the mastercalendar court about the $40 limit on in propria persona funds, Judge Munozexplained that the $40 was intended only to cover incidental expenses, and stated:\u201c[i]f you need experts, you will get experts, pay them just like we do with otherattorneys.\u201dOn June 10, 1987, on defendant\u2019s motion, Judge Munoz appointed RobertSabel as defendant\u2019s investigator and issued an order authorizing payment \u201cnot toexceed $3,000 without further order of court.\u201dBetween July 1987 and February 1988, the case was continued severaltimes and was reassigned to Judge Candace Cooper. During that period, defendantmoved for an order to preserve tissue samples taken from Green\u2019s organs after herdeath, for examination by a defense pathologist. The prosecutor agreed to havethe samples sent from Michigan, where Green had died, to the coroner\u2019s office inLos Angeles. Upon defendant\u2019s request, the court ordered the reporter\u2019s transcriptof the May 31, 1985, proceedings in the attempted murder trial prepared and filed.The court denied, however, defendant\u2019s request for additional legal books andother materials.49At a hearing held on March 11, 1988, Judge Cooper at defendant\u2019s requestappointed Dr. Irving Root as the defense expert pathologist. The court later signedan order authorizing payment of up to $3,000 for Dr. Root\u2019s services. The courtalso promised to look into the matter of the May 31, 1985, transcript, which hadnot been prepared as ordered.In June 1988 the parties agreed to continue the trial until January 1989, inpart because Dr. Root had not yet examined Green\u2019s tissue samples. On July 8,1988, the parties appeared before Judge Cooper for a hearing on defendant\u2019sdiscovery motion. Defendant asked for a copy of any fingerprint analysisconducted by the prosecution on the gin bottle and the box it came in, and askedthat the bottle and box be released to a defense fingerprint expert. Defendant alsocomplained that a page was missing from the defense copy of the \u201cmurder book\u201d(the district attorney\u2019s collection of relevant police reports), which had been turnedover to defendant in March of 1987. The missing page documented the death ofMichelle DuBois, the woman Rhoda Miller had visited on the day of thepoisoning. Defendant suggested that the district attorney or his agents might havetaken the page from his cell during a search. Judge Cooper declined to inquireinto the legality of any searches of defendant\u2019s cell, but stated she would order theprosecutor to deliver to the defense a new copy of the page involving DuBois, aswell as any prosecution fingerprint analysis of the gin bottle and box.After another continuance, on March 16, 1989, the court set this matter fortrial the next day. Because Judge Cooper was unavailable, the case wasreassigned to Judge Krieger.On March 17, 1989, before Judge Krieger, the prosecutor agreed to arrangefor the defense expert, Dell Freeman, to examine the gin bottle, the box it came in,and other relevant items. When defendant complained that he had not received themissing page from the murder book, the court stated that Judge Cooper\u2019s order50regarding the page was still in effect, and that the prosecutor would turn it over todefendant if and when it was found.Jury selection began on March 22, 1989. Later that day, Judge Kriegerappointed Malcolm Everest as defendant\u2019s replacement investigator afterdefendant explained that his previous investigator, Robert Sabel, had resigned.The court\u2019s order provided funds of up to $1,500 for Everest\u2019s services.During jury selection on March 30, Judge Krieger formalized theappointment of Dell Freeman as defendant\u2019s fingerprint expert. The prosecutorstated that the gin box and bottle would be available for Freeman to examine at theLos Angeles Police Department.At defendant\u2019s request, on April 6, 1989, Judge Krieger relieved Everest asdefendant\u2019s replacement investigator and appointed Malcolm Richards in hisplace. The funding limit remained $1,500. On April 7 and 10, 1989, during juryselection, Lucas informed the court that he had been unable to contact Richards.Judge Krieger heard and denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion onApril 17, 1989. The parties presented opening statements and the prosecutionbegan its case in chief that same day. The next day, defendant again complainedthat the defense had been unable to contact his replacement investigator, Richards.The court ordered Richards to appear in court on April 20 to meet with defendant.The prosecution rested its case-in-chief on April 24, 1989. Dell Freemantestified for defendant the following day. Ultimately, defendant declined to callDr. Root, but the prosecution called him on April 28, 1989, in its rebuttal case.Dr. Root testified that Green died from cyanide poisoning.Between October 1987 and July 1988, defendant\u2019s initial investigator,Robert Sabel, submitted four fee statements seeking reimbursement for a total of$4,426.57 for 177hours worked, plus expenses. On each statement, defendantacknowledged that he had requested all of the services performed. Neither of51defendant\u2019s subsequent two defense investigators (Everest or Richards) submittedbilling statements.b. DiscussionDefendant contends that the equal protection clause of the FourteenthAmendment to the United States Constitution demands \u201cparity\u201d between theancillary services provided to an indigent defendant who represents himself orherself and an indigent defendant represented by counsel. Defendant contends thatparity was denied to him and that his Fourteenth Amendment rights therefore wereviolated. Defendant asserts that even if parity is not required, the alleged denial ofancillary services violated his Sixth Amendment right to represent himself and hisFifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law and a fair trial.Our analysis begins with a discussion of the constitutional and statutorybases of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to ancillary defense services. \u201c[T]he right tocounsel guaranteed by both the federal and state Constitutions includes, andindeed presumes, the right to effective counsel [citations], and thus also includesthe right to reasonably necessary defense services. [Citations.]\u201d (Corenevsky v.Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 307, 319-320.) Section 987.9 codifies this rightin capital cases. (County of Los Angeles v. Commission on State Mandates (1995)32 Cal.App.4th 805, 815.) At the relevant time (1987 through 1989), that statuteprovided, as it does today, in pertinent part: \u201cIn the trial of a capital case . . . theindigent defendant, through the defendant\u2019s counsel, may request the court forfunds for the specific payment of investigators, experts, and others for thepreparation or presentation of the defense. The application for funds shall be byaffidavit and shall specify that the funds are reasonably necessary for thepreparation or presentation of the defense.\u201d (Former \u00a7 987.9, now \u00a7 987.9, subd.(a).)52As section 987.9 makes clear, the right to ancillary services arises onlywhen a defendant demonstrates such funds are \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for his orher defense by reference to the general lines of inquiry that he or she wishes topursue. (Corenevsky v. Superior Court, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 320.) Thisrequirement applies both to indigent defendants represented by counsel and tothose who choose to represent themselves. (See People v. Faxel (1979) 91Cal.App.3d 327, 330-331 [interpreting the analogous provision for noncapitalcases, section 987.2].) The court held in Faxel that the \u201cnecessary parity betweenthe indigent defendant and others\u201d required by the equal protection clause \u201cis to beachieved not by permitting the indigent to spend public funds at his whim butrather by administration\u201d of the reasonable necessity requirement. (Id. at p. 331.)Assuming the equal protection clause also demands parity between the servicesprovided to indigent defendants represented by counsel and those provided toindividuals representing themselves, such parity is to be achieved in the samemanner.As for the Sixth Amendment, we have recognized that depriving a self-represented defendant of \u201call means of presenting a defense\u201d violates the right ofself-representation. (People v. Jenkins, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1040, citing Miltonv. Morris (9th Cir. 1985) 767 F.2d 1443 , 1445-1446.) Thus, \u201ca defendant who isrepresenting himself or herself may not be placed in the position of presenting adefense without access to a telephone, law library, runner, investigator, advisorycounsel, or any other means of developing a defense.\u201d (People v. Jenkins, supra,22 Cal.4th at p. 1040.) Yet, as we have observed, \u201c[i]nstitutional and securityconcerns of pretrial detention facilities may be considered in determining whatmeans will be accorded to the defe"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/james_a.blair/3152065", "page_content": "James A.
