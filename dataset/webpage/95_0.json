{"Steve Cooper is a former professional footballer.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61565033", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest are in the Championship play-off final despite making their worst start to a season since 1913 before Steve Cooper took charge, having lost six of their opening seven games.\n\nNottingham Forest are not supposed to be in the Championship play-off final, not this season.\n\nA club who have gone through 14 bosses in 10 years, a club who were rock bottom of the Championship when Chris Hughton was sacked in September, a club who have become the ultimate example of a \"sleeping giant\" in English football.\n\nTwo times the champions of Europe, Nottingham Forest have not featured in the Premier League in the 21st century, but are now 90 minutes from ending a 23-year absence.\n\nForest's rise after their worst start to a season in over a century owes an awful lot to an unassuming Welshman who might just be about to make fans' dreams a reality after years of nightmares.\n\nHis name is Steve Cooper and he is the man who utterly transformed Nottingham Forest.\n\nA World Cup winner\n\nCooper's route to possible Premier League manager has not been conventional - he won a World Cup as a manager before he had presided over a single club game.\n\nThe son of former Premier League referee Keith Cooper, Steve Cooper the footballer had a nearly, but not quite, career; failing to make the grade at Wrexham before playing for The New Saints, Rhyl, Bangor City and Porthmadog.\n\nThroughout his time in the Welsh Premier League, Cooper was eyeing a future as a coach.\n\nCooper was only 27 years old when he earned his Uefa Pro licence and after progressing to become Wrexham's head of youth, he joined Liverpool's academy and worked with the likes of Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nManchester City's Phil Foden scored twice as England beat Spain to win the 2017 Under-17 World Cup\n\nCooper had become Liverpool's academy manager before he joined the Football Association in 2013, where he was later named under-17s coach in 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Cooper won the under-17s World Cup, with a team including Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden, as England beat Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\nEngland played with such intensity and fluidity it was only a matter of time until a club came calling, as his former colleague at the FA and now Wales women's national team boss Gemma Grainger recalls.\n\n\"Steve and I worked together at the English FA, I was under-17s women coach and he was men's coach and his qualities as a leader always shone,\" she said.\n\n\"He was always very open about sharing his processes and his planning, he's meticulous.\n\n\"He's an incredible leader, the way he helps players, he inspires his staff and he has real strengths.\"\n\nWith a World Cup won and players raving about him, a transition to club football was inevitable.\n\nIt just came down to who would roll the dice on someone with no experience of managing at a senior level.\n\nRhian Brewster scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for Swansea, but has only found the net four times in the past two seasons for Sheffield United\n\nThe road to Nottingham... via Swansea\n\nSwansea City felt like a natural fit for Cooper.\n\nA club with a track record of strong managerial appointments, the Swans - in transition and in the Championship - were happy to take the chance on Cooper after losing Graham Potter to Premier League Brighton.\n\nHowever, despite still receiving Premier League parachute payments, Swansea nonetheless felt a determination to slash their wage bill, with key performers such as Daniel James and Oli McBurnie sold and not replaced.\n\nYet despite being set for a period of transition - Swansea finished 15th last season - despite shedding key stars, Swansea became promotion contenders.\n\nCooper, as he tends to do, found a problem he was able to solve, as he utilised his relationships working in the FA with the best of English football's young talent.\n\nThe Swans reached the play-offs in 2020 thanks to some superb loan signings as the likes of Freddie Woodman, Rhian Brewster, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher made key contributions, but Swansea were beaten by Brentford in the semi-finals.\n\nDespite spending just \u00a31m towards the 2020-21 campaign, with Joe Rodon sold to Spurs for 10 times that amount, Cooper once again led Swansea to the play-offs with key performers including Andre Ayew and Connor Roberts taking the club all the way to Wembley.\n\nYet the Swansea fans were restless. They did not enjoy the style of football Cooper was deploying as he placed results over the notion of playing \"the Swansea way\".\n\nAfter a 2-0 play-off final defeat to Brentford, there seemed little desire from coach or club for the relationship to continue.\n\n\"I think he did a fantastic job, Swansea probably missed a bit of a trick there,\" former Wales striker Nathan Blake said.\n\n\"I think after reaching the play-offs twice, promotion in the third season seemed a natural progression. If I was a Swansea board member or fan, I'd be kicking myself.\n\n\"It's difficult to know why he's not more loved by Swansea fans. With the budget he had and the players he had, he was a master at being able to get results.\n\n\"Will Swansea fans be happier next season if they finish outside the top 10 and Forest are in the Premier League?\"\n\nCooper left by mutual consent in July, but from the heights of the play-off final he was soon signing up for a relegation battle... or so it seemed.\n\nHighlights: Ruthless Forest knock holders Leicester out of FA Cup\n\nA relegation battle becomes a promotion push\n\nDespite punching well above his weight with Swansea, Cooper's next job was at the City Ground, where Forest were rock bottom of the Championship, a club on its knees.\n\nThe side he inherited from Chris Hughton had lost six of their first seven games in making their worst start since 1913, with Cooper becoming the 14th manager they had appointed in a decade since Billy Davies' departure in 2011.\n\nNot only has Cooper transformed Forest's fortunes, taking more points than any other side since his appointment in September, but he did so in style. He turned a relegation battle into an incredible campaign where automatic promotion was possible until the final week of the season.\n\n\"No-one would have given Forest a chance of being where they are after they were bottom after seven games of the season, and the players were looking a sad group,\" former Forest midfielder Steve Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham.\n\n\"The whole season looked to be a write-off before he took over.\"\n\nWith an emphasis on attacking football, Forest powered up the table, while some of Cooper's critics at Swansea might also have been answered with emphatic 4-1 and 5-1 wins over his former side.\n\nIt was on the coaching field that the best work was done. Cooper turned water into wine. Or rather, Djed Spence from a Middlesbrough reserve to a player now eyed by several Premier League clubs, with others such as 19-goal Wales forward Brennan Johnson also given the opportunity to shine.\n\nAn eye-catching FA Cup run also boosted Cooper's profile, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp singling Cooper out for praise in his speech at the League Managers' Association awards after his side edged past Forest 1-0 in the quarter-final.\n\n\"The evidence of what a good motivator and coach Steve is has been there for all to see with what he's achieved this season,\" Grainger added.\n\n\"His CV is definitely looking good at the moment.\"\n\nNottingham Forest have appointed 19 different managers since Ron Atkinson left the club following their relegation from the Premier League in 1999\n\nThe final hurdle\n\nThe next step for a coach who has now been to the Championship play-offs in three successive seasons is clear - to manage in the Premier League, with Forest now as close as they have been to a Premier League return.\n\nBeaten at Wembley last season - in a match where Swansea were clearly second best - Cooper now has a chance to complete Forest's incredible revival on Sunday against Huddersfield, having survived a scare to see off Sheffield United in a tense semi-final.\n\n\"The job Steve Cooper has done at Forest is amazing,\" Blake added. \"It is clear for everyone to see how much he's gone in and changed things.\"\n\nCan Cooper now go one better at Wembley after last season's disappointment?\n\n\"He's been to the play-offs before, he's got plenty of experience and he knows exactly how to prepare to get a result in a big, one-off game,\" Grainger said.\n\nIf Cooper can get it done, he will have capped one of the most remarkable seasons in Forest's history, taking them from a recent nadir back to the Premier League.\n\nBut whatever the result at Wembley, after years of despair, Cooper has given Forest fans hope again."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3194871/2022/03/19/steve-cooper-the-liverpool-years-only-now-do-i-fully-appreciate-what-a-brilliant-coach-he-was/", "page_content": "Steve Cooper is the kind of character who prefers to look forward rather than back. He often needs a little encouragement to even talk about the past.\n\nAnd when he does, he nearly always has a knack of finding a way to bring the conversation back around to the future.\n\nGiven that he is still only 42 \u2014 young for a football manager \u2014 it is hard to conceive the thought that a key step on his journey to becoming Nottingham Forest manager began more than 13 years ago, when he was appointed as an academy coach at Premier League Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanded the role of coaching the under-12 side in 2008, within three years he was head coach of the academy. Some might have seen his rise coming on the horizon given that at the age of 27 \u2014 while coaching in the academy at Wrexham \u2014 he had become one of the youngest people to complete a UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper\u2019s journey into management in Championship football, with Swansea, saw him climb the ladder steadily, with his appointment in 2019 following positive spells coaching the England Under-16 and Under-17 sides, winning the World Cup with the older age group.\n\nBut it was during those five years at Liverpool that Cooper\u2019s reputation really blossomed as he played a part in the development of players like Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper\u2019s Forest will face his former club in a FA Cup quarter-final at the City Ground that feels decidedly like a blast from the past, largely because of the shared history of the two clubs.\n\nAnd Cooper acknowledges the role his time on Merseyside played in his personal development as he looks to further enhance his reputation by attempting to mastermind a win that would propel Forest into their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 \u2014 in the year they lost in the final to Tottenham, when he was just 11.\n\n\u201cI think all of your experiences shape you, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. I had a long time at Wrexham and they were important days,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThen Liverpool, the FA, Swansea\u2026 you take something out of everything in life. Life is all about experiences and learning from them.\n\n\u201cI had the best part of five years at Liverpool and, when I look back on that now, for me personally it was a really important time. You always do your best for the organisation you work for. It is about the job you do, rather than what you get out of it as an individual. But I was definitely a better coach when I stepped away from there than I was when I first went in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is what I try to achieve in every job I go into \u2014 I try to come out of it as a better coach. It is what I am trying to do here as well, at Nottingham Forest. Every step for me so far has been a beneficial one. I am still a relatively young coach, if I am allowed to say that. I am looking to always improve.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years at Liverpool, Cooper went from being an under-12 coach, to being the senior coach at the academy.\n\n\u201cAcademies are all about the players. That is all that matters. You work long hours, you run long sessions, you work with a lot of players and a lot of different teams,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThe challenge is to help as many players as you can, as much as you can. That applies wherever you are and regardless of who you are working for and whether it is a young nine or 10 year-old or a player in the latter part of his development.\n\n\u201cI managed to work with a lot of very talented young players. Academies are all about the players; it is only ever about their development.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s enthusiasm for reflecting on the past is revived noticeably when the subject of who his biggest influences were at Liverpool arises.\n\n\u201cI met a really important person there, a guy called Pep Segura. He had a massive influence on me. He influenced me when it came to game understanding and the methodology of things,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nCooper with Segura (Photo: Joe Giddens \u2013 PA Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough as well that Sir Kenny (Dalglish) was still working there before he went back to being with the first team. It was brilliant to spend some time around such an iconic guy like him. They were important times for me, in terms of learning and developing as a coach.\u201d\n\nIt was Segura, who had previously managed Olympiakos and Barcelona B \u2014 where he helped develop talents such as Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas \u2014 that Cooper quickly formed a close relationship with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPep was and is a major influence because I still speak to him now. He helped me understand how the game can be played and what it takes to play that way. Not so much just playing \u2014 it was about how you train as well; how you prepare players to do things in the way that you want. He taught me about the methodology behind things as well as how to do things.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like. That\u2019s what I pride myself on now \u2014 having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also how to get there. Pep put me on a different track, really.\n\n\u201cWhat is important in coaching is that you find your own way. You find what you really believe in as a coach. Because, in the end, you want your team to be a reflection of what you believe in. Pep was important to me. What I have learnt, most of all, is that what you think yourself is most important of all. I am still on that journey.\u201d\n\nCooper will not come up against Alexander-Arnold, who has developed into an integral figure at Liverpool and, arguably, one of the best right-backs in the world. The defender will be missing at the City Ground through injury. But Cooper plays down the thought of missing out on a reunion with his former player \u2014 and on any notion of him deserving any credit for the progress of players like him.\n\n\u201cCoaches don\u2019t produce players \u2014 players produce themselves. That is always something I have thought. I never think about any coach being part of a player\u2019s evolution. We are there, along the way,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cPlayers are the ones who deserve the credit for what they achieve. If they do well, they are the ones who deserve the praise for it, because it is their hard work that has got them there.\n\n\u201cWhether they turn into footballers or just good young men, that is what development is all about. It is the same here now. We have a host of young players who are working to get established. It is an ongoing daily journey.\n\n\u201cBut with Trent, I don\u2019t see it as missing out on a reunion, exactly. There are not many games where we do not come up against somebody I have worked with. Chris Willock and Andre Dozzell played with QPR. Before that, against Reading, they had Tom Dele-Bashiru in their squad. There are always players you come up against who you have a past relationship with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest have already beaten Arsenal and Leicester on their way to the quarter-final. It feels like their biggest test yet against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nIf they are to pull off another upset, much will depend on the talented younger players within Forest\u2019s own squad. Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence have formed a dangerous partnership down the right flank, James Garner and Ryan Yates have a dynamic midfield partnership and Keinan Davis has been almost unstoppable up front in recent weeks.\n\nSpence celebrates his goal against QPR this week with Johnson (left) and Worrall (right) (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that young players need these experiences. Players are shaped by all experiences, be they good, bad or indifferent. But it is often the latter two that are the most important,\u201d says Cooper, who will also hope to guide Forest into the play-offs in the remaining 10 games of the Championship season. \u201cThat is where you learn the most from. It is about the difficult situations and how you respond to them. That is what defines you. It is how you respond to setbacks that shapes you.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in self-worth in people; a big believer in positivity and what you can do. We definitely like to have positivity around our daily routines, in the terminology we use and the intent of our days. We always try to focus on ourselves, on our environment and trying to achieve \u2014 to be successful. We attack challenges, we attack big games and embrace them rather than fear them. That is our mentality and if that is building belief and building confidence, then great.\n\n\u201cEvery day I ask the players to be the best version of themselves, to be winners and to give their best; to train and play in a way that we want to do things \u2014 to behave the way we want to behave. But we have not turned things around here. Not yet. We have made some good steps. We have work still to do.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor\n\n\u201cCoops is destined to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Morecambe\u2019s Northern Irish full-back Ryan McLaughlin tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cEven all those years ago at Liverpool it was clear that he had everything you need to make the leap from youth coaching to a senior environment. I don\u2019t think any of us have been surprised by how well he has done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin played for Liverpool Under-18s under Cooper a decade ago. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup where they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by a Chelsea side including Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nCooper during the FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea at Anfield on April 12, 2013 (Photo: Paul Thomas \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was Coops\u2019 attention to detail that really stood out for me. He was very good at seeing things in your game that needed to be worked on. Then he would be relentless in terms of pummelling that into you every day on the training field,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBefore we played Chelsea he talked to me about what I\u2019d be up against in their winger Jeremie Boga. He knew him inside out. He got the balance spot on between giving you good info about what to expect but not freaking you out. He sold it to you as a brilliant challenge. He never over-complicated things. He was a really good communicator. I remember how enjoyable it was playing for him.\u201d\n\nCooper initially joined Liverpool from Wrexham in 2008. In the summer of 2011 he was promoted to academy manager by Dalglish to work closely with academy director Frank McParland, who also had a spell working at Forest during Mark Warburton\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe previous season Cooper had enhanced his reputation after stepping up to assist the academy\u2019s technical director Segura with the reserves following the departure of coach John McMahon.\n\n\u201cCoops and Pep had a great relationship,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cI know Coops took a lot from working with Pep. The Barcelona way is Coops\u2019 way. He always wanted to be expansive with the full-backs high and wide. He always wanted us to be brave in possession.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager in 2012 sparked another reshuffle at Kirkby. With under-18s coach Mike Marsh added to Rodgers\u2019 senior staff at Melwood, Cooper took charge of the under-18s for the 2012-13 season. His squad included the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jon Flanagan, Ryan Kent, Jerome Sinclair, Sheyi Ojo, Harry Wilson, Jordon Ibe, Tom Brewitt, Cameron Brannagan and Jordan Williams.\n\nMcLaughlin was coached by Cooper at Liverpool (Photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams, who currently plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, was one of Cooper\u2019s youngsters who broke into Rodgers\u2019 first-team set-up, making his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Anfield in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Coops since I was nine years old and he was coaching at Wrexham. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with him and we\u2019re still in contact a few times a month with messages going back and forth,\u201d Williams tells The Athletic. \u201cHe moved on to Liverpool when I was in the under-13s at Wrexham and then when I made the same move he was my under-16s coach at Kirkby. We had a great team. I think we only lost two games under him all season.\n\n\u201cCoops could be quite hard on us but not in a bad way. He set standards every day and he didn\u2019t like anyone falling below them. He knew what each player needed to get them going and would personalise it.\n\n\u201cI always remember striker Jerome Sinclair (who later signed for Watford) had his best season under Coops. He used to work so hard with Jerome on the training pitch. He knew he needed an arm around the shoulder, while he knew that I needed more of a kick up the ass. You can tell if someone is more suited to being a coach than a manager. Coops always had both sides. His training sessions were good and he knew how to set a team up tactically. But he also knew how to handle egos off the pitch, which is important.\u201d\n\nCentre-back Brewitt had only just turned 16 when Cooper gave him his FA Youth Cup debut in a fifth round victory over Leeds United.\n\n\u201cCoops was great for me,\u201d says Brewitt, who currently plays for Connecticut-based Hartford Athletic in the USL Championship.\n\n\u201cI was one of the youngest in the squad but he always knew how to fill me with confidence while also ensuring I was on edge to get the best out of me. He had a way of taking you out of your comfort zone. Not to a point where you couldn\u2019t perform, but to help you grow as a player.\n\n\u201cShortly before I made my FA Youth Cup debut he told me \u2018You\u2019re not in the team because of the injuries, you\u2019re in it because I picked you and I believe in you\u2019. We won 3-1 and I cleared one off the line. I felt like I had his trust and I was desperate to impress him.\n\n\u201cThere was always a feeling between us as players that Coops would go on to manage in first-team football. It was the way he went about things. He was less of a pure talent developer and more of a manager in terms of his tactics and getting the best out of players.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely an edge to him. He wasn\u2019t shy in terms of giving out a bollocking. But any criticism was always constructive. He made players better from working with them but he also made it clear that we were there to win and we needed to win in a certain way.\u201d\n\nRodgers rejigged the academy structure when at Liverpool (Photo: Clint Hughes/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the 2012-13 season when Cooper was in charge of the under-18s.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re injured managers forget all about you, but Coops cared and always went out of his way to help during a tough period,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met off the pitch. He cares about what\u2019s going on in your life away from football.\n\n\u201cWhen I got promoted with Bolton, he was in touch with me straight away. When my dad passed away, Coops was the first person to come around the house. That says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper left Liverpool in the summer of 2013, it was a shock for his players. His contract wasn\u2019t renewed as Rodgers\u2019 overhaul of the academy gathered pace.\n\nIt was a period of significant change at Kirkby as Rodgers sought to exert his authority. Segura had stepped down in 2012 citing a desire to return home to Spain. However, his decision was also influenced by the fact he missed out on a more senior role after the owners ditched plans to appoint a technical director and a sporting director to work with Rodgers, who had demanded sole control.\n\nAlex Inglethorpe, the current academy director, was brought in from Tottenham initially as under-21s coach and Michael Beale, currently No 2 to Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, was recruited from Chelsea. Cooper\u2019s exit was swiftly followed by the sackings of academy head coach Rodolfo Borrell, now Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant at Manchester City, and academy director McParland. Neil Critchley, now manager of Blackpool, had arrived from Crewe to take over from Cooper after being headhunted by Rodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise when Coops left and I\u2019m not sure what went on,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cWe were never told the finer details, but obviously Brendan had come in as manager and was putting his own stamp on things.\n\n\u201cCoops was similar to Michael Beale and Alex Inglethorpe in terms of his approach to the game \u2014 young and very driven. Whenever I went back home to Northern Ireland people would ask me what the coaches were like at Liverpool and I\u2019d always say how lucky I was. As well as Coops, I worked with Mick Beale, Mike Marsh, Rodolfo Borrell and Alex Inglethorpe. They have all done well for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the academy at Liverpool is that they develop coaches as well as players. Just look at the job Mick is doing at Villa and Critch at Blackpool. I enjoyed working with Coops, but I think it\u2019s only now that I fully appreciate what a brilliant coach he was.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds: \u201cWe were gutted about Coops going because we all loved playing for him. We just turned up one day and he had been replaced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever affected what Coops thinks about Liverpool. He still speaks highly of the club. He became a fan. He moved on and put everything into his new challenges.\u201d\n\nCooper twice led Swansea into the play-offs before being recruited by Forest, following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a smart move by Forest,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had has been amazing. They\u2019re great to watch and they\u2019re winning. He has turned them into promotion contenders. He had a great education at Liverpool and as players we all benefited from that time we spent with him.\u201d\n\nWilliams agrees, saying: \u201cEverywhere Coops has been he has improved the teams he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI know Yan Dhanda and he really enjoyed playing for him at Swansea. Now he\u2019s got Forest flying. I\u2019m made up for him. Great coach, great person.\u201d\n\nJames Pearce\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphic: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://www.planetsport.com/soccer/steve-cooper", "page_content": "Steve Cooper Profile\n\nName Steve Cooper Born Dec 10, 1979 Age 42 years Birthplace Pontypridd Height 5ft 11ins\n\nSteve Cooper is a Welsh football manager and former player. He is the current head coach of Nottingham Forest having previously managed Swansea City and the England under-16 and under-17 set-ups.\n\nWith a relatively unimpressive playing career, highlighted by a two-year stint at Bangor City, Cooper's prowess comes via his coaching skills which have made him a highly sought after manager.\n\nHis notable work with the England youth teams included leading the under-17s to the final of the European Championship and victory in the World Cup. This success encouraged Swansea City to offer Cooper his first managerial role at club level in 2019.\n\nIn Cooper's two seasons at the South Wales outfit, he twice took the Swans to the play-offs. In his first season they lost out in the semi-finals to Brentford, who would again beat Cooper's side the next year, this time in the final. He left Swansea by mutual consent in the summer of 2021.\n\nIn September 2021 he was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest, taking the club from the relegation zone to the play-offs, where they beat Huddersfield at Wembley. Forest had spent 20 seasons in the second tier prior to his arrival.\n\nSteve Cooper's early coaching career\n\nWhile still playing for Wrexham, Cooper trained to earn his UEFA pro license which he attained at 27, making him one of the youngest ever coaches to do so.\n\nHe went on to take up a position at Wrexham's academy as head of youth development and later moved to Liverpool in 2008 to work as a coach.\n\nAfter three years, Cooper was promoted to academy manager. He left in 2014 when the opportunity to manage England's under-17s arose.\n\nIn 2017, he coached his under-17s to the final of the UEFA European U17 Championship, losing out to Spain on penalties. Redemption came at the U17 World Cup, where again his team reached the final, this time hammering Spain 5-2.\n\nSteve Cooper's club career\n\nAfter five years managing the England youth set-up, Cooper was enticed by a job at Championship side Swansea City at the end of the 2018/19 season.\n\nIn his two seasons at the club, his knowledge of England's talented youth set-up allowed him to sign players such as Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi, both of whom have gone on to represent the England first team.\n\nIn a dramatic end to his first season at the club, Swansea reached the play-offs on the final matchday of the season. A 91st-minute goal from Wayne Routledge secured a 4-1 victory over Reading but more crucially gave his side a superior goal difference to Nottingham Forest to pip the East Midlands club to sixth place.\n\nHowever despite a 1-0 win over Brentford in the first leg of the semi-finals, the Swans were defeated 3-1 at Griffin Park and missed out on the final.\n\nWell done Steve Cooper and all the players of @SwansOfficial getting to the play off final in Wembley\n\n\n\nCracking goal @Matt_Grimes8 pic.twitter.com/8t7zH7MSGv \u2014 \u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2N D L \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2\u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf (@NDLane1) May 22, 2021\n\nIn his second season, Cooper again guided his team into the play-offs with a much more comfortable fourth-placed finish.\n\nA 2-1 aggregate win over |Barnsley saw them into the final. However, once again, Cooper couldn't get the better of Thomas Frank's Brentford as they were beaten 2-0 at Wembley.\n\nA little over a month after the defeat, Swansea announced that Cooper would not be renewing his contract and would be leaving the club.\n\nTransforming Nottingham Forest\n\nIn September 2021, Chris Hughton was fired from his role as Nottingham Forest manager, with the club enduring their worst start to a season in over a century.\n\nForest were bottom of the table having taken only one point from their opening seven games. On September 21, Steve Cooper was named as Hughton's successor.\n\nAlmost immediately, Cooper transformed Forest and they began to rise up the table.\n\nHis expertise once again came into play during the January transfer window, signing young talented forwards Sam Surridge and Keinan Davis, as well as experienced centre-half Steve Cook - additions which would ultimately propel the club to the top end of the table.\n\nIn the 35 matches following his appointment, Forest picked up a remarkable 72 points.\n\nWith two games remaining, Forest were just three points off the automatic promotion spots. However, defeat at Bournemouth meant Cooper would once again have to go down the play-off route.\n\nNottingham Forest win the Championship play-off final to secure promotion to the Premier League \u00f0\u0178\u2018\n\n\n\nThey were bottom of the table when manager Steve Cooper took over in September \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00af pic.twitter.com/fMA8SxZ3xz \u2014 GOAL News (@GoalNews) May 29, 2022\n\nForest earned a 2-1 at Bramall Lane in the first leg of their semi-final against Sheffield United.\n\nHowever, Cooper's play-off curse seemed to be in full effect as a second-half comeback from the Blades saw the tie finish 3-3. Extra-time couldn't split the sides and it went down to a penalty shootout, in which Forest keeper Brice Samba's heroics sent his side to Wembley for the first time since 1992.\n\nForest defeated Huddersfield Town 1-0 in the final, meaning a first Premier League this century, with Cooper achieving something Forest managers before him had failed to do."}, {"url": "https://www.ghgossip.com/who-is-steve-cooper-bio-age-career-net-worth-more/", "page_content": "Steve Cooper bio-Welsh football manager and former footballer Steve Cooper was born on December 10th, 1979 in Pontypridd, Wales.\n\nHe is the son of Keith Cooper, a former Welsh football referee.

He was aged 39 and he leaves behind wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA post-mortem was being held to discover the cause of Cooper's death, but his passing left the club in shock. During his spell at City the former schoolboy gymnast enthralled the crowd with his trademark back-flip somersault celebrations after scoring a goal.\n\nFormer City manager Alan Little, who signed the six-foot front-man from Tranmere Rovers in a \u00a335,000 deal a few months after the club's historic promotion play-off conquest at Wembley, told the Evening Press he was 'devastated' by the news.\n\nSaid Little: \"It's absolutely unbelievable and incredibly tragic for his wife and kids.\n\n\"He was a smashing lad was 'Coops'. He would do anything for you and I am certain that everyone who knows him in football will be absolutely gutted on hearing this news because he was such a great lad. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was blighted by injury, scoring eight goals in 46 appearances.\n\nLittle revealed that he had played alongside the Birmingham-born Cooper when the striker was a young lad and the ex-City boss was coming to the end of his career with Halifax Town.\n\n\"We travelled back and forth to Birmingham a couple of times and I could see then what a great lad he was. That's what made me sign him for York City from Tranmere.\n\n\"He was a big, strapping lad - as fit as anything. I just cannot believe it.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was unfortunately blighted by injury and after scoring eight goals in 46 appearances he moved to Airdrie for \u00a360,000 in September 1994.\n\nIt was with the Diamonds, where he achieved cult status, bagging the winner over Hearts in a Scottish Cup semi-final to go on to meet eventual winners Glasgow Rangers. Former City team-mate Andy McMillan told the Evening Press that it was Cooper who got him to Scotland when he revived his career post-Bootham Crescent with Ayr United.\n\nSaid McMillan: \"I just can't believe it. He made a huge impact on people wherever he went. He was an absolutely fantastic bloke. There wouldn't be anyone who had a bad word about him. It's a massive shock and a big, big loss.\"\n\nCurrent head of youth development at City, Paul Stancliffe played against Cooper, whose career took him from his native Birmingham in 1983 via Halifax, Holland, Plymouth Argyle - coincidentally in a swap deal involving former City ace Gordon Staniforth - Barnsley, Tranmere, York and then on to Airdrie and Ayr.\n\nRecalled Stancliffe: \"He was one of those centre-forwards you never liked playing against. His athleticism was unbelievable and though he wasn't very tall he had such an amazing leap.\n\n\"Off the field he was such a big character as well.\"\n\nThat point was echoed by City chief executive Keith Usher, who told the Evening Press: \"Coops was very popular within the club in the time he was here.\n\n\"He was well liked and a nice chap. It's just devastating when you hear of something like this happening.\"\n\nYork City chairman Steve Beck recalled the impact Cooper had made on his City debut in the first game of the 1993-94 season at home to Swansea City.\n\nHe said: \"I was doing some photographic work at the ground that day and you could see how well he linked up with Paul Barnes.

Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow.\n\n\u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d England ended up winning on penalties.\n\nNow Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived.\n\n\u201cOver a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,\u201d says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. \u201cIn terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Gu\u00e9hi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England]. The players know him, they trust him, they like his ideas and they know what sort of coach and person he is. He knows how to handle young players. He\u2019s got tons of experience.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper (right) and an England squad including Emile Smith Rowe, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Phil Foden celebrate winning the Under-17 World Cup in 2017. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters\n\nFor Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. Frank McParland, then the academy director, promoted Cooper from under-16s to under-18s coach. Cooper worked closely with the technical manager at Liverpool\u2019s academy, Pep Segura, adopting the former Barcelona coach\u2019s philosophy.\n\nCooper\u2019s passion radiated to his players. \u201cHe is the most dedicated manager I\u2019ve come across, in terms of his appetite, his eagerness, his energy, his buzz,\u201d says Jordan Lussey, who Cooper named under-18s captain at Liverpool. \u201cWe got to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals [in 2013] and played Chelsea over two legs. I\u2019d be out locally around Ormskirk on an evening and get a phone call off him saying: \u2018What do you think about this? I\u2019ve got this idea.\u2019 Or: \u2018Come into the office tomorrow, I need to show you something.\u2019 You would sit down, the two of us at a computer, and he would show you what he wants from you in a game, what their weaknesses are and that is another reason he has had great success. Any situation that was put in our way, you knew your job.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper during Liverpool\u2019s FA Youth Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Anfield in 2013. Photograph: Paul Thomas/The FA/Getty Images\n\nCooper, born in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, is meticulous \u2013 on and off the grass. \u201cThere is not a stone that Steve leaves unturned,\u201d says Margetson. \u201cEven the smallest detail is important to him. He is across everything. The dressing room, how it is set up and how meeting rooms are set up, etcetera. One of the things he did around the training ground was make it feel more like Swansea City. He put images of the players all around the training ground and images of the supporters cheering on the team. He was proud to manage Swansea and he knew what it meant to the people. and he often referred to that in meetings and he did a lot of brilliant motivational [pre-match] videos for the players, showing them the history of the club.\u201d\n\nRyan Yates (left) is embraced by teammates after putting Nottingham Forest ahead during Wednesday\u2019s win over QPR. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe 42-year-old, whose father, Keith, was a referee, is an unassuming character and although a deep thinker and level-headed, he can be firm when required. \u201cIf he needs to give you the hairdryer treatment, he will,\u201d says Lussey, now with Curzon Ashton. \u201cIf he needs to give you praise, he will. That\u2019s where he gets that mutual respect from top to bottom. He\u2019s not your best mate where you can just mess about or not put in the work. He will pull you up properly and let you know what he thinks.\u201d\n\nSwansea\u2019s hierarchy were wowed by Cooper during his interview and, after guiding the club to successive play-off finishes on a modest budget, unsurprisingly there was Premier League interest last summer and he held talks with Crystal Palace. Forest identified Cooper as their first-choice target after sacking Chris Hughton when bottom of the Championship. They have risen to eighth, Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 home win over QPR continuing form that looks capable of securing a play-off place. Since his appointment six months ago they have lost only four times.\n\nA Nottingham Forest fan with a Steve Cooper cutout. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n\u201cHe is very much a family man, but he lives and breathes football,\u201d Margetson says. \u201cIf he\u2019s not thinking about Forest, he\u2019ll be watching games somewhere. You can\u2019t just rock up and land in the Championship \u2013 you have to earn your stripes and study the game and there is no doubt that Coops has done.\u201d\n\nWhen Forest kick off against Liverpool at the City Ground, Foster will be watching on television at St George\u2019s Park, cup of tea in hand. \u201cI am immensely proud of him,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI think when you\u2019ve not had a wonderful playing career it\u2019s harder to establish yourself as a coach. He\u2019s had to do it the hard way and is reaping the rewards of that. He has been a shining light for coaches at the FA and beyond. He will play it down but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s itching to pit his wits against one of the best coaches in the game.\u201d"}], "Steve Cooper played as a midfielder.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61565033", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest are in the Championship play-off final despite making their worst start to a season since 1913 before Steve Cooper took charge, having lost six of their opening seven games.\n\nNottingham Forest are not supposed to be in the Championship play-off final, not this season.\n\nA club who have gone through 14 bosses in 10 years, a club who were rock bottom of the Championship when Chris Hughton was sacked in September, a club who have become the ultimate example of a \"sleeping giant\" in English football.\n\nTwo times the champions of Europe, Nottingham Forest have not featured in the Premier League in the 21st century, but are now 90 minutes from ending a 23-year absence.\n\nForest's rise after their worst start to a season in over a century owes an awful lot to an unassuming Welshman who might just be about to make fans' dreams a reality after years of nightmares.\n\nHis name is Steve Cooper and he is the man who utterly transformed Nottingham Forest.\n\nA World Cup winner\n\nCooper's route to possible Premier League manager has not been conventional - he won a World Cup as a manager before he had presided over a single club game.\n\nThe son of former Premier League referee Keith Cooper, Steve Cooper the footballer had a nearly, but not quite, career; failing to make the grade at Wrexham before playing for The New Saints, Rhyl, Bangor City and Porthmadog.\n\nThroughout his time in the Welsh Premier League, Cooper was eyeing a future as a coach.\n\nCooper was only 27 years old when he earned his Uefa Pro licence and after progressing to become Wrexham's head of youth, he joined Liverpool's academy and worked with the likes of Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nManchester City's Phil Foden scored twice as England beat Spain to win the 2017 Under-17 World Cup\n\nCooper had become Liverpool's academy manager before he joined the Football Association in 2013, where he was later named under-17s coach in 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Cooper won the under-17s World Cup, with a team including Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden, as England beat Spain 5-2 in the final.\n\nEngland played with such intensity and fluidity it was only a matter of time until a club came calling, as his former colleague at the FA and now Wales women's national team boss Gemma Grainger recalls.\n\n\"Steve and I worked together at the English FA, I was under-17s women coach and he was men's coach and his qualities as a leader always shone,\" she said.\n\n\"He was always very open about sharing his processes and his planning, he's meticulous.\n\n\"He's an incredible leader, the way he helps players, he inspires his staff and he has real strengths.\"\n\nWith a World Cup won and players raving about him, a transition to club football was inevitable.\n\nIt just came down to who would roll the dice on someone with no experience of managing at a senior level.\n\nRhian Brewster scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for Swansea, but has only found the net four times in the past two seasons for Sheffield United\n\nThe road to Nottingham... via Swansea\n\nSwansea City felt like a natural fit for Cooper.\n\nA club with a track record of strong managerial appointments, the Swans - in transition and in the Championship - were happy to take the chance on Cooper after losing Graham Potter to Premier League Brighton.\n\nHowever, despite still receiving Premier League parachute payments, Swansea nonetheless felt a determination to slash their wage bill, with key performers such as Daniel James and Oli McBurnie sold and not replaced.\n\nYet despite being set for a period of transition - Swansea finished 15th last season - despite shedding key stars, Swansea became promotion contenders.\n\nCooper, as he tends to do, found a problem he was able to solve, as he utilised his relationships working in the FA with the best of English football's young talent.\n\nThe Swans reached the play-offs in 2020 thanks to some superb loan signings as the likes of Freddie Woodman, Rhian Brewster, Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher made key contributions, but Swansea were beaten by Brentford in the semi-finals.\n\nDespite spending just \u00a31m towards the 2020-21 campaign, with Joe Rodon sold to Spurs for 10 times that amount, Cooper once again led Swansea to the play-offs with key performers including Andre Ayew and Connor Roberts taking the club all the way to Wembley.\n\nYet the Swansea fans were restless. They did not enjoy the style of football Cooper was deploying as he placed results over the notion of playing \"the Swansea way\".\n\nAfter a 2-0 play-off final defeat to Brentford, there seemed little desire from coach or club for the relationship to continue.\n\n\"I think he did a fantastic job, Swansea probably missed a bit of a trick there,\" former Wales striker Nathan Blake said.\n\n\"I think after reaching the play-offs twice, promotion in the third season seemed a natural progression. If I was a Swansea board member or fan, I'd be kicking myself.\n\n\"It's difficult to know why he's not more loved by Swansea fans. With the budget he had and the players he had, he was a master at being able to get results.\n\n\"Will Swansea fans be happier next season if they finish outside the top 10 and Forest are in the Premier League?\"\n\nCooper left by mutual consent in July, but from the heights of the play-off final he was soon signing up for a relegation battle... or so it seemed.\n\nHighlights: Ruthless Forest knock holders Leicester out of FA Cup\n\nA relegation battle becomes a promotion push\n\nDespite punching well above his weight with Swansea, Cooper's next job was at the City Ground, where Forest were rock bottom of the Championship, a club on its knees.\n\nThe side he inherited from Chris Hughton had lost six of their first seven games in making their worst start since 1913, with Cooper becoming the 14th manager they had appointed in a decade since Billy Davies' departure in 2011.\n\nNot only has Cooper transformed Forest's fortunes, taking more points than any other side since his appointment in September, but he did so in style. He turned a relegation battle into an incredible campaign where automatic promotion was possible until the final week of the season.\n\n\"No-one would have given Forest a chance of being where they are after they were bottom after seven games of the season, and the players were looking a sad group,\" former Forest midfielder Steve Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham.\n\n\"The whole season looked to be a write-off before he took over.\"\n\nWith an emphasis on attacking football, Forest powered up the table, while some of Cooper's critics at Swansea might also have been answered with emphatic 4-1 and 5-1 wins over his former side.\n\nIt was on the coaching field that the best work was done. Cooper turned water into wine. Or rather, Djed Spence from a Middlesbrough reserve to a player now eyed by several Premier League clubs, with others such as 19-goal Wales forward Brennan Johnson also given the opportunity to shine.\n\nAn eye-catching FA Cup run also boosted Cooper's profile, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp singling Cooper out for praise in his speech at the League Managers' Association awards after his side edged past Forest 1-0 in the quarter-final.\n\n\"The evidence of what a good motivator and coach Steve is has been there for all to see with what he's achieved this season,\" Grainger added.\n\n\"His CV is definitely looking good at the moment.\"\n\nNottingham Forest have appointed 19 different managers since Ron Atkinson left the club following their relegation from the Premier League in 1999\n\nThe final hurdle\n\nThe next step for a coach who has now been to the Championship play-offs in three successive seasons is clear - to manage in the Premier League, with Forest now as close as they have been to a Premier League return.\n\nBeaten at Wembley last season - in a match where Swansea were clearly second best - Cooper now has a chance to complete Forest's incredible revival on Sunday against Huddersfield, having survived a scare to see off Sheffield United in a tense semi-final.\n\n\"The job Steve Cooper has done at Forest is amazing,\" Blake added. \"It is clear for everyone to see how much he's gone in and changed things.\"\n\nCan Cooper now go one better at Wembley after last season's disappointment?\n\n\"He's been to the play-offs before, he's got plenty of experience and he knows exactly how to prepare to get a result in a big, one-off game,\" Grainger said.\n\nIf Cooper can get it done, he will have capped one of the most remarkable seasons in Forest's history, taking them from a recent nadir back to the Premier League.\n\nBut whatever the result at Wembley, after years of despair, Cooper has given Forest fans hope again."}, {"url": "https://www.premierleague.com/managers/65984/Steve-Cooper/overview", "page_content": "Manager Bio\n\nSteve Cooper was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest on 21 September 2021.\n\nBorn in Pontypridd, Wales, Cooper played as a defender for several Welsh sides including Bangor City, while also studying for his coaching badges.\n\nAfter becoming one of the youngest coaches to obtain his UEFA Pro License, aged 27, Cooper went on to take charge of Wrexham and then Liverpool's academies.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed manager of the England Under-16s, before going on to the Under-17s a year later.\n\nHe led them to the final of the 2017 UEFA European Championship, where they were beaten by Spain, but in October of that year, they avenged their loss with a 5-2 victory over the Spaniards in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup final.\n\nCooper joined Swansea City in June 2019, guiding them to the playoff final in 2020/21, where they lost out to Brentford at Wembley Stadium in his second and final season at the helm.\n\nIn his first campaign at Forest, Cooper took the club from the bottom of the table and ended their 23-year exile from the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final."}, {"url": "https://www.foottheball.com/manager-in-focus/steve-cooper-nottingham-forest-tactics-style-positional-play-championship-star-players-johnson-garner-spence-play-offs-premier-league-potential/", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest has long been a dormant giant of English football.

Whether it was his England youth teams or his Swansea side, Cooper makes sure his team looks to control possession. The tactics Cooper has deployed at Nottingham Forest function around the same principles.\n\nCooper usually sets up his Nottingham Forest team in a 3-4-1-2. Which looks like a 5-3-2 without the ball and often like 3-4-3 with the ball. His players are very comfortable with on field positional interchanges. Especially in the final 3rd.\n\nOne centre midfielder is deployed as a box-to-box midfielder while the other central midfielder hangs back to protect the backline and acts as a deep-lying playmaker. The number 10 is allowed to roam into free space, especially to help cause overloads on the flanks with an attacker and charging wing-backs on either flank. More often than not James Garner was the deep-lying playmaker and Ryan Yates was deployed as the box-to-box midfielder. New signing Orel Mangala might be an upgrade on Yates, while there is an upgrade in the No10 position too.\n\nAhead of them, Philip Zinckernagel played as the number 10. Jesse Lingard has come in to play this role now. Forest are not going to control games as easily in the Premier League so Lingard\u2019s running might prove to be crucial.\n\nOn the flanks, the wing-backs are charged with bombing up and down the pitch to contribute defensively and in the final 3rd. So much so that 78% of Forest\u2019s attacks come from the flanks. The wing-backs have also contributed with 16 goal involvements this season. Which is an impressive number for players in such a strenuous league as the Championship. Djed Spence and Jack Colback fit into these roles seamlessly last season.\n\nWhat was remarkable about Cooper\u2019s Forest is that they were the best counter-attacking side in the league. They move the ball extremely incisively. Without the ball, they look to cramp the centre of the park to leave space for the wing-backs to cause havoc on the flanks. The rampaging Spence and Colback were essential cogs to Nottingham Forest\u2019s counterattacks. Without Djed Spence, that could take a hit. Forest would hope new signing Neco Williams hits the ground running.\n\nNottingham Forest under Cooper have shown the tactical versatility to combine their possession game and counter-attacking ability to become one of the most complete teams in the league.\n\nSome of the above-mentioned players have gone on to become stars and had a breakthrough campaign in the Championship. Luckily for Nottingham Forest, Steve Cooper has an excellent track record of working with young players and developing them. They have 13 squad members under the age of 25 meaning Cooper can build a prodigious squad at Nottingham Forest.\n\nJust look at Sancho, Foden and Smith-Rowe who were part of Cooper\u2019s under-17 World Cup winning England squad.\n\nThe supporting cast\n\n\n\nSteve Cooper has managed to get superb performances out of some middling players. He has also given the perfect platform for youngsters. Cooper has even managed to get the best out of some veterans. Basically, he has got the squad working together beautifully.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Relaxed atmosphere, players often refer to him as \u2018Coops\u2019 not \u2018boss\u2019\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Several player meetings each day\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Eye for detail\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Helping developing Worrall as leader when Grabban injured How Cooper inspired Forest to play-off place \ud83d\udcdd @nottmtails @PJBuckingham @DTathletic \u2014 The Athletic UK (@TheAthleticUK) April 27, 2022\n\nMiddling players such as Steve Worral, Scott McKenna, Brice Samba and Philip Zinckernagell have fit into Cooper\u2019s system flawlessly. Worral, who was seen as a promising centre-back about 4 years ago, became one of the most consistent ball-playing centre-backs in the Championship.\n\n156 interceptions, 14 fouls, 2,720 minutes played and 1 vintage car.

Coming up in Scotland McKenna was seen as a promising centre-back. His form at Forest took a step up after Cooper\u2019s appointment. Since then, he has become one of the most physically dominant defenders in the league. This centre-back duo has managed to keep 17 clean sheets together and has got their career back on the right track.\n\nMcKenna has been called up #nffc pic.twitter.com/QpoCynds17 \u2014 Talk Forest TV (@talkforesttv) May 23, 2022\n\nPhilip Zinckernagel exploded last season. After his disappointing stint at Watford, the Hornets loanee has 6 goals and 7 assists last season. His performances earned him a move to Greek champions Olympiacos. The trio of Niakhate, Mangala and Lingard will hope to replace his attacking output.\n\nOnly Brennan Johnson and Lewis Grabban have more direct goal involvements for Nottingham Forest this season than Philip Zinckernagel (16). #NFFC pic.twitter.com/eMjo2MbEd3 \u2014 Callum Castel (@callumcasteln) April 19, 2022\n\nBrice Samba was the best keeper in the league last season. He had an 80% save rate in the Championship this season, the highest in the league. However, he moved back to France with Lens, leaving Forest to look for a replacement. Forest again played a masterstroke here. Manchester United\u2019s GK Dean Henderson was available on loan and the club snapped him up, arguably an upgrade on Samba.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f \"Brice Samba saves it, and Forest are going to Wembley\" \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udd34 #NFFC pic.twitter.com/j28z0w9A8h \u2014 Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC) May 18, 2022\n\nCooper has also managed to get the best out of veterans like Lewis Grabban, Steve Cook and Jack Colback. These 3 veterans have provided the much-needed experience that was needed for a club like Nottingham Forest to push for a Premier League spot.\n\nLewis Grabban ruled out for 6-7 weeks with a hamstring injury At 34 and out of contract this summer, you suspect he\u2019s now played his final game for #NFFC Grabbs became the first Forest player since 2003 to net 20 goals in a season and has scored 50+ in red!

Grabban scored 12 and assisted 4 in 32 appearances in the league last season. Expecting such output in the PL was not realistic. Therefore, Forest went out and bought Taiwo Awoniyi for a club record fee.

Yates is the oldest out of this lot. At 24, he contributed 8 goals last season. The 21-year olds-Garner, Johnson and Spence were exceptional season for Nottingham Forest under Steve Cooper.\n\nGarner, who was on loan from Manchester United, looked exceptional on the ball as his defensive game took a much-needed step up. In fact, he looks primed to make space for himself at the Red Devils under Ten Hag. His passing ability has made him a fan favourite this pre-season with United and he will look to make the deep-lying playmaker role his own. If the Frenkie de Jong saga ends up with de Jong not joining United, then Garner might make his way into ten Hag\u2019s first XI.\n\n\ud83e\udd47 James Garner has been named in the SofaScore team of the season; the only Nottingham Forest player to do so. \ud83d\ude80 \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddf2'\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf7\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udfee\ud835\udfed \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf1.#MUFC pic.twitter.com/i3b8BS5Ogk \u2014 Man United News (@ManUtdMEN) May 9, 2022\n\nBrennan Johnson was an outstanding attacking talent at Nottingham last season. His pace caused problems for every backline in the league. The hybrid attacking midfielder/ winger was mainly been deployed as a striker alongside a more physically dominant partner in either Davies, Grabban or Surridge.\n\n\ud83d\udcab Brennan Johnson has been directly involved in 29 goals in all competitions this season (19 goals, 10 assists) \u2013 12 more than any other @NFFC player.

In 47 appearances he scored 17 goals and laid out 10 assists, the highest in the Nottingham Forest squad for both metrics. A stroke of genius by Cooper. Now, with a new contract, Johnson is one of the pillars of this side.\n\nLast but not least is Djed Spence. Spence was on loan from Boro but his performances had ensured that there was going to be no second season for him at Forest. The wing-back became a bona fide superstar last season. His relentless running, ball-carrying ability and sheer pace made him one of the most effective wing-backs in the EFL. So much so that he is Tottenham moved for him. In 40 appearances he kept 15 clean sheets and even chipped in with 2 goals. Along with Destiny Udogie, Conte might have settled Spurs\u2019 wing-back spots for the next decade.\n\nMost important result today: Djed Spence will be playing for Nottingham Forest in the playoffs. Boro didn\u2019t consider him good enough and Boro didn\u2019t make it.#NFFC pic.twitter.com/lEAEv7QK1I \u2014 FFSForest (@Forest_No_22) May 7, 2022\n\nOne can argue that the challenge for Steve Cooper starts now. He will get his chance to manage in the Premier League. However, just bringing promotion to Forest is a miracle, considering the position they were in when he was appointed.

So five years to the day since that triumph in Kolkata, allow Mirror Football to take you through the ranks and see how their careers have progressed.\n\nGoalkeeper: Curtis Anderson\n\nAnderson was a Manchester City academy player back in 2017, but since then has been on quite the journey. He moved across the Atlantic to sign for US side Charlotte Independence in 2019 before coming back to England to sign for Wycombe Wanderers, where he was sent out on loan to Walton Casuals and Eastbourne Borough.\n\nHaving never made an appearance for Wycombe, the 22-year-old joined Northern Premier League side Lancaster City in January.\n\nFull-back: Steven Sessegnon\n\nThe twin of Tottenham left-back Ryan Sessegnon went to India as a key member of Cooper\u2019s squad. He was a Fulham player then \u2013 and he remains one now. Sessegnon is yet to make a real breakthrough at Fulham and is currently out on loan with Charlton Athletic, following spells at Bristol City and Plymouth Argyle.\n\nCentre-back: Marc Guehi\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nGuehi is one of the few players on this list to have progressed to the senior England squad, having been capped by Gareth Southgate for the first time in March. The 22-year-old\u2019s international recognition came off the back of some solid and consistent displays for Crystal Palace, who bought him in July 2021 for \u00a318million from Chelsea.\n\nCentre-back: Joel Latibeaudiere\n\nLatibeaudiere was a prominent player at youth team level, captaining Manchester City's U18 to the Premier League North title and the FA Youth Cup final. But he was never given a first-team chance by Pep Guardiola and, after a loan spell with FC Twente, he moved to Swansea City in October 2020.\n\nNow settled at the Championship club, Latibeaudiere is a regular for Russell Martin\u2019s side, who are pushing for promotion back to the Premier League.\n\nFull-back: Jonathan Panzo\n\nImage: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images) James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images)\n\nFor a 22-year-old, Panzo has already had quite the nomadic career. One of many talented players developed by the Chelsea academy, Panzo left for Monaco, has played on loan for Cercle Brugge and signed for Dijon.\n\nHe was snapped up by Nottingham Forest in January, before they were promoted to the Premier League, and has since been loaned out to Coventry City for the season. He features regularly on the left side of Mark Robins\u2019 favoured three-man defence at the Sky Blues.\n\nCentre-midfield: Tashan Oakley-Boothe\n\nOakley-Boothe was at Tottenham back in October 2017, but made just one substitute appearance in the League Cup for his boyhood club. He was sold to Stoke City in January 2020 where he made a decent impact before a back injury stalled his progress.\n\nThis season has taken the midfielder to Lincoln City on a season-long loan and he is a regular for the League One side.\n\nCentre-midfield: George McEachran\n\nThe younger brother of Josh McEachran has been given his schooling at Chelsea, where he featured heavily for all age groups. McEachran is now following the well-trodden path of Chelsea youngsters, with a loan spell at Cambuur followed by another at Dutch side MVV, where he has one assist in three appearances so far.\n\nRight-wing: Phil Foden\n\nImage: DeFodi Images via Getty Images) DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\nHere is a name you are bound to be familiar with. Foden was the star of the under-17 team, scoring twice in the final to win the man of the match award. It will come as no surprise to those who watched him dazzle defences in India that Foden is already an established world star.\n\nAt the age of 22, Foden already has 52 goals and 36 assists in 185 appearances for Man City. He has won four Premier League titles, four League Cups and an FA Cup and is rightly considered one of the best young players in the world.\n\nAttacking midfield: Morgan Gibbs-White\n\nThere is a reason why Nottingham Forest were so keen to sign Gibbs-White this summer. Cooper managed him with England under-17s, so knew just how good he could be. Forest shelled out a whopping \u00a342.5m to sign the midfielder from Wolves after he bagged 12 goals and 10 assists on loan at Sheffield United last season.\n\nGibbs-White is yet to provide much of a return on that investment, with two assists in 12 Premier League games this season.\n\nLeft-wing: Callum Hudson-Odoi\n\nHudson-Odoi is another player who enjoyed an early breakthrough in his career. The 22-year-old winger has already played 126 times for Chelsea, contributing 16 goals and 22 assists, and has a Champions League and Europa League winners medal in his collection.\n\nHowever, he left Chelsea this summer, joining Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan in order to get more frequent game time.

You've got a strong runner in Doucoure with Iwobi and McNeill had a free role from the left.\n\nREAD MORE: Forest predicted XI as Cooper faces key Spurs decisions\n\nREAD MORE: Forest have three undroppables as Cooper makes key point after stalemate\n\n\"Forest struggled and that can happen when you have three players who haven't played together much. Colback won't let anyone down. You know what you will get from him.\n\n\"Jonjo will play that forward pass and try to unlock defences. At times for me, it just looked so spread out as a three. There were times when Jonjo was in front of Aurier and it left Freuler almost on his own. Everton dominated that first half.\n\n\"It needs tweaking. It's not quite right. Yates is a big part of fixing that because of his energy. When you have someone with that energy - I think of playing with Chris Cohen - that energy around you lets a player like Shelvey do what he's good at.\n\n\"I don't think the balance is right. Colback will give you an honest performance and a tidy one. Shelvey can really implement his role in the side but he needs the right people around him.\"\n\nMidfielders were at fault for both Everton goals with a combination of Freuler and Colback failing to clear in their own penalty area before Shelvey conceded a penalty with a clumsy tackle on Dwight McNeill.\n\nThe second goal saw central defenders Felipe and Joe Worrall lose aerial challenges before Freuler let Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 run beyond him to head in.\n\n\"They had chances where they could have cleared it from the first header and a scramble, then it broke (for the penalty). They got caught out. If that penalty is given against you, you think it's soft. McNeill was looking for it, but if you dangle a leg that can happen.\"\n\nOn the second goal, he said: \"Centre halves won't win every header. The biggest thing is that ball after. Players, myself included, you can switch off and then you can't get back. Small details are important the higher you go up the leagues.\n\n\"You want centre-halves to win headers but it happens.

He often needs a little encouragement to even talk about the past.\n\nAnd when he does, he nearly always has a knack of finding a way to bring the conversation back around to the future.\n\nGiven that he is still only 42 \u2014 young for a football manager \u2014 it is hard to conceive the thought that a key step on his journey to becoming Nottingham Forest manager began more than 13 years ago, when he was appointed as an academy coach at Premier League Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanded the role of coaching the under-12 side in 2008, within three years he was head coach of the academy. Some might have seen his rise coming on the horizon given that at the age of 27 \u2014 while coaching in the academy at Wrexham \u2014 he had become one of the youngest people to complete a UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper\u2019s journey into management in Championship football, with Swansea, saw him climb the ladder steadily, with his appointment in 2019 following positive spells coaching the England Under-16 and Under-17 sides, winning the World Cup with the older age group.\n\nBut it was during those five years at Liverpool that Cooper\u2019s reputation really blossomed as he played a part in the development of players like Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper\u2019s Forest will face his former club in a FA Cup quarter-final at the City Ground that feels decidedly like a blast from the past, largely because of the shared history of the two clubs.\n\nAnd Cooper acknowledges the role his time on Merseyside played in his personal development as he looks to further enhance his reputation by attempting to mastermind a win that would propel Forest into their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 \u2014 in the year they lost in the final to Tottenham, when he was just 11.\n\n\u201cI think all of your experiences shape you, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. I had a long time at Wrexham and they were important days,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThen Liverpool, the FA, Swansea\u2026 you take something out of everything in life. Life is all about experiences and learning from them.\n\n\u201cI had the best part of five years at Liverpool and, when I look back on that now, for me personally it was a really important time. You always do your best for the organisation you work for. It is about the job you do, rather than what you get out of it as an individual. But I was definitely a better coach when I stepped away from there than I was when I first went in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is what I try to achieve in every job I go into \u2014 I try to come out of it as a better coach. It is what I am trying to do here as well, at Nottingham Forest. Every step for me so far has been a beneficial one. I am still a relatively young coach, if I am allowed to say that. I am looking to always improve.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years at Liverpool, Cooper went from being an under-12 coach, to being the senior coach at the academy.\n\n\u201cAcademies are all about the players. That is all that matters. You work long hours, you run long sessions, you work with a lot of players and a lot of different teams,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThe challenge is to help as many players as you can, as much as you can. That applies wherever you are and regardless of who you are working for and whether it is a young nine or 10 year-old or a player in the latter part of his development.\n\n\u201cI managed to work with a lot of very talented young players. Academies are all about the players; it is only ever about their development.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s enthusiasm for reflecting on the past is revived noticeably when the subject of who his biggest influences were at Liverpool arises.\n\n\u201cI met a really important person there, a guy called Pep Segura. He had a massive influence on me. He influenced me when it came to game understanding and the methodology of things,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nCooper with Segura (Photo: Joe Giddens \u2013 PA Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough as well that Sir Kenny (Dalglish) was still working there before he went back to being with the first team. It was brilliant to spend some time around such an iconic guy like him. They were important times for me, in terms of learning and developing as a coach.\u201d\n\nIt was Segura, who had previously managed Olympiakos and Barcelona B \u2014 where he helped develop talents such as Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas \u2014 that Cooper quickly formed a close relationship with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPep was and is a major influence because I still speak to him now. He helped me understand how the game can be played and what it takes to play that way. Not so much just playing \u2014 it was about how you train as well; how you prepare players to do things in the way that you want. He taught me about the methodology behind things as well as how to do things.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like. That\u2019s what I pride myself on now \u2014 having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also how to get there. Pep put me on a different track, really.\n\n\u201cWhat is important in coaching is that you find your own way. You find what you really believe in as a coach. Because, in the end, you want your team to be a reflection of what you believe in. Pep was important to me. What I have learnt, most of all, is that what you think yourself is most important of all. I am still on that journey.\u201d\n\nCooper will not come up against Alexander-Arnold, who has developed into an integral figure at Liverpool and, arguably, one of the best right-backs in the world. The defender will be missing at the City Ground through injury. But Cooper plays down the thought of missing out on a reunion with his former player \u2014 and on any notion of him deserving any credit for the progress of players like him.\n\n\u201cCoaches don\u2019t produce players \u2014 players produce themselves. That is always something I have thought. I never think about any coach being part of a player\u2019s evolution. We are there, along the way,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cPlayers are the ones who deserve the credit for what they achieve. If they do well, they are the ones who deserve the praise for it, because it is their hard work that has got them there.\n\n\u201cWhether they turn into footballers or just good young men, that is what development is all about. It is the same here now. We have a host of young players who are working to get established. It is an ongoing daily journey.\n\n\u201cBut with Trent, I don\u2019t see it as missing out on a reunion, exactly. There are not many games where we do not come up against somebody I have worked with. Chris Willock and Andre Dozzell played with QPR. Before that, against Reading, they had Tom Dele-Bashiru in their squad. There are always players you come up against who you have a past relationship with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest have already beaten Arsenal and Leicester on their way to the quarter-final. It feels like their biggest test yet against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nIf they are to pull off another upset, much will depend on the talented younger players within Forest\u2019s own squad. Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence have formed a dangerous partnership down the right flank, James Garner and Ryan Yates have a dynamic midfield partnership and Keinan Davis has been almost unstoppable up front in recent weeks.\n\nSpence celebrates his goal against QPR this week with Johnson (left) and Worrall (right) (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that young players need these experiences. Players are shaped by all experiences, be they good, bad or indifferent. But it is often the latter two that are the most important,\u201d says Cooper, who will also hope to guide Forest into the play-offs in the remaining 10 games of the Championship season. \u201cThat is where you learn the most from. It is about the difficult situations and how you respond to them. That is what defines you. It is how you respond to setbacks that shapes you.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in self-worth in people; a big believer in positivity and what you can do. We definitely like to have positivity around our daily routines, in the terminology we use and the intent of our days. We always try to focus on ourselves, on our environment and trying to achieve \u2014 to be successful. We attack challenges, we attack big games and embrace them rather than fear them. That is our mentality and if that is building belief and building confidence, then great.\n\n\u201cEvery day I ask the players to be the best version of themselves, to be winners and to give their best; to train and play in a way that we want to do things \u2014 to behave the way we want to behave. But we have not turned things around here. Not yet. We have made some good steps. We have work still to do.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor\n\n\u201cCoops is destined to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Morecambe\u2019s Northern Irish full-back Ryan McLaughlin tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cEven all those years ago at Liverpool it was clear that he had everything you need to make the leap from youth coaching to a senior environment. I don\u2019t think any of us have been surprised by how well he has done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin played for Liverpool Under-18s under Cooper a decade ago. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup where they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by a Chelsea side including Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nCooper during the FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea at Anfield on April 12, 2013 (Photo: Paul Thomas \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was Coops\u2019 attention to detail that really stood out for me. He was very good at seeing things in your game that needed to be worked on. Then he would be relentless in terms of pummelling that into you every day on the training field,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBefore we played Chelsea he talked to me about what I\u2019d be up against in their winger Jeremie Boga. He knew him inside out. He got the balance spot on between giving you good info about what to expect but not freaking you out. He sold it to you as a brilliant challenge. He never over-complicated things. He was a really good communicator. I remember how enjoyable it was playing for him.\u201d\n\nCooper initially joined Liverpool from Wrexham in 2008. In the summer of 2011 he was promoted to academy manager by Dalglish to work closely with academy director Frank McParland, who also had a spell working at Forest during Mark Warburton\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe previous season Cooper had enhanced his reputation after stepping up to assist the academy\u2019s technical director Segura with the reserves following the departure of coach John McMahon.\n\n\u201cCoops and Pep had a great relationship,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cI know Coops took a lot from working with Pep. The Barcelona way is Coops\u2019 way. He always wanted to be expansive with the full-backs high and wide. He always wanted us to be brave in possession.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager in 2012 sparked another reshuffle at Kirkby. With under-18s coach Mike Marsh added to Rodgers\u2019 senior staff at Melwood, Cooper took charge of the under-18s for the 2012-13 season. His squad included the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jon Flanagan, Ryan Kent, Jerome Sinclair, Sheyi Ojo, Harry Wilson, Jordon Ibe, Tom Brewitt, Cameron Brannagan and Jordan Williams.\n\nMcLaughlin was coached by Cooper at Liverpool (Photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams, who currently plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, was one of Cooper\u2019s youngsters who broke into Rodgers\u2019 first-team set-up, making his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Anfield in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Coops since I was nine years old and he was coaching at Wrexham. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with him and we\u2019re still in contact a few times a month with messages going back and forth,\u201d Williams tells The Athletic. \u201cHe moved on to Liverpool when I was in the under-13s at Wrexham and then when I made the same move he was my under-16s coach at Kirkby. We had a great team. I think we only lost two games under him all season.\n\n\u201cCoops could be quite hard on us but not in a bad way. He set standards every day and he didn\u2019t like anyone falling below them. He knew what each player needed to get them going and would personalise it.\n\n\u201cI always remember striker Jerome Sinclair (who later signed for Watford) had his best season under Coops. He used to work so hard with Jerome on the training pitch. He knew he needed an arm around the shoulder, while he knew that I needed more of a kick up the ass. You can tell if someone is more suited to being a coach than a manager. Coops always had both sides. His training sessions were good and he knew how to set a team up tactically. But he also knew how to handle egos off the pitch, which is important.\u201d\n\nCentre-back Brewitt had only just turned 16 when Cooper gave him his FA Youth Cup debut in a fifth round victory over Leeds United.\n\n\u201cCoops was great for me,\u201d says Brewitt, who currently plays for Connecticut-based Hartford Athletic in the USL Championship.\n\n\u201cI was one of the youngest in the squad but he always knew how to fill me with confidence while also ensuring I was on edge to get the best out of me. He had a way of taking you out of your comfort zone. Not to a point where you couldn\u2019t perform, but to help you grow as a player.\n\n\u201cShortly before I made my FA Youth Cup debut he told me \u2018You\u2019re not in the team because of the injuries, you\u2019re in it because I picked you and I believe in you\u2019. We won 3-1 and I cleared one off the line. I felt like I had his trust and I was desperate to impress him.\n\n\u201cThere was always a feeling between us as players that Coops would go on to manage in first-team football. It was the way he went about things. He was less of a pure talent developer and more of a manager in terms of his tactics and getting the best out of players.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely an edge to him. He wasn\u2019t shy in terms of giving out a bollocking. But any criticism was always constructive. He made players better from working with them but he also made it clear that we were there to win and we needed to win in a certain way.\u201d\n\nRodgers rejigged the academy structure when at Liverpool (Photo: Clint Hughes/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the 2012-13 season when Cooper was in charge of the under-18s.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re injured managers forget all about you, but Coops cared and always went out of his way to help during a tough period,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met off the pitch. He cares about what\u2019s going on in your life away from football.\n\n\u201cWhen I got promoted with Bolton, he was in touch with me straight away. When my dad passed away, Coops was the first person to come around the house. That says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper left Liverpool in the summer of 2013, it was a shock for his players. His contract wasn\u2019t renewed as Rodgers\u2019 overhaul of the academy gathered pace.\n\nIt was a period of significant change at Kirkby as Rodgers sought to exert his authority. Segura had stepped down in 2012 citing a desire to return home to Spain. However, his decision was also influenced by the fact he missed out on a more senior role after the owners ditched plans to appoint a technical director and a sporting director to work with Rodgers, who had demanded sole control.\n\nAlex Inglethorpe, the current academy director, was brought in from Tottenham initially as under-21s coach and Michael Beale, currently No 2 to Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, was recruited from Chelsea. Cooper\u2019s exit was swiftly followed by the sackings of academy head coach Rodolfo Borrell, now Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant at Manchester City, and academy director McParland. Neil Critchley, now manager of Blackpool, had arrived from Crewe to take over from Cooper after being headhunted by Rodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise when Coops left and I\u2019m not sure what went on,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cWe were never told the finer details, but obviously Brendan had come in as manager and was putting his own stamp on things.\n\n\u201cCoops was similar to Michael Beale and Alex Inglethorpe in terms of his approach to the game \u2014 young and very driven. Whenever I went back home to Northern Ireland people would ask me what the coaches were like at Liverpool and I\u2019d always say how lucky I was. As well as Coops, I worked with Mick Beale, Mike Marsh, Rodolfo Borrell and Alex Inglethorpe. They have all done well for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the academy at Liverpool is that they develop coaches as well as players. Just look at the job Mick is doing at Villa and Critch at Blackpool. I enjoyed working with Coops, but I think it\u2019s only now that I fully appreciate what a brilliant coach he was.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds: \u201cWe were gutted about Coops going because we all loved playing for him. We just turned up one day and he had been replaced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever affected what Coops thinks about Liverpool. He still speaks highly of the club. He became a fan. He moved on and put everything into his new challenges.\u201d\n\nCooper twice led Swansea into the play-offs before being recruited by Forest, following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a smart move by Forest,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had has been amazing. They\u2019re great to watch and they\u2019re winning. He has turned them into promotion contenders. He had a great education at Liverpool and as players we all benefited from that time we spent with him.\u201d\n\nWilliams agrees, saying: \u201cEverywhere Coops has been he has improved the teams he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI know Yan Dhanda and he really enjoyed playing for him at Swansea. Now he\u2019s got Forest flying. I\u2019m made up for him. Great coach, great person.\u201d\n\nJames Pearce\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphic: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3266381/2022/05/29/nottingham-forest-huddersfield-promotion-premier-league/", "page_content": "(Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article was published on April 26)\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to raise a glass to somebody who cannot be here today. He is a big inspiration to me and to most people who know him. I want him to know we are all thinking of him. So please, can you all raise a glass to\u2026 Steve Cooper.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to understand the scale of the impact Cooper has had at Nottingham Forest, the widely shared social media video clip of a recent wedding speech sums things up perfectly.\n\nThe unexpected toast is followed by an enthusiastic rendition of Depeche Mode\u2019s Just Can\u2019t Get Enough. The song \u2014 fittingly released in 1981 during the era when then-manager Brian Clough\u2019s Forest side were at the peak of their powers \u2014 has become ubiquitous with Cooper\u2019s present-day version as he has overseen a remarkable transformation in both fortunes and mood.\n\nAt the time of his appointment in September, Forest had made their worst start to a season for 108 years, claiming only a single point from their first seven Championship games under Chris Hughton.\n\nThe fact they have now secured a place in the Premier League is testimony to the incredible job Cooper has done.\n\nBut it is more than just results that have earned the 42-year-old Welshman a place in the hearts of Forest supporters. It is the fact Cooper just seems to have an intrinsic grasp of this club and what it means to their fans. He gets it.\n\n\u201cIt is a special club to be part of. I tell the players that it is not going to last forever because we are just passing by, really, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Cooper said recently. \u201cYou do have to take it in and recognise that not everywhere is like this. You should never take it for granted, having the opportunity to be involved with a club like this, in any capacity. I just want a team that the supporters can be proud of.\u201d\n\nSo what has been behind his success?\n\nIn the dressing room and on the training ground, the players more regularly refer to him as \u201cCoops\u201d than \u201cBoss\u201d or \u201cGaffer\u201d.\n\nCooper does not favour a hierarchical structure but an atmosphere of unity. His post-match fist-pumps in front of every corner of the City Ground have become a trademark. But, normally, those moments only arrive after he has taken the time to talk to and congratulate every single one of his players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose fist-pump celebrations were not pre-planned but something that happened off the cuff and, while he appreciates the bond it has helped him to forge with supporters, Cooper has never wanted the spotlight to be cast solely on him. He can feel slightly embarrassed when it is. He prefers to see Forest\u2019s achievements as a team effort.\n\nHis family, including his father, brother and son, regularly attend games. Cooper admits he has been known to feel emotional during the traditional pre-match rendition of Mull Of Kintyre, which seems to have grown louder and more fervent with each passing week.\n\nFormer Wrexham and Liverpool academy coach Cooper still has his family home in north Wales, where there are a small but growing number of Forest fans who now make the journey across to the English east Midlands, having been inspired by the job their fellow countryman is doing.\n\nThere is nothing complex to Cooper\u2019s approach. He is meticulous but still somehow manages to keep things simple. There are several meetings with players every single day, as a group and individually.\n\nHe is a friendly, approachable character but also possesses a sharp wit and the ability to deliver a cutting put-down if a player does mess up in training.\n\n\u201cHe is intense but good. He has a great nature. He is good around the lads but you don\u2019t want to mess up one of his drills; you do not want to give balls away cheaply,\u201d defender Steve Cook tells The Athletic. \u201cHe is very sharp when he wants to be\u2026 he can give you one or two lines that will bring you down to earth.\n\n\u201cIf it is not you on the receiving end of it, it can be quite enjoyable \u2014 because I like hearing what he has to say. But if it is you on the end of it, it is much less enjoyable.\n\nFrom left: Scott McKenna, Steve Cook and Jack Colback have all benefited from Steve Cooper\u2019s guidance (Photo: Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe work he does with his coaching staff all has a purpose. You can see the thought process behind everything. We do not do drills for the sake of it; they all have a purpose. That is a good way of keeping players on it \u2014 particularly those who can kind of drift, attention-wise. There are a few of those!\n\n\u201cThey are always short, sharp sessions, with a lot of detail. It is about keeping fitness levels up but also about getting the tactical ideas across. Because that can change, game to game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Hughton had doubts over whether young Brennan Johnson was ready for Championship football, Cooper has honed the talent of the Wales international, who is now valued at as much as \u00a325 million, such has been his progress. The 20-year-old has contributed 19 goals and 10 assists.\n\nSimilarly, Hughton regarded Jordi Osei-Tutu as Forest\u2019s first-choice right-back at the start of the season and, while injury hampered his progress \u2014 to the point where his loan spell was terminated early and he returned to Arsenal \u2014 fellow loanee Djed Spence has subsequently evolved into a player that the likes of Tottenham, and Arsenal themselves, are watching keenly.\n\nThe only regret is that it will be parent club Middlesbrough who benefit financially from Spence\u2019s rapid development into one of the best young defenders outside of the top flight. He was an outcast in the north east last summer but is now valued at \u00a310 million.\n\nRyan Yates has long been regarded as a bright prospect by those who have worked closely with him, who see his qualities, but the midfielder had struggled to win Forest fans around to the same idea. His work-rate and constant desire for personal improvement are indicative of the attitude Cooper demands. Yates\u2019 personal improvement is a sign that they are more than just words.\n\n\u201cYou rest at the end, not in the middle,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cI have said that to the players. They just have to be hungry to improve and hungry to get the best out of every single day.\n\n\u201cIt is an elite environment. It needs to be challenging. Sometimes people need to be pushed \u2014 including myself. To achieve that, things are not always going to be fluffy. What we try to do is get to a place where, if you are having difficult conversations, we have built good connections and relations with people so that they know it is coming from the right place.\n\n\u201cThick or thin, everyone sticks together. That is so important.\u201d\n\nForest have been granted planning permission to revamp parts of their training ground at the Nigel Doughty Academy. But, while he approves of the club\u2019s ambition, Cooper is also a fan of the intimate, compact nature of the current facilities and does not want that to be lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd his eye for detail extends to requesting that investment be made in new equipment to allow the ground staff to maintain the training pitches to the same degree that the City Ground\u2019s pitch is carefully manicured.\n\nSignificant money could be invested to level off the slight slope on some of the playing surfaces at the training ground, where Cooper has already overseen significant changes to the previously cramped meeting rooms to create a more welcoming environment.\n\n\u201cHe might as well have a rotating door in his office, because there are players in and out of there so often,\u201d Cook says. \u201cHe is very approachable. He is a good laugh. You don\u2019t want your work environment to be an entirely serious place. (But) there is a line you need to remain on the right side of. Their expectations are very high. It all stems from that.\u201d\n\nAfter Cooper was appointed, Joe Lolley revealed the new manager had held individual meetings with every single player to garner their thoughts on where things stood at Forest. It is a habit Cooper has maintained in the eight months since. Every player has been offered help or guidance of some sort.\n\nWhen regular captain Lewis Grabban was injured and out for most of the season\u2019s final three months, Cooper worked extensively with stand-in Joe Worrall on the challenges and demands of wearing the armband for a club of Forest\u2019s stature \u2014 and encouraged him to think about what kind of skipper he wants to be.\n\nWorrall has had to work on aspects of the role \u2014 including being more of a leader when other players are late for meetings or for training and need reminding of their responsibilities. Worrall\u2019s performances on the pitch have gone up another level this season, as have those of fellow defender Scott McKenna.\n\nBut while the academy product has never been short of confidence, the Scotsman, in contrast, has been encouraged not to be so self-critical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKenna would focus on every mistake or poor pass despite the fact that he \u2014 like Worrall \u2014 is hugely respected for his strong, no-nonsense displays and ability to carry the ball out from the back. Along with the experienced Cook and the resurgent Tobias Figueiredo, Forest have built one of English football\u2019s strongest defensive units outside of the Premier League.\n\nWhen Yates was left out of the starting XI, Cooper spoke to him to explain his thinking. The midfielder, respectfully but firmly, informed his manager that he was making a mistake. Cooper, far from being annoyed, loves the attitude of the 24-year-old, who is always the first into meetings and the last to leave the training pitch.\n\nRyan Yates has been in brilliant form under Cooper (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhen Max Lowe was sidelined with injury for the rest of the season in early March, Cooper took midfielder Jack Colback to one side to explain that he would be putting his faith in him to fill the void at left wing-back. His impressive performances culminated in him scoring a contender for goal of the season against West Bromwich Albion.\n\n\u201cThere is so much more improvement we can make still but we have come so, so far since the manager came in, and that is credit to him,\u201d Yates says. \u201cI look back at my clips from his first games in charge and from more recent games and some of the movements he wanted from me, I now do without even thinking.\u201d\n\nEven when they had time off during the March international break, the players could not escape Cooper\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cThe gaffer was dropping messages into the group chat, reminding us to keep focused for when we come back,\u201d says on-loan Aston Villa forward Keinan Davis. \u201cHe just makes sure that we keep our eye on the ball. It is always about the next match.\u201d\n\nIt says much that Davis and Lowe, who is on loan from Sheffield United, that both wanted to stay at Forest to complete their rehab from injuries rather than returning to their parent clubs.\n\n\u201cIt is great that they want to stay here,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThey are part of it. They are popular lads and they have made friends here. We just need to shut Keinan up a little bit!\u201d\n\nThe appetite for Premier League football was only whetted by Forest\u2019s FA Cup run, which saw them beat recent winners Arsenal and Leicester City, as well as eventual play-off final opponents Huddersfield Town, before eventually being narrowly beaten by quadruple-chasing Liverpool in the last eight.\n\nForest may not have made it to the Wembley semi-finals because of that 1-0 loss to a club who would win both domestic cups, finish as runners-up in the Premier League by one point and lose Saturday\u2019s Champions League final to the only goal, but Cooper did go along to observe as he looks to continue his own football education.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing spectacle,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a football nut. I am always up for seeing what might be new, what is happening in the game \u2014 in foreign football as well. You are always looking for something; always looking for ideas.\u201d\n\nWhat was telling in those FA Cup ties was how Forest took the game to their opposition. It is a mindset that has seen them now clinch promotion under Cooper, restoring the club to the top flight for the first time since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWe do not fear anyone,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cThere is no player I have come up against that has made me think, \u2018I need to be on the back foot\u2019. The gaffer wants us to be positive, on the front foot all over the pitch. We are all confident and believe we can run over teams. That is why we score a lot of goals. We keep going in games, we never change our approach.\n\n\u201cIt was not great at the start here. But once the gaffer came in, things changed so quickly. I cannot speak highly enough about the club.\u201d\n\nIt says much that even an arch-rival can appreciate the job Cooper has done.\n\nDerby defender Curtis Davies played in both the 1-1 draw at Pride Park, which earned Hughton his only point of the season in August, and as Forest won 2-1 in January\u2019s reverse fixture under Cooper.\n\nEven Derby\u2019s Davies can appreciate the impact Cooper has made at arch-rivals Forest (Photo: Mick Walker \u2013 CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cRegardless of my feelings about the club, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s done a fantastic job,\u201d Davies tells The Athletic. \u201cUnfortunately, him coming into the club was at the expense of my former manager (Davies worked with Hughton at Birmingham City), someone I have huge respect for \u2014 but at the start of the season, the club had lost a bit of its spark.\n\n\u201cWhen we played them earlier in the season, I think it was a game where Chrissy was on the verge of losing his job and in the second half they basically threw the game at us. They ended up getting the equaliser.\n\n\u201cThe second game, I don\u2019t think there was much in it. But they won the game and played some great football. Keinan Davis has been a great signing, Brennan Johnson has been used really well, leaving him up the pitch to frustrate teams. Not only has he got pace, he\u2019s got skill to break down teams on the counter.\n\n\u201c(Cooper) feels like a perfect fit for the club. Not just the way he wants to play football but his personality. Forest was a squad that was full of players who all thought they should be playing at Championship level, every week. That\u2019s one to 20 who all felt like they should be playing. He\u2019s found a way of keeping people onside. He keeps them ready and keeps them motivated. A hands-on coach but one who people want to work for.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, another experienced defender in Cook \u2014 who signed in January from a Bournemouth side bound for automatic promotion to the Premier League \u2014 has been equally impressed.\n\n\u201cI can appreciate the job he has done. You hear stories of how training used to be before he came in; about how we used to play and how things have changed \u2014 in just such a short amount of time,\u201d Cook says.\n\n\u201cNeil Warnock used to say that 90 per cent of being a manager is about man-management. I don\u2019t know whether that is true but that management side of the game \u2014 dealing with young players, knowing how you can speak to players now and treat them has changed so much.\n\n\u201cThe way that the manager does it here is a perfect example of how to do it. You have to speak to players in a certain way now, when they are on the pitch; you have to put your views across \u2014 there is an understanding of the game on the pitch that is needed, because the game is so tactical now.\n\n\u201cIt is a chess game. You (as a player) have to understand what you are being asked to do. For me, learning that from him has improved me.\u201d\n\nDo not expect things to change too much in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stick to what you do more than ever. Why change? That is my feeling. Stick to the plan. Make sacrifices every day. Plan, prepare and review as you have done all season,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIf it has been a good enough way of working, it will get you to where you want to be.\n\n\u201cIf it does not, then somebody else has a go, don\u2019t they? That is the way it works. That is it really: stick to the plan. Believe in it.\u201d\n\nForest have had 21 permanent managers since they were last in the top flight in 1999.\n\nWith Cooper being mentioned in wedding speeches due to his success, is it any wonder this has proven to be the union that has finally taken them back to the Premier League?\n\nOther contributors: Phil Buckingham and Daniel Taylor\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson using Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3029338/2021/12/29/what-it-is-like-play-steve-cooper-nottingham-forest/", "page_content": "Whenever asked about what he has achieved so far, Steve Cooper often jokes that he has only been at Nottingham Forest for \u201ctwo minutes\u201d.\n\nSuch quips are indicative of a man who, according to those who work closest with him, knows when it is a moment for humour and when it is time for hard work.\n\nIt is an approach that has helped him to make a remarkable impact \u2014 even if it also inspired one player to label him as being like a \u201cfunny uncle\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper has been at the helm for three months and the transformation he has overseen has seen Forest go from fighting relegation to pushing for the play-offs. Fans have gone from despair to daring to dream and the style of play has been transformed.\n\nHughton struggled to forge any kind of bond with the Forest fans. Cooper\u2019s fist-pumping celebrations with fans have already become a trademark.\n\nThere is unity, there is belief and there is hope. And much of it stems from one man.\n\nThe Welshman, 42, arrived in Nottingham with a solid reputation, built on the back of consecutive top-six finishes in the Championship in what was his first role in senior management with Swansea. Cooper, who had also coached at youth level with Wrexham, Liverpool and England, was no stranger to the Forest players, who had seen him in the opposition dugout. But there was still an element of the unknown.\n\n\u201cThere is a tiny bit of pressure,\u201d Lewis Grabban tells The Athletic when asked what it is like on the first day under a new boss. \u201cFor me, it is slightly different because I am a senior player here. I have seen this before. But there is still pressure, you want to have a good first few training sessions and show the new boss what you have got. Cooper certainly did that with the players.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper celebrates Forest\u2019s victory over Hull with the fans (Photo: James Holyoak/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nFrom day one, Cooper began a series of one-to-one meetings with his new squad. He wanted to know what made them tick. He also wanted to gauge their opinions on the game.\n\n\u201cThere are two things. There is the way he is personally \u2014 and he has had everyone in his office for a one-to-one at some point, which players appreciate. He is always honest with us,\u201d Jack Colback tells The Athletic. \u201cAnd also there is what he has brought for us tactically \u2014 the organisation, getting the team on the front foot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, sometimes you do these kinds of interviews when you talk about managers and you might not be having him at all. You kind of have to say, \u2018He\u2019s great, he\u2019s great\u2019. You say what you are meant to. But the gaffer has been a breath of fresh air. I spoke to him early on. He wanted to know why I wasn\u2019t playing much. I suppose he needed to get to know me as a person. He has given confidence to everyone. He always reminds us what a good team we are and what a good team we can be.\n\n\u201cPersonally, the main thing he has done is play me\u2026 that is the best thing you can get from a manager, having the chance to play. You feel there is trust there. You to repay that faith. I do not want to say too much \u2014 we don\u2019t want him getting a big head.\u201d\n\nJoe Lolley believes a sense of togetherness has been promoted by the fact the players have a valued voice in the new regime.\n\nThe way he looks at football and the way he coaches is completely aligned with the way I see things,\u201d Lolley tells The Athletic. \u201cWe have had proper football chats about how things are done.\n\n\u201cA lot of the players feel the same and you have seen that in performances. The way \u2018Grabbs\u2019 is bouncing back under him is probably a similar situation to myself\u2026 Jack Colback immediately looked like a different player. He\u2019s just fresher. Steve gets the best out of players. We always have good ideas and from a man-management point of view, he treats everyone with a lot of respect. You can talk to him about anything.\n\n\u201cBut when it is on the training pitch it is very serious and we are very intense in our work. It is a really good balance. There is a line and we know the standards that are set and we know how intense it is every day. We all know what is expected of us.\n\n\u201cGiven time, he can make us successful.\u201d\n\nAt the Nigel Doughty Academy, there has been a clear change in dynamic. Training sessions have gone up a level in intensity and expectation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are no easy days, players cannot coast through a session.\n\n\u201cThe level at the training ground has been raised. It is hard every day. There is more tempo, the demands are bigger\u2026 there is just more quality there. That is so important, that is when you get better,\u201d says attacking midfielder Philip Zinckernagel, who is on loan from Watford.\n\n\u201cCooper demands more. We have longer sessions, we do more tactical work. When you come in as a new manager to a club in the Championship, you do not have too many opportunities in training \u2014 it is just game after game. But once we had those sessions, we did some important work on the tactical side of things.\n\n\u201cI am feeling great, I like it here. He arrived with new ideas and gave us a new level of belief. He keeps us on track every day. He is a funny man. He has a little bit of that \u2018uncle\u2019 way about him. He can joke with you but there is authority there. He expects hard work. But away from the training ground, he smiles a lot and jokes a lot.\n\n\u201cI am not sure there is any big secret. But there has been a new playing style and new ideas. When a new manager comes in, it gives the group new energy and something to believe in. We needed that.\u201d\n\nCooper has had an incredible start as Forest manager (Photo: George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nColback had been all but frozen out under Hughton. Last summer, he expected to leave in search of first-team football. His family had returned to the north east in anticipation of making a move. Under Cooper, the midfielder has been a revived force in the centre of the pitch or when filling in at left-back.\n\n\u201cThe mood has changed. But we were previously not playing great football, even when we won games,\u201d says Colback. \u201cI am not having a dig at Chris (Hughton) when I say that, because different managers have their ways and his way has been successful for him over the years. But it was a different style of football. We were more on the back foot, trying not to lose. Now we go out to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can get managers who have played 1,000 games who are not great to be around. On a personal level, you can have banter with him (C0oper) when the time is right \u2014 but he has the respect of the players.\u201d\n\nRyan Yates would probably admit himself that his attitude, as much as his ability, has helped him to emerge as a key man in the Forest side. The 24-year-old believes he has a kindred spirit in Cooper.\n\n\u201cHe is relentless to improve. I did not think I would find a manager as passionate as myself when it comes to that desire,\u201d Yates tells The Athletic. \u201cI am taken aback by how much detail they go into. Everything has gone up a level.\n\n\u201cThe data from the games \u2014 the training\u2026 there are things we need to improve on still but every detail is taken care of. No stone is left unturned. I just know that he is going to be successful here.\n\n\u201cEvery day we train, it is relentless focus. There are no days off when we are in. We are on the same wavelength. I am so motivated, we have a manager and staff who will take us in the right direction.\u201d\n\nYates took it in his stride when asked to play in the centre of defence in recent games against Swansea and Hull, with Cooper praising him for his willingness to do whatever he is asked for the club.\n\n\u201cI am quite headstrong. People can say what they want \u2014 as long as my performances are improving, that is all I care about,\u201d says Yates. \u201cI do feel as though I have kicked on, but it is only one step on the road and there are another 100 steps to come, hopefully.\n\n\u201cI have honestly never worked with a manager who is so motivated to progress this club and the players individually. I come in every day feeling so, so motivated.\u201d\n\nLolley says that Cooper\u2019s work ethic has convinced him of one thing \u2014 that he is not personally cut out for a career in management.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do what the manager does. He lives and breathes the game,\u201d says Lolley. \u201cI don\u2019t think managers switch off from their job for a single second.\n\n\u201cI would like to have a life and I am not convinced that managers generally do. Credit to them, because I do not know how they commit to that.\u201d\n\nCooper has not just sought the opinion of his own players, but also of those who played for Forest in the past.\n\nWhen European Cup-winning striker Garry Birtles was a guest at a recent game, he was made to feel more than welcome by the head coach.\n\n\u201cHe invited me into his office for a drink after the Peterborough game,\u201d says Birtles. \u201cWe just talked about football and what we did at Forest in the past. He seemed interested in the history here.\n\n\u201cThe players seem to like him and that is vital. When I was a player, if you were enjoying your football, you naturally did better.\u201d\n\nAt half-time against Peterborough, Forest were playing poorly and being held to a 0-0 draw. Some managers might have thrown a few teacups. But Cooper is calmer.\n\nJames Garner celebrates his goal against Peterborough United (Photo: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe does not make knee-jerk decisions or even knee-jerk comments. He likes to analyse what has happened before he gives too many opinions,\u201d says defender Scott McKenna. \u201cThat means he is always calm. Anything that is ever discussed is never an argument or never heated. It is an open discussion.\n\n\u201cHe will tell us what he thinks but he will also ask us our opinion. We are out there on the pitch and he is always keen to know if there is anything we can see within the game. It is a good environment. The discussion we had at half-time (against Peterborough) really changed what we saw in the game.\n\n\u201cManagers are generally open to players having an opinion. But yes, this manager just seems to be extra calm, ultra-composed and does not let anything fluster him. His decision making is always spot on.\u201d\n\nMcKenna believes the positive mood is reflected on match days.\n\n\u201cHe just lets everyone know how much he is behind us and how much he trusts everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cThat goes a long way for players, when they can play with confidence.\n\n\u201cWe were in a difficult situation and he came in and gave us that belief. He will stand by us. He is very, very good around the boys and in the dressing room. He is tactically very good. Training is enjoyable. We are learning all the time. He has brought a feel-good factor. I don\u2019t think there is anyone here who is not enjoying their football.\u201d\n\nChris Wilder\u2019s appointment as Middlesbrough manager has left Forest waiting nervously to see if Djed Spence will be recalled by his parent club in January. But the rampaging full-back is enjoying life under Cooper.\n\n\u201cHe is a great guy,\u201d says Spence. \u201cWe know what he wants from us. Everyone is buying into what he asks.\n\n\u201cHe is down-to-earth. He will talk to you about how you are doing. If you are doing badly, he will tell you. He has good honesty. He is a very positive character.\u201d\n\nLeeds and Brentford continue to monitor Brennan Johnson\u2019s progress with interest, as the Wales international continues to thrive. Johnson, 20, took his tally of goals to five with a smart finish to help Forest secure a 2-1 win over Hull.\n\n\u201cHe just gives me freedom. He is a very good manager, tactically. In the final third, he gives me a lot of freedom just to go and make things happen,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI am excited about being able to express myself.\n\n\u201cHe had a talented group when he came in \u2014 we just did not have much confidence. He has given everyone the belief to step up their game.\u201d\n\nNot bad, for somebody who has only been in the job for two minutes.\n\n(Top photo: Getty Images/Design: Sam Richardson)"}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-steve-cooper-sheffield-6750087", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nBoss Steve Cooper was full of praise for \u201cdiamond\u201d Ryan Yates as the midfielder rescued a 1-1 draw for Nottingham Forest with a dramatic late equaliser.\n\nThe Reds deserved more than the point against Sheffield United, having dominated for much of the evening at Bramall Lane.\n\nIt had looked as though they would be left to rue a string of missed chances after Billy Sharp had netted against the run of play with 20 minutes to go.\n\nBut Forest once again showed their fighting spirit and Yates headed in right at the death to ensure the visitors claimed a share of the spoils.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak highly enough of him. He\u2019s just an absolute diamond of a lad. He\u2019ll do anything for the football club and anything for the team,\u201d Cooper said of the midfielder.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most selfless players I\u2019ve ever worked with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he\u2019s the one who got on the end of that ball, because he will do anything for this football club.\n\n\u201cI meant to say after the last game, but one of the highlights against Bristol City was when he came on and the crowd sang his name. I think we\u2019re really starting to appreciate what he brings now, which is great.\u201d\n\nIt had been a terrific display by the visitors against one of their rivals for a top-six spot, with some good opportunities for Brennan Johnson, Keinan Davis and Philip Zinckernagel.\n\nJohnson had also had a penalty saved just past the half hour mark, while Steve Cook rattled the crossbar with a header after the break.\n\nThe result leaves the Reds two points below the play-off spots, with their opponents having climbed into the top six.\n\n\u201cI thought we were excellent. I\u2019m proud of the performance, just disappointed we didn\u2019t win,\u201d Cooper said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a really tough game, coming here, but with that performance we should have won the game comfortably.\n\n\u201cAnd then you\u2019re more than half-pleased that we managed to get something out of the game in the end.

He was aged 39 and he leaves behind wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA post-mortem was being held to discover the cause of Cooper's death, but his passing left the club in shock. During his spell at City the former schoolboy gymnast enthralled the crowd with his trademark back-flip somersault celebrations after scoring a goal.\n\nFormer City manager Alan Little, who signed the six-foot front-man from Tranmere Rovers in a \u00a335,000 deal a few months after the club's historic promotion play-off conquest at Wembley, told the Evening Press he was 'devastated' by the news.\n\nSaid Little: \"It's absolutely unbelievable and incredibly tragic for his wife and kids.\n\n\"He was a smashing lad was 'Coops'. He would do anything for you and I am certain that everyone who knows him in football will be absolutely gutted on hearing this news because he was such a great lad. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was blighted by injury, scoring eight goals in 46 appearances.\n\nLittle revealed that he had played alongside the Birmingham-born Cooper when the striker was a young lad and the ex-City boss was coming to the end of his career with Halifax Town.\n\n\"We travelled back and forth to Birmingham a couple of times and I could see then what a great lad he was. That's what made me sign him for York City from Tranmere.\n\n\"He was a big, strapping lad - as fit as anything. I just cannot believe it.\"\n\nCooper's career with City was unfortunately blighted by injury and after scoring eight goals in 46 appearances he moved to Airdrie for \u00a360,000 in September 1994.\n\nIt was with the Diamonds, where he achieved cult status, bagging the winner over Hearts in a Scottish Cup semi-final to go on to meet eventual winners Glasgow Rangers. Former City team-mate Andy McMillan told the Evening Press that it was Cooper who got him to Scotland when he revived his career post-Bootham Crescent with Ayr United.\n\nSaid McMillan: \"I just can't believe it. He made a huge impact on people wherever he went. He was an absolutely fantastic bloke. There wouldn't be anyone who had a bad word about him. It's a massive shock and a big, big loss.\"\n\nCurrent head of youth development at City, Paul Stancliffe played against Cooper, whose career took him from his native Birmingham in 1983 via Halifax, Holland, Plymouth Argyle - coincidentally in a swap deal involving former City ace Gordon Staniforth - Barnsley, Tranmere, York and then on to Airdrie and Ayr.\n\nRecalled Stancliffe: \"He was one of those centre-forwards you never liked playing against. His athleticism was unbelievable and though he wasn't very tall he had such an amazing leap.\n\n\"Off the field he was such a big character as well.\"\n\nThat point was echoed by City chief executive Keith Usher, who told the Evening Press: \"Coops was very popular within the club in the time he was here.\n\n\"He was well liked and a nice chap. It's just devastating when you hear of something like this happening.\"\n\nYork City chairman Steve Beck recalled the impact Cooper had made on his City debut in the first game of the 1993-94 season at home to Swansea City.\n\nHe said: \"I was doing some photographic work at the ground that day and you could see how well he linked up with Paul Barnes. He made such an impact with his commitment and his effort. Fans will always respond to people who get stuck in and Cooper did that.\n\n\"It's a very, very sad day.

In 1964, Independence Day in the Philippines was moved from July 4th to June 12th at the insistence of nationalists and historians.\n\nIn 1950, when he was only 4 years old, in February, Joe McCarthy gave a speech alleging that he had a list of \"members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring\" who worked in the State Department. He went on to chair a committee that investigated not only the State Department but also the administration of President Harry S. Truman, the Voice of America, and the U.S. Army for communist spies - until he was condemned by the U.S. Senate in 1954.\n\nIn 1969, when he was 23 years old, in August, a previously planned small concert turned into a (free) more than 400,000 strong gathering of attendees and bands at Max Yasgur's farm in upstate New York - now called Woodstock.

In the same season he spent a month on loan to Dutch side NAC Breda, playing three times for them and scoring one goal.\n\nAt the end of the season it became apparent he would have to move to get regular first team football and he took the opportunity of joining Newport.\n\n\n\nSteve spent one season with the Welsh club hardly missing a game and after making 38 appearances and scoring eleven goals Argyle manager Dave Smith took an interest in him. He joined us in time for the start of the 1985-86 season with Gordon Staniforth moving to Newport in an exchange deal.\n\n\n\nSteve made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 3-1 defeat at York with Gerry McElhinney scoring the consolation goal.\n\nSteve\u2019s first goal came in the next away game a 2-0 win at Swansea with Gerry scoring the first goal. Two weeks later Steve got another goal when he scored in a 1-1 draw at Brentford. His next goal came at Home Park in a 3-1 win over Wolves, after he had got the first goal a Garry Nelson double finished the visitors off.\n\nSteve then scored the third goal in a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Gillingham after Kevin Hodges and Garry Nelson had both scored.\n\nHis next goal came on Bonfire Night when he scored the winner in a 2-1 win at home to Bournemouth after Kevin Hodges had scored the first. The same two players both scored in a 4-2 win at home to Darlington in mid-December, Kevin scored twice with Steve and Kevin Summerfied also on the scoresheet.\n\n\n\nIn the next game Argyle played the team that would finish the season as champions, Reading, although you wouldn\u2019t have thought much of their chances when Argyle raced into a 3-0 lead with Kevin Hodges, Steve and John Clayton all scoring. The home team showed why they were top of the league by winning the game 4-3.\n\nSteve\u2019s eighth and last goal of the season came when he scored the first goal in a 3-1 win at Bournemouth with Russell Coughlin and Kevin Hodges also scoring.\n\nThe following game saw Tommy Tynan return on loan from Rotherham which limited Steve\u2019s appearances in the first team.\n\nArgyle finished the season in second place and returned to Division 2.\n\n\n\nWith Tommy scoring goals for fun Steve found his appearances limited throughout the 1986-87 season, only starting ten league games. He still managed to score four goals, all coming before mid-October. He scored twice in a 3-0 win at Hull in early September and then scored in successive 1-1 draws, the first at home to Leeds and the following Saturday at Grimsby.\n\n\n\nThe following season saw Steve make more regular first team appearances, including eleven as a substitute he made a total of 26 appearances scoring four goals, the three he got in the league came in successive games in December, on the 6th he got the second goal in a 2-0 win at home to Shrewsbury after Kevin Hodges had opened the scoring.\n\nThe following Saturday he scored the Argyle goal in a 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield. On the 20th Steve got the first goal in a 2-1 win at home to Bradford City with Mark Smith scoring the winner.\n\nSteve\u2019s other goal came in the third round of the FA Cup in a 2-0 win over Colchester at Home Park with John Matthews also scoring.\n\n\n\nSteve played his final game for the club in the last game of the season in a 2-1 defeat at Shrewsbury with John Clayton scoring the Argyle goal.\n\nAfter making 85 appearances scoring 16 goals Steve moved to Barnsley for a \u00a3100,000 fee.\n\n\n\nSteve spent three seasons at Oakwell making 77 appearances and scoring 13 goals before he moved to Tranmere.\n\n\n\nSteve enjoyed a successful first season at Tranmere with the club winning promotion to Division 1. He also appeared in the Leyland DAF cup final in 1991 against his home town club Birmingham City, although Steve scored a goal the Blues won the game 3-2.\n\n\n\nIn 1992 Steve was loaned out to Peterborough near the end of the season, with his temporary club reaching the Division 3 play-offs. After a 2-2 draw at home to Huddersfield the second leg at Leeds Road was level at 1-1 when Steve was brought on as substitute. He scored an 86th minute winner with a diving header to set up a game against Stockport at Wembley.\n\nThe Posh beat Stockport 2-1 to win promotion to Division 2.\n\n\n\nSteve returned to Tranmere but found it difficult to hold down a first team place and in 1993 was loaned out to Wigan where he made four appearances before being transferred to York.\n\nSteve was an almost ever present with York throughout the 1993-94 season making 38 league appearances scoring six goals.\n\n\n\nA move to Scotland with Airdrieonians followed and was the start of the most successful period of his career, ending up as leading goalscorer in two of the five seasons he was with them.\n\nSteve scored his first goal for Airdrie on 5th October 1994 in a 2-0 win over Ayr in the B&Q Cup, with his new club going on to win the trophy in a 3-2 victory over Dundee in the final.\n\nIn what proved to be an excellent season as far as cup matches were concerned. He scored in the semi-final of the League cup but missed out on another final with Raith ending up winning the game on penalties.\n\nIn the Scottish Cup Airdrie gained revenge for the League Cup defeat against Raith when they beat them 4-1 to set up a semi-final game against Premier League Hearts. Steve scored the winner with a towering header to reach another cup final. In the final against a star studded Celtic team they were narrowly beaten 1-0 thanks to a Pierre Van Hooijdonk goal.\n\nAt the end of his first season in Scotland Steve scored sixteen goals and reached two cup finals and a semi-final.\n\n\n\n1995-96 and 1996-97 were disrupted due to injuries, but fully fit again for the 1997-98 with Steve again terrorising Scottish defences scoring fourteen goals including a hat trick against Hamilton.\n\n1998-99 again saw Steve suffer from injuries with his appearances limited. He did manage to score nine goals though.\n\nAt the end of the season he was released by manager Gary McKay after making 133 appearances and scoring 42 goals.\n\n\n\nSteve joined Ayr for the 1998-99 season but was forced to retire from the game due to injuries without making an appearance.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to England after his retirement he retained an involvement in football by coaching Studley FC in Warwickshire.\n\n\n\nSteve sadly died aged only 39 on 15th February 2004, he had banged his head in a fall and unknowingly cracked his skull and he later died in his sleep due to internal bleeding, leaving a wife Hayley and children Dale and Jade.\n\nA popular player at every club he played for his funeral was attended by many former team mates and fans of the clubs he had played for.\n\n\n\nLater in the year he died Steve was inducted into the Airdrie Hall of Fame, and is still held in great esteem by fans of the club.\n\n\n\nplymouthvital@aol.co.uk\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/steven_m.cooper/3029713", "page_content": "Steven M.

Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow.\n\n\u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d England ended up winning on penalties.\n\nNow Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived.\n\n\u201cOver a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,\u201d says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. \u201cIn terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Gu\u00e9hi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England]. The players know him, they trust him, they like his ideas and they know what sort of coach and person he is. He knows how to handle young players. He\u2019s got tons of experience.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper (right) and an England squad including Emile Smith Rowe, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Phil Foden celebrate winning the Under-17 World Cup in 2017. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters\n\nFor Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. Frank McParland, then the academy director, promoted Cooper from under-16s to under-18s coach. Cooper worked closely with the technical manager at Liverpool\u2019s academy, Pep Segura, adopting the former Barcelona coach\u2019s philosophy.\n\nCooper\u2019s passion radiated to his players. \u201cHe is the most dedicated manager I\u2019ve come across, in terms of his appetite, his eagerness, his energy, his buzz,\u201d says Jordan Lussey, who Cooper named under-18s captain at Liverpool. \u201cWe got to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals [in 2013] and played Chelsea over two legs. I\u2019d be out locally around Ormskirk on an evening and get a phone call off him saying: \u2018What do you think about this? I\u2019ve got this idea.\u2019 Or: \u2018Come into the office tomorrow, I need to show you something.\u2019 You would sit down, the two of us at a computer, and he would show you what he wants from you in a game, what their weaknesses are and that is another reason he has had great success. Any situation that was put in our way, you knew your job.\u201d\n\nSteve Cooper during Liverpool\u2019s FA Youth Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Anfield in 2013. Photograph: Paul Thomas/The FA/Getty Images\n\nCooper, born in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, is meticulous \u2013 on and off the grass. \u201cThere is not a stone that Steve leaves unturned,\u201d says Margetson. \u201cEven the smallest detail is important to him. He is across everything. The dressing room, how it is set up and how meeting rooms are set up, etcetera. One of the things he did around the training ground was make it feel more like Swansea City. He put images of the players all around the training ground and images of the supporters cheering on the team. He was proud to manage Swansea and he knew what it meant to the people. and he often referred to that in meetings and he did a lot of brilliant motivational [pre-match] videos for the players, showing them the history of the club.\u201d\n\nRyan Yates (left) is embraced by teammates after putting Nottingham Forest ahead during Wednesday\u2019s win over QPR. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nThe 42-year-old, whose father, Keith, was a referee, is an unassuming character and although a deep thinker and level-headed, he can be firm when required. \u201cIf he needs to give you the hairdryer treatment, he will,\u201d says Lussey, now with Curzon Ashton. \u201cIf he needs to give you praise, he will. That\u2019s where he gets that mutual respect from top to bottom. He\u2019s not your best mate where you can just mess about or not put in the work. He will pull you up properly and let you know what he thinks.\u201d\n\nSwansea\u2019s hierarchy were wowed by Cooper during his interview and, after guiding the club to successive play-off finishes on a modest budget, unsurprisingly there was Premier League interest last summer and he held talks with Crystal Palace. Forest identified Cooper as their first-choice target after sacking Chris Hughton when bottom of the Championship. They have risen to eighth, Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 home win over QPR continuing form that looks capable of securing a play-off place. Since his appointment six months ago they have lost only four times.\n\nA Nottingham Forest fan with a Steve Cooper cutout. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n\u201cHe is very much a family man, but he lives and breathes football,\u201d Margetson says. \u201cIf he\u2019s not thinking about Forest, he\u2019ll be watching games somewhere. You can\u2019t just rock up and land in the Championship \u2013 you have to earn your stripes and study the game and there is no doubt that Coops has done.\u201d\n\nWhen Forest kick off against Liverpool at the City Ground, Foster will be watching on television at St George\u2019s Park, cup of tea in hand. \u201cI am immensely proud of him,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI think when you\u2019ve not had a wonderful playing career it\u2019s harder to establish yourself as a coach. He\u2019s had to do it the hard way and is reaping the rewards of that. He has been a shining light for coaches at the FA and beyond. He will play it down but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s itching to pit his wits against one of the best coaches in the game.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.idolbirthdays.net/steve-cooper", "page_content": "Does Steve Cooper Dead or Alive?\n\nAs per our current Database, Steve Cooper is still alive (as per Wikipedia, Last update: May 10, 2020).\n\n\ud83c\udf82 Steve Cooper - Age, Bio, Faces and Birthday\n\nCurrently, Steve Cooper is 65 years, 9 months and 9 days old.

According to astrologers, Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won\u2019t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.\n\n\ud83c\udf19 Chinese Zodiac Signs\n\nSteve Cooper was born in the Year of the Rooster.
