Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research.

Germer's experiment confirmed an earlier hypothesis suggested by French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie. Germer's work came a critical time during the development of quantum theory. The experiments of Germer and Davisson helped validate the mathematically complex atomic models proposed by de Broglie and Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that predicted a particle and wave duality for electrons (i.e., that electrons should show properties of both particles and electromagnetic waves).\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Germer exhibited precocious mathematical ability as a child, and later became a graduate student under the tutelage of Davisson at Columbia University. While working at the Bell Laboratories in New York City in 1927, Germer and Davisson experimented with directing a beam of electrons of known energy onto the surface of polycrystalline nickel. Germer and Davisson measured the various angles at which electrons bounced off of the surface. When measured, the scattered electrons showed peaks precisely where predicted by wave theory (i.e., an intense reflected beam was observed in accord with the Bragg condition for constructive interference). In a stroke of serendipity the experiment was altered when air accidentally entered the tube that contained target nickel. An oxide film formed on the surface of the nickel crystals and resulted in the production of crystalline structure consistent with wavelike electron defraction patterns. Germer and Davisson correctly asserted that their experiments argued for a particle-wave duality in electrons, a fundamental postulate of modern quantum mechanics.\n\nScientists use the wavelike properties of electrons discovered by Germer in a number of applications, including the electron microscope."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-79268-8_6", "page_content": "Clinton J. Davisson (1881\u20131958) was frail of frame throughout his life. He graduated from high school at age 20 and received a one year scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he spent six years, since his studies were interrupted by occasional lack of funds. At Chicago, he found physics \u201cconcise and orderly,\u201d and was inspired by Millikan. Before finishing his degree at Chicago, he was a part-time instructor in physics at Princeton University, where he came under the influence of Owen Richardson (1879\u20131959). He earned his Ph.D. under Richardson at Princeton in 1911 and subsequently married Richardson\u2019s sister, Charlotte, whom he had met when she was visiting from England in 1911. After the honeymoon, Davisson joined the Carnegie Institute of Technology as an instructor. But the 18 hour teaching load left him no time for research, except for the summer he spent at the Cavendish Laboratory with J.J. Thomson in 1913. Richardson returned to England in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at King\u2019s College London.\n\nIn 1917 Davisson was unable to enlist in the U.S. Army because of his physical frailty. He took a leave of absence from Carnegie Tech to do war-related work at Western Electric, which was the engineering arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). This would later become Bell Telephone Laboratories. After the war he turned down a promotion at Carnegie Tech and accepted a permanent position at Western Electric [121].\n\nBell Telephone Laboratories, then in New York City, was an industrial research center. The rapid growth and capabilities of the industrial laboratory in the post World War 1 period was one of the key features of the developing American scientific system. The mission of an industrial laboratory differed from that of an academic or national laboratory in that the projects undertaken were directly related to the perceived needs of the company supporting the laboratory.Footnote 5 The laboratory director could, however, use his own judgement to provide the freedom necessary to pursue any investigation that seemed critical for scientific reasons, but might not be obviously directly related to any industrial question. At this time, the director of the research section at Bell Laboratories was Harold D. Arnold (1883\u20131933). Figure 6.2 is a photo of the Bell Telephone Laboratories building in New York City, taken in 1936.\n\nFig. 6.2 (Public Domain. Author unknown) Bell Telephone Laboratories Building in New York City 1936. Full size image\n\nIn March of 1917 Davisson was assigned an assistant, Lester H. Germer (1896\u20131971), who had just graduated from Cornell. Two months later, however, Germer volunteered for service in the army and became a pilot in the aviation section of the Signal Corps [121]. After the war, following three weeks of rest, Germer returned to Bell Laboratories to work with Davisson. They were assigned the investigation of thermionic emission in oxide-coated cathodes under positive ion bombardment. This led to an investigation of the nature of secondary emission from grids and plates. According to Germer\u2019s later recollection, this study originated because of a patent dispute between Arnold of Western Electric and Irving Langmuir (1881\u20131957) of General Electric. The primary problem in the lawsuit, however, dealt with the understanding of the physics prior to 1913. Therefore, data from 1920 were of little value [240, pp. 125, 130].\n\nIn 1920, Bell Laboratories initiated a cooperative program for advanced degrees with Columbia University, which allowed those chosen to freely elect their course of study and curtail their work time. Germer was one of the first to take advantage of this, obtaining an M.A. in 1922 [240, p. 120]. At that time Davisson was interested in pursuing a sideline investigation of secondary electron emission under electron bombardment. This sideline was encouraged by Arnold, who supplied Davisson with a new assistant, Charles Kunsman (1890\u20131970). Kunsman had just received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nDavisson and Kunsman found that 1% of the electrons were scattered back toward the electron gun with virtually no energy loss. The beam energy was 150 eV. The scattered electrons showed two maxima. One of these was in the direction of the incoming beam and the other was at an angle. This angle was affected by the energy of the incoming beam. Davisson was profoundly impressed by this result. He noted the similarity of the electron scattering to the scattering of alpha particles that had been engaging Rutherford and his group in Manchester. In Davisson\u2019s own words [121]:\n\nWhat we were attempting [...] were atomic explorations similar to those of Sir Ernest Rutherford [...] in which the probe should be an electron instead of an alpha particle.\n\nIn 1921, Davisson and Kunsman submitted a two-column paper to Science. But the subsequent experiments yielded unimpressive results and they were not published. Kunsman left the company at the end of 1923 and Davisson abandoned the scattering investigations [66, 121, 240, pp. 131\u2013132].\n\nGermer had fallen ill, missing 15 months at work as a result. However, in October of 1924, he was put back on the project replacing Kunsman [121]. Preliminary experiments were carried out to cross-check the new data with the data of the previous experiments carried out by Davisson and Kunsman. Then on 5 February 1925, the now famous accident occurred. A liquid air bottle exploded while the target was at a high temperature. The tube used for the experiment was broken and the target oxidized. This was not the first accident that had occurred in the course of these experiments, but this time the target was not replaced. The oxide was removed by vaporization along with a layer of the target, after prolonged annealing in H\\(_{\\text {2}}\\) and in vacuum [121, 240, p. 139].\n\nOn 6 April the experiments began again. At first the results were not different than those previously obtained. But then on 12 and 14 May, rather than the single offset peak previously observed, there were multiple peaks with varying intensities. To understand what might have happened Davisson and Germer cut open the apparatus and, with the help of the microscopist Francis F. Lucas (1885\u20131961), examined the structure of the target. Instead of the many microscopic crystals present previously, they observed only a few large crystals. The results, therefore, came from the scattering of electrons by crystals rather than by atoms. Fortunately, there was a group at the laboratory doing research on crystal structures [121, 240, p. 140].\n\nDavisson decided that they should now consider scattering from a single crystal with known orientation with respect to the electron beam. Because of the demands of other experiments in the laboratories, a single crystal was not available until April 1926, provided by the company\u2019s metallurgist Howard Reeve. They mounted the crystal so that both the polar and azimuthal angles could be changed. The results were disappointing. There was no variation in the reflected beam from variation in the polar angle, and only meagre dependence on the azimuth [121, 240, p. 141].\n\nArturo Russo points out that electron diffraction might never have been discovered at Bell Laboratories had Davisson not needed a rest and returned to England with his wife for a second honeymoon during the summer of 1926. According to Charlotte Davisson, they were fortunate that her sister and brother-in-law at Princeton University were able to care for the children [121]. While in England, (Clinton) Davisson attended the Oxford meeting of the British Society for the Advancement of Science. There he heard a lecture by Born on the new quantum theory and the wave nature of matter proposed by de Broglie [72, 73, 240, p. 141].\n\nDavisson had previously contacted Born for advice on crystals, since he was a recognized expert. At the time, Born had suggested to Davisson that the electron scattering data might be the result of forces from different planes in the crystal. This first contact had left little impression on Born until he discussed the issue later with Franck, who raised the possibility of electron waves as proposed by de Broglie.\n\nBorn and Franck realized that the data from Bell Laboratories might indicate diffraction of electron waves. Together they decided that the issue was worth pursuing and assigned a new graduate student in Franck\u2019s laboratory, Walter Elsasser (1904\u20131991), to the problem. In July of 1925 Elsasser was ready to suggest that the 1921 results of Davisson and Kunsman might be indicative of the diffraction of electron waves. He was not, however, in a position to conduct any experiments of his own [240, p. 143].\n\nIn his lecture at Oxford, Born cited de Broglie\u2019s work and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s papers on wave mechanics. Then he noted that the experiments by Davisson and Kunsman in 1921 had provided evidence for the diffraction of electron waves. This resulted in an extensive discussion after the lecture with Born, Franck, and Douglas Hartree (1897\u20131958) providing Davisson with an introduction to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s papers, which dealt extensively and directly with matter waves, de Broglie\u2019s papers, and the new matrix mechanics due to Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan. Davisson had normally kept himself informed of developments in physics, but it seems he was not yet aware of these advances in quantum mechanics [121].\n\nDavisson borrowed reprints of the Schr\u00f6dinger papers and a German\u2013English dictionary from Richardson to study on the return trip to New York. When he was back at Bell Laboratories he had an idea for the experiment he and Germer should perform. Davisson wrote to Richardson [121]:\n\nI am still working at Schr\u00f6dinger and others and believe that I am beginning to get some idea of what it is all about. In particular I think that I know the sort of experiment we should make with our scattering apparatus to test the theory.\n\nArnold acknowledged the importance of the idea and assigned the mechanical engineer C. Calbick as an assistant [121].\n\nThe experiments began in December of 1926 [240, pp. 144, 145]. The first results in accordance with theory were obtained on 6 January 1927 and the first announcement was sent to NatureFootnote 6 [67]. The results were also presented at the American Physical Societymeeting in Washington in April [69] and a Bell Laboratories Record report was published in April [68]. A lengthy review paper then appeared in the Physical Review in December of 1927 [70, 121].\n\nFigure 6.3 is a simplified drawing of the main parts of the 1927 apparatus. As in all previous experiments, the apparatus was mounted inside a glass tube containing a high vacuum to prevent absorption of the electrons. An approximate outline of this tube is provided in Fig. 6.3 from pictures of the apparatus in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Figures 6.2 and 6.4 in Davisson and Germer\u2019s Physical Review paper are detailed technical drawings of the apparatus from each side.\n\nFig. 6.3 (Simplified from Fig. 2 of [70]. Drawn by CSH) Davisson and Germer\u2019s apparatus in 1927. T is the Nickel target, G is the electron gun, and C is the double Faraday box collector for the scattered electrons. The electrons entering the Faraday box are registered by a sensitive galvanometer. This apparatus was sealed inside a glass tube, which is indicated partially. The angular location of the Faraday box was adjusted by rotating the tube about an axis perpendicular to the drawing. Full size image\n\nThe electron gun G in Fig. 6.3 provided a collimated beam of electrons directed at the nickel target T, which could be rotated to position selected crystal lattice planes relative to the electron beam. The collector C was a double Faraday box with output to a sensitive galvanometer, and was similar to the collector used by Millikan (see Fig. 5.8). The angle of the collector relative to the beam of electrons was selected by rotating the tube and measured on a scale on the side opposite the one shown in the drawing.\n\nFigure 6.4 shows a composite of the data from Davisson and Kunsman\u2019s paper in Science which attracted the attention of Born\u2019s group, and the data from the Davisson and Germer paper in the Physical Review, which was their final statement of 1927. The plot in Fig. 6.4 is configured so that the beam is aligned with the one in Fig. 6.3. The scale is correct for the 1921 (black) data. The scale of the 1927 (red) data has been adjusted to make the difference between the two results clear.\n\nFig. 6.4 (Public Domain. Plotted by CSH) Composite of the Davisson and Kunsman data (black) and the Davisson and Germer data (red). Data plotted in black are from Fig. 1 of the November 1921 Science article. Data plotted in red are from Fig. 1 of the December 1927 Physical Review article. Full size image\n\nThe plot is polar with an origin at the point at which the incoming electron beam strikes the target. A polar angle of zero is defined by the negative direction of the incoming electron beam. Positive diffracted beam angles are measured in a clockwise direction from this. The value of the radial component is the ratio of the diffracted electron intensity at the corresponding angle to the intensity of the incoming beam. The scale in our drawing, as in Davisson and Germer\u2019s plot, has a factor of \\(10^{\\text {4}}\\) as shown in Fig. 6.4. This is an indication of the experimental expertise.\n\nThe relative minima and maxima of the 1921 data are at polar angles of \\(65^\\circ \\) and \\(75^\\circ \\), respectively. Davisson and Kunsman indicated these angles in their paper. We have removed them to avoid clutter. Knowing that the relative maximum, so crucial in attracting the attention of Born\u2019s group, was at \\(75^\\circ \\) will help the reader to understand the polar plot.\n\nThe black data points in Fig. 6.4 have been taken directly from Fig. 6.1 in the Science paper. The red points are those at \\(5^\\circ \\) intervals read from the Physical Review paper. There were many more data points in the graphs in the 1927 paper in order to clearly indicate the structure that can be seen in Fig. 6.4."}, {"url": "https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/lester-germer", "page_content": "Lester Germer (right) and Clinton Davisson, holding the electron gun used for the Davisson-Germer experiment in 1927, photograph (aps.org)\n\nLester Germer, an American physicist, died Oct. 4, 1971, just shy of his 75th birthday. Germer is one of the few lucky physicists to have his name attached to a classic experiment. We have the Millikan oil-drop experiment that first determined the charge on the electron (1910), and the Michelson-Morley experiment (1887), which disproved the existence of an ether. And then there is the Davisson-Germer experiment of 1927.\n\nFirst paragraph of \u201cThe scattering of electrons by a single crystal of nickel,\u201d by Clinton Davison and Lester Germer, in Nature, vol. 119, 1927 (Linda Hall Library)\n\nIn 1924, the French physicist Louis de Brogle had proposed that particles have a wave function associated with them, and he even predicted the wavelength of such waves for various particles. This seemed absurd at first \u2013 how could a particle behave like a wave and still be a particle? \u2013 but no one said nature is predictable, just that she is open to experimental inquiry. So Germer and his senior partner, Clinton Davisson, bounced a beam of electrons off the atoms in a nickel crystal. If you do that with light waves, you get a diffraction pattern, essentially a pattern of alternating light and dark zones. Germer and Davisson found that the same thing happens with electrons \u2013 they produce a diffraction pattern, and on measuring the length of the waves that would produce such a pattern, they got very nearly the wavelength that De Broglie had predicted for the electron. Albert Einstein had shown in 1905 that waves can behave like particles, and now Davisson and Germer were demonstrating that particles can and do behave like waves.\n\nDiagram of the instrumental set-up for the Davisson-Germer experiment of 1927. The electron gun is at left, the nickel target at right, and the detector at top (byjus.com)\n\nA diagram of the simple experimental set-up can be seen in our third image. Electrons are emitted with a known energy from an electron gun (which Davisson and Germer are holding in the portrait photograph), the electrons are reflected off the nickel crystal, and a detector that can slide along a circular scale detects the energy of the reflected electrons for different angles of reflection.

Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research. He died after a fall while climbing near Gardiner, New York."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70626-7_45", "page_content": "The Davisson\u2014Germer experiment (1927) was the first measurement of the wavelengths of \u25ba electrons. C. J. Davisson, who worked in the Bell Research Laboratories, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the year 1937 together with George P. Thomson from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who independently also found experimental indications of electron diffraction. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, \u25ba wave-particle duality leads to particles also exhibiting wave-like properties like extension in space and interference.\n\nClinton J. Davisson (1881\u20131958) and Lester H. Germer (1896\u20131971) investigated the reflection of electron beams on the surface of nickel crystals. When the beam strikes the crystal, the nickel atoms in the crystal scatter the electrons in all directions. Their detector measured the intensity of the scattered electrons with respect to the incident electron beam. Their normal polycrystalline samples exhibited a very smooth angular distribution of scattered electrons. In early 1925, one of their samples was inadvertently recrystallized in a laboratory accident that changed its structure into nearly monocrystalline form. As a result, the angular distribution manifested sharp peaks at certain angles. As Davisson and Germer soon found out, other monocrystalline samples also exhibited such anomalous patterns, which differ with chemical constitution, angle of incidence and orientation of the sample. Only in late 1926 did they understand what was going on, when Davisson attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford. There Born spoke about de Broglie's \u25ba matter-waves and Schrodinger's \u25ba wave mechanics. Their later measurements completely confirmed the quantum mechanical predictions for electron wavelength \u03bb as a function of momentum p: \u03bb = h/p.

Credit: AIP Emilio Segr\u00e8 Visual Archives\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again. On 3 October, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will name the winners of the 111th Nobel Prize in Physics. Speculation abounds: Will it be the architects of LIGO? The pioneers of chaos theory? Perhaps the discoverers of exoplanets? What\u2019s certain is that the new laureates, whoever they may be, will join one of the most exclusive clubs in science. Champagne corks will be popped. News stories will be written.\n\nYet there will also be dozens of nominees for the prize who will be rebuffed by the Nobel committee. They, too, will join an elite club. Among the list of Nobel also-rans are Henri Poincar\u00e9, Edwin Hubble, Lise Meitner, and many other physicists who left lasting marks on the field.\n\nWe\u2019ll probably never know for sure why some physicists win Nobel glory and others come up short; the Nobel committee is notoriously secretive about their deliberations. But decades of data on the Nobel Prize\u2019s nominees reveal that not all snubs are created equal. It turns out that Nobel also-rans tend to fall into two groups: scientists who contributed to a Nobel-worthy breakthrough only to be overshadowed by collaborators and competitors, and undisputed giants in their field who simply set out after the wrong problem.\n\nIn the chart above, the circles represent physicists who were nominated between 1901 and 1965 but never won a Nobel. (Nomination data are released to the public only after 50 years.) The larger the circle, the more nominations an individual received. A single nomination may include up to three names\u2014usually of scientists who have made related discoveries\u2014and it\u2019s not unusual for just one or two of those candidates to be awarded the Nobel. The vertical axis shows how many times each person shared a nomination with an eventual laureate; the horizontal axis indicates the number of times the person was nominated either alone or exclusively with fellow Nobel snubs. Blue indicates that a majority of nominations were shared with laureates; red, a minority.\n\nBy and large, the physicists clustered along the vertical axis are the ones who were overshadowed, in the committee\u2019s eyes, by coworkers and competitors. That group includes the likes of Walter Gerlach, who with 1943 Nobel laureate Otto Stern discovered the quantization of spin angular momentum, and Seth Neddermeyer, who helped uncover the positron but saw the Nobel go to Carl Anderson.\n\nBut probably no one better exemplifies this group of also-rans than Bell Labs physicist Lester Germer. A codiscoverer of electron diffraction, Germer garnered 26 nominations throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, each one shared with collaborator Clint Davisson. But his Nobel chances were thwarted in 1937 when Davisson shared the prize with competitor George Thomson, who had nearly concurrently discovered the phenomenon.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for a deserving researcher to be squeezed out of Nobel contention when competing groups lay claim to the same discovery. But even so, the committee\u2019s decision to exclude Germer was a curious one. The year he won, Thomson received just four Nobel nominations, and each of those nominations included both Germer and Davisson. What\u2019s more, all four nominations explicitly listed Germer and Davisson as their first choice, with the second choice being to split the prize evenly among the three. In addition, Germer and Davisson were named in four additional nominations that excluded Thomson entirely. Somehow, the committee members settled on a final pairing that seems to have been no one\u2019s preference but their own.\n\nAs for the nominees clustered along the horizontal axis, their preeminence in a scientific pursuit was unquestioned; at issue was the legitimacy of the pursuit itself. In effect, their sin was that they stood apart from the intellectual in-crowd.\n\nThe polymath Poincar\u00e9 falls into this group. So do George Hale and Augusto Righi. But the archetype may well be the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who reshaped our understanding of the cosmos by establishing the rotation of the Milky Way and discovering its galactic halo. These days, he\u2019s probably best known for his namesake cloud, a vast shell of icy planetesimals orbiting at the edge of the solar system.\n\nOort was nominated 24 times during the 1950s and 1960s, only once alongside an eventual laureate. (Astronomer Otto Struve of the University of California, Berkeley, once put forth Emilio Segr\u00e8 as his first choice and Oort as his second, but never meant for the two men to share the prize.) The fact that most of Oort\u2019s support came from fellow Dutchmen may have put him at a disadvantage. Statistically, the tiny country didn\u2019t carry much sway with the Nobel committee: Only 1 in 16 Dutch nominations through 1965 produced a laureate (see chart below), compared with more than 1 in 10 nominations from Americans and nearly 1 in 6 from Great Britain.\n\nProbably the bigger factor, however, was that the Nobel committee didn\u2019t see astronomy as a Nobel-worthy discipline. Hale and Edwin Hubble are thought to have missed out on the prize for the same reason. The committee eventually came around, awarding the 1974 prize to British radio astronomers Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish; the committee has since doled out several more Nobels to astronomers.\n\nOf all the physicists who\u2019ve been spurned by the Nobel committee over the years (or at least through 1965), one defies categorization. Arnold Sommerfeld, named on a record 84 nominations, shared ballots with the likes of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Niels Bohr, and Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie. But the quantum theorist was also the sole nominee on 26 nominations and a joint nominee on 25 others that included no future laureates.\n\nAs lore has it, the knock against Sommerfeld was that he had no single, great achievement that the committee could point to, even though his collective body of work stacked up to those of contemporaries who won the prize. Though Sommerfeld himself never won, the branches of his academic tree are weighted with Nobel gold: Four of his graduate students, and at least two of his students\u2019 students, went on to become laureates.\n\nThe road to the Nobel Prize is paved with the careers of people like Sommerfeld, Oort, and Germer\u2014gifted physicists who, subject to the whims and quirks of the prize committee, narrowly missed out on their discipline\u2019s crowning achievement. So come Nobel Day, once everyone has toasted the newly minted laureates, let\u2019s hope they\u2019ll also raise a glass to the overlooked and left out: the Nobel also-rans.\n\nEditor\u2019s note, 22 September 2017: This story, which originally ran on 29 September 2016, has been updated and included as part of a series on the physicists nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics."}, {"url": "https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/25/1/93/428218/Lester-H-Germer", "page_content": "Alfred U.

Unlike an optical microscope that provides a direct image of an object, the STM uses a stylus and electric current to scan the surface and record each atom. The STM was invented at IBM Z\u00fcrich by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in 1981; they received the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in 1986.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate from the California Institute of Technology in 1982, Feenstra began his career at IBM labs in Yorktown Heights, New York. He traveled to Z\u00fcrich to study Binnig and Rohrer\u2019s STM and returned to the United States where he reconstructed the STM, making his lab one of only a few in the country to have the technology.\n\nOver the years, Feenstra and his colleagues worked to continue to develop STM, with a particular emphasis on refining the specifications for the microscope and improving the computational tools that would convert STM data into images. He developed new STM systems that were used to study semiconductor surfaces in an ultra-high vacuum. Along with his postdoc Joseph Stroscio, he created new techniques that allowed them to make novel observations about specific materials, including gallium arsenide, a semiconductor used in integrated circuits, light emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells.\n\nFeenstra joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Department of Physics in 1995. In his early work at CMU, Feenstra, with Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor David Greve, developed a molecular beam epitaxy system to grow gallium nitride films, which are essential components of blue LEDs and microwave transistors. The system included a STM, which they used to image the surface atomic arrangement and thereby understand and optimize the growth procedures.\n\nFeenstra\u2019s current research focuses on the development of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Two-dimensional materials are made by stacking one-atom-thick layers of different materials, creating a heterostructure. By carefully selecting the materials in each layer, scientists can create specific electronic properties that can enhance a material\u2019s performance and create new functionalities. Feenstra uses low-temperature STM to study these semiconductor heterostructures and determine their unique electronic properties.\n\nA native of Vancouver, Canada, Feenstra earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering physics from the University of British Columbia, and his master\u2019s and doctorate degrees in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology. He has received numerous awards for his work, including the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation Research Award, the Peter Mark Memorial Award of the American Vacuum Society and the IBM Outstanding Innovation Award. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Vacuum Society.\n\nFeenstra has published more than 230 papers in peer-reviewed journals and contributed seven book chapters, which have been cited more than 10,000 times.\n\nThe Davisson-Germer Prize was established in 1965 to recognize and encourage outstanding work in atomic or surface physics. The prize is named after Nobel laureates Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer who first measured electron diffraction. Davisson was a physics faculty member at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research in 1967 to form Carnegie Mellon University."}, {"url": "https://news.columbia.edu/news/columbia-alum-wins-nobel-prize-physics", "page_content": "\"We are thrilled that one of our own alumni is being recognized for his contributions to quantum mechanics.

This prize is further recognition of that, and we heartily congratulate John Clauser on his award,\" said Robert Mawhinney, dean of the Division of Natural Sciences at Columbia.\n\nThe team was awarded the prize for experiments that demonstrate what is known as \u201cquantum entanglement\u201d \u2013 the fact that two particles can affect each other despite being far apart from one another and seeming to have no physical connection.
