Fields as \u201cthe funniest man I ever saw \u2013 and the saddest man I ever knew\u201d \u00a9 Getty Images\n\nThe earliest Black characters in mainstream cinema reflected the worst stereotypes and caricatures that proliferated elsewhere, in books and on stage. Donald Bogle identifies the first Black character in a silent film as Uncle Tom, in a 1903 adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s novel. In his landmark study Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks (1973), Bogles delineated how between that film and the apotheosis of Hollywood racism that was The Birth of a Nation (1915), the stereotypes of his book\u2019s title became hard-wired into white filmmakers\u2019 use of Black characters.\n\nBut there was an alternative. As the artistic and cultural boom we know now as the Harlem Renaissance took off in New York and made its effects felt in Paris and beyond, Black performers, directors and writers created an independent cinema that positioned itself in opposition to the racist messaging coming out of the commercial studios.\n\nFinancially, these \u2018race films\u2019 were precarious, but they had immediate, and lasting, impact. As the film scholar Jacqueline Stewart has written, in an introduction to Kino Lorber\u2019s Blu-ray box-set of early African-American cinema: \u201cIt was a rare and complicated experience for Black viewers to see race movies. These films could be validating because they were made specifically with Black audiences in mind. They could also be endearing, and embarrassing, for their low-budget inability to match the production values of the Hollywood films that served as the norm.\u201d\n\nWilliam D. Foster was the first African American to establish a film company, the Foster Photoplay Company, in 1910, with the express aim of correcting the negative representations that were the norm. Its 1912 film The Railroad Porter is thought to be the world\u2019s first with an all-Black cast and director. The company folded after a few years but it had successors, such as the Lincoln Motion Picture Company, founded by the actor Noble Johnson.\n\nTen Nights in a Barroom (1926)\n\nThere were early Black stars too, such as Bert Williams, a vaudeville comedian who took the lead in films such as A Natural Born Gambler (1916). Later, in the 1920s, revered Black stage actors (and rivals) Charles Sidney Gilpin and Paul Robeson would dip their toes into film, respectively with the temperance drama Ten Nights in a Barroom (1926) and Body and Soul (1925), directed by Oscar Micheaux.\n\nTen Nights in a Barroom, the Gilpin film, was made by a Philadelphia-based studio called The Colored Players Film Corporation, a producer of silent melodramas with all-Black casts, though white directors. The scholar and filmmaker Manthia Diawara has described the best of its work and that of Micheaux as \u201ca genre of Black independent cinema which puts Black people and their culture at the centre as subjects of narrative development; in these films, Black people are neither marginalized as a problem, nor singled out as villainous stereotypes such as Hollywood constructs in its films.\u201d\n\nOscar Micheaux\n\nOscar Micheaux was the most famous director of race films in the silent era and probably the most successful Black filmmaker in the first half of the 20th century. He was a multi-hyphenate novelist/director/producer whose mission went further than avoiding typeacting. \u201cIt is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat we can raise our people to greater heights.\u201d\n\nHe was also an astute salesman, who marketed his stars in relation to comparable Hollywood celebrities: Lorenzo Tucker was the \u2018Black Valentino\u2019, Bee Freeman the \u2018sepia Mae West\u2019.\n\nHis films, including The Homesteader (1919) and Birthright (1924), tackle social issues, including racism, head on; they also seem to be in dialogue with popular white-authored plays and films on the same topics. Within Our Gates (1920) has widely been interpreted as a riposte to The Birth of a Nation, for example, and depicts racist violence, including a lynching. In narrative terms, Micheaux\u2019s films are complex and make substantial use of flashbacks and plot reveals.\n\nMicheaux\u2019s success meant he weathered storms many other independent Black filmmakers could not. However, the tradition of the race film continued into the 1950s, and although many of the films are now lost, the work of the silent pioneers who, in Bogle\u2019s words, \u201ckept the faith for as long as they could and for a long time before it was fashionable\u201d has plenty to recommend it, and still serves as a vital and refreshing counterblast to the prevailing winds from Hollywood.\n\nEight key Black performers and directors of the silent era\n\nBert Williams\n\nBahamian-American vaudeville comedian Bert Williams was described by W.C. Fields as \u201cthe funniest man I ever saw \u2013 and the saddest man I ever knew\u201d. He broke boundaries on Broadway and in cinema, and is said to be the first Black American to play leads, in films such as 1914\u2019s Darktown Jubilee.\n\nJack, Sam and Pete (1919)\n\nBermuda-born actor Ernest Trimmingham (sometimes spelled Trimingham) moved to England to act on stage, but is thought to have made his film debut in 1912, with The Adventures of Dick Turpin for the British and Colonial Film Company. His biggest film role was as Pete in Jack, Sam and Pete (1919).\n\n3. Luther Pollard\n\nLuther Pollard worked at the Ebony Film Corporation, a white-owned outfit making comedies with Black casts, producing films such as Two Knights of Vaudeville (1915). Especially after he became president of the company, he tried to steer the studio away from racist caricatures and prove that \u201ccolored players can put over good comedy without any of that crap shooting, chicken stealing, razor display, watermelon eating stuff that the colored people generally have been a little disgusted in seeing\u201d.\n\nSisters Ethel and Lucia Lynn Moses are two of the most famous faces in silent race films. Ethel was a sex symbol (the \u2018negro Harlow\u2019) who starred in Micheaux\u2019s films; Lucia appeared in Colored Players Film Corporation\u2019s stunning melodrama The Scar of Shame (1929, excerpted above). They also had careers on Broadway and performed at the Cotton Club.\n\nThe pre-eminent name among Black American independent filmmakers in the silent and early sound era, Micheaux directed his first film in 1919. The novelist-turned-director made more than 44 feature films \u2013 stirring, sophisticated dramas that openly commented on racism within society and in mainstream theatre and cinema.\n\nBest known for his sound films, his singing voice and his activism, Paul Robeson claimed his film career began in the sound era, but he had already starred in two culturally significant silent features: he took a formidable dual role in Micheaux\u2019s Body and Soul (1925) and also starred in Kenneth Macpherson\u2019s avant-garde drama of an interracial relationship, Borderline (1930, excerpted above).\n\nBorn in Cuba, Richard D. Maurice moved to Detroit as a child and founded the Maurice Film Company in 1920. It produced two features, the lost film Nobody\u2019s Children (1920) and the daringly experimental Eleven P.M. (1928), considered one of the best and most innovative silent race films, praised for its cinematography, special effects and surrealist style."}, {"url": "https://whatnerd.com/cinema-silent-era-explained-must-watch-silent-films/", "page_content": "Who remembers the silent era of film? Nobody, pretty much. The silent age has, obviously, passed beyond living memory for the most part.\n\nSure, there have been a few motion pictures since the invention of \"talkies\" that have used the silent technique, such as 2011's Academy Award-winning film The Artist. But practically speaking, silent films are history\u2014\"too artistic\" for modern box office viewers.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the silent movie era was actually like? Are there any masterpiece silent films that would still be considered great if they came out today? Well, you'd be surprised how many silent films are still considered among the industry's most beloved classics.\n\nFrom Charlie Chaplin to Fritz Lang, let's revisit the beginning years of cinema and the silent films of the era that still hold up today.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Silent Film Era\n\nThe silent film era began in 1906 with Charles Tait directing The Story of the Kelly Gang in Australia. As the first-ever feature-length movie, The Story of the Kelly Gang was received well and succeeded financially.\n\nBut it wasn't until 1915 that so-called \"movies\" began to catch on as a mainstream artform. That's when D.W. Griffith made The Birth of a Nation, after which the American film industry was truly born.\n\nGriffith had proven the viability of feature-length movies in America. From then on, film studios operated on a new level and were willing to hire filmmakers to create their visions as feature-length narratives.\n\nThe following 15 years saw the rise of Hollywood's most memorable stars, with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Greta Garbo all launching their careers during the silent film era. Unfortunately, many silent film stars couldn't translate their star power to \"talkies\" come the 1930s.\n\nAnd by the mid-1930s, the silent film era was done. Audiences had moved on to movies with audible dialogue, marking a landmark shift in filmmaking technology that forever changed the landscape of cinema.\n\nWhich is a shame, because silent movies still have much to offer. They're more than just pretentious works of art for snobby cinephiles to gawk over. Indeed, the silent film era gave us some of the finest movies ever produced, many of which are worth watching today.\n\nKeep reading for our picks of the best classic silent movies that are worthy of their reputation and still hold up today.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's last appearance as The Tramp is his finest effort, if you ask me. By 1936, talkies had been around for nearly a decade and silent films had been all but pushed out of the industry\u2014but Chaplin continued producing them, ignoring talkies all the way to the early 1940s.\n\nAnd we're glad he did! Modern Times is a harsh warning of modernization and mechanization to those who work in factories everywhere.\n\nIn this final tale of his iconic character, The Tramp finds Ellen and they fall madly in love with one another. But as the pair try to make their way in life, they're constantly being arrested.\n\nEver the optimist, Charlie Chaplin's The Tramp delivers an ending that feels hopeful in a world that's often bereft of it.\n\nModern Times has the Chaplin brand of humor in spades, as well as the heart that Chaplin skillfully weaves throughout his comedies. That's why the film endures and remains relevant to this day.\n\nOnce described as having \"the most beautiful final shot ever put to celluloid,\" City Lights was Charlie Chaplin's favorite film amongst the many films he made throughout his career.\n\nThe story follows his iconic character of The Tramp and his attempts to raise money to pay for a blind girl's operation so she can see.\n\nAs The Tramp makes his way through the film\u2014hilarious mishaps in tow\u2014the character becomes a figure for more than comedy. He's not interested in anybody else. He only wants to help her, which imbues a kind of depth that potently projects itself across the screen.\n\nYet even viewing it today, the comedy remains wonderfully engaging. And that acclaimed final scene? It still draws tears from the eyes.\n\nThe original dystopian sci-fi movie, Metropolis wasn't a hit upon release in 1927. Instead, it was an early example of a slow-burn movie\u2014one that, upon repeat viewings, became a cinematic titan.\n\nFritz Lang's film showcased storytelling on a huge scale, with the picture focusing on the rise of an underappreciated and undervalued workforce that was helped by Freder, the son of the master of Metropolis.\n\nRelated: Why Are Sci-Fi Movies So Popular in Modern Cinema? 5 Reasons\n\nThe picture's narrative encompasses the sheer scale of the massive fictional city and delivers a chilling warning on social class divide.\n\nToday, Metropolis still exudes an Orwellian attraction. The heroic actions of a few stand between a cold and uncaring world and the caring nature of the human species, keeping the film relevant almost a century later.\n\nTelling the real-life story of the Russian warship and the mutiny of its crew against the officers aboard, the 1925 film Battleship Potemkin is often ranked as one of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nSergei Eisenstein's direction remains a forward-thinking and edgy example of filmmaking in the silent era. He brilliantly showcases the conditions endured by the sailors aboard the ship, which led to the famous mutiny (and arguably the revolution itself).\n\nBattleship Potemkin is a highly influential film that inspired several of cinema's great filmmakers, and also served as an early example of how to make propaganda films in line with the government's agenda.\n\nNevertheless, Battleship Potemkin is a cinematic flagpole, if for no reason than it being one of the earliest epic films. The 75-minute runtime makes it highly approachable for any first-time silent film viewer.\n\nRead next: The 25 Best Classic Old Movies Everyone Should See, Ranked"}, {"url": "https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/hollywoods-silent-era", "page_content": "The National Museum of American History is renowned for its collection of American cinematic treasures such as Dorothy's Ruby Slippers from The Wizard of Oz (1939), but did you know that the museum also possesses an impressive collection of material related to silent films? Made from the 1890s through the late 1920s, silent films are movies without synchronized sound and dialogue. Instead, music was often played live in theaters to accompany and punctuate the action that took place on the screen, and dialogue was conveyed through intertitles, or shots of printed text. Our rich collection of silent cinema artifacts can give us a glimpse into the early days of the global artistic and entertainment medium we call \"the movies.\" Below are a few highlights from our silent cinema collection.\n\nBefore John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, movie cowboy William S. Hart lit up film screens across the country during the first two decades of the 20th century. A Shakespearean stage actor, Hart was almost 50 years old before he began a career in motion pictures, however he almost immediately became a successful and much-loved screen personality. (By the time his career was over, Hart had acted in over 70 films and directed over 50 films.) Although he worked as a producer, writer, and director, Hart is best known today for his career as an actor in silent westerns, in which he often portrayed moral lawmen or villains-turned-good.\n\nA passionate fan of western history and a stickler for historical detail, Hart made films that attempted to capture the gritty realism of the American West during the 1800s. An example of Hart's dedication to historical accuracy is this functional Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, which was used by Hart as a prop in a number of his silent westerns. According to our collection records, the gun's \"chamber is engraved with [a] scene showing the Texan-Mexican naval Battle of Campeche in May 1843.\" Inside the gun's wooden case is a plaque that reads \"'Owned by Wm. S. Hart and used in all early day picture work. Saw service in Wagon Tracks [(1919)], The Testing Block [(1920)], White Oak [(1921)], and other pictures.'\" This historic artifact-turned-movie-prop offers a glimpse into the career of a silent cinema pioneer and the history of American silent movies.\n\nNicknamed \"The Great Stone Face\" for his trademark deadpan facial expressions, Buster Keaton is considered one of the greatest screen comedians of all time. Keaton started his career in the entertainment industry as a child vaudevillian, performing with his parents, Joe and Myra Keaton, in their three-person act. After making the transition to motion pictures in 1917, Keaton combined his physical dynamism with his stoic disposition to create memorable comedic masterpieces such as Our Hospitality (1923), Sherlock Jr. (1924), and The General (1926). Keaton continued working into the sound era and even made appearances on television, however the peak of his career was firmly rooted in the silent era.\n\nThis velocipede is an original prop from Keaton's Our Hospitality, in which a young man (Keaton) finds himself stuck in the middle of a long-standing family feud. In a notable sequence from the film, Keaton is seen riding this velocipede, which was built specifically for the film to resemble an early 1800s dandy horse or \"gentleman's hobby horse,\" a pedal-less bicycle. Keaton himself donated the velocipede to the Smithsonian in 1924, where it remains one of the National Museum of American History's most prized silent film artifacts.\n\nTo see Keaton in motion on the velocipede, take a look at this clip on YouTube from Our Hospitality courtesy of the Marin Museum of Bicycling.\n\nDuring the silent era, there were few opportunities for African Americans to break into the mainstream film industry. As a result, smaller studios specializing in making films by African American filmmakers for African American audiences sprang up around the country. Called \"race films,\" these resulting motion pictures often boasted all-African-American casts and storylines that, unlike most mainstream films of the time, did not rely on racial stereotypes but rather attempted to explore important issues facing complex characters.\n\nFounded by filmmaker Richard E. Norman in 1920, Norman Studios was an example of one such studio that specialized in producing race films. The Bull-Dogger (1922) was Richard E. Norman's first feature-length film and followed the exploits of real-life African American rodeo star Bill Pickett. Pickett was a bulldogger, or steer wrestler, an act in which rodeo cowboys wrestle steer to the ground with their bare hands. Now considered a lost film, The Bull-Dogger is an example of an early race film created by a notable silent-era studio that strove to present alternative images of African Americans to cinematic audiences. An original poster for The Bull-Dogger resides in our collection, where it serves as a significant reminder of not only the racial barriers erected in early Hollywood but also of the tenacity and determination of African American filmmakers and performers who strove to attain fair representation on cinema screens around the country.\n\nThese are just a few of the many treasured artifacts related to silent cinema in the collection of the National Museum of American History. Stay tuned for updates on our popular culture exhibition, which will open in the next few years, and for part two of this blog series, which will focus on objects in our collection related to movie fan culture during the silent era.\n\nAnjuli M.

On screen, the title is Napol\u00e9on vu par Abel Gance, meaning \"Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance\". The film is recognised as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static. Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive close-ups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen and mosaic shots, multi-screen projection, and other visual effects. A revival of Napol\u00e9on in the mid-1950s influenced the filmmakers of the French New Wave.\n\n\n\nThe film begins in Brienne-le-Ch\u00e2teau with youthful Napoleon attending military school where he manages a snowball fight like a military campaign, yet he suffers the insults of other boys. It continues a decade later with scenes of the French Revolution and Napoleon's presence at the periphery as a young army lieutenant. He returns to visit his family home in Corsica but politics shift against him and put him in mortal danger. He flees, taking his family to France. Serving as an officer of artillery in the Siege of Toulon, Napoleon's genius for leadership is rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general. Jealous revolutionaries imprison Napoleon but then the political tide turns against the Revolution's own leaders. Napoleon leaves prison, forming plans to invade Italy. He falls in love with the beautiful Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais. The emergency government charges him with the task of protecting the National Assembly. Succeeding in this he is promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Interior, and he marries Jos\u00e9phine. He takes control of the army which protects the French\u2013Italian border, and propels it to victory in an invasion of Italy.\n\n\n\nGance planned for Napol\u00e9on to be the first of six movies about Napoleon's career, a chronology of great triumph and defeat ending in Napoleon's death in exile on the island of Saint Helena. After the difficulties encountered in making the first film, Gance realised that the costs involved would make the full project impossible.\n\n\n\nThe film was first released in a gala at the Palais Garnier (then the home of the Paris Opera) on 7 April 1927. Napol\u00e9on had been screened in only eight European cities when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to it, but after screening it in London, it was cut drastically in length, and only the central panel of the three-screen Polyvision sequences were retained before it was put on limited release in the US. There, the silent masterpiece was indifferently received at a time when talkies were just starting to appear. The film was restored in 1981 after twenty years' work by silent film historian Kevin Brownlow."}, {"url": "https://entertainism.com/brief-history-of-silent-movies", "page_content": "They say speech is silver, but silence, gold. In accordance, many regard the era of silent films as a time when some of the masterpieces of the movie industry were crafted and presented to audiences. Given here is a brief history of the era of silent movies.\n\nImagining a mute movie in today\u2019s times would probably freak the daylights out of your mind! For many years, this popular medium of entertainment \u2013 cinema, movies, or films \u2013 did not have a voice. It is called the silent era of movies.\n\nMovie-makers back then had to heavily and largely depend on all other aspects of movie-making, since the technology to combine visuals with sound had not yet developed. It was only a matter of time before this technology did develop, but meanwhile, cinema witnessed the birth of many legends, who crafted many masterpieces that were appreciated and viewed over and over again, even as the \u2018talkies\u2019 arrived.\n\nThe Journey of Silent Cinema\n\nFirst Motion Picture Documentation\n\nThe history of silent movies begins with the history of cinema itself; as all movies made in those times did not have sound. Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s Sallie Gardner at a Gallop was the first silent film ever to be made. It documented equine motion and was released in 1878. The film consisted of a series of 24 photographs that were projected on the Zoopraxiscope (considered the first movie projector) in succession at high speeds to create the illusion of motion. Muybridge\u2019s Zoopraxiscope was the inspiration behind the Kinetoscope, which was meant for individual viewing. It used the same basic technique of relaying successive photographs to create the illusion of motion. However, in spite of being a \u2018motion\u2019-picture, Sallie Gardner at a Gallop cannot be really called a \u2018film\u2019, as it was merely a relay of successive photographs that created the \u2018illusion\u2019 of motion.\n\nFirst Narrative Film\n\nThe first narrative film ever, Roundhay Garden Scene was made by Louis Aim\u00e9 Augustin Le Prince. It was released on 14 October 1888, and was only 2 seconds long! Louis Le Prince is considered the true father of motion picture. Motion pictures matured into full-length feature films in the 1920s, but still lacked sound. It is this short period of a few decades that is referred to as the era of silent cinema.\n\nThe Cast and the Crew\n\nSilent movies were at their peak by the 1920s \u2013 the decade saw the birth of many a legend and many a masterpiece. By the 1920s, people had mastered the art of speaking volumes without saying a word. In fact, so adept was the film fraternity with the concept of silent films, that for quite a few years after the \u2018talkies\u2019 arrived, movies failed to create the impact they did in the silent era, for directors and actors alike could not deal with all the sound!\n\nActing\n\nCharlie Chaplin, one of the geniuses of the silent era, very correctly once said that \u201cCinema is pantomimic art\u201d. No sound meant no dialogs, so your body language and facial expressions had to do all the talking. Many actors hence adopted hyperbole in their acting. You may notice many actors exaggerate their actions in silent films \u2013 you fall, it has to be dramatic; you are sad, you have to be melodramatic; you are falling in love, you have to bat your eye-lashes and blush! Exaggeration worked especially well for comedies. Exaggerating grief is something that can very quickly and easily go wrong. But they all managed to do it beautifully; and that is sheer brilliance.\n\nMusic\n\nThe importance of music in creating a mood was already known \u2013 music was effectively used to the same purpose in plays and dramas. In the very beginning, music was only used to entertain the audiences before the actual movie began, and during the intertitles. Later, movies came to be accompanied with live music performances that coordinated with the scene. Theater organs were used to create special sound effects too. However, most of the movies adapted theater music and improvised on it. The first ever movie to have an original music score was D.W. Griffith\u2019s 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation(composed by Joseph Carl Breil). As silent movies reached their highest peaks of success, the popularity of plays and dramas slowly waned.\n\nDirection\n\nDirectors of the silent era never shied away from experimenting, for movies were still new to everyone. While most directors insisted on their actors being theatrical, melodramatic and flamboyant, a few allowed the actors to identify their own acting styles, and act naturally and candidly. Many movie-makers considered this style as rather mellow and subtle. With barely any sound and no dialogs, direction was hence a big challenge, which talented, daring directors took up bravely, and did justice to it.\n\nDialogs\n\nWhen the requirement of saying something was unavoidable, movies made use of something called intertitles. Intertitles were text plates interspersed between the visuals. They helped carry the story from one point in the plot to another. Intertitles themselves went through various stages, from simple text intertitles to elaborate ones, sometimes even carrying an illustration of one or more of the movie characters. Writing intertitles became a profession, and soon people apart from the screenplay writers (or scenario writers, as they were called back then) came to be hired to write intertitles for movies! Intertitles evolved too, like all other aspects of silent movies, to become a special feature of the films.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe technology which was used to make movies in the silent era \u2013 and hence the norms that governed movie-making \u2013 are completely different from those which exist now. But even thinking of showing a small boy flying on a broomstick or a man dreaming would have seemed blasphemous in the silent era! And yet it was achieved brilliantly by G.A. Smith as early as in the year 1898, using a technique called double exposure. Other techniques like stop motion were also used to add to the movie-watching experience. Film continuity, slow motion, animation \u2013 some of the techniques that have become the basics of movie-making now, were all developed in the silent era of cinema.\n\nMost Celebrated Legends of the Silent Era\n\nSome of the initial movies were written, directed, and produced by a single person. Even after various divisions were established, some ambitious movie-makers continued to make \u2018all-me\u2019 films, where they worked on more than just one aspect of movie-making. Below is an account of some of the most celebrated legends of the silent cinema.\n\nD.W. Griffith\n\nThe man who directed the epic The Birth of a Nation (1915), D.W. Griffith is regarded by film historians as one of the greatest American film directors ever, although he arrived in New York with the dreams of becoming a successful playwright. He made his debut in the film industry as an actor in Edward Porter\u2019s Rescued from an Eagle\u2019s Nest. With The Birth of a Nation, Griffith raised the bar of movies to another level. The movie set many a record, becoming the highest grossing film in history, and the first American feature film. Griffith is also celebrated for his other films \u2013 Lady Helen\u2019s Escapade, Intolerance: Love\u2019s Struggle Throughout the Ages, and Broken Blossoms; all of which have been preserved by the United States National Film Registry.\n\nRoscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle\n\nRoscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle was an actor, director and screenwriter. But he is widely and most significantly acknowledged for his comic genius. Arbuckle\u2019s is a life full of controversies. When he was born, his father named him after a politician he despised, because he did not believe Roscoe was his child. From childhood, Roscoe had a very melodious voice. He was soon pulled into vaudeville for his singing talent. Arbuckle\u2019s acting debut was Ben\u2019s Kid. He popularized the clich\u00e9 gag \u2018pie in the face\u2019 that went on to be adapted into several comedies of the silent era. But more than anything else, I think we are all indebted to Arbuckle for having mentored Charlie Chaplin (it is believed \u2018The Tramp\u2019 was adapted from Arbuckle\u2019s dressing style) and discovered Buster Keaton; two very famous personalities of the silent era.\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin is one of the most sensitive comedians to have ever existed. You watch a Chaplin movie, and you laugh \u2013 but look into the eyes of the actor, and you cannot help shedding a tear. Chaplin\u2019s early life had him face tough times and go through hardships unimaginable of a small boy. It must have, however, paved the way for his film-technique \u2013 for Chaplin\u2019s humor is one that begins with laughter but leaves you ashamed of yourself and what the world around is turning into. Chaplin had the power to make you introspect, after giving you a good laugh \u2013 almost as if he were challenging you. Chaplin\u2019s films came to define and dominate the silent era, especially in the 1920s. Two of his films \u2013 The Gold Rush and The Circus, went on to become top-grossing silent films in the United States.\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nIf Charlie Chaplin epitomizes pantomime, Buster Keaton is \u2018The Great Stone Face\u2019 (as he was nicknamed). Keaton\u2019s comic appeal came from the way his characters in different films were always unfazed by the events occurring around them. Keaton\u2019s debut in The Butcher Boy was first in the legacy of films of the duo that Arbuckle and Keaton made. Keaton went on to become Arbuckle\u2019s gag-man, second-director, and best friend for life, who was to stand by Arbuckle through all his highs and lows. Such was the acting and directorial genius of the man, that he has been ranked as the 7th greatest director of all times (Entertainment Weekly) and 21st greatest male star of all times (American Film Institute). He and Arbuckle together as a pair have given the film industry some of the best comedy films.\n\nSergei Eisenstein\n\nOne cannot talk of silent cinema and not mention Eisenstein, a director and a film theorist. Eisenstein traveled a lot throughout his life. As a young boy, Sergei took up architecture and engineering, his father\u2019s profession. Eisenstein\u2019s introduction to the arts came with the study of the Japanese language, when he learned about the Kabuki theater. Eisenstein is best known for his silent film Battleship Potemkin. One who has seen this film cannot help but remember and shudder at the aesthetic beauty in which the Odessa Steps scene was shot. Though not entirely factual, the incident was added in the film to emphasize on the cruelties of the Imperial regime. Alexander Nevsky, one of Eisenstein\u2019s talkies, won him the Order Of Lenin.\n\nMaking Way For The Talkies\n\nThe first ever talking movie was The Jazz Singer, which was released in 1927. However, attempts to construct a device that could combine visuals and sound had been made many years prior to the release of this movie. Thomas Edison\u2019s Kinetophone was probably the earliest of movie projectors to combine sound and visuals. Even after the release of the first talky, silent films continued to reign the cinema world for quite a few years. The early attempts of the film fraternity to adapt to \u2018talking movies\u2019 were clumsy, and for a brief period, the quality of work produced reduced significantly. But even as talkies gained popularity, many a director, producer and film-maker continued to make silent movies, some with the specific intention of making a film that would celebrate the art of silent cinema, and some to pay a tribute to an era gone by. Murnau\u2019s City Girl (1930), and Chaplin\u2019s Modern Times(1931), are few such examples.\n\nThe names of many more maestros are associated with the silent era; like the German film director and expressionist F.W. Murnau, or Fritz Lang, who gave us the earliest science fiction film Metropolis, which was also the most expensive silent film ever made. Some film personalities even began their careers in the silent era and continued to work through the talkies till as late as the 1980s, like the silent era actress Lilian Gish, who had one of the longest careers, a complete 75 years!\n\nBeginning at personal experiments ending in a two-second clip, the U.S. movie industry has grown into a gigantic force providing employment to more than 2 million people, and contributing grossly $180 billion each year to the U.S. economy. We indeed have a lot to owe to personalities of the silent film era, for they developed in us a taste to see motion on a screen, even though it was without sound. The art of silent movies will be celebrated by generations to come."}, {"url": "https://blog.academyart.edu/a-century-apart-hollywood-in-1920s-vs-2020s/", "page_content": "A Century Apart: Hollywood in 1920s vs 2020s | In Student Life In Acting | By By Academy Contributor\n\nHollywood has had major changes occur in a century. Learn more about acting career highlights and the filmmaking industry in the 1920s vs 2020s.\n\nHollywood has changed quite a bit over the past century, although some aspects of filmmaking have stayed the same. Knowing more about the industry past and present can help you understand what to expect from an acting career. Take a closer look at Hollywood in the 1920s compared to Hollywood in the 2020s.\n\nFilmmaking Industry: 1920s vs. 2020s\n\nThe filmmaking industry in the 1920s mainly operated as a studio system. Studios took responsibility for producing movies and finding and signing talented artists. While this system helped ensure that actors and other filmmaking artists had steady work available, one of the big drawbacks was less creative control. For example, actors were often expected to do a certain number of films per year that might not appeal to them.\n\nIn the 2020s, Hollywood mainly operates on an agency system. Instead of being tied to a particular studio, actors are free to audition for roles they are interested in from different studios. This provides them with a wider range of possibilities in terms of acting roles. However, this freedom of choice means they also have to keep looking for work since steady roles aren\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nFilm Genres: 1920s vs. 2020s\n\nThe kinds of films that were made in the 1920s vs. today has also changed. In the 1920s, some of the most popular genres were silent comedies, Westerns, talkies (films with sound), and epics. Actors and actresses relied on exaggerated facial and body movements and limited on-screen text to portray the movie\u2019s storyline.\n\nDuring the 2020s, action movies featuring superheroes or other comic book characters have been bringing in audiences at the box office. Other genres that have been common include CG-animated movies, reimagined versions or remakes of nostalgic films, comedies, and sci-fi movies.\n\nTop Actors of the 1920s\n\nDouglas Fairbanks\n\nDouglas Fairbanks; Image Courtesy of LA Times\n\nDouglas Fairbanks starred in several silent films, including The Mask of Zorro and Robin Hood. He was also a founding member of both United Artists and The Motion Picture Academy. His athleticism and amazing stunt skills allowed him to play many iconic Hollywood silent films. However, he struggled to land on roles in early sound films due to deteriorating health and enthusiasm.\n\nCharles Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin; Image Courtesy of Getty Images\n\nCharles Chaplin, more commonly known as Charlie Chaplin, is best known for starring in silent films in the 1920s, such as The Circus and The Kid. His on-screen character, \u201cThe Tramp\u201d, is known as one of the most iconic film characters in history. Chaplin initially avoided starring in films once sound was introduced, but he resumed his acting in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nWilliam Holden, Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd.; Image Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nGloria Swanson, an Academy Award nominated actress, starred in silent films throughout the 1920s and sound films later on, including Sadie Thompson. She was one of the most famous actresses that defined the golden age of Hollywood in the 1920\u2019s. Her most iconic work, Sunset Boulevard, drew many inspirations from her own career switch as a silent to sound film actress.\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nBuster Keaton\u2019s acting career focused mainly on comedy in silent films made during the 1920s, such as The General.. Although he starred in sound films after signing with MGM Studios, his earlier films are considered his best work. He was especially known for his dead-pan comedic styles in silent films and was even named \u201cThe Great Stone Face.\u201d\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nSwedish-American actress Greta Garbo got her start in a 1924 Swedish film before heading to Hollywood. Known as one of the first people to introduce method acting, Garbo embodied the dramatic art form perfectly in her iconic roles. She\u2019s best known for her roles in sound films, such as Mata Hari, Anna Karenina, and Camille.\n\nTop Actors of the 2020s\n\nRobert Downey, Jr.\n\nRobert Downey Jr in Iron Man\n\nEven before his role as Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Robert Downey, Jr was already a successful actor. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won BAFTA for his role in Chaplin. Despite some twists and turns in his personal life, he is still known as one of the most famous actors of the 2020s.\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\nScarlett Johansson in Jojo Rabbit\n\nOscar-nominated actress Scarlett Johansson has been in several notable films since the late 1990s. In more recent years, she\u2019s been starring in the MCU films as Black Widow. She has also won critical acclaim for her roles in movies such as Marriage Story and JoJo Rabbit.\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\nDwayne Johnson in The Fate of the Furious\n\nDwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has come a long way from his role in The Scorpion King. He first started his career as a professional wrestler, then pursued a career in fulfilling acting career. These days, he\u2019s been in some of the Fast and Furious franchise films, as well as the newer Jumanji movies and Moana.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nJennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games\n\nJennifer Lawrence won a few Golden Globes and an Academy Award for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.

Besides being the pioneers, many silent films in the late 1890s and early 1910s feature filming, editing, and acting techniques that were revolutionary and timeless since many actors, directors, editors, and producers still use those technique even today. To know more about this important period in cinema history, here are some details about the silent film era.\n\nBefore the Silent Film Era\n\nBefore the most popular silent movies were made, many inventors struggled in finding ways to record and project moving images on a screen. Historians believed that the first step towards the invention of films and cinema was taken in 1877, when Eadweard Muybridge set up a row of cameras on a horse racetrack and took pictures of one specific horse racer every time he is at the center of each camera. The result of the photos taken was a proto-movie that showed the horse\u2019s movement on the racetrack.\n\nIn 1888, the first short film was created by Louis Le Prince and was titled \u201cRoundhay Garden Scene.\u201d The 2-second short film featured Le Prince\u2019s son, Adolphe, walking around a garden that belonged to his parents-in-law Sarah Whitley and Joseph Whitley, who are also featured in the movie walking around the garden. Another woman was also seen in the film, and she was known as \u201cAnnie Hartley,\u201d who is believed to be Louis Le Prince\u2019s friend. The Roundhay Garden Scene is considered the oldest surviving film.\n\nThe first real motion picture, consequentially serving as the predecessor to silent movies, was known as \u201cWorkers Leaving the Factory\u201d and was directed by Louis Lumi\u00e8re in 1895. There are three versions of the short film that was recorded, and these versions were filmed during different seasons, which meant that Lumi\u00e8re originally intended the film to show how the factory and its workers looking during different seasons of the year.\n\nThe Birth of the Silent Film\n\nThe silent film era started when celluloid film, which allowed faster and more efficient production of images captured using motion picture cameras, became widely available in several countries around the world. The stability in the production of celluloid film was brought by George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, who sought ways to improve the quality and the fast production of photographic dry plates used to stabilize celluloid film for cinemas.\n\nAlthough many historians still debate when the silent movie era actually started, most of them agree that the era began in 1894, right after William Kennedy Dickson received a patent for \u201cmotion picture film\u201d when he was employed by renowned inventor Thomas Edison. Beside William Kennedy Dickson, there were also other producers and directors that filmed their short movies in the same year, like Birt Acres, Etienne-Jules Marey, and Charles-Emile Reynaud.\n\nNotable Styles and Movements of the Silent Film Era\n\nThere were four notable film movements that began during the silent movie era, and these movements are considered to be influential in the current state of modern cinema. The first and most popular movement was Classical Hollywood, which refers to the style of filming that was created in the United States, particularly in Hollywood, California. Classical Hollywood cinema stood the test of time because of its innovation in narrative, as the movies were more story-driven compared to earlier silent films that only feature movements and expressions from the actors as a form of entertainment. In fact, Classical Hollywood remained in the spotlight after the silent movie era, as it survived until the 1960s.\n\nThe second movement was the French Impressionist, which focused more on the stylistic and aesthetic nature of film rather than narrative, although there are some French movies that were narrative-driven. The French Impressionist cinema conveyed most of the film\u2019s stories through visual effects, as many directors following the movement believe that silent movies are more effective in making the audience feel the emotions on the screen through visual art. Unfortunately, because of the birth of the sound film era in the 1930s, the French Impressionist movement slowly faded away from the spotlight since many directed adopted a more story-driven approach to filming that was amplified thanks to the incorporation of sound.\n\nSoviet Montage was the third movement that focused on the editing aspect of the film, as many Soviet directors argue that editing specific parts of the film is essential in creating a cohesive story or narrative. This movement is considered to be one of the most influential in modern cinema, as they have revolutionized how film should be edited, as many silent film directors during the era were not believers in the art of editing, which was considered tedious and time-consuming. However, the narrative styles of Soviet Montage and Classical Hollywood were vastly different, as Soviet Montage focuses more on the \u201cstory of the masses\u201d while Classical Hollywood has a more individualistic approach in storytelling. Soviet montage might include larger sets with aircraft models and other props.\n\nThe fourth movement was German Expressionism that featured similar but more exaggerated approach to film to French impressionism. Like the latter, German Expressionism focused on adding \u201cvisual art\u201d to films, although the art used were more distorted than French Expressionism that each scene would look \u201csurreal.\u201d As such, the background of many German films feature distorted buildings, painting, and structures, and some scenes even feature strange dances that convey emotions for the actors.\n\nSound in Silent Films\n\nDespite being called \u201csilent\u201d films, some movies that were produced in that era weren\u2019t actually meant to be entirely silent, as the films would sometimes feature music, although the music is played live by an artist, a band, or an orchestra. In addition, the live music would often follow what is happening on the screen. So, if there is someone hitting a person with a stick, a sound would be produced by one or two instruments. Furthermore, some musicians would even mimic sounds of items, vehicles, and contraptions used in particular scenes of the movie.\n\nEnd of the Silent Movie Era\n\nThe silent movie era started to come to and end and led to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Putting sound in films has already been experimented even before the beginning of the silent movie era. However, creating a film with sound was proven to be difficult, as the equipment needed to provide sound for films in the cinema were proven to be too expensive for most theatres. It is not until 1927, when Warner Bros revolutionize the industry after producing the Vitaphone, a sound-on-disc technology that was more advanced and much cheaper than any sound formats or systems during that time. The Vitaphone was first used in the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, which is considered as the first commercially successful movie with sound. Following the success of the film, many film studios began competing as to who can produce the most successful sound film in the 1930s, thus leading to the abandonment of silent films. Its hard to believe this where it all started when today we have the ability to do real time video on YouTube with amazing effects and heavily CGI based films."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls051374072/", "page_content": "76 min | Comedy\n\nAn unimpressive but well intending man is given the chance to marry a popular actress, of whom he has been a hopeless fan.

It was a vitally important period in film history, both for the artistry of the films it produced and for the societal impact of the various institutions that developed to produce and display those films. Numerous films from the silent era are regarded as landmarks of world cinema, just as some of the stars and filmmakers that dominated the period remain among the most beloved and influential in film history. Despite the era\u2019s vitality, for decades many scholars took a primitivist view of all but its latest films, regarding the bulk of the silent years mainly as the period of the cinema\u2019s nascence. An evolutionary reading of film history often prevailed, one that saw interest or merit primarily in those aspects of silent film artistry and production that directly anticipated later cinematic developments. Beginning in the 1980s, a new generation of scholars came to fundamentally question this approach and began to see silent film as part of a distinct historical moment worthy of attention in its own right and less as a series of progressive steps on a predefined evolutionary ladder. One impact of this reevaluation has been the periodization of silent cinema into a series of distinct historical stages, each with its own prevailing stylistic features and reigning social dynamics. The details of such periodization can vary significantly between scholars, but one overarching effect is that the term \u201csilent film\u201d has become less frequently used by academic film historians as a viable catchall, given the term\u2019s potential to elide significant differences across cinema\u2019s first decades. Yet the study of filmmaking across the whole of the silent era, or substantial parts thereof, remains an important facet of film scholarship, and in these contexts the idea of a transhistorical silent cinema is still regularly employed. This article looks at those studies that take a broad view of the silent era, both those that predate the trend toward reperiodization and those more contemporary studies that look across a substantial portion of the three and a half decades of the silent years and encompass multiple historical and stylistic periods. In so doing, it aims to offer a starting point for readers wishing to better understand the rich world of filmmaking that existed before sound.\n\nGeneral Overviews\n\nGiven the general academic consensus around the periodization of silent film into a series of distinctive stages as described in the Introduction, the kind of broad, single-author overviews spanning the whole of the silent era that once marked film scholarship have become relatively rare. (Far more common are anthologies and edited collections that bring together work by specialists in different temporal periods of silent film, as detailed in Anthologies, Essay Collections, and Journals.) Still, readers who are new to the study of silent film and looking for a place to start can find some useful titles, both new and old. Kobel 2007 offers what is arguably the most thorough overview of the silent era written since the 1990s; aimed at the general reader, the book is meticulously designed and illustrated with more than four hundred images from the Library of Congress. Robb 2010 provides a more concise introduction intended largely for students and can serve as a useful jumping off point for further study. Everson 1978, which focuses on the silent film in America only, also provides useful introductory material, although readers should be aware that Everson\u2019s views on the evolution of silent film have been thoroughly revised by later scholars. Predating Everson, Brownlow 1968 was at one point the most prominent and important text on the history of silent film, arguing for its value and artistry at a moment when many still viewed the silent cinema as archaic. It remains useful for the sheer volume of original interview material that it includes, although Brownlow\u2019s hagiographic work, like Everson\u2019s evolutionary view, has been largely supplanted by later historicist and neoformalist approaches to film studies. More personal reflection than scholarly history, Card 1994 presents a loving look at the era of silent film by an archivist and film collector who dedicated much of his life and career to preserving the works of that era, many of which he first saw as an adolescent during the 1920s. Usai 2000 shares with Card a dual focus on film history and film preservation as it relates to the study of the silent era. For readers who wish to understand the way that academic film historians since the 1980s have come to divide silent era filmmaking into multiple historical and stylistic periods, Thompson 1985 offers a useful point of entry. Those readers looking for a more informally presented but still rigorous introduction to silent film should consult The Bioscope, a blog on silent film research and appreciation containing fourteen hundred entries searchable by topic and theme. Interested readers are also urged to visit other complementary articles within Oxford Bibliographies that provide further detail on specific topics and time periods that fall under the general rubric of \u201cSilent Film.\u201d These include the entry on \u201cAmerican Cinema, 1895\u20131915\u201d and entries on various national cinemas, and the numerous entries on individual stars, directors, and films of the silent era from around the world."}, {"url": "https://movingimage.us/collection/the-silent-film-era/", "page_content": "It is generally said to have begun in 1894, as the first paying customers lined up at a Kinetoscope Parlor showing films made by Thomas Edison near the corner of Broadway and 27th Street in Manhattan, and was certainly over by 1931, when the last of Hollywood's silent features were released by Paramount and United Artists.\n\nOnly later would those years be thought of as \"the silent film era,\" and sectioned off as a sort of prelude to the real movies that would follow. But the idea that their favorite new medium might be lacking in something essential had never occurred to audiences of the time. And the businessmen (and artists) who had created this industry were too busy enjoying their newfound fame and fortune to even dream of that sort of a change. As Harry Warner famously said, \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\"\n\nThat was Warner's response to AT&T's offer to go in with them on a talking picture system. An experienced showman, he knew the sorry history of this concept, which one inventor or another was always touting as the next new thing in motion pictures. He also knew the amount of money that had been wasted on such gadgets. And he was right: there was no demand to hear actors speaking from the screen. But Warner saw something else, and did agree to help develop sound films, whose canned musical accompaniments could save the theater-owning brothers a fortune in weekly musicians' salaries. As with many technological innovations\u2014 including the internet\u2014the real benefits only became apparent after the system was already in place. And so the notion of a \"silent film era\" was born.\n\n***\n\nThe cinema is both an art and an industry, a curious mix of culture and technology that generations of critics and historians have puzzled over. The art part exists only on screen. By the 1930s a few museums and private collectors had already begun to collect prints of individual film titles, assessing their curatorial value through a range of ad hoc criteria. But the first museum to display its own collection of motion picture artifacts was the Smithsonian Institution, whose Graphic Arts Department began exhibiting film projectors and pre-cinema apparatus in 1897. A few others followed suit, sometimes putting their motion picture materials in the \"useful arts\" wing, sometimes the technology room, and occasionally even giving them a corner in the photography collection.\n\nHenri Langlois, one of the first film archivists, began to collect motion picture prints in the early 1930s, when he realized that silent films, now economically obsolete, were doomed. Langlois devoted his life to saving silent films, but he soon found himself saving every other film, too. Unlike rival archivists in New York or London, Langlois's criteria were not merely aesthetic, but cultural. He realized that cinema was not simply the part of the show that came in a can, but a complex web of economic, cultural, and technological factors which necessarily involved commerce and industry as well as art. Langlois ultimately tried to have it all, operating both an archive of films (cinematheque) and, for interpretive context, a mus\u00e9e du cinema. A radical policy for any film archive, it meant diverting scarce resources away from film prints in order to collect costumes and posters, movie cameras and theater programs.\n\nAlthough some supporters criticized this broad-based approach, few historians today would write a history of motion pictures without offering a clear understanding of their cultural and industrial context. Motion picture materials can now be found in dozens of collections all over the world, from theater libraries to science museums. Still, very few have the range of resources, from moviolas to fan magazines, to adequately document the complex role such materials have played in the development of moving image media.\n\n***\n\nAn earlier generation of historians, steeped in technological determinism, saw the coming of sound as a watershed, a step in the drive towards \"realism\" that would make everything that came before it suddenly irrelevant. Talkies did affect one corner of the marketplace, of course, as all those unemployed musicians could testify. But this was evolution, not revolution, and certainly no reason to banish the silent film to some cinematic dark age. As demonstrated by historians from Andr\u00e9 Bazin to David Bordwell, the introduction of sound was a speed bump, not an apocalypse. The grammar of film\u2014how the camera addresses its subject, and how editors cut shots together\u2014quickly returned to the classic style developed in the 1920s. No Hollywood studios went out of business. The same 35mm film went through the same film projectors (now with added sound heads), while audiences read the same film magazines and attended the same local theaters.\n\nDuring those few \"silent\" decades, Edison's invention had developed from a mechanical curiosity to a major international industry, and became\u2014as D. W. Griffith once boasted\u2014the only new art form created since antiquity. No primitive backwater, the years from 1894 to 1931 must have impressed both filmmakers and audiences as an unending stream of innovation and experimentation. Later years may have been dominated by Technicolor and television, but audiences of the 1920s would have wondered just why improvements like these took so long to catch on\u2014since both were already part of the creative mix long before The Jazz Singer (1927).\n\nSo while the advertising materials, home movie cameras, film costumes, and licensed merchandise shown here may differ in style from their modern equivalents, the important thing to remember is that their functions remain identical\u2014even in a digital age undreamed of by Harry Warner."}]}
