The project was completed in 2014, but following the 2012-13 season, the team\u2019s lease expired and both sides got into a long protracted dispute. The result was the Pirates suing the trustees for breach of contract, forcing the team to play the entire 2013-14 season at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\nCain became majority owner in Dec. 2013 and worked out a new five-year lease agreement with the trustees less than a month later. Former managing owner/CEO Brian Petrovek, now President of the ECHL Adirondack Thunder, was replaced by Church, who was named Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThe Pirates recently completed the second year of the five-year lease agreement as Cain approached the trustees a few weeks ago about making changes to the lease agreement as an attempt to reduce operating cost. There were discussions about the Panthers purchasing the Pirates in order to keep them in Portland, but no deal could be reached.\n\nThe departure of the Pirates, including the $100,000 exit fee, left many questions about future of the CIA including Portland\u2019s mayor Ethan Strimling.\n\nThe Pirates move to Springfield was paved by the Springfield Falcons, who were sold last month to the NHL\u2019s Arizona Coyotes with the intent on relocating the team to Tucson, AZ for next season.\n\nThe AHL Board of Governors met on Tuesday to give conditional approval to the sale and relocation. The board also reviewed the sale of the Pirates and a vote on the sale and relocation is expected in the next two weeks.\n\nThe Pirates won its only Calder Cup championship during the team\u2019s first season in Portland. The excitement of that season culminated with an estimated 15,000 people gathering in Portland for a ticker tape parade.\n\nChurch spent six seasons as a player for the Pirates (1996-2002) and was inducted into the Pirates\u2019 Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nThe new team would retain the Pirates name, and incorporate aspects of the original and current logo include mascot\u2019s Salty Pete and Crackers.\n\nThe ECHL, formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League until it absorbed several teams from West Coast Hockey League in 2003, has 28 teams spanning from New Hampshire to Alaska and Florida to Idaho.\n\nThe league, which is one level below the AHL, plays a 72-game regular season schedule beginning in late October and ending in April. The playoffs last through the month of May.\n\nTeams in the ECHL do not have a direct affiliation with NHL teams compared to the AHL where the Pirates were affiliated with the Florida Panthers. An ECHL franchise typically will receive five or six players from an NHL club, allowing for more control over its roster by signing unrestricted free agents.\n\nIt\u2019s cheaper to operate an ECHL franchise compared to the AHL. Unlike the AHL, there is no affiliation fee in the ECHL, and they have limits on roster size and operate under a strict salary cap.\n\nTravel is also compared to this past season after losing Manchester, Worcester, and Glens Falls as part of the new AHL Pacific Division. Last season, five AHL teams relocated from the northeast to California as western-based NHL clubs moved their affiliates closer to home.\n\nManchester recently completed its first season in the ECHL, while Worcester is slated begin in the fall of 2017.\n\nLower operating cost should help drive attendance as they plan to reduce ticket prices and include pricing options for children and seniors.\n\nBefore the puck can even drop in Oct. 2017. The new ownership group still need to apply for an expansion franchise or purchase an existing franchise that will be relocated to Portland. The group also need to reach a lease agreement with the trustees."}, {"url": "https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/particle-dynamics-announces-sale-to-new-ownership-group-led-by-broadoak-capital-partners/", "page_content": "Leveraging the industry expertise and capital of its new ownership group, Particle Dynamics, a global leader in particle processing with a fully integrated product portfolio, prepares for its next phase of growth in the global healthcare industry.\n\nST.

Petrovek came to Maine as one of the new owners of the Portland Pirates hockey team in 2000, and Pratt joined the board of the Cumberland County Civic Center, where the Pirates play home games, two years later. Pratt is now chairman of the board.\n\nAdditional Photos Brian Petrovek Neal Pratt\n\nTheir professional relationship has long been contentious, although the two say they like and respect each other personally. Before the latest dispute, the civic center board of trustees and the Pirates last faced off in 2010, when there were public charges of foot-dragging and overreaching in negotiations and threats to pull the team from Portland and move to Albany, N.Y.\n\nBut the latest scuffle may represent a high-water mark of brinksmanship, culminating with the two sides in court over a disputed lease agreement that would keep the Pirates at the arena for five more years.\n\nThe outcome of the court battle could determine how much longer the Pirates will keep \u201cPortland\u201d as part of the team name.\n\nPetrovek, the fiery, intense managing owner of the American Hockey League team, is suing the civic center trustees to enforce the terms of an April agreement on the basic terms for a five-year lease to play in the newly renovated arena \u2014 a goal of the team since the current owners bought the franchise 13 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they cannot reach an agreement on how to split revenues and expenses, Petrovek has indicated the team could leave Portland altogether.\n\nPratt, a buttoned-down corporate lawyer, scoffs at the lawsuit, suggesting it\u2019s ridiculous to expect a court will uphold as valid a lease outline that has not been signed by either party.\n\nCivic center officials would like to keep a team that will play three dozen or more home games a year in the arena, where the $34 million renovation will wrap up in about four months. But they also point out that they might be able to make more money booking concerts, trade shows and touring ice shows on those dates.\n\nPETROVEK: EX-GOALIE, DETERMINED\n\nPetrovek, 58, admits to being a workaholic who isn\u2019t easy to work for. His intense preparation and long hours date back to his hockey-playing days.\n\nHe was a standout goalie in prep school and went on to Harvard, where he became an all-American. He was named the most valuable player of the 1977 Beanpot tournament, when the Crimson defeated a Boston University team that would go on to win the national championship the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPetrovek said being a goalie appealed to him because it\u2019s the position where the player is essentially the coach on the rink.\n\n\u201cThe goalie is the only player on the ice who can play the entire game, and I like the part that you\u2019re the hero or the goat, the last line of defense and the player who can quarterback the game,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was good enough to be drafted by the Los Angeles Kings, an NHL team, but was disappointed when he was assigned to the AHL affiliate after training camp.\n\n\u201cMy expectations were a little different, so I figured I would take advantage of my prep school education and my Harvard education\u201d and move into the business side of the sport, he said.\n\nAfter earning a master\u2019s in education at Harvard while also serving as an assistant coach on the team, Petrovek became the assistant commissioner of the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference. He then worked for a Boston marketing firm while also running a summer hockey camp in the Berkshires. The NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils then hired him, first to run their AHL affiliate in Utica, N.Y., and then to become vice president of marketing for the parent team.\n\nAfter that, he helped head USA Hockey \u2014 which oversees the national team that plays in the Olympics \u2014 until Lyman Bullard, a teammate from Harvard who went on to became one of the nation\u2019s top sports lawyers, asked Petrovek to help him buy a hockey franchise \u2014 the Portland Pirates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Petrovek\u2019s career seems like an unbroken string of successes, he has had public setbacks. Last December, he was arrested and charged with operating under the influence in downtown Portland after a game. He pleaded guilty and said publicly that the arrest marked a \u201cturning point\u201d for him.\n\nBullard said he has always been impressed by Petrovek\u2019s determination to do what was necessary to get the job done, a trait that was legendary back in his playing days.\n\n\u201cHe was, in high school and in college, the most meticulously prepared athlete I\u2019ve ever known. He would study opponents, study shooters, study tendencies and take notes,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cHe was just an unbelievably focused guy. You did not want to talk to him in the locker room before a game.\u201d\n\nPetrovek said that\u2019s his personality. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I was as an athlete and I\u2019m that way as an executive,\u201d he said. \u201cThat oftentimes means working more at it and harder at it. If somebody interprets that as (being) a workaholic, so be it.\u201d\n\nHe remains that way even among family, said his brother-in-law, Bill Leblond, whose sister, Sara, started dating Petrovek at Harvard. The two were married a few years after graduating.\n\nAt family gatherings, Leblond said, Petrovek always seems preoccupied by what he has to do the next day for the Pirates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd when I see him at a game, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s working,\u201d Leblond said.\n\nLeblond played against Petrovek at BU and remembers scoring on him at the 1978 Beanpot. The two don\u2019t reminisce about their college careers like others might expect, Leblond said, but an attitude that others might see as aloof he attributes to shyness.\n\nPRATT: RENOVATION LEADER, COACH\n\nPratt, by contrast, has a lawyer\u2019s knack for talking and relating to people.\n\nPratt\u2019s game was baseball, and he said he considered himself a good player while growing up in Bangor. But when he got to the University of Maine, the team was flying high and stocked with talented players, including a few who went on to major league careers.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, the coach thought that Billy Swift and others should play ahead of me,\u201d joked Pratt, who was relegated to the practice team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPratt, 51, earned a law degree in New Hampshire and came to Portland to practice after working as a staffer for U.S. Sen. George Mitchell.\n\nHe ran for Cumberland County district attorney in 1998 and lost, but formed a deep friendship during the campaign with Peter Feeney, his campaign manager, who was a Cumberland County commissioner at the time.\n\nFeeney died at age 25 \u2014 a cause was never determined \u2014 as he was preparing to have Pratt named to the civic center board. Feeney\u2019s father, Dick Feeney, was appointed to his son\u2019s seat and nominated Pratt for the board seat.\n\nPratt said he recognized that the arena was in desperate need of a renovation and made that his goal. He devoted years to planning the scope of the work, getting a $34 million bond passed to finance the renovations and seeing the work get under way.\n\nOutside of his legal work and the civic center, his focus was to help his son\u2019s Scarborough Little League team. Although the team turned out to be very good \u2014 the same core group played together for three years and won the state title in 2012 \u2014 Pratt said winning wasn\u2019t his primary goal.\n\nHis proudest moment, the one he calls his personal definition of success, came at the New England regional tournament, where the winning team goes on to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. He watched his team rally around the pitcher, who had just walked in the winning run, costing the team a trip to Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe may not have had the most talented players, but in terms of playing together as a team, I don\u2019t think there was anybody better,\u201d he said.\n\nBOTH THINK ABOUT MOVING ON\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what will happen to either man after the court battle is eventually resolved. Both Pratt and Petrovek hinted they each may soon be ready to move on from the civic center and Pirates, respectively.\n\nPratt said his current term ends in December, weeks before the civic center is scheduled to reopen.\n\nThere would be a certain symmetry, he said, to stepping down when the job that confronted him when he first joined the board wraps up.\n\nPratt said he\u2019s devoted to making sure the civic center is used to its fullest and makes enough money to pay off the bond that voters passed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was raised that if you commit to something, you commit to it 100 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrovek said his goal is to create a sustainable team that will turn a profit, which it is forecast to do in 2014-15 \u2014 assuming the team is still playing in the civic center.\n\n\u201cI came here to get something done,\u201d he said.\n\nEdward D.
