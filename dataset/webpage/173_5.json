I have also been approached to consider running for mayor of White Rock and I am meeting with my family this week to see whether or not there\u2019s some type of agreement on that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, it\u2019s somewhat up in the air \u2013 all of it\u2019s up in the air right now.\u201d\n\nBACK in 2017, Hogg was selected as the federal Liberal candidate in a by-election in South Surrey\u2014White Rock when incumbent Conservative MP Dianne Watts \u2014 who founded Surrey First in 2007 \u2014 resigned. Hogg defeated Conservative candidate Kerry-Lynne Findlay, but lost to her in the 2019 federal election. He lost to her again in 2021.\n\nIn an interview with The VOICE in 2017, he pointed out that he was on White Rock Council first as a Councillor for 10 years and then as the mayor for another 10 years.\n\nHe then became an MLA from the riding of Surrey-White Rock in a 1997 by-election. He was re-elected in 2001, 2005, 2009, and again in 2013.\n\nHe held several portfolios as MLA including Minister of Children and Family Development, Parliamentary Secretary for Youth Sport to the Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development, Parliamentary Secretary for Social Entrepreneurship to the Minister of Finance, Minister of State for Mining, and Minister of State for ActNow BC.

In 2017, he ran with the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected as the MP for South Surrey-White Rock. He ran again in 2019 and 2021, both times losing to Conservative Kerry-Lynne Findlay.\n\nLinda Annis, the only city councillor currently representing the party founded by former mayor Dianne Watts, introduced Hogg at the launch event and in an accompanying statement. She touted his roots in the community and described him as a person of honesty and integrity, something she said would be a \"refreshing change\" at city hall.\n\nHogg took more direct shots at current Mayor Doug McCallum.\n\n\"When it comes to the election in October, the question for Surrey voters is clear: have you had enough yet, and do you believe we can do better, together?\u201d Hogg write in a statement.\n\n\"Over the past four years Surrey residents have had a tough go of it as they witnessed one man\u2019s destructive my-way-or-the-highway approach to governing.\"\n\nThe current mayor and his slate of councilors with the Safe Surrey Coalition have made a number of moves that have been slammed by critics \u2013 Annis among them \u2013 as undemocratic. Those have included a controversial bylaw on signs, abrupt ends to meetings and shutting down debate, and an attempt to suspend all new ethics complaints until after the 2022 election.\n\nBut the move to prohibit seven citizens from attending meetings was by far the most inflammatory. McCallum reversed the ban after it was challenged in court.\n\n\"When Surrey residents were banned from city hall by the mayor it made news right across the country, because that\u2019s what you expect from politicians who have given up on democracy. We cannot let that ever happen again,\u201d Hogg said, adding that part of his platform is \"giving city hall back to the people.\"\n\nMcCallum is also facing a criminal charge of public mischief, something Hogg reminds prospective voters on in his announcement.\n\nMany of these controversies can be traced back to disagreement over the move to replace the RCMP with a municipal police force.\n\nHogg describes the transition as \"divisive,\" over-budget, and behind schedule \u2013 pledging to hold a referendum on the well-underway establishment of the Surrey Police Service.\n\n\u201cWe will give people all the facts about costs so far and what it will cost to carry on, then let Surrey residents decide who will police their city,\" Hogg writes.\n\nIn addition to Annis, Hogg announced two other candidates running for council on the slate -- Bilal Cheema and Mary-Em Waddington.

He was a breath of fresh air in what was otherwise a stuffy banking community. He gave people ideas and left them to work out solutions. He gave young people a huge amount of freedom, recalled one former colleague.\n\nHe created a workforce that was multicultural and provided opportunity to anyone willing to work hard.\n\nHe had been the BNZ's man in London when he was called upon to investigate the new technology of the day \u2013 computerisation \u2013 as a way of future-proofing the bank at a time when there was a need to replace old ledger machines in order to cope with the decimalisation of the currency due to take place in 1967.\n\nHogg visited 40 English and American banks that he considered to have operations that were similar to the BNZ.\n\nWhile banks had computerised their systems, they lacked any interbank integration and it was here Hogg identified an opportunity: to share electronic data-processing among all New Zealand banks. Such a facility would generate daily ledgers for each branch and bank and provide savings on staffing and time across the entire industry.\n\nThe creation of a consortium was in part due to practicality. Back in the 1960s, a computer system would take up enormous amounts of space and by coming together, banks could share the load.\n\nThis co-operation was no mean feat in an industry where the banks were fiercely competitive.\n\nHogg was behind research in microchips, electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (Eftpos) and cash-dispensing machines and paved the way for New Zealand to become the first country in the world to have a nationally integrated automatic teller machine (ATM) network that connected all its trading banks.\n\nOverseas bankers who had heard Hogg speak at conferences or simply got to know him through banking channels wanted to emulate what Databank was doing, such was its success.\n\nHe was regarded as a man who inspired loyalty, inspiration and camaraderie amongst Databank employees. Former colleagues say his biggest achievement was the development of the large number of people that passed through Databank, providing skills to New Zealand and overseas.\n\nBut he was not without his detractors.\n\nHe had a fractious relationship with the Databank board, sparked in part by the innovations he introduced and his desire for banking novelty. Hogg saw Databank as a vehicle for income while the shareholding banks only wanted a co-operative clearing house for cheques and preferred Hogg to concentrate on banking services.\n\nOver many years he thwarted attempts to bring him to heel and with the company making a profit it would not be till 1988 that Hogg finally left the company.\n\nHogg's style was legendary. His office was opulent, to say the least, with a sauna, bar, private dining room and floor to ceiling marble.\n\nHe liked a celebration. A former PA recalled how Hogg was decidedly grumpy the day he turned 40 but broke out the good stuff when his staff hit that particular milestone.\n\nHogg was born in Nelson. He and his younger sister were raised by their father, a police constable, and their mother, a housewife.\n\nHe was dux of Nelson College and excelled at sport, winning the New Zealand secondary school 100-yard sprint and the lightweight boxing championship. He played rugby for Nelson province and once subbed for an All Blacks game.\n\nHe went straight into a trainee executive position at the BNZ from school, later taking accountancy papers at Victoria University. After a few stints as branch manager in Napier and New Plymouth he was dispatched to London where he was primarily tasked with learning about computerisation in the banking industry.\n\nWhile in the United Kingdom he met and married his first wife, Pamela Hardenberg, with whom he had a son and a daughter.\n\nThe marriage later ended and he married Genevie, whom he had met on a blind date. Together they had two sons.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, four children, 12 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.\n\nSources: Andrew Cardow and William Wilson (Massey University), Hogg family, Peter Montague, Malcolm Shaw.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said Hogg died in 2017, rather than 2018."}, {"url": "https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/gordie-hogg-announces-run-for-surrey-mayors-chair/", "page_content": "Surrey First announced Wednesday its mayoral and council candidates for this fall\u2019s municipal election: (left to right) Mary-Em Waddington, Gordie Hogg \u2013 who will run for mayor \u2013 Linda Annis and Bilal Cheema.

Also announced were three Surrey First council candidates \u2013 incumbent Linda Annis, plus two new faces, Bilal Cheema and Mary-Em Waddington.\n\nIn a press release issued Wednesday, Annis said Hogg \u201cwill be a breath of fresh air at city hall because he always listens, and his reputation for honesty and integrity will be a refreshing change, which means Surrey voters will always be welcome at their city hall.\u201d\n\nHogg also noted that Surrey residents\u2019 ability to access city hall needs improvement, and pitched a few ideas to make that possible \u2013 from expanded operating hours in city departments to holding council meetings throughout the city, rather than solely at city hall.\n\n\u201cI think we need to open things up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big city, and there are opportunities for all kinds of questions to be asked, and that\u2019s been prohibited in the last little while.\u201d\n\nOver the last few decades, Hogg, 75, has been a politician at all levels of government. He served as a White Rock city councillor from 1974 until 1984, then was mayor from \u201984 until 1993. Moving on from the municipal arena, he was elected as a BC Liberal MLA in the Surrey-White Rock riding in 1997 and was re-elected four times before retiring from provincial politics in 2013.\n\nHe was subsequently elected Liberal MP for White Rock\u2013South Surrey in 2017 in a byelection prompted by the resignation of sitting Conservative MP Dianne Watts \u2013 herself a former Surrey mayor \u2013 but Hogg lost the seat in 2019 to Conservative challenger Kerry-Lynne Findlay, who also won a rematch during last year\u2019s federal election of 2021.\n\nEarlier this spring, Hogg told PAN he was mulling a mayor\u2019s run in either Surrey or White Rock.\n\nHogg is the fifth candidate to announce a Surrey mayoralty run. Current Mayor Doug McCallum has said he plans to run for re-election, while current councillor Brenda Locke, Surrey MLA Jinny Sims, and Surrey MP Sukh Dhaliwal \u2013 who announced his candidacy and his new slate, United Surrey, Monday \u2013 are also running for the city\u2019s top political seat.\n\nDespite so many experienced, well-known politicians running, Hogg said he wasn\u2019t concerned with vote-splitting or with the idea that, potentially, candidates could have similar platforms.\n\n\u201cMy perspective is that the people of Surrey deserve a number of different visions and options to choose from,\u2019 Hogg said. \u201cPeople running for mayor and for council should be challenged, and should have to explain what their vision is\u2026 Access, opportunity, the police transition \u2013 people should be able to challenge each one of us on these issues, and then decide what works best for them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how democracies are most effective.\u201d\n\n\n\neditorial@peacearchnews.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nBC municipal electionCity of SurreyMayor's Race"}, {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/hogg-announces-retirement-6673607.html", "page_content": "A ustralian spinner Brad Hogg has announced he will retire from international cricket at the end of the CB Series next week.\n\nThe 37-year-old has played 121 one-day internationals and seven Test matches since making his debut in 1996, and was part of Australia's triumphant World Cup sides in 2003 and 2007.\n\n\"My career started against India and I thought if I can play Test cricket against India that would be fantastic,\" he said. \"I wanted to fight to get back in there and I did it and I achieved what I wanted to achieve.\"\n\nWith Shane Warne's success, Hogg found his Test appearances limited and the spinner admitted he had thought about ending his international career after last year's World Cup but reconsidered after Warne's retirement\n\nThe 37-year-old becomes the third Australian in the past month to leave the international arena, joining Adam Gilchrist and Shaun Tait.\n\nHogg's retirement poses a real problem for Australia as they are now left without a recognised Test spin bowler with Stuart MacGill still to make a successful comeback from hand surgery late last year."}, {"url": "https://planetradio.co.uk/greatest-hits/borders/news/rugby-stuart-hogg-retirement-world-cup-hawick/", "page_content": "Stuart Hogg announces retirement from professional rugby\n\nAuthor: Ally McGilvray Published 27th Mar 2023\n\nLast updated 27th Mar 2023\n\nScotland star Stuart Hogg has announced his retirement from professional rugby.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who plays for Exeter Chiefs in the English Premiership, has revealed on social media he'll be hanging up his boots after the Rugby World Cup in France in September.\n\nHe said: \"As a young kid growing up in the Borders, all I wanted to do was play rugby for Scotland.

By far the biggest and most consequential retirement announcement came in early April, as Speaker Paul Ryan told his colleagues he would not seek reelection to his House seat.\n\nFar more Republicans are leaving Congress voluntarily than Democrats, putting the party\u2019s control of the chamber in jeopardy. Several veteran Republican lawmakers in competitive districts are calling it quits, depriving the GOP of the advantage of incumbency in races that could determine control of the House in 2019.\n\nAt the same time, a wave of allegations of sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior has scrambled the retirement picture in both parties, forcing several lawmakers to leave Congress early. Republican Representatives Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania and Joe Barton of Texas, and Democratic Representative Ruben Kihuen of Nevada abandoned reelection campaigns after misconduct allegations. Scandals already forced the immediate resignations of Democratic Senator Al Franken and long-serving Representative John Conyers, as well as GOP Representatives Trent Franks and Tim Murphy. Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas first announced he would forgo his reelection bid after acknowledging he agreed to a taxpayer-funded harassment settlement with a former staffer. But in early April, he resigned from Congress altogether.\n\nAs for those getting out in 2018, Trump\u2019s low approval rating and Congress\u2019s meager legislative output may be contributing to the decisions of some Republicans to retire, including moderate Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, and Dave Reichert of Washington state. But there are other factors at play. Unlike Democrats, Republicans have rules limiting the terms of their committee chairmen to ensure turnover and give younger members a chance to advance in the House. Congress isn\u2019t as fun with less power, and six of the departing GOP committee leaders would be forced out of their roles and to the back bench in 2019.\n\nSome Republicans untainted by scandal aren\u2019t even finishing out their terms. Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio left office in January to take a job with the Ohio Business Roundtable, and Dent announced in April that he would resign within a few weeks, having apparently determined that with the campaign season approaching, Congress wasn\u2019t likely to get much more done this year. Meehan resigned on April 27 after earlier announcing plans to retire at the end of his term. Meehan wanted to short-circuit an investigation by the House Ethics Committee into allegations of inappropriate behavior towards a staff member, and he said he was repaying the government $39,000 for money used to settle the harassment case.\n\nThe trend to this point gives a distinct edge to the Democrats. While roughly the same number of lawmakers in both parties are leaving their seats to run for higher office, just 11 House Democrats are retiring outright or have already resigned, compared with 28 Republicans. (House members running for other offices often count as retirements, because it\u2019s usually impractical or illegal to run for multiple positions at the same time.)\n\nAnd although Democrats must defend far more Senate seats than Republicans in 2018\u2014including several in states that Trump won\u2014all of the party\u2019s incumbents are currently running for reelection. The retirements of Corker and Flake, along with a Democratic victory in December\u2019s special election in Alabama, give Democrats an outside chance at retaking the Senate majority. In the House, they\u2019ll need to pick up a net 23 seats.\n\nData sources: Each district\u2019s presidential-election results are from the Daily Kos. House and Senate election results are from the Associated Press.\n\nSenate Republicans Retiring Outright\n\nBob Corker, Tennessee\n\n2016 presidential election: +26.15 Trump\n\n2012 Senate election: +34.6 Corker\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opted against running for a third term and promptly intensified his criticism of the president, whom he had praised during the election. Trump alleged that Corker \u201cbegged\u201d for his endorsement, while Corker said it was Trump who urged him to run again.\n\nJeff Flake, Arizona\n\n2016 presidential election: +3.57 Trump\n\n2012 Senate election: +3.9 Flake\n\nHe decided to leave after a single term rather than wage what would have been a brutal fight for reelection, first in a primary against a hard-right Trump backer, Kelli Ward, and then, if he won, against a centrist Democrat, Representative Kyrsten Sinema, in the general election. Flake had lost his base in Arizona: His criticism of Trump in his recent book, Conscience of a Conservative, alienated the president\u2019s GOP backers, while his conservative voting record put off Democrats.\n\nOrrin Hatch, Utah\n\n2016 presidential election: +17.9 Trump over Hillary Clinton; +23.8 Trump over Evan McMullin\n\n2012 Senate election: +35 Hatch\n\nThe 83-year-old incumbent announced in a video message in early January that he will not seek reelection next year, creating an opening for a possible Senate bid by Mitt Romney. With seven terms under his belt, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. He also serves as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThad Cochran, Mississippi\n\n2016 presidential election: +17.83 Trump\n\n2014 Senate election: +20.8 Cochran\n\nCochran, 80, announced he would resign from the Senate on April 1 due to his declining health, ending a 40-year tenure. His retirement will set off a special election in November. Republicans should be heavily favored to hold the seat, but they are wary of a divisive primary that could open the door for Democrats.\n\nSenate Democrats Retiring Outright\n\nAl Franken, Minnesota\n\n2016 presidential election: +1.5 Clinton\n\n2014 Senate election: +10.24 Franken\n\nUnder pressure from fellow Democrats, Franken announced in December he would resign \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d after multiple women came forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual behavior. Most of the allegations involved Franken groping women while taking a photo. His resignation means there will be a special Senate election in 2018 in a state that Hillary Clinton barely carried in 2016.\n\nHouse Republicans Retiring Outright\n\nPaul Ryan, Wisconsin 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +10.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +34.77 Ryan\n\nNo retirement announcement in either party was more consequential than Ryan\u2019s, in April. But it was not altogether surprising: The House speaker had been rumored to be considering an exit for months and had delayed filing for reelection. His departure is a huge blow to Republicans, and it could cost them a seat, as Democrats were already making a run at Ryan\u2019s district.\n\nSteve Helber / AP\n\nBob Goodlatte, Virginia 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +24.8 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +33.56 Goodlatte\n\nGoodlatte was nearing the end of his third and final term as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, where he aligned with conservative hard-liners on immigration and voting rights. He advanced bipartisan legislation on criminal-justice reform, but it never reached the House floor.\n\nJeb Hensarling, Texas 5th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +28.4 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +61.21 Hensarling\n\nHensarling left the House leadership team in 2013 to head up the Financial Services Committee, and he passed up opportunities to make a conservative bid for speaker. His chairmanship will end because of term limits, but it was also marked by frustration: Hensarling\u2019s proposals to wind down federal mortgage-lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as his overhaul of the federal flood-insurance program, proved too conservative to pass the full House.\n\nRodney Frelinghuysen, New Jersey 11th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +0.9 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +19.15 Frelinghuysen\n\nFrelinghuysen arrived in Washington with the Republican wave of 1994 and only reached the pinnacle of his career in 2017, when he became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. But he has faced criticism from conservatives for voting against major GOP legislation, and he was facing the race of his life this fall in a highly competitive district. His retirement gives Democrats a seat they should pick up if they\u2019re going to reclaim the majority.\n\nTrey Gowdy, South Carolina 4th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +25.7 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +36.21 Gowdy\n\nDespite rising quickly up the ranks of House Republicans, Gowdy had made no secret of his dissatisfaction serving in Congress, and in January he announced he would give up the chairmanship of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee after less than a year. He\u2019ll return to the justice system, where he served as a federal prosecutor.\n\nDarrell Issa, California 49th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +7.5 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +0.52 Issa\n\nIssa in January became one of the most recognizable House Republicans to announce his retirement. A former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he served as the chief congressional inquisitor of the Obama administration for several years. Issa is annually ranked as one of the wealthiest members of Congress, having co-founded the company behind the Viper car alarm (for which he famously provided the voice). But he was in for the fight of his life to win reelection after nearly losing in 2016 in a district that Hillary Clinton carried over Donald Trump.\n\nJoe Barton, Texas 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +12.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +19.31 Barton\n\nThe dean of Texas\u2019s large Republican delegation, Barton was planning to seek a 17th term before lewd texts and photos he had sent to women with whom he had extramarital affairs leaked online. During the course of his long career in Congress, he served as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nLamar Smith, Texas 21st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +10.00 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +20.56 Smith\n\nHis is another term-limits retirement. An arch-conservative first elected in 1986, Smith likely would have had nowhere higher to go after finishing his tenure as chairman of the Space, Science, and Technology Committee, which he used to fight policies and funding to combat climate change.\n\nKris Connor / Stringer / Getty\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida 27th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +19.6 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +9.79 Ros-Lehtinen\n\nA former chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ros-Lehtinen never endorsed Trump and became one of his most vocal GOP critics in Congress. She retires after 28 years in the House. As a moderate, she voted frequently against top Republican priorities, including Obamacare repeal and the budget. Her South Florida district now becomes a prime pickup opportunity for Democrats.\n\nCharlie Dent, Pennsylvania 15th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +7.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +19.63 Dent\n\nAs co-chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group in the House, Dent was one of his party\u2019s most vocal critics, often voicing his frustration either with the president or the influence of the conservative Freedom Caucus in steering legislation to the right. He said the lack of a governing coalition in Congress contributed to his decision to retire after seven terms. He announced in April that he would leave office early rather than stick around for the remainder of his term.\n\nCharles Dharapak / AP\n\nDave Reichert, Washington state 8th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +3.00 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: uncontested\n\nA former leader of the Tuesday Group, Reichert is another moderate retiring after seven terms. Though he won his recent elections easily, his district was once one of the most competitive in the nation and could be again next year.\n\nPat Tiberi, Ohio 12th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +11.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +36.73 Tiberi\n\nWhereas others on this list retired after being term-limited out of committee chairmanships, Tiberi\u2019s decision may have more to do with a post he never won. The veteran Ohio Republican lost out to Kevin Brady of Texas in his bid to lead the Ways and Means Committee after Paul Ryan left the job to become speaker. Tiberi was a close ally of former Speaker John Boehner, and he, too, became frustrated with the dysfunction in Congress. He won\u2019t serve out the rest of his term, choosing instead to take a job as president of the Ohio Business Roundtable early next year.\n\nFrank LoBiondo, New Jersey 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +4.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +21.99 LoBiondo\n\nLoBiondo\u2019s retirement after 12 terms gives Democrats a major pickup opportunity in New Jersey. First elected in the Republican wave of 1994, he broke with his party to oppose Obamacare-repeal legislation, the GOP budget, and the tax bill.\n\nZach Gibson / AP\n\nLynn Jenkins, Kansas 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +18.4 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +28.38 Jenkins\n\nJenkins\u2019 announcement in January that she would not seek a sixth term in the House was one of the earliest and most surprising of the Republican retirements. She had served in the House leadership and was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in Kansas, but she said she would not run for any office in 2018.\n\nSam Johnson, Texas 3rd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +14.2 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +26.63 Johnson\n\nJohnson is revered in the House for his Air Force service in both Korea and Vietnam, where he was held\u2014and tortured\u2014as a prisoner of war for seven years. The 87-year-old is retiring from a safe Republican seat after more than a quarter-century in Congress.\n\nJohn Duncan Jr., Tennessee 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +35.4 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +51.29 Duncan Jr.\n\nDuncan will have served in the House for 30 years by the time he leaves next year. Though he votes with Republicans on domestic issues, he opposed the Iraq War and supports a non-interventionist foreign policy. His district should be an easy hold for Republicans.\n\nTed Poe, Texas 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +9.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +24.26 Poe\n\nNow in his seventh term, Poe is a former Houston judge known for ending each of his floor speeches with a variation on Walter Cronkite\u2019s longtime sign-off, \u201cAnd that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d He was diagnosed with leukemia in 2016.\n\nDave Trott, Michigan 11th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +4.4 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +12.76 Trott\n\nTrott was a first-time candidate when he won his seat in the House in 2014. He decided he preferred the private sector, however, announcing in September that he would return home after just two terms.\n\nRyan Costello, Pennsylvania 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +9.3 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +14.48 Costello\n\nDespite having served just two terms in the House, Costello is retiring rather than seeking reelection in a district that now favors Democrats after the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court threw out the existing congressional map. With the incumbent out, the 6th district is a prime Democratic pick-up opportunity.\n\nTrent Franks, Arizona 8th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +21.1 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +37.13 Franks\n\nFranks is leaving for perhaps the most unusual reason: He abruptly announced in December that he would resign after acknowledging that he had asked two members of his staff to carry his and his wife\u2019s child as surrogates, making them \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d His announcement came on the same day as the House Ethics Committee said it was opening an investigation into the situation.\n\nBlake Farenthold, Texas 27th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +23.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +23.39 Farenthold\n\nFarenthold announced in December 2017 he would not seek a fifth term after several former staffers accused him of harassment and of verbally abusive behavior in his congressional office. He initially resisted pressure to bow out even after the House Ethics Committee opened a new inquiry into his alleged behavior. In April, he abruptly resigned from Congress altogether.\n\nBill Shuster, Pennsylvania 9th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +42.5 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +26.68 Shuster\n\nShuster, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, announced in early January that he\u2019ll spend 2018 on developing an infrastructure plan instead of running for reelection. \u201cI thought it was the best decision for me to focus 100 percent on my final year as the chairman of the Transportation Committee, working with the president and other Democrats and Republicans to pass an infrastructure bill, which is much needed to rebuild America,\u201d he told The Washington Examiner. Shuster first won election to the House in 2001.\n\nGregg Harper, Mississippi 3rd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +24.5 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +35.83 Harper\n\nHarper, the chairman of the House Administration Committee, said he made the decision not to seek reelection over the holidays. \u201cI never intended for this to be a career, and it will soon be time for another conservative citizen legislator to represent us,\u201d he said in a statement in early January. Harper\u2019s committee has recently received a great deal of attention as the panel charged with addressing sexual harassment in the lower chamber. The five-term congressman joins a number of other Republican committee chairmen who are stepping down.\n\nEd Royce, California 39th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +8.6 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +14.46 Royce\n\nThe chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Royce is yet another committee leader who chose retirement over a return to the back bench once his tenure with the gavel was up. Royce will finish his 13th term in 2018, and his departure creates a top pick-up opportunity for Democrats in Southern California.\n\nPatrick Meehan, Pennsylvania 7th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +2.3 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +18.93 Meehan\n\nMeehan announced in January that he wouldn\u2019t run for a fifth term following the revelation that he settled a claim of sexual harassment made against him by a former staffer. The House Ethics Committee\u2014a panel of which Meehan was a member\u2014had already begun an investigation, and the congressman acknowledged that he had developed a deep affection for the woman while denying improper behavior. Meehan resigned on April 27 and said he repaid $39,000 in taxpayer money used to settle the harassment claim. His departure opens up a strong pick-up opportunity for Democrats in what was already a competitive district.\n\nTom Rooney, Florida 17th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +27.2 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +27.57 Rooney\n\nIn February, the Florida congressman announced he would not seek a sixth term this year. \u201cAfter what will be 10 years in the United States Congress representing the good people of Florida\u2019s Heartland, it\u2019s time to \u2018hang \u2018em up\u2019 as my old football coach used to say,\u201d Rooney said in a statement. He represents a solidly Republican district.\n\nDennis Ross, Florida 15th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +10 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +14.92 Ross\n\nFirst elected in the GOP wave of 2010, Ross announced in April that he would not seek a fifth term in the House. He had made a name for himself advocating for reform of the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nTom Garrett, Virginia 5th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +11.1 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +16.69 Garrett\n\nGarrett announced in late May that he would be leaving the House after just a single term because of his struggle with alcoholism. His retirement also came after a report that he and his wife had treated his congressional staff essentially as personal servants. The 5th district race is expected to be competitive, though it\u2019s unclear whether Garrett\u2019s exit will improve the GOP\u2019s chances of holding the seat.\n\nHouse Democrats Retiring Outright\n\nLuis Gutierrez, Illinois 4th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +68.9 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: uncontested\n\nNow in his 13th term, Gutierrez is perhaps the most prominent Democratic ally of immigrants in the House and has been at the center of virtually every attempt to extend a path to citizenship to those in the country illegally. In announcing his retirement in November, he anointed a possible successor in his heavily Democratic district, Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, and said he might run for president in 2020.\n\nJohn Conyers, Michigan 13th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +60.7 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +61.38 Conyers\n\nFirst elected in 1964, Conyers was the dean of the House as its longest-serving member. But he was brought down by allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple former female staffers in his office. Conyers denied the accusations but bowed to pressure from Democratic leaders and resigned from the House in early December.\n\nSander Levin, Michigan 9th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +7.8 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +20.51 Levin\n\nLevin, 86, will leave the House four years after his brother, Carl, retired from the Senate. He served briefly as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and was a top Democrat on taxes and trade policy.\n\nBob Brady, Pennsylvania 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +61.3 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +64.4 Brady\n\nA former chairman of the House Administration Committee, Brady will leave the House after 20 years. He had drawn a serious primary challenger after having been under FBI investigation for a payment his campaign made to a primary opponent in 2012.\n\nCarol Shea-Porter, New Hampshire 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +1.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +1.34 Shea-Porter\n\nShea-Porter represents what is perhaps the nation\u2019s quintessential swing district. It has changed parties five times in the last six elections, and Shea-Porter faced the same Republican opponent in four consecutive races. (She won twice.) With her retirement, the district is once again considered a toss-up.\n\nNiki Tsongas, Massachusetts 3rd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +22.8 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +37.53 Tsongas\n\nTsongas will retire after more than a decade in the House, and her district should stay in Democratic hands. She is the widow of Paul Tsongas, the former senator and Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nGene Green, Texas 29th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +45.7 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +48.49 Green\n\nThe onetime chairman of the House Ethics Committee announced in November that he would retire after more than a quarter-century in the House. He was first elected in 1992.\n\nRuben Kihuen, Nevada 4th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +4.9 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +4.01 Kihuen\n\nKihuen\u2019s time in Congress will be brief after he faced accusations of sexual harassment less than a year into his first term. Facing calls from Democratic leaders to resign, he announced instead that he would serve out his term but not seek another one in 2018. His exit will leave a competitive open seat in Nevada that Republicans might take a serious run at picking up.\n\nRick Nolan, Minnesota 8th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +15.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +0.56 Nolan\n\nThis is actually the second time Nolan has voluntarily given up his seat. The Minnesota Democrat first served in the House in the 1970s and left after three terms. He returned to politics in 2012 after three decades in business, capturing a Republican-held seat. With his retirement after a total of six terms, the GOP will have a good shot at winning back the district.\n\nElizabeth Esty, Connecticut 5th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +4.1 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +16 Esty\n\nEsty is leaving after just three terms, having withdrawn from her reelection bid after acknowledging she mishandled allegations of abuse and harassment against her then-chief of staff in 2016. She was a vocal advocate for gun control after the Sandy Hook massacre, which unfolded in her district shortly after her first election to the House. Her district could become competitive; Esty won her first race by just three points in 2012.\n\nHouse Republicans Running for Higher Office in 2018\n\nDiane Black, Tennessee 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +48.9 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +49.29 Black\n\nFirst elected in 2010, Black served this year as chairwoman of the House Budget Committee before deciding not to seek reelection and run for governor instead. With the 2018 budget finally adopted, she may leave her seat early to focus on her next campaign.\n\nChip Somodevilla / Getty\n\nLuke Messer, Indiana 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +40.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +42.44 Messer\n\nNow serving his third term in the House, Messer is facing off against fellow Indiana Representative Todd Rokita in a primary for the right to challenge Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly. He represents the seat once held by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTodd Rokita, Indiana 4th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +34.1 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +34.12 Rokita\n\nRokita entered Congress one term before Messer. He made a brief bid for governor in 2016 after Pence was named as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, but he was able to retain his House seat after Republicans picked Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb. He won\u2019t have that luxury if he loses the Senate race because the primaries for the Senate and House are on the same day.\n\nSteve Pearce, New Mexico 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +10.2 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +25.48 Pearce\n\nAfter serving two separate stints covering seven terms in the House, the conservative Pearce is running to succeed Susana Martinez as governor of New Mexico. Republicans remain favored to keep his House seat.\n\nRaul Labrador, Idaho 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +38.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +36.36 Labrador\n\nLabrador defeated a GOP establishment-backed candidate in a 2010 primary before beating a centrist Democratic incumbent during the Tea Party wave that November. His decision to run for governor may be a blessing for GOP leaders, as he was a frequent conservative critic and member of the House Freedom Caucus during his tenure. Republicans should hold his seat easily next year.\n\nZach Gibson / AP\n\nJim Renacci, Ohio 16th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +16.6 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +30.66 Renacci\n\nOne of the wealthiest members of Congress, Renacci originally announced plans to leave the House after four terms to run for governor of Ohio. But in January he decided to run for Senate instead after a leading Republican candidate, Josh Mandel, withdrew from that race.\n\nLou Barletta, Pennsylvania 11th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +23.8 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +27.34 Barletta\n\nBarletta was a Trump Republican before Trump and became one of the first to endorse the president\u2019s campaign. A longtime crusader against illegal immigration, his Senate candidacy challenging Democratic incumbent Bob Casey will be a test of Trump\u2019s brand in a formerly blue state that the president flipped red in 2016. Though it was held by a Democrat until Barletta won it in 2010, the 11th district is not currently expected to be competitive in the 2018 general election.\n\nKristi Noem, South Dakota at-large\n\n2016 presidential election: +29.79 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +28.21 Noem\n\nNoem defeated Democrat Stephanie Herseth Sandlin in one of the closest races in the 2010 Republican wave. She\u2019s giving up her House seat to run for governor, and Democrats will have a tough time winning it back.\n\nEvan Jenkins, West Virginia 3rd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +49.2 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +43.91 Jenkins\n\nJenkins knocked off one West Virginia Democrat, Nick Rahall, to win his House seat in 2014. He\u2019ll try to beat another, Senator Joe Manchin, in 2018. As with many of the seats Republicans are giving up to run for higher office, the 3rd district is less favorable to Democrats than it used to be.\n\nRon DeSantis, Florida 6th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +17.0 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +17.13 DeSantis\n\nA conservative in his third term, DeSantis announced in January he would run for governor, not Congress, in 2018. His decision came just a couple weeks after Trump offered him an unexpected endorsement in a pre-Christmas tweet. DeSantis won the Republican gubernatorial primary in August and then resigned his House seat in early September to focus on the general election.\n\nMartha McSally, Arizona 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +4.9 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +13.92 McSally\n\nMcSally launched her long-expected Senate campaign in January for the seat Jeff Flake is vacating. Serving her second term in the House, she had become famous as the first American woman to fly in combat during the 1990s. Republicans leaders see her as the best candidate to hold the Senate seat, but her departure gives Democrats another strong pick-up opportunity in the House.\n\nMarsha Blackburn, Tennessee 7th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +39.3 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +48.71 Blackburn\n\nBlackburn is leaving a safe Republican House seat after eight terms to run for the Tennessee Senate seat Bob Corker is vacating. With the support of conservative groups, she appears in solid shape to win the GOP nomination after Corker briefly reconsidered his decision, but she\u2019ll face a touch general-election matchup against Phil Bredesen, the state\u2019s former two-term Democratic governor.\n\nKevin Cramer, North Dakota at-large district\n\n2016 presidential election: +36.4 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +45.46 Cramer\n\nThe third-term congressman declared his candidacy to challenge Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp in February, barely a month after announcing he would forgo the race. Cramer\u2019s Senate run opens up his at-large House seat, which should stay in Republican hands this fall.\n\nJim Bridenstine, Oklahoma 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +28.7 Trump\n\n2016 House election: Uncontested\n\nBridenstine didn\u2019t run for higher office after three-and-a-half terms in the House, but he was picked in 2017 by President Trump to serve as the next administrator of NASA. His nomination languished in the Senate for months, but his confirmation on a narrow party-line vote in April created another vacancy and open seat in November. Republicans should easily hold this conservative district.\n\nHouse Democrats Running for Higher Office in 2018\n\nCharles Dharapak / AP\n\nKyrsten Sinema, Arizona 9th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +16.3 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +21.88 Sinema\n\nSinema announced her candidacy for the Senate before Flake decided to retire. A member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, she has occasionally voted with Republicans on health care, taxes, and border security. She\u2019s also the first openly bisexual member of Congress. Though Sinema\u2019s first election in 2012 was very close, her district has trended more Democratic in the years since.\n\nJared Polis, Colorado 2nd district\n\n2016 presidential election: +21.3 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +19.72 Polis\n\nAnother of Congress\u2019s most wealthy members, Polis is running for governor after five terms in the House. The district includes Boulder and is considered a safe Democratic seat.\n\nTim Walz, Minnesota 1st district\n\n2016 presidential election: +14.9 Trump\n\n2016 House election: +0.76 Walz\n\nWalz\u2019s decision to run for governor of Minnesota after six terms in the House gives Republicans one of their best pickup opportunities. He won his 2016 race by only about 2,500 votes.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, Texas 16th district\n\n2016 presidential election: +40.7 Clinton\n\n2016 House election: +75.75 O\u2019Rourke\n\nO\u2019Rourke won his House seat in 2012 after defeating a longtime Democratic incumbent, Silvestre Reyes, in a primary.
