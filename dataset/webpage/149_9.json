Brown was ordered to surrender his home by British forces so it could be converted into a barracks:\n\n\"Elisha Brown was an inhabitant of the southerly part of Boston, where he owned an estate of considerable value. In the year 1769, when the British soldiers held possession of the town, his house, a very commodious mansion, was selected as remarkably well adapted for the use of barracks, and he was peremptorily ordered to vacate the premises for their convenience.\n\nElisha Brown Marker\n\nOn refusing to comply with the demand of the soldiers, the house was surrounded by the troops, and kept in a state of siege.\n\nIt is said that for seventeen days he prevented the troops from gaining their wishes, he having barred all the windows and doors on the inside of the house, and relying for sustenance on the usual family stores which he had provided for family use, and upon the supplies which his friends from without, from time to time found opportunities to convey to him.\"\n\nBrown died in 1785 at the age of 65. He was a true Son of Liberty. His marker can be found in the cemetery off the walkway to the left of the Franklin obelisk. The sign there can direct you to the marker's location. His marker states the following:\n\nELISHA BROWN,\n\nOF BOSTON,\n\nWHO,\n\nIN OCT'R, 1769, DURING 17 DAYS, INSPIRED WITH A GENEROUS ZEAL\n\nFOR THE LAWS,\n\nBRAVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY\n\nOPPOSED A WHOLE BRITISH REG'T.\n\nIN THEIR VIOLENT ATTEMPTS\n\nTO FORCE HIM\n\nFROM HIS LEGAL HABITATION.\n\nHAPPY CITIZEN, WHEN CALL'D SINGLEY\n\nTO BE A BARRIER\n\nTO\n\nTHE LIBERTYS OF A CONTINENT.\n\nContact Information & Address:\n\nGranary Burying Ground\n\nTremont & Bromfield Streets, Boston, MA\n\n617.635.4505\n\ncityofboston.gov"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/196336980/elisha-brown", "page_content": "Mr. Elisha \u201cSandy\u201d Brown, Jr., 62, passed away on the morning of Thursday, January 24, 2019 at Hospice House of South Bend.
