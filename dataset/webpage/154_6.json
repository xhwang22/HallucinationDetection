Each funded project must include an educational component.\n\nThe recipients (assistant professors unless noted):\n\nJulia Dshemuchadse, Materials Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, will use her award for research that aims to shed light on the self-assembly processes behind the growth of both simple and complex crystal structures \u2013 specifically, how different particle attachment patterns depend on the symmetry and complexity of crystal structure type, and how they vary with the chemistry of the system. The educational component of this award includes inviting teachers from rural areas in central New York to campus for an annual student-organized summer workshop, and teaching math and science at New York state prisons through the Cornell Prison Education Program.\n\nJillian Goldfarb, associate professor in Biological and Environmental Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, will use her funding to design next-generation processes to transform organic wastes into liquid biofuels via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which directly treats wet wastes without an energy-intensive pre-drying step by processing the waste in water at high temperature and pressure. The educational components include a redesign of BEE 2510 (Sustainable Engineering Design) and original public survey research on biomass-based fuels. In a first-of-its-kind survey, Goldfarb will uncover how scientists can frame messages to garner public support for green energy implementation.\n\nBharath Hariharan, Computer Science, Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, will use his award to develop technologies for computer-vision recognition systems that can identify difficult visual concepts without large datasets. Current systems must be trained on datasets of millions of images which have been painstakingly labeled by human annotators. Such datasets are difficult to create for many application domains, such as microscopy; they may also run afoul of privacy concerns. Recognition systems that can work with limited training data will unlock many downstream applications and increase accessibility. The educational component will include a workshop for high school students from underrepresented communities.\n\nMeredith Holgerson, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, CALS, will use her award to further study pond ecosystems, which are globally abundant and ecologically significant. Ponds have higher rates of biogeochemical activity (nutrient recycling, greenhouse gas emissions) compared to lakes, which may be related to their small size and shallow depths. This research will examine the mechanisms driving ponds\u2019 high biogeochemical activity, using field surveys and whole-pond manipulations, and includes training of undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. A key feature of this project is the close interaction of researchers with public agencies that regulate aquatic habitats.\n\nJustin Hsu, Computer Science, Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, will use his award for his work on randomized algorithms, which play a central role in areas including machine learning, data privacy and cryptography. Like all software, probabilistic programs are susceptible to bugs; furthermore, correctness properties rest on mathematical proof, and missteps in these arguments can render algorithms incorrect before they are even implemented, which could have long-range consequences. This proposal seeks to advance the theory and practice of verification for probabilistic programs, developing technology to increase our confidence in these programs.\n\nSabrina Karim, Government (Arts and Sciences), founder and director of the Gender and Security Sector Lab, will use her funding to expand the scope of research in her lab to include the project \u201cThe Domestic and International Politics of Global Police.\u201d The project focuses on understanding the political relationships among police forces, civilian governments and international police assistance donors. She will collect and analyze global data on police violence and police reforms, as well as conduct and analyze surveys of police personnel around the world. Karim will also develop an undergraduate course and master\u2019s level program on the \u201cThe Politics of Policing.\u201d\n\nQi Li, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENG), will use her award to further her study of the fluid dynamics and hydrologic processes in the built environment. More than half of the global population lives in urban areas, which modify the atmosphere through two broad pathways: urban form (i.e., changes in surface properties) and urban function (i.e., anthropogenic activities emitting heat and mass). The goal of this project is to improve basic understanding of transport of heat and air pollutants and inform physically realistic, generalizable estimates of surface-atmosphere exchanges, leading to findings necessary for next-generation urban climate modeling tools.\n\nNils Napp, Electrical and Computer Engineering (ENG), develops algorithms and builds robots that can operate in unstructured, real-world environments. He will use his award to develop planning and coordination methods for robots to reliably modify their environment. The key technical aspect of this approach is to focus on approximate mathematical representations of the environment so that robots can reason about and react to the uncertain outcomes of their individual building actions. This algorithmic view of robot-environment interaction will enable new types of building applications and help address the urgent societal need for innovative construction techniques.\n\nSamitha Samaranayake, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENG), will use his funding to address fundamental research questions related to designing and operating transit-centric, multi-modal transportation systems, with the aim of making these systems efficient, sustainable and equitable. The technical focus will be on algorithms for designing and operating such systems, an area with key research gaps. The research will incorporate technical ideas from civil engineering, operations research and computer science, to develop new methodologies and train students with cross-disciplinary expertise. The project will involve community outreach and education efforts targeting high school and college students, as well as public agencies.\n\nScott Steinschneider, Biological and Environmental Engineering (CALS), will use the award to further his studies of sustainable water resources planning and management in the 21st century, which requires adaptation strategies aimed at future climate and environmental change. This work \u2013 which will be applied in the Lake Ontario eco-hydrologic system \u2013 will develop innovations in physics-informed machine learning that will enable process-guided climate simulation and hydrologic prediction that support risk-based adaptation planning. The educational component will include community engagement and knowledge-sharing with Great Lakes communities, students and other stakeholders.\n\nRong Yang, Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ENG), will use her funding to support research that enables advances in the manufacturing science of polymer nanoparticles, currently synthesized via a solution-based batch process, which can limit their shape, size, chemistry and, thus, broad deployment. The aim is to develop an all-dry, scalable manufacturing paradigm that produces polymer nanoparticles \u2013 with programmable shape, size and chemistries without toxic solvents \u2013 that could be used as injectable implants or in drug delivery. The educational component will focus on active learning and broadening the participation of women in STEM entrepreneurship."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fei-Ping_Hsu", "page_content": "Fei-Ping Hsu (Chinese: \u8bb8\u6590\u5e73; July 20, 1952[1]\u2013November 27, 2001) was a Chinese-American pianist.\n\nPianist\n\nHsu was born on the island of Gulangyu in southeast China.

Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.\n\nView details for DOI 10.4161/auto.19496\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000305403400002\n\nView details for PubMedID 22966490\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3404883"}, {"url": "https://tc.computer.org/tcdp/awardrecipients/", "page_content": "TCDP Award Recipients\n\n2023 IEEE TCDP Outstanding Technical Achievement Award\n\n\n\nIEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Distributed Processing (TCDP) has named Professor H. T. Kung of Harvard University as the recipient of the 2023 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award. The citation of the award to Professor Kung is for seminal contributions on concurrency control and systolic arrays in distributed systems.\n\nProfessor Kung is one of the world\u2019s most influential research and education leaders in the field of distributed systems. He is William H. Gates professor of computer science at Harvard University. He and his former students created new algorithms, architectures and designs that have led to efficient distributed systems. His early research in parallel computing produced the systolic array in 1979, which has since become a core computational component of hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence, including Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Similarly, he proposed optimistic concurrency control in 1981, now a key principle in distributed memory and database transaction systems, including MySQL, Apache CouchDB, Google\u2019s App Engine, and Ruby on Rails. He remains an active researcher, with ongoing contributions to hardware design, parallel computing, wireless networking, signal processing, privacy and security, and artificial intelligence.\n\nProfessor Kung is also well-known as an influential mentor. Throughout his career, he has been equally regarded for the role of his own research as for the legacy of his students, who have gone on to become pillars at Y Combinator, Google Brain, IBM, Intel, MediaTek, Stanford, and MIT. Professor Kung received his bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics from National Tsing Hua University in 1968. He received his Ph.D. degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1973. He taught at Carnegie Mellon for 19 years before being appointed McKay Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Harvard in 1992.\n\nProfessor Kung was elected a member of the US National Academy of Engineering in 1993 for introducing the idea of systolic computation, contributions to parallel computing, and applying complexity analysis to very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) computation. In addition, he is a Guggenheim Fellow, member of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, as well as president and co-founder of the Taiwan AI Academy, a non-profit organization which has cultivated over 10,000 AI talents for various industries. He received the IEEE CS Charles Babbage Award in 1990, Pittsburgh Intellectual Property Law Association Inventor of the Year Award in 1991, and the ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award in 2015.\n\n2022 IEEE TCDP Outstanding Technical Achievement Award\n\nIEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Distributed Processing (TCDP) has named Professor Andrew Tanenbaum of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as the recipient of the 2022 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award. The citation of the award to Professor Tanenbaum is for seminal work on microkernels and performance of operating systems, and for authoring textbooks that have educated multiple generations of students, researchers, and practitioners.\n\nProfessor Tanenbaum is a global leader on microkernels and operating system design. He is the principal designer of three operating systems: TSS-11, Amoeba, and MINIX. In 1987, Professor Tanenbaum wrote a clone of UNIX, called MINIX (MINi-UNIX), for the IBM PC. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text. Within three months, a Usenet newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds, who began adding new features to 300MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. In 1991, Torvalds announced his own (POSIX-like) kernel, called Linux, which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code. Although MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one. The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure operating system. Professor Tanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing.\n\nIn addition, Professor Tanenbaum is the author or coauthor of five books, which together have been translated in more than 20 languages, in more than 175 editions. He is best known as the author of MINIX, a free Unix-like operating system for teaching purposes, and for his computer science textbooks.\n\nAndrew S. Tanenbaum has a B.S. from MIT and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. He is currently a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Andrew S. Tanenbaum is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and a member of the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994 he was the recipient of the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. In 1997 he won the ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science. In 2007 he won the IEEE James H. Mulligan, Jr., Education Medal.\n\n2022 IEEE TCDP Outstanding Technical Achievement Award\n\nIEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Distributed Processing (TCDP) has named Professor Willy Zwaenepoel of the University of Sydney as the recipient of the 2022 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award.

The citation for Professor Ousterhout is for seminal contributions to infrastructure for large-scale distributed systems.\n\nProfessor Ousterhout has made numerous contributions to large-scale and distributed systems. As a graduate student he played a key role in the development of Cm*, the first large-scale distributed multiprocessor. During his PhD dissertation work he developed the concept of coscheduling (now known as gang scheduling); his paper on this topic at ICDCS 1982 was selected as one of two ICDCS High Impact Papers for the 40-year anniversary of the conference. At Berkeley, he and his graduate students created the Sprite operating system, one of the first systems to provide a \u201csingle system image\u201d across a cluster of workstations. Along with Mendel Rosenblum, he developed the concept of log-structured file systems; its no-overwrite approach is now used in most large-scale distributed storage systems as well as software for managing flash memory. His more recent work at Stanford has focused on large-scale computing in datacenters. He and his students developed RAMCloud, a distributed storage system that achieves five-microsecond access times by storing all data in DRAM. Along with Diego Ongaro, he created Raft, a new consensus algorithm that is replacing Paxos for many commercial applications. His most recent project is Homa, a new transport protocol that is superior to TCP for low latency communication within a datacenter.\n\nJohn Ousterhout is the Bosack Lerner Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. He received a BS in Physics from Yale University and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. He was a Professor of Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley for 14 years, followed by 14 years in industry, where he founded two companies (Scriptics and Electric Cloud), before returning to academia at Stanford. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the ACM, and has received numerous awards, including the ACM Software System Award, the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, and the U.C. Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award.\n\nThe IEEE Computer Society Technical Community on Distributed Processing (TCDP) has named Professor Miron Livny from University of Wisconsin as the recipient of the 2020 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award. The citation for Professor Livny is for his Influential Contributions of the Condor system to Distributed and High Throughput Computing.\n\nMiron Livny is the John P. Morgridge Professor of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison where he is serving as the Director of the Center for High Throughput Computing and the Lead Investigator of Computing Technologies at the Morgridge Institute for Research. He has been serving as the Technical Director of the Open Science Grid and has been collaborating for more than three decades with researchers from a wide spectrum of science domains. Two of these collaborations \u2013 the LHC experiments and the LIGO collaboration \u2013 were recently awarded Nobel prizes in physics (2013 and 2017 respectively).\n\nLivny\u2019s PhD work on Load Balancing Algorithms for Distributed Processing Systems laid the foundation for research in adaptive load sharing algorithms. It also provided the underpinning principals of sharing and local autonomy for the Condor system that was first deployed in 1985. The original Condor paper was published in ICDCS 1988 and was awarded as one of the two ICDCS High Impact Papers in the 40-year anniversary of the conference in 2020. Experience with the Condor system led him to pioneer the area of High Throughput Computing (HTC) in the mid 90\u2019s. Livny has been promoting the adoption of HTC methodologies and technologies to advance scientific discovery ever since. The widely adopted HTCondor Software Suite embodies four decades of research, software development and experimental evaluation of distributed computing frameworks and technologies. The suite includes novel concepts like the ClassAd language, resource acquisition through Matchmaking, and on-the-fly deployment and configuration of software modules. The impact of his work is also reflected in the growing awareness of the role that HTC is playing in scientific discovery. The fabric of distributed HTC services offered by the Open Science Grid is a clear display of who resource sharing and local autonomy translate in to a powerful distributed research computing infrastructure.\n\nLivny is the recipient of the 2006 ACM SIGMOD Test of Time Award and the 2013 HPDC Achievement Award.\n\n2020 IEEE TDCP ICDCS High Impact Paper Award\n\nTo celebrate the 40 years anniversary of the International Conference on Distributed Systems (ICDCS), the IEEE Technical Community on Distributed Processing (TCDP) Award Committee has selected ICDCS High Impact Papers that have profoundly influenced the field of distributed computing systems.

Birman\n\nKen Birman [http://www.cs.cornell.edu] is The N. Rama Rao Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. Consistency, reliability and data replication have been themes of his work for nearly thirty years, and many of today\u2019s large cloud-computing platforms (for example, IBM Web Sphere, Microsoft Enterprise Clustering and a number of Amazon\u2019s \u201cgossip-based\u201d subsystems) draw on ideas first explored by his group.\n\nBirman\u2019s best known work was on the Isis Toolkit, which introduced the virtual synchrony model, and became central to the French air traffic control system and US Navy AEGIS. Isis also operated the New York Stock exchange for more than a decade and was used in hundreds of financial, process-control and data center settings. Other widely cited systems created by Birman and his team include the first widely used publish-subscribe message bus (the \u201cNews\u201d subsystem in Isis); the Astrolabe platform for scalable monitoring, data aggregation and system management; the Bimodal Multicast, and the Kelips 1-hop DHT. On the more theoretical side, Birman went on to merge the virtual synchrony model with the state machine replication model used by Paxos, to create a powerful new model for dynamically reconfigurable services. He pioneered the analysis of gossip-based protocols, and has been a leader in applying optimization techniques to distributed systems resource management and similar problems. Reiter and Birman introduced the first dynamic group key replication protocol, to secure groups of components that must tolerate faults and allow new members to join at runtime.\n\nThe author of several books and more than 200 journal and conference papers, Dr. Birman was Editor in Chief of ACM Transactions on Computer Systems from 1993-1998, is a Fellow of the ACM and the winner of the 2009 IEEE Kanai Award.
