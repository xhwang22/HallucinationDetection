{"Bill Brown played for Clyde, Partick Thistle, Celtic, and St Mirren.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51391281", "page_content": "The Clyde players celebrate a famous Scottish Cup victory at Broadwood\n\nIt was supposed to be Roy Keane's big day. The Manchester United legend had joined boyhood heroes Celtic intent on a glorious end to his career to prove wrong manager Gordon Strachan, who he believed did not really want to sign him.\n\nBut his debut on 8 January 2006 turned sour with one of the Scottish Cup's biggest upsets as second-tier Clyde - with an average age of under 21 - ran the legs off Strachan's side as they triumphed 2-1, and could have won by a more handsome margin in front of a live TV audience.\n\nIt was also to prove a turning point for several careers. Here, we look back at what happened to those two contrasting squads.\n\nGraham Roberts, 60: The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Rangers defender had formed his squad after inheriting just three players and holding open trials in the summer for free agents released by other clubs. His tenure was short-lived as, six months after the famous win over Celtic, he was sacked over allegations of racist remarks but subsequently won a case for unfair dismissal. Roberts went on to coach the Pakistan and Nepal national teams.\n\nClyde manager Graham Roberts celebrates at full-time\n\nPeter Cherrie, 36: The goalkeeper, in the only season when he was first choice at Broadwood, denied Shaun Maloney an equaliser when Clyde were 1-0 ahead. Cherrie was released along with the rest of the squad when the Bully Wee hit financial problems in 2009 and went on to play for Dundalk, Cliftonville, Bray Wanderers, Cork City and Derry City, who he helped finish fourth in the League of Ireland last year.\n\nNeil McGregor, 34: The right-back/centre-half also left after Clyde's 2009 financial problems and went on to play for Dunfermline Athletic, Dundee and Ayr United before moving on to the juniors with Hurlford United and, last season, Troon.\n\nChris Higgins, 34: The centre-half joined Dunfermline along with McGregor and, like his team-mate, was released despite helping the Pars win promotion to the top flight. He went on to have six seasons with Queen of the South before moving to Ayr United and is now in League One with East Fife.\n\nCraig McKeown, 34: The centre-half moved on to Dundee in 2008 but was released after helping them win promotion to the top flight in 2012 and went on to finish his career in the Highland League with Brora Rangers and Formartine United.\n\nEddie Malone, 34: The marauding left-back made his name with what turned out to be winning goal. He moved to St Mirren in the Premier League the following season, but was soon back in the second tier with Dundee before moves to Ayr United, Raith Rovers, Stenhousemuir and Forfar Athletic. He is currently in the Lowland League with East Stirlingshire.\n\nCraig Bryson, 33: The box-to-box midfielder was the youngest member of the Clyde team, scored the opening goal and was the home player who went on to greatest success. He moved to Kilmarnock the following season and, after four campaigns in the top flight, switched to Derby County, winning three Scotland caps on the way. A short spell on loan to Cardiff City preceded his move to Aberdeen at the start of the current season.\n\nEddie Malone and Craig Bryson were the goal heroes for Clyde at Broadwood\n\nStevie Masterton, 35: The skilful midfielder moved on to Greenock Morton in 2008, then Crawley Town, but returned to Scotland soon after for short spells with Alloa Athletic and Clyde again before ending his career in the juniors with Hurlford United.\n\nStephen O'Donnell, 36: The rangy midfielder had a penalty saved by Artur Boruc as Clyde led 1-0 but supplied the corner that led to the second goal. A year later, he moved to the top flight with St Mirren and, three seasons later, to Dundee before a brief return to Clyde in 2014.\n\nMichael McGowan, 34: The Glasgow-born Northern Ireland Under-21s winger went on to become Clyde captain before moving to Queen of the South in 2008. He spent a year with Dundalk, where he was named player of year and scored from the halfway line against Derry City. He returned to Scotland to play for Alloa and Ayr.\n\nAlex Williams, 37: The forward, who had a goal controversially disallowed before Clyde took the lead, had been a prolific scorer for Morton before joining the Cumbernauld club. He left after one season to play in Australia but was soon back in Scotland with Ross County, Clyde then another prolific spell with Ayr before joining Dundalk, St Patrick's Athletic then Stenhousemuir. He spent two seasons with junior side Luncarty after returning to football in 2013 following a 32-month jail sentence, having pleaded guilty to charges of supplying designer drugs, claiming it was due to financial difficulties suffered due to a gambling addiction.\n\nTom Brighton, 35. The former Rangers youth and Scotland Under-21s striker was another to have a goal ruled out before Clyde took the lead and went on to play for Millwall, St Mirren, Stirling Albion, Queen of the South and juniors Irvine Meadow.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nRomauld Bouadji, 37. The French centre-half, who started his career with Saint-Etienne, went on to play for Tooting & Mitcham United, Fisher Athletic, Carshalton Athletic and Stranraer.\n\nJoe Miller, 52: The former Aberdeen and Celtic forward had re-registered as a player after being appointed assistant manager to Roberts and became Clyde manager eight months later after a dispute between himself and the Englishman that led to the latter winning his claim of unfair dismissal. Miller led Clyde to the Challenge Cup final in 2006 but refused a new contract in 2007 and became assistant at Dundalk two years later.\n\nGary Arbuckle, 35: The forward was released in 2008 after more than 100 appearances for Clyde and had short spells with Queen of the South and Ayr before finishing his career in the juniors with Kilbirnie Ladeside, Arthurlie and Gartcairn.\n\nGordon Strachan, 62: The former Scotland winger recovered from the Broadwood defeat to lead Celtic to three consecutive league titles before spells in charge of Middlesbrough and Scotland. Is presently technical director with first club Dundee in the Scottish Championship.\n\nArtur Boruc, 39: The goalkeeper capped 65 times for Poland spent five successful seasons with Celtic before joining Fiorentina in 2010 and then heading to the English top flight with Southampton and Bournemouth, where he is still part of the squad.\n\nCeltic goalkeeper Artur Boruc kept out a penalty from Stephen O'Donnell\n\nPaul Telfer, 48: The right-back had followed Strachan to Celtic from Southampton, but his family could not settle in Glasgow and, after briefly retiring in 2007, he joined Bournemouth before spells with Leeds United, Slough Town and Sutton United. Capped once for Scotland, Telfer has coached at Indy Eleven in the North American Soccer League.\n\nDu Wei, 37: The China centre-half, on loan from Shanghai Shenhua after helping them win the league, was hauled off after 45 minutes of a nightmare debut at Broadwood. It was to be his only Celtic appearance, but after returning to Shanghai, he became club captain in 2008 and went on to earn 71 caps for his country.\n\nStephen McManus, 37: The centre-half, capped 26 times for Scotland, moved from Celtic to Middlesbrough in 2010 before ending his career with Motherwell in 2017. He is now coaching Celtic's youths.\n\nRoss Wallace, 34: The left-back, another to earn a single Scotland cap, moved to Sunderland in 2006 then on to Preston North End, Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday and Fleetwood Town, who released him in September.\n\nShunsuke Nakamura, 41: Being part of the Broadwood defeat did not prevent the classy midfielder becoming a cult hero with Celtic and earning 98 caps for Japan. After four seasons in Glasgow, he left for Espanyol in 2009 before a return to first club Yokohama Marinos. He switched from Jubilo Iwata to second-tier Yokohama FC in July and is renowned for novelty appearances on television displaying the accuracy of his free-kicks.\n\nNeil Lennon, 48: The current Celtic manager and former Northern Ireland midfielder ended his seven-year playing career with the club in 2007 when he moved to Nottingham Forest, then Wycombe Wanderers, before returning to take up a coaching role. Lennon also managed Bolton Wanderers and Hibernian before his return for a second spell in charge of the Scottish champions.\n\nRoy Keane, 48: The Republic of Ireland superstar did not live up to his reputation during his time at Celtic. However, he went on to help the Glasgow side win the League Cup and league title before retiring that June on medical advice. After spells as Sunderland and Ipswich Town manager, he was assistant manager for the Republic of Ireland, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest before quitting the City Ground in June 2019.\n\nRoy Keane had a day to forget on his Celtic debut\n\nStephen Pearson, 37: The Scotland midfielder left Celtic for Derby in 2007 and went on to play for Bristol City, Kerala Blasters and Atletico Kolkata before ending his career back with first club Motherwell.\n\nJohn Hartson, 44: The Wales striker left Celtic six months later to join West Bromwich Albion and retired two years after that, soon after they released him. He went on to fight a winning battle against testicular cancer and become a TV and radio pundit.\n\nShaun Maloney, 37: The Scotland attacking midfielder left in 2007 for Aston Villa but returned a year later for another three-year spell before joining Wigan Athletic, Chicago Fire and Hull City. He went on to coach with Celtic before switching to his present role as assistant to Belgium head coach Roberto Martinez.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nAdam Virgo, 37: The English centre-half failed to live up to the \u00a31.5m fee Celtic paid Brighton for his services and, after spells on loan at Coventry City and Colchester United, returned to his former club. He went on to work as a TV commentator, pundit and journalist as well as launching his own football academy.\n\nAidan McGeady, 33: The Rutherglen-born Republic of Ireland winger fluffed a chance to bring Celtic back into the game at Broadwood but went on to become Scotland's most expensive export when Spartak Moscow paid \u00a39.3m for him in 2010. He went on to play for Everton, Sheffield Wednesday, Preston and Sunderland, and is currently on loan at Charlton Athletic.\n\nMaciej Zurawski, 43: The Poland striker came off the bench to reduce the arrears with eight minutes remaining. He went on to be part of his country's 2006 World Cup squad and was captain for the Euro 2008 finals before moving on to Larissa and Omonia Nicosia in Cyprus and ending his career back with first club Wisla Krakow."}, {"url": "https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/scot15.html", "page_content": "Scotland 1914/15\n\nFinal League table 1914/15 PLD W D L F-A PTS 1.

Glasgow is the Second City of the British Empire: an industrial melting pot with a burgeoning population. Victorian gentlemen are keen to find some healthy recreation far from the grime of work. Football has become an increasingly popular sport and hundreds of clubs are forming and just as quickly folding.\n\nIn Glasgow a team called \u2018Clyde\u2019 had existed for one season in 1872-73. Anecdotally they were formed at the same time in a similar fashion to Rangers FC by a crew of rowers at Glasgow Green. However this club has no direct link to the current Clyde FC. Another team called Eastern similarly lasted one season in 1875-76 and it\u2019s thought their members went on to form the club we know today. Evidence for this comes from the unlikely source of the Sheffield Daily Telegraph of 12th October 1877:\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most important match in the first round was that between 3rd Lanark and the Clyde which ended in the defeat of the latter by one goal. The Clyde is mainly comprised of men who take a prominent part in the aquatics and formerly went under the name of the Eastern, a club which has produced some of the finest players of the Association game, including Mr P. Andrews now of Sheffield.\u201d\n\nThe location of Barrowfield Park\n\nClyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. We don\u2019t know the exact date or circumstances in 1877 as most of Clyde\u2019s historical material was destroyed in fires at Shawfield. However, documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\n\nHere\u2019s how the SFA recorded Clyde\u2019s origins:\n\n\u201cClyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\u201d\n\nSitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park was leased by the club and lay at the end of Martin Street in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the River Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile works with a high population density to provide the labour. Maps of the time show the ground consisted of a grand stand running north-south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end, and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch. It remains to be discovered if Clyde developed the infrastructure and facilities at the site.\n\nThe 1895 Valuation Rolls include an entry for Clyde:\n\nYear: 1895\n\nDescription: Recreation Grounds at Martin Street\n\nProprietor: Joseph Monteith, Carstairs House, per J Frame, 40 Royal Exchange Square\n\nTenant: The Clyde Football Club, per James Mackie, 11 Allan Street\n\nYearly Rent: \u00a350\n\nOddly, the name \u2018Barrowfield\u2019 is missing from the entry, despite being used in match reports since 1877. Joseph Monteith was a wealthy landowner and famous for powering his Carstairs mansion and private tramway with one of Scotland\u2019s first hydroelectric systems. James Mackie was probably the club secretary of the time living in nearby Dalmarnock.\n\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but it also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Given Clyde\u2019s history of ground-sharing, it\u2019s ironic that Barrowfield was originally shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\n\nFrom the outset Clyde FC lay in very close proximity to other Senior clubs. Thistle (not related to Partick Thistle) were the nearest to Barrowfield and shuffled around Glasgow\u2019s East End from park to park. Queen\u2019s Park and Third Lanark were situated only about a mile from Barrowfield with Cambuslang (later to become Junior) also nearby, but crucially there was geographical distinction from these clubs provided by the River Clyde.\n\nA very early team group\n\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde FC was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club and its players were strictly amateur. Clyde\u2019s Honorary Secretary, John D. Graham, was a champion rower and an active member of Queen\u2019s Park FC where he occasionally played as goalkeeper. His dual memberships didn\u2019t seem a problem until he became Clyde\u2019s representative on the Glasgow Football Association which forced his resignation from Queen\u2019s Park (although he later rejoined). Widely respected, and possessed with energy and enthusiasm, he was a major driving force in Clyde\u2019s formation and consolidation. Sadly he met a premature death in 1895.\n\nThe first mention of Clyde in action was in The Evening Times of Monday 17th September 1877:\n\n\u201cClyde v T. Lanark\n\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end the 3rd were victors by 3 goals to 1.\u201d\n\nThis very short report was common at the time as sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and even quoiting or otter hunting for the limited column space available.\n\nAlthough most fixtures were arranged informally, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants\u2019 & Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup that in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29th September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again and they triumphed 1-0.\n\nClyde FC must have thought Glasgow\u2019s East End was theirs to exploit until the emergence of Celtic FC in 1888. The original Celtic Park, situated a mile to the north of Barrowfield Park, lay on the junction of London Road and Dalmarnock Road (now Springfield Road). The obvious affiliations of Celtic and their roaring success from the outset stifled Clyde\u2019s ambitions. Celtic were simply on a different scale in terms of crowds and success and remained so.\n\nThe effect of the emergence and immediate success of Celtic to the detriment of Clyde and others was reported in the Scottish Umpire in 1888:\n\n\u201cOne or other of the East End clubs \u2013 Clyde and Thistle \u2013 perhaps both, will feel keenly the presence of another Richard in the field in the shape of Celtic F.C. There is no gainsaying the fact that this combination will prove most formidable opposition to the rival houses of Beechwood and Barrowfield. As a rule, the general public follow wherever they are provided with a good bill of fare, and if our Celtic brethren can retain the services of those players who did duty for them last week, the attendance at club matches at the grounds we have mentioned will show a perceptible falling off.\u201d\n\nAlthough Celtic had emerged on Clyde\u2019s doorstep, there were benefits. Celtic\u2019s first ever balance sheet of 31st May 1889 revealed that of 45 games played at Celtic Park, the three Clyde games accounted for a disproportionately large 11.5% of total gate receipts. At that time the football authorities wanted to foster competition and gates were shared between teams. Hence Clyde received \u00a3158 from the generous giant up the road.\n\nAs football became established and popular with paying customers, this forced clubs into becoming businesses rather than mere sporting concerns. Gradually as club secretaries became more efficient various local leagues sprang into existence. The game in England developed rapidly with professionalism adopted in 1885 and a national League structure soon followed. Threatened with the best Scottish talent being lured south, the prominent Scottish clubs decided to act and circulated a proposal to form a national League in the spring of 1890. Clyde were invited to join but saw the whole exercise as an affront to their amateur pastime.\n\nAction at Barrowfield against St Mirren in 1894\n\nThe press also took the moral high ground and showed distaste for anything as vulgar as a League. The Scottish Sport stated, \u201cOur first and last objection is that they exist. The entire rules stink of finance \u2013 money making and money grabbing.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly the League proved to be a success and Clyde\u2019s objections lasted all of twelve months as they applied to join the very next year in 1891. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde\u2019s first League fixture on Saturday, 15th August 1891. In a dream introduction to League football Clyde triumphed 10-3.\n\nMonday\u2019s Glasgow Herald praised them highly:\n\n\u201cSPECIAL NOTES ON SUMMER PASTIMES\n\nThe League championship competition opened on Saturday, and, judging from the attendances at various matches, football continues to be as popular as ever. The newly admitted clubs to the League \u2013 the Clyde and the Leith Athletic \u2013 proved themselves worthy of inclusion by defeating their opponents, the Vale of Leven and Third Lanark respectively. The Clyde were strengthened by several prominent players returned from England, and with some practice, and assuming they keep together, should prove about the most powerful combination in Scotland. On Saturday they did pretty much as they liked against the Vale of Leven, when they defeated them by ten goals to three. The forward play of the incomers was magnificent, and could hardly be improved, while their defence was sound and reliable. The Vale\u2019s team was composed mainly of juniors, and while no real fault could be found with their forwards, who are smart and active on the ball, their half-backs and full-backs were weak. In the second half they had to play without D. Sharpe, their best half-back, who had the misfortune to get his collar bone broken, and to some extent disorganised the team.\u201d\n\nA mid-table finish saw Clyde complete a confident season in League football and the table shows watching Clyde would guarantee goals at both ends.\n\nDIVISION 1 1891-92\n\nP W D L F A Pts Dumbarton 22 18 1 3 78 27 37 Celtic 22 16 3 3 62 21 35 Hearts 22 15 4 3 65 35 34 Leith Athletic 22 12 1 9 51 40 25 Rangers 22 11 2 9 59 46 24 Third Lanark 22 8 5 9 44 47 21 Renton 22 8 5 9 37 43 21 Clyde 22 8 4 10 63 61 20 Abercorn 22 6 5 11 44 59 17 St Mirren 22 5 5 12 43 60 15 Cambuslang 22 2 6 14 21 53 10 Vale of Leven 22 0 5 17 24 99 5\n\nThe League expanded to encompass Division 2 in 1893-94 and following a poor season Clyde were in it, but thankfully only for one season. Professionalism was also adopted in 1893 after a fierce debate and the path of modern football was set. Clyde\u2019s seven League seasons up until 1898 were largely mediocre but a Glasgow Cup final was reached in 1892. Celtic were the opponents and hammered Clyde 7-1.\n\nOne competition where Clyde excelled was the North Eastern Cup organised by the North Eastern FA in the city of Glasgow. This cup was open to all in the North and East areas of the city with the first final being played in 1882. Clyde eventually claimed the cup on 4th April 1891 with a 3-2 victory over Northern at Celtic Park in front of 10,000 spectators. Between1893-95 three more cups were won before the competition ended. The last cup victory, a 4-0 victory over Northern, was witnessed in front of only 1000.\n\nOver their first twenty years of existence Clyde FC became part of the fabric of Bridgeton sporting culture. Formal club business meetings were held in Bridgeton and reported in the national press. A Dundee newspaper provided the following information on 18th May 1897:\n\nCLYDE\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING\n\nThe annual meeting of the Clyde Football Club was held in the Bridgeton Cross Public Hall, Canning Street, Glasgow, last night \u2013 Mr J Blackadder, President, in the chair. Proceedings opened with the reading of the minutes of the last annual meeting, this being followed by the reading of the secretarial and financial reports, both of which, although anything but gratifying documents, were ultimately adopted. The Secretary stated that 38 matches had been played, 12 won, 25 lost and 1 drawn. The Treasurer\u2019s report showed that the Club had incurred a loss on the season\u2019s working of \u00a3724 odd. This however did not include the transactions of the Bazaar Committee, the Secretary of which stated that the bazaar had yielded something over \u00a3500; that the Committee had cleared off \u00a3333 of debt, and that they still had a surplus on hand of over \u00a3223. Taking these figures into consideration, the actual debt of the Club at the present time is \u00a3266 19s 6d, this amount being a good few pounds less than stood against the Club at the commencement of the season. Forty-four members intimated their resignation from the Club, which thus leaves the total membership at 112.\n\nIf nothing else, this detailed report shows how little circumstances have changed in the 115 years since it was written.\n\nWith League football an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and simply couldn\u2019t cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League. The lease on Barrowfield was also due to expire which forced the club\u2019s hand. With hindsight it seems obvious Barrowfield\u2019s owners were keen to redevelop the area for industrial or commercial use.\n\nThe solution lay directly across the Clyde on some open ground known as Shawfield. The nearby Rutherglen Bridge had been rebuilt between 1893 and 1896, improving access between the sites. Another meeting in 1897 resulted in a proposal for the formation of Clyde Football and Athletic Company Limited. It was envisaged the incorporation of the club, with issuing of shares, would largely finance the move across the river. The proposal was adopted and the move to Shawfield was set in motion.\n\nOn 6th May 1898 the papers noted the formation of a new company:\n\n\u201cClyde Football and Athletic Club Limited acquiring the whole property and rights of Clyde Football Club \u2013 capital \u00a35000 in shares of \u00a31.\u201d\n\nClyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield finishing bottom of Division 1. However, as automatic relegation wasn\u2019t yet adopted, Clyde\u2019s allies decided to keep them in the top flight. The final action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30th April 1898 ending in a 3-3 draw. At a stroke Clyde transformed from Brigtonians to Shawfielders."}, {"url": "http://ptearlyyears.net/1900s/1900-01", "page_content": "1900-01\n\nAnother First Division challenge\n\nTop clubs threaten to break away from Scottish League\n\nTragedy befalls top player\n\nView season statistics\n\nThe Partick Thistle committee and members were quick to start their preparations for their second attempt to establish themselves as members of Scotland\u2019s top division following their Second Division championship win and subsequent promotion.\n\nTom Hyslop (who had been with Stoke the previous season) and William Dunlop had moved from Rangers while William Haggart and Tom Gibbons had arrived from Aston Villa and Third Lanark respectively. Gibbons had received several good offers from England, while Haggart\u2019s transfer cost \u00a350. Walter Fairgrieve (from Hibernians), James Henderson (from Annbank after an unsuccessful spell with Liverpool) and Alexander Kay (St Bernards) made up the remainder of the high-profile close-season signings.\n\nPromising junior Tom Harvey was tempted away from Irvine Meadow where he had been since the club\u2019s inauguration in 1895, and had been the mainstay of the team in the previous season. Well regarded in Ayrshire, he was presented with a gift of appreciation from his fellow players as he left for Glasgow. He had received tempting offers from several other important clubs. Tom was to play over 200 times for Thistle.\n\nMilo in the Evening Times felt that the committee had been approaching the new season in the right way. \u201cI am pleased to learn that the PT are fully alive to the supreme importance of entering upon a second essay in first league rivalry with a greatly improved team. It was the utter disregard of that precaution that led to their degradation two years ago. They have already secured Hyslop and Dunlop of Rangers and Gibbons of the Third Lanark and they mean to have more of the same stamp. These, with the addition of several of last year\u2019s players, such as Goudie, should go far to place them in a respectable middle-mark position.\u201d This strategy of signing experienced players was in contrast to the last time they had reached the First Division, when there was a reliance on youngsters and local players.\n\nHowever, all of Thistle\u2019s pre-season preparations were thrown in disarray when a serious challenge to the structure of the Scottish League was raised by Celtic. A number of First Division clubs were unhappy that the League had been managed in the previous year by a committee made up of representatives of First and Second Division clubs, rather than the previous arrangement where both divisions were effectively autonomous. Seven of the ten First Division clubs threatened to break away from the Scottish League unless the lower division\u2019s influence was removed. There was a concern that the Second Division clubs could impose their will on the First Division teams until Mr Connell of Thistle pointed out that the lower division teams all aspired to join the top teams so would do nothing to seriously jeopardise that. Thistle, Hearts, and curiously Rangers, were the clubs who were happy with the status quo, although Rangers stance may have been affected by allegations that the English League were trying to persuade leading Scottish clubs to join their league.\n\nThreat and counter-threat were issued until an agreement was reached which saw each division being run by the member clubs \u2013 effectively the structure which has existed until 1899 when the Management Committee was initiated.\n\nThere was one conspicuous change: Queen\u2019s Park, who had previously refused to join the professional league, had applied and been accepted straight into the top division. There were suggestions that they needed the guaranteed income that the league would offer as they had over-extended themselves building the new Hampden.\n\nEleven clubs was a strange number for a league competition. Clubs would have been aware that at the end of the season moves would be made to increase numbers (the Evening Times suggested that the league should be extended to include teams from Fife, Falkirk, Aberdeen, Dumbarton and Perth) or more likely lose a club. Although there was no automatic relegation, the bottom three clubs would have to re-apply for membership for next season, and there was likelihood that the bottom team would lose their top division status. This was huge pressure before the season started for Thistle.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Partick, preparations continued for the start of the season. Formal training began at the end of July but some players kept themselves fit. To encourage regular attendance gold albert watch chains were awarded to Andrew Wilson, David Proudfoot and William Goudie by trainer John Nutt and assistant William McDonald. Crowds approaching 3000 had been attracted to watch sessions.\n\nOther players and members formed a cricket team inspired by match secretary James Gilchrist. William Freebairn and Tom Hyslop were notable players for the cricket team throughout the summer. Hyslop, Tom Gibbons and David Campbell took part in the professional footballers sprint at the Third Lanark sports day.\n\nAt the Partick Police Sports at Meadowside, Thistle won the five-a-side competition, beating Rangers in the final. The day also included ball putting, a ladies bicycle race, hammer throwing, wrestling, piping, dancing, a wheelbarrow race, and a highly competitive tug of war which drew teams from across Scotland.\n\nTom Atherton, a forward previously with Raith Rovers, was bought from St Bernards. Goalkeeper Daniel Fletcher had caught a chill when camping, and was confined to his house. Tom Wilkie was signed, also from St Bernards, to replace him. Thistle had failed in an audacious bid to sign Scotland goalkeeper Harry Rennie earlier in the summer.\n\nAugust\n\nThe Evening Times previewed the club\u2019s season.\n\nThe Partick Thistle begin the season with brighter and better prospects than they have experienced for many a long day. Having once more earned well-merited promotion to the First Division of the League, the officials are quite determined to make their place there a permanency. If this is not the case, it will not be the blame of the managers, for few clubs, on promotion, have shown the same enterprise in securing class players. With the well-balanced team that won the Second Division championship some clubs would have been content, but the Thistle, from former experience, recognise that there is a vast gulf between First and Second League football, and they now claim to have the strongest team that has ever represented the club. Whenever their promotion was assured, they set about their work with a method, and it is satisfactory to them that they have secured almost all the men they were in quest of. In this connection , money was not spared in order that they might have the best procurable, and not a few clubs have been surprised at the boldness and importance of the captures made, for which the committee have earned for themselves the highest encomiums of press and public for the ability and tact displayed. Even the \u2018great\u2019 Rennie was angled for, and probably would have been fixed for Meadowside if the Thistle had seen their way to pay close-season wages. Although in a fairly good financial condition, the club was not prepared to meet the transfer fees demanded, and on this being put to the membership, several gentlemen at once came forward with a guarantee of \u00a3400 to procure talent, which was a proof of the confidence placed in the management. The following is the official list of players signed up to date, with negotiations pending on two others. Goal \u2013 Fletcher and Wilkie (late St Bernards); backs \u2013 Kay (St Bernards), Haggart (Aston Villa), R.Campbell and Wilson; half-backs \u2013 Proudfoot, Bryce, Goudie, Dunlop (Rangers) and Harvey (Irvine Meadow XI); forwards \u2013 D.Campbell, Freebairn, McNicoll, Hyslop (Rangers), Gibbons (Third Lanark), Henderson (Annbank), Fairgrieve (Luton) and Atherton (St Bernards). This is amateur Paul\u2019s twentieth season with the Thistle \u2013 surely a record \u2013 and he will be at hand when he is required to help the club, of which he is such an old and faithful member. This is a capital list, and if the players enter into their work with the same confidence as was the case last season, success is sure to follow. The only difficulty to be faced is how to use the players to the best advantage.\n\nEx player John Proudfoot (David\u2019s brother) had returned to Glasgow to get married and he met up with some of his old Thistle friends. His old mates persuaded him that returning to Meadowside was a good idea, and offered to pay the transfer fee themselves. Proudfoot would have been a worthwhile addition but Everton were reluctant to let him go.\n\nBy the start of the season Thistle had 19 professional players registered with the SFA. Only Dundee had more: 23, while Rangers made do with 16 and Celtic 15. Celtic and Rangers were unsurprisingly favourites for the championship.\n\nThe new players weren\u2019t the only change at Meadowside. The Committee were reported as thinking that an aesthetic change, as well as a sporting change, might bring some good luck, and announced that they had exchanged the dark blue strip for a new jersey of yellow and black hoops. They were quickly christened the Wasps.\n\nThe first game of the season was a league game against Celtic at Parkhead and Thistle relied almost entirely on their new players, lining up with eight new men. The team was Wilkie, Kay, Haggart, Harvey, Proudfoot, Goudie, Freebairn, Gibbons, Henderson, Hyslop and Fairgrieve. Hopes were indeed high. Scottish Sport reported that \u201cthe [Thistle] brake clubs, bugles, banners and all, were out in full force\u201d.\n\nThistle started the game well and Tom Gibbons became the first player of the season in Scotland to score a goal when he opened the scoring from a Freebairn pass. \u2018Long Tom\u2019 Hyslop scored a second and Thistle held a surprising two nil lead at half time. Celtic came back into the game, and despite Wilkie, Haggart and the half-back\u2019s best efforts, equalised the game. Thistle were dispirited for a time and a Kay mistake allowed Celtic to take the lead but with a few minutes left Walter Fairgrieve levelled the scoring again.\n\nThe 3-3 draw was described as \u201cimmense\u201d by Scottish Sport, while the Evening Times suggested that \u201ca repetition of this form will see Thistle in a good place in the table\u201d.\n\nThe visit to Parkhead was followed the next night with a trip to Ibrox where most of the players who had missed the league match got a game in a friendly match for what was regarded as a 2nd XI, against a powerful Rangers team. Rangers began well and were two up, but Thistle came back to draw the game. It was another hugely impressive performance. The defence played well \u2013 \u201cinartistic in clearing but determined and safe,\u201d said the Evening Times, while Hyslop played well in his second game in two days. Team: Mackie, R.Campbell, Wilson, Bryce, Dunlop, McDonald, Freebairn, D.Campbell, Atherton, Hyslop, Wylie.\n\nThe first game at Meadowside was a league game against Kilmarnock and the same players that played at Parkhead lined up, with the exception of Kay who was replaced by Andrew Wilson. Mrs Connell, wife of club president George Connell, ran the championship flag up the flag pole in front of 6000 supporters. Gate takings were \u00a3129.\n\nScottish Sport summed up the game. \u201cFor the first 15 minutes the Thistle looked like masters, then they drooped and they drooped and they drooped. Partick Thistle were not beaten by superior football \u2013 as a matter of fact they showed cleverer manipulation \u2013 it was the pace that killed. Kilmarnock romped and roamed and checked and charged with astonishing vigour, and poor Thistle could not follow.\u201d It was a blow to trainer Nutt who had worked hard on the players\u2019 fitness. Willie Freebairn and David Proudfoot both missed penalties before David Hyslop scored a late goal. \u201cIt was a wilful waste and the wasters will require to hop about a bit livelier and so prevent further disaster\u201d reported the Sport.\n\nImprovement wasn\u2019t immediate. Following a friendly draw with Abercorn was a trip to play St Mirren. The home team started strongly and were quickly 2-0 up. Thistle, though, kept their heads, and after yet another missed penalty, equalised through Hyslop and Atherton. Thistle continued playing well for much of the second half and looked likely winners until Wilkie let a soft goal in. St Mirren went on to score two more and Thistle left another game with nothing despite good periods of play.\n\nRobert Campbell had been the outstanding Thistle defender, despite playing out of position at right half. There was concern expressed from several of the newspapers that the excess of available players was a problem, and the committee didn\u2019t know the best way of using the talent at the club \u2013 15 players had been used in the first four games. Experimenting should be done cautiously. The Ladderman in the Sport suggested that Thistle shouldn\u2019t panic despite some disappointing results, pick their best eleven and stick with them. One consolation the Ladderman pointed out \u2013 the club were making money.\n\nCeltic (A) League 3-3\n\nRangers (A) Friendly 2-2\n\nKilmarnock (H) League 1-2\n\nAbercorn (H) Friendly 1-1\n\nSt Mirren (A) League 2-5\n\nClyde (H) Friendly 1-1\n\nSeptember\n\nWith the large number of players available Thistle arranged two friendly matches for the first Saturday in September and the players should have got a boost from the first team\u2019s 5-2 win over Dumbarton and the reserves 4-0 win over Kings Park.\n\nTom Gibbons didn\u2019t play in either game as he had been hospitalised, to undergo an operation for an \u2018internal trouble\u2019. The Evening Times reported that it was a routine operation, though it might be as long as a month until he could play again.\n\nGibbons\u2019 forward colleague Tom Hyslop\u2019s appearance against Rangers in the next game was raising interest as he lined up against his old team-mates. Thistle began the game strongly, as they had in previous games, and playing \u201ca strong bustling game, their object being to prevent their opponents dropping into their neat passing game\u201d they were successful in holding Rangers to a 0-0 score at half-time. \u201cThey have plenty of height and weight, qualities which stood them in good stead at close quarters,\u201d said the Glasgow Herald. The first half was remarkable for excellent play from both goalkeepers. The second half was more open and Rangers were on the attack with many more chances than Thistle, but Wilkie kept most of them at bay. Man of the day Hyslop combined well with left winger Atherton and Thistle scored, but a late mistake by Wilkie let Rangers snatch both points.\n\n\u201cA more spirited or determined opposition than Saturday\u2019s experience at Partick has not been offered the champions for many a day. The Thistle seemed strung up for the occasion and knocked the Rangers completely off their usual game. Not since the opening of the competition have the Thistle forwards wrought so well together, and had they only been able to make use of the opportunities afforded them, they and not their opponents would have secured the points,\u201d reported the Daily Record.\n\nHopefully the improved performances and results in September would continue, and Thistle had been strong favourites for the next game since the draw, a Glasgow Cup tie. Normal Athletic v Partick Thistle had been drawn to be played at Titwood, but with neighbours Queen\u2019s Park playing at home on the same day, the game was switched to Meadowside. Athletic performed better than expected but Thistle were comfortable 2-0 winners.\n\nThe Thistle committee\u2019s ambition of investing in players to stay in the First Division had been widely applauded but after just a month of the season some players were released on cost grounds. James Henderson, David Campbell and James Bryce were let go.\n\nThere was a familiar pattern to the next league game, at Kilmarnock. Thistle started the better team, and were all over Kilmarnock, but couldn\u2019t make their dominance count with goals. Hyslop scored Thistle\u2019s goal in the 1-2 defeat, but it was two other team-mates that caught the eye of the Sport. \u201cAtherton and Freebairn played together and pleased Thistle supporters beyond measure with their pretty display. Atherton had the Kilmarnock defence beaten all over, friend and foe voting him the best forward on the field. If Freebairn hadn\u2019t forgotten the way to score, these two little \u2018uns would make things hum a bit.\u201d The estimated thousand Thistle fans left the game disappointed again.\n\nAfter five games, a quarter of the league season, only Hearts were below Thistle. Thistle had managed one draw. Hearts had lost all of their games.\n\nThistle rarely played games on holidays, but were persuaded to play their league game against Hibs on holiday Monday afternoon. Rangers were also at home that day and the kick-offs were staggered to allow attendance at both games thanks to the cross-river ferries.\n\nIt would have been a rough crossing as Glasgow was hit by high winds, and the conditions helped Hibs to take a one goal lead at half time. During the break the wind died down and Thistle didn\u2019t get the same assistance from the weather. Atherton again performed well but Thistle\u2019s inability to score cost them again. \u201cThe Partick Thistle forward line could stand improvement. Against the Hibernian their play was individual and disjointed and there were very few instances of combined or concentrated effort. Where goals have to be got individual brilliance must be sacrificed to combination,\u201d said the Sport.\n\nWhile many of Thistle\u2019s poor results had been attributed to poor forward play, there was a feeling amongst the newspapers that luck hadn\u2019t been on Thistle\u2019s side either \u2013 four of the five defeats had been by a single goal. Against Third Lanark at Meadowside the luck seemed to change, although the Daily Record also suggested it was due to \u201cshooting at goal instead of passing \u2026 and it paid off\u201d. The forward line included Willie Paul, Willie Freebairn and George McNicoll, who tellingly weren\u2019t new players, and it was McNicoll in particular who caught the eye, scoring Thistle\u2019s third in a 3-1 win, the first in the league.\n\nDumbarton (H) Friendly 5-2\n\nRangers (H) League 1-2\n\nNormal Athletic (H) Glasgow Cup 2-0\n\nKilmarnock (A) League 1-2\n\nHibernian (H) League 0-1\n\nThird Lanark (H) League 3-1\n\nOctober\n\nHad the luck changed? A trip to play fellow strugglers Hearts might be the perfect game to build upon the previous win. Scorer McNicoll was replaced by new signing James Chalmers, who had joined from Beith after spells with Sunderland and Notts County, and he made an instant impact on the left wing. \u201cChalmers may turn out to be a daisy. His passing against Hearts indicated he will be an acquisition,\u201d said the Sport. However, it was on the right that the goals came from. Tom Atherton scored two goals and Willie Freebairn scored a third.\n\nThe following game was a Glasgow Cup tie against Clyde and Thistle were regarded as favourites, and for the first time a newspaper report mentioned Thistle\u2019s superiority in front of goal. Freebairn scored his fourth goal in three games as Thistle came from behind to beat Clyde comfortably and qualify for the semi final.\n\nThis boost in form saw a couple of Thistle players suggested for the forthcoming Glasgow v Sheffield challenge match. Alexander Kay had played in every league game since missing the first game of the season, while it was proposed that Willie Freebairn might revive his old partnership with ex Thistle player John Campbell who was now with Rangers. The eventual team didn\u2019t include any Thistle players, and lost 1-3.\n\nThe three game winning run came to a juddering halt against Third Lanark and again it was failings of the forwards that was to blame. Atherton was missing, replaced by Willie Paul, and despite a good performance in the first half, the second period was a disaster and Thirds won the game 1-0. It had been another inconsistency performance, made the more frustrating by the previous good results. The Sport reported \u201cThere is a slackness about Thistle\u2019s forwards which is accountable, for they know the game, and can play it \u2013 sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe semi final draw for the Glasgow Cup had given Thistle an easy path to the final, while the two best teams left in the competition, Third Lanark and Rangers, were drawn together. Thistle\u2019s game against Cameronians was played at Maxwell Park and Thistle won comfortably 3-0 to reach the final, which would be played against Rangers at Parkhead. Willie Freebairn scored one of the goals, but received a kick which would prevent him from playing in the final.\n\nHeart of Midlothian (A) League 3-1\n\nClyde (H) Glasgow Cup 3-1\n\nThird Lanark (A) League 0-1\n\nCameronians (A) Glasgow Cup 3-0\n\nNovember\n\nThe Scottish League announced that neutral linesmen would be used in league games in the future. Previously linesmen had been provided by the two competing clubs. The linesmen would be paid 10s 6d and a 3rd class train ticket for each game. Views were mixed \u2013 the Daily Record thought that the change should improve general conduct in games and would help referees while the Sport thought it an expensive luxury. Neutral linesmen didn\u2019t last long, and had been dispensed with come 1902 \u201cin the interests of economy rather than impartiality.\u201d\n\nThe Glasgow Cup Final against Rangers would be played at Parkhead for the first time and admission prices were reduced to league prices for what was reckoned to be an unappealing and mismatched fixture. The Evening Times were scathing, reckoning the final would be the poorest for seven years and mentioning the \u201cfeebleness of the entire Thistle team\u201d. The dismissal of Thistle\u2019s chances was in contrast to the praise they received just two months earlier when they almost held Rangers to a draw at Meadowside.\n\nPrior to the final the Thistle players had a chance to measure themselves against the Rangers players in the return league game at Ibrox. The Daily Record reported that Thistle were keen to play their first choice team against Rangers in both games, but that the preferred forwards might not be available. However, given the weekly changes in the forward line its difficult to imagine that the committee actually knew what their preferred forwards were. George McNicoll replaced Willie Freebairn at inside right \u2013 McNicoll\u2019s fifth position of the season. Freebairn hadn\u2019t recovered from a chest complaint after being injured against Cameronians.\n\nDick Crawford, Dunfermline\u2019s left back, surprised Thistle\u2019s critics by playing at centre forward and opening the scoring but Rangers gradually became the better team, and walked over Thistle in the second half to win comfortably 4-1. The Partick Press thought that Thistle now knew what was needed to win the Glasgow Cup.\n\n\u201cI believe they will make a better show against Rangers. I have no doubt that the Thistle officials will make the necessary changes to strengthen the team, as the defence was rather weak. Not much improvement could be made to the forwards, their only fault being keeping the ball to themselves a little too much, especially in the second half. Each apparently felt anxious to have the honour of scoring, with the result that scoring was an unknown quantity.\u201d\n\nThe forward line, praised the previous week, was changed. John Muirhead, an untried junior from Duntocher played, and full back Robert Campbell was tried at centre forward. Perhaps there was nothing to lose after the previous week\u2019s defeat but the changes seem unorthodox. It was a poor game, spoiled by terrible weather, and followed a similar pattern to the previous league game. When the weather improved at the start of the game the crowd increased and Rangers took control in the second half. Rangers were never in any danger of losing, and Thistle, listless and slow, only scored with five minutes remaining through Hyslop.\n\nThe 1-3 defeat was a disappointment, though perhaps no surprise. Also unfortunate was the news that Thistle had lost money in the tournament. Games against Normal Athletic and Cameronians hadn\u2019t pulled crowds.\n\nWhile poor play had undoubtedly contributed to Thistle\u2019s position at the bottom of the division, two points below Hearts and Queen\u2019s Park, but so had injuries to key players. William Haggart had been injured at Ibrox, while Tom Gibbons had been out for a while. Tom Hyslop had been injured at work, while Willie Freebairn was progressing from his injury, but wasn\u2019t quite ready yet. Envious glances might have been made at the Woolwich Arsenal reports in the papers \u2013 John Blackwood, who had moved to Arsenal in the close season, was scoring regularly in the English Second Division.\n\nCampbell moved back from the forward line to replace Haggart against Dundee, while John Cameron of Rangers became the ninth centre forward to be tried by Thistle. Cameron played well but there were suggestions that his move was a temporary one. He scored the goal in a 1-1 draw.\n\nJust four days earlier Willie Freebairn was reported as \u201cnot quite ready\u201d to return to the team so it was a shock to all his friends when his death was reported, in the Evening Times on 19 November.\n\nDEATH OF A FOOTBALL PLAYER Willie Freebairn, a member of Partick Thistle FC, died in the Western Infirmary this forenoon. The recently deceased underwent an operation for an inward trouble, but failed to survive the ordeal.\n\nHe had been kicked in the chest in the game against Cameronians and underwent an operation from which he didn\u2019t recover. It was doubly tragic news \u2013 Willie was engaged and due to be married on 28 December.\n\nWillie Freebairn was 26 and had joined his local club at the age of 19 with his brothers Archie and David, playing 63 games and scoring 27 goals before finishing his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and following his brothers down south, where he signed for Leicester Fosse. He later returned to Scotland for a spell with East Stirlingshire before returning to Partick Thistle, playing 59 times and scoring 36 goals.\n\n\u201cA well known person in football circles in the person of William Freebairn, of the Partick Thistle FC, died on Monday. Freebairn had been suffering from some trouble which necessitated his undergoing an operation, and for this purpose he entered an infirmary [the Western Infirmary]. On Sunday he went under an operation from which he never rallied. As a player Freebairn was a skilful forward and was esteemed by all for his many good qualities.\u201d\n\nOn 22 November the funeral was held. The funeral party walked from the Freebairn home in Dumbarton Road near Whiteinch Cross to Byres Rd and was then driven to Western Necropolis. Local shops were closed in respect. Representatives from East Stirlingshire, Rangers and Morton were in attendance.\n\nWhen William Freebairn died a poem was published in tribute. A copy was retained by his old team-mate John Proudfoot until his death in 1934. Click here for the poem.\n\nHaving buried their team-mate two days earlier it\u2019s unlikely that the Thistle players were in the best frame of mind for a relegation battle against Queen\u2019s Park, but that\u2019s what they had to face. Tom Gibbons returned but to little effect. The teams were equally matched, with the only difference being in front of goal \u2013 Thistle were terrible and the Queen\u2019s goalie had nothing to do. The Partick Press expressed some of the local disappointment. \u201cPartick Thistle still figure at the bottom of the league, and will remain there for some time to come unless they show great improvement in their play. The team from which so much was expected when they secured such men as Hyslop and Gibbons, is coming far short of their supporters\u2019 ideal.\u201d Thistle were now three points behind at the foot of the table and struggling.\n\nRangers (A) League 1-4\n\nRangers (Parkhead) Glasgow Cup Final 1-3\n\nDundee (H) League 1-1\n\nQueen\u2019s Park (A) League 0-2\n\nDecember\n\nAn away game against the team top of the league probably isn\u2019t the most likely game to get back to winning, and true to form Thistle lost the game at Parkhead 2-6. However, the game wasn\u2019t as one-sided as you might think. For the first hour Thistle played as well as they had done all season but ultimately they were unable to stay the pace. Goals from Hyslop and Muirhead brought them back after going 0-2 down early on, but when Celtic upped the pace in the second half Thistle couldn\u2019t respond. Not for the first time was the blame pointed at the forwards. \u201cHyslop never played a worse game than that of Saturday. The front rank of the Thistle was weak and the sooner the committee strengthen the weak spots and build up a strong front rank, the sooner they will pull themselves out of the slough of despond into which the team has fallen.\u201d James Lamont, the old Thistle favourite, who had left the club in 1897 for Bedminster, and then Bristol Rovers, returned to the team.\n\nThree points behind second bottom with only seven games left, things needed to improve. \u201cUnless they secure a few wins now in their remaining matches they will be in a very bad position in the league,\u201d sighed the Partick Press. The next four games were against the teams directly above them in the league. If there was to be a push to move up the table it would need to start now.\n\nNow was an away game against Morton and injuries deprived the team of Haggart and Goudie. Proudfoot had declared himself unfit but was forced to play when Lamont was unable to deputise for Goudie. Hyslop moved to left half to fill the gap. The game was even, Wilkie playing well but unable to stop Morton leading 2-1 at the interval. In the second half Thistle played a \u2018rushing game\u2019 and equalised through an own goal before converted defender Campbell, all \u201cpluck, dash and inexperience\u201d scored the winner with just five minutes remaining.\n\nThe Partick Press sensed a shift in fortunes as the gap with Queen\u2019s Park was closed to a point. \u201cNow that Thistle are on the upgrade let them go on and conquer in the remaining matches.\u201d\n\nThe optimism of Cappielow led to disappointment a week later when Hearts came to town and took away an important victory. The Partick Press had gone from hope to concern over whether Thistle would be wanted by their fellow clubs for next season. \u201cPartick Thistle are now in the slough of despond, as it is now certain that they will have to seek re-election for admission into the select circle of the first leaguers. Whether they will succeed to be re-elected is another question, as there are teams in the second league with extra good claims, and of course a tussle will ensue for admission or re-election, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nThe Thistle Second XI had reached the final of the Scottish Cup Final at Powderhall, but lost against Hearts 2-8. The team was Fletcher, Cunningham, Another, McDonald, Currie, Harvey, Wright, Crawford, Paul, Cleland, McNicoll.\n\nIf it looked unlikely that Thistle could escape the bottom three, and hence the re-election process, it was still possible to avoid last place. Next game up was a home match against second bottom Queen\u2019s Park with a two point gap. However, it was another poor performance which saw Queens with 4-1. \u201cTheir destiny is practically settled, and by their play last Saturday, they would have given their supporters the idea that they had resigned themselves to fate,\u201d groaned the Partick Press disappointedly.\n\nThe miserable year concluded at Dundee in a 0-4 defeat. \u201cThe glory hath departed from Meadowside. They now hold the lowly position of wooden spoonist of the league and are almost certainly to be regaled to the more suitable fare of the Second league.\u201d The last three teams in the division would have to re-apply and canvas votes to make re-inclusion next season a possibility. Even the most optimistic Thistle fan would struggle to make a case for the club to stay in the division.\n\nThe players continued north after the defeat in Dundee and played two friendlies, drawing 1-1 with Aberdeen and losing 3-4 to Inverness Clachnacudin over the New Year holidays. Athletic News described it as \u201ca very unsatisfactory holiday tour.\u201d\n\nCeltic (H) League 2-6\n\nMorton (A) League 3-2\n\nHeart of Midlothian (H) League 0-1\n\nQueen\u2019s Park (H) League 1-4\n\nDundee (A) League 0-4\n\nAberdeen (A) Friendly 1-1\n\nJanuary \u2013 May\n\nFinishing last in the league had been inevitable for some time, but it became mathematically impossible to avoid when Morton beat Thistle 2-1. \u201cThe result seals the doom for the Thistle,\u201d reported Athletic News. The league campaign ended with a defeat at Hibernians and an unexpected 5-3 win over St Mirren. It seemed certain that the relegation was follow \u2013 the only thing that might save them from a return to the Second Division would be an increase in the number of clubs to twelve for the top division. Most clubs, though, were keen to return to a ten team division.\n\nThe Athletic News had a different take on things, and made the case for the club to stay in the top division:\n\nAt the start of the present season when Partick Thistle, by virtue of having won the Second League Championship, had the good fortune to be elected to the First Division, the management set out to do themselves credit in the \u2018upper circle,\u2019 and the officials launched out the necessary capital to secure a capable team to uphold the honour of the old club. In this they were deemed successful by many of the most competent judges, and for a time matters went almost as smoothly as could be desired, the team in their opening game under League auspices taking a point from Celtic at Parkhead. Thereafter they were unlucky to lose by a goal against Kilmarnock at home after which they had a \u2018bad day\u2019 against St Mirren at Paisley. Following this they recovered nicely, and were only beaten by a goal against the Champions (Rangers) and by a like score against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park and Hibernians the following week. Things took a turn for the better, a victory over Third Lanark by 3-1 at Meadowside being followed by a visit to Tynecastle, when they secured full points off the Hearts by a like score. Just about this time they lost the services, through illness, of Tom Gibbons, one of their strongest forwards, who was off for about two months and ere he was fit to return they were deprived of the services, through death, of Willie Freebairn, one of the most brilliant forwards Partick has ever produced, while W.Haggart, their left back, was also injured in the knee at the same time. Added to this the failure of Hyslop and Chalmers to fulfil expectations, and the dismal luck of the Meadowside club was complete. In some quarters I know it is considered inevitable that the Thistle will be sent back to the lower division, but I trust the enterprise of the Thistle committee \u2013 although unsuccessful this season \u2013 will be more generously recognised, for surely a run of more unparalleled misfortune has never befallen a leading Scottish club, and I trust the League will give a generous consideration. At any rate, in consideration of the misfortunes that have fallen on the Meadowside club, and the pecuniary sacrifices of the officials who have all along honourably met the club\u2019s liabilities, I trust the League will retain the Thistle in the First Division.\n\nAround the conclusion of the league season there were a number of changes in personnel as the committee perhaps started to look at moving on some of the failures. Tom Hyslop, of whom so much was expected after his transfer from Rangers, was released from his contract just a couple of days before the first round of the Scottish Cup. His form had been a huge disappointment. He was to join the Yeomanry and shipped to the Boer War for a period, before returning and restarting his football career.\n\nDaniel Fletcher had returned to the first team during the New Year tour, replacing Wilkie in goals. The search for a centre forward continued, as it had throughout the season. Leading the forwards had been a problem position and come the end of the season thirteen players had been tried. William Reid was signed from Kilmarnock and John Spence from Partick Athletic juniors. Neither had the desired effect, although Spence\u2019s inclusion as a local boy was met with approval from the supporters, and he scored five goals in his first two games. His success prompted the committee to offer terms to Spence\u2019s inside left partner at Athletic, Andrew Alexander, but Alexander\u2019s success didn\u2019t mirror Spence\u2019s.\n\nEconomical approaches to personnel were the order of the day. Geordie McNicoll, long-serving William McDonald and Alex Crawford, the latter was only recently secured from Dunfermline juniors, left the club because of cost.\n\nJames Chalmers was another high-profile signing that hadn\u2019t worked out. He had joined Thistle after a fee of \u00a340 was paid to Notts County but had played for Beith for a period prior to joining Thistle while he looked for his next club. Only a couple of months after signing, and after only six appearances, Chalmers agreed with the committee that his play had been unsatisfactory as he was released. After a spell with Preston, Thistle wanted their money back and demanded a \u00a340 fee. Chalmers asserted that his agreement meant that he was a free agent, and also demanded his wages for the remainder of his contract. The SFA found in Chalmers favour \u2013 another failed transfer was credited to the Thistle committee.\n\nThe season continued at the conclusion of the league games and the first round of the Scottish Cup provided an intriguing tie. Wilkie, Kay and Atherton were returning to their old club as Thistle travelled to Powderhall to play Second Division leaders St Bernards. An away win might persuade the other First Division clubs that St Bernards didn\u2019t merit a place in the top division and save Thistle from relegation. However, as the Glasgow Herald reported:\n\n\u201cPartick Thistle\u2019s overwhelming defeat was the overwhelming surprise of the round, for although it was recognised that St Bernards stood the better chance of winning, no-one expected the downright runaway victory for the Powderhall team. To the friends of the Partick Thistle the score was all the more galling seeing as their football was every bit as good as the Saints up to a certain point, and to their poor show in front of and nearing goal their defeat must be put down.\u201d\n\nIn a season of poor performances this was surely one of the poorest.\n\nThe West of Scotland League and a series of friendlies would fill Thistle\u2019s calendar until the end of the season and the team that played the games from February until May was almost a completely different team \u2013 only Alexander Kay, Tom Harvey, Tom Gibbons and Tom Atherton played consistently from beginning to end. Still though, the poor results continued. In ten West League games only two were won and Thistle finished last in their second league campaign of the season.\n\nInverness Clachnacuddin (A) Friendly 3-4\n\nMorton (H) League 1-2\n\nSt Bernards (A) Scottish Cup 0-5\n\nHibernians (A) League 0-2\n\nAyr Parkhouse (A) Friendly 3-0\n\nSt Mirren (H) League 5-3\n\nThere was one positive note. Tom Atherton had been one of the few good performers throughout the season, and he was selected for the Scottish League\u2019s match against the Irish League at Grosvenor Park, Belfast. Although the selectors\u2019 choices were limited because the game was to be played on the same day as the Scottish Cup third round it was still an honour for the club to have a player represent his country. Scotland won 2-1 and although Atherton didn\u2019t score, he was a favourite with the Belfast crowd with his tricks and speed. He had lived in Belfast for 5 years before moving to Edinburgh.\n\nAt the end of the season Thistle were drawn into an international player dispute. After Peter McBride of Preston was injured in the annual Anglo-Scot international trial match in March, Preston negotiated with Thistle to take Tom Wilkie to Deepdale until McBride recovered. However, this type of temporary transfer was not allowed in the English League, and after Wilkie returned to Glasgow in April Preston were fined \u00a35 by the Football League.\n\nIf the season had been a disaster for the committee who selected the players, it had strangely been a successful one for treasurer George Easton, despite falling attendances (the takings at game against St Mirren in April barely covered the \u00a310 guarantee to the visitors). The club\u2019s debt had been reduced by \u00a3162, which pointed to good management by Easton. The club had contributed positively to the finances of the game, paying \u00a3369 to clubs visiting Meadowside as their share of gates, while Thistle received just \u00a3292 from the gates at their away games.\n\nTreasurer\u2019s statement\n\nIncome Expenditure Members subs \u00a3148, 16s, 6d Scottish Cup tie \u00a326, 14s, 10d Glasgow Cup ties \u00a3184, 11s, 6d \u00a352, 11s, 9d Scottish League at home \u00a31197, 9s, 5d \u00a3369, 0s, 5d Scottish League away \u00a3292, 3s, 1d Western League/friendlies home and away \u00a3212, 1s, 9d \u00a344, 2s, 1d Players wages \u00a3873, 1s, 1d Transfer fees \u00a3360\n\nAt the club\u2019s AGM the following were elected: William Ward (President), Richie Robertson (Vice-President), George Easton (Treasurer), John Gilchrist (General Secretary), James Gilchrist (Match Secretary, 13 Crow Rd). Committee: R.Little, AM.Smith, John McColl, WR.Mitchell, John L Robertson.\n\nThe final business of the season was the AGM of the Scottish League, where the vital voting would take place the decide the size and membership of the divisions for the following season. Thistle had all but given up hoping that they would stay in the First Division. Their best opportunity was in the proposal by Dundee, Hamilton Academical and Clyde to expand the division to twelve clubs. However, there was to be no reprieve \u2013 the clubs voted to reduce numbers back to a manageable ten which meant that a team would be relegated. Hearts and St Mirren were backed to stay and Thistle were demoted to play in the Second Division. There was no promotion for the Second Division clubs.\n\nA quick exodus began at Firhill. Alexander Kay departed for Sheffield United, but Thistle felt that the full backs that remained, William Haggart and Andrew Wilson (with Robert Campbell in reserve) would be sufficient for the Second Division. Tom Atherton signed for Dundee.\n\nComings and Goings\n\nAugust\n\nTom Wilkie joined from St Bernards\n\nAlexander Kay joined from St Bernards\n\nWilliam Haggart joined from Aston Villa\n\nWilliam Dunlop joined from Rangers\n\nTom Harvey joined from Irvine Meadow XI\n\nThomas Gibbons joined from Third Lanark\n\nJames Henderson joined from Annbank\n\nWalter Fairgrieve joined from Luton\n\nTom Atherton joined from St Bernards\n\nMurray joined from Forres Mechanics to play in two friendlies\n\nSeptember\n\nJames Henderson released\n\nDavid Campbell released\n\nJames Bryce signed for Abercorn\n\nOctober\n\nJames Chalmers joined from Notts County\n\nAlex Crawford joined from Dunfermline juniors\n\nWilliam Dunlop moved to Annbank\n\nJohn Muirhead joined from Duntocher\n\nNovember\n\nDavid Cameron joined from Rangers\n\nDecember\n\nJames Lamont joined from Bristol Rovers\n\nDavid Cameron returned to Rangers\n\nWilliam Reid joined from Kilmarnock for a \u00a330 fee\n\nJames Chalmers left Partick Thistle\n\nJanuary\n\nTom Hyslop left Partick Thistle (and later joined the army)\n\nWilliam Reid joined from Kilmarnock\n\nGeordie McNicoll left Partick Thistle (and later joined Port Glasgow Athletic)\n\nWilliam McDonald left Partick Thistle\n\nAlex Crawford left Partick Thistle\n\nFebruary\n\nJohn Spence joined from Partick Athletic\n\nAndrew Alexander joined from Partick Athletic\n\nJames Lamont joined from Bedminster\n\nHaldane joined from Paisley Academicals\n\nApril\n\nLang joined from Clydebank juniors\n\nLaw joined from Rockbank\n\nMcDonald joined from Petershill\n\nFerguson joined from Jordanhill\n\nMay\n\nAlexander Kay moved to Sheffield United\n\nTom Atherton moved to Dundee\n\nView season statistics\n\nReferences/Sources\n\nEvening Times July 1900 \u2013 June 1901\n\nDaily Record July 1900 \u2013 June 1901\n\nPartick & Maryhill Press July 1900 \u2013 June 1901\n\nScottish Sport July \u2013 Nov 2 1900\n\nGlasgow Herald July 1900 \u2013 Jun 1901\n\nBritish Newspaper Archive July 1900 \u2013 May 1901\n\nhttp://www.lfchistory.net\n\nhttp://scottishleague.net\n\nhttp://scottish-football-historical-archive.com"}, {"url": "https://blog.stevenkellow.com/scottish-league-champions-without-the-old-firm/", "page_content": "NOTE: The tables in this article were updated on the 15th May 2022 to include the results of the 2021/22 season.\n\nYet again, the fight for the title in Scotland is non-existent, as Celtic coast to another championship without any real challenge in the absence of Rangers. Even when Rangers were in contention, there hasn\u2019t been any serious third-party contender since Aberdeen in the 80s.\n\nHowever, beneath the Old Firm duo in the table, there is always a much more exciting battle being fought for 3rd place, or now for 2nd. Over the last fifteen years, 5 different teams have been second only to the Glasgow giants (or better than one in the case of Hearts in 2005/06). The top division of Scottish football would be more exciting without the domination of these two clubs.\n\nI decided to go through all league championships and compile a list of who would be Scotland\u2019s most successful clubs if you were to remove the Old Firm from the equation (including points earned against them) to show how much more dynamic the league title battle could have been.\n\nMy methodology was to go back through the league tables and remove results against both Celtic and Rangers from the teams at the top to see who was the best \u201cother\u201d team that season. In 40 seasons removing results against Old Firm teams changed the order of the top teams, so the actual runner-up or winner of the league might not be the winner without the Old Firm clubs. The results also take into account that before 1921/22, teams level on points shared the position, resulting in shared titles. Between then and 1971/72 goal average was used to separate teams, and from then on goal difference is used. 3 points for a win was introduced for the 1994/95 season. The 2019/20 season was also decided on a points-per-game basis due to the coronavirus pandemic which curtailed the season.\n\nAt the moment, there have only been 11 champions of Scotland in 123 seasons. This is because the Old Firm have won 105 between them (Rangers 54, Celtic 50). Without the Old Firm, there would be a total of 19 champions. For comparison, England has had 24 champions in its\u2019 footballing history.\n\nIn only 5 seasons have both the Old Firm clubs finished outside the top two sides, and in only 1 have neither finished in the top three (in 1964-65 when Rangers finished 5th and Celtic 8th). So removing them from contention changes the history of the game in Scotland significantly.\n\nHere is the current table of teams that have won or been runners-up in the top division in Scotland:\n\nWinners Runners-up Rangers 55 33 Celtic 52 32 Aberdeen 4 17 Heart of Midlothian 4 14 Hibernian 4 6 Dumbarton 2 0 Motherwell 1 7 Kilmarnock 1 4 Dundee 1 4 Dundee United 1 0 Third Lanark 1 0 Airdrieonians 0 4 Falkirk 0 2 Morton 0 1\n\nNote: includes shared title between Dumbarton & Rangers\n\nWithout the Old Firm, and the actual order of the all-time winners table changes only slightly at the top. Hearts would still be the most successful non-OF side in the country (a seldom highlighted fact), with Aberdeen and Hibs swapping places. Motherwell would win a total of 13 titles, which is 12 more than they\u2019ve actually won. Kilmarnock would have won 6 more titles; Dundee United would go up to 6 titles from 1, but would also come 2nd in the league 13 further times, which they have never achieved with the Old Firm in the mix. Morton would have won the league 5 times, Airdrie 4 times and Partick Thistle 3 times, something which they have not once managed. Falkirk, St. Mirren, Clyde, Dunfermline, St. Bernard\u2019s, Livingston and Raith Rovers would all have titles to their name that they don\u2019t at the moment. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that 8 teams would have won 5 or more titles, what could be considered a reasonable benchmark of historical success, whereas only Celtic and Rangers have managed this feat for now.\n\nHere\u2019s the table of winners and runners-up as it would be without the Old-Firm:\n\nWinners Runners-up Heart of Midlothian 27 24 Aberdeen 23 19 Hibernian 22 11 Motherwell 14 7 Kilmarnock 7 6 Dundee United 6 13 Dundee 5 5 Morton 5 3 Airdrieonians 4 4 Partick Thistle 3 5 Falkirk 2 3 St. Mirren 2 3 Clyde 2 2 Third Lanark 2 2 Dumbarton 2 0 Dunfermline Athletic 1 4 St. Bernard\u2019s 1 1 Livingston 1 0 Raith Rovers 1 0 St. Johnstone 0 4 East Fife 0 2 Ayr United 0 1 Cambuslang 0 1 Inverness CT 0 2 Queen of the South 0 1 Hamilton Accies 0 0\n\nNote: includes shared titles between Hearts/St. Bernard\u2019s, Hearts/St. Mirren, Clyde/Partick Thistle, Kilmarnock/Morton & Dundee/Hearts and shared runners-up positions between Dundee/Hearts, Hibs/Partick Thistle, Hearts/Hibs\n\nOther interesting feats that would be accomplished include:\n\nAn 8-in-a-row for Motherwell between 1926 and 1934\n\nA 5-in-a-row for Aberdeen between 2014 and 2019\n\nHibs winning a 4-in-a-row twice (1949-53 & 1972-76)\n\nAirdrie (1922-25), Hearts (1956-59), Kilmarnock (1966-69), Aberdeen (1979-82), Motherwell (2011-14) all achieving 3-in-a-rows.\n\nWith the Old Firm teams in contention, only three other teams \u2013 Dumbarton (1890-92), Hibs (1950-52) and Aberdeen (1983-85) have won two titles in a row.\n\nAlso of interest, Livingston would have won the league in their first-ever season in the Premier League in 2001-02 and Hearts would have pipped Dundee United to the title in 2010-11 by one goal on goal difference (as they scored one more goal).\n\nHere is a full summary of league titles in Scotland, including the non-Old Firm winner and runner-up and the actual winner and runner-up:\n\nSeason Non-OF Winner Non-OF Runner-Up Actual Winner Actual Runner-Up

coronavirus pandemic\n\nWith the much-discussed topic of Celtic and Rangers moving into other competitions, like competing in the English league system, dead in the water for several different reasons \u2013 it is only a hypothetical question as to how exciting Scotland\u2019s top football league would be without the two. But I think looking at the history books would show that for neutral and non-Old Firm fans that a top division without Celtic and Rangers would be far more exciting than with them."}, {"url": "https://www.clydefc.co.uk/matches/partick-thistle-v-clyde-07-03-2009/", "page_content": "Recap\n\nAfter a week of poor luck, disappointing results and worrying news off the field, Clyde at least gave their fans a weekend bonus with a battling display to take a crucial three points from Firhill; their first win over an Ian McCall led Partick Thistle side.\n\nWith Billy Gibson suspended and Pat Clarke injured, Clyde was left with a weakened squad but there was the pleasing boost of a return for Ricky Waddell who replaced Gibson in the starting line-up. This saw Mark Brown move to sweeper and Gregory Tade return to the middle of the pitch alongside new skipper Stuart Kettlewell. Fortunately for Clyde, Thistle were missing their own key players with John Robertson and Liam Buchanan missing out through injury.\n\nThistle started the match knowing a win could move them level with St. Johnstone at the top of the table and a set of rousing pre-match announcements appeared to have an impact as they dominated the first 20 minutes. Their first effort on goal saw left wing-back Mark Twaddle rise above Tony Stevenson but his weak header bounced straight to David Hutton. The goalkeeper\u2019s next involvement was somewhat more challenging as Gary Harkins moved onto a loose ball and fired in a powerful volley from 18 yards that Hutton superbly blocked.\n\nThe Bully Wee have had a reasonable amount of success in plundering the Junior leagues for players in recent years and Thistle have also been busy scouting at that level. In January they added young striker Kris Doolan from Auchinleck Talbot and he has responded with a series of predatory goals. He showed his attacking instincts by anticipating a through ball that seemed destined for Hutton\u2019s hands but his inventive lob looped over the crossbar. On the half hour mark, Doolan then met a Paul Paton free kick with a flicked header but the ball slid just past the post. Alan Lithgow then became the first man booked for sliding through the back of Simon Donnelly.\n\nAlthough both Ruari McLennan and Tade had half chances to shoot, Clyde failed to seriously trouble their opponents in the opening period. That said, the level of commitment and determination shown by the likes of Scott Gemmill, Kettlewell and Brown saw the travelling support applaud the team off at half-time.\n\nThe second half was to be a huge improvement, although Thistle carved out an early chance for Donnelly that thudded into the side netting. Clyde then created their first real chance as Gemmill bravely challenged for the ball with Alan Archibald, only to suffer a bang on the head. From the loose ball, Stevenson fired in a powerful volley that was destined for the top corner but Twaddle did well to head clear.\n\nDespite Clyde having marginally more possession, it was Hutton that was called into action next as Harkins wriggled clear and his near-post shot needed to be well blocked by the \u2018keeper. Then, Thistle carved out their best chance as the ball fell to Doolan in the box but with time and space to pick his spot, he rushed a shot straight at Hutton.\n\nThis was to be a key moment as within a minute, Clyde took a lead with the sort of goal that will take pride of place on football bloopers DVDs. Ian Maxwell was under little pressure in the right-back area but managed to over-hit his passback to Jonny Tuffey. The \u2018keeper tried to take a touch but calamitously only succeeded in slicing the ball into his own net.\n\nWith the lead, the Bully Wee suddenly had a new found confidence and Willie McLaren, who had struggled in the first half, came to life. Apart from a decent penalty shout when Brown slid into a challenge against Donnelly, this period of the game saw play flow towards Tuffey\u2019s goal, with the \u2018keeper noticeably affected by his error. McLaren and MacLennan both had shots blocked by defenders, whilst Tade was denied by a superb block from Simon Storey. Then, McLaren burst clear from the halfway line and he slid a neat pass into the box for Tade to run onto. The French midfielder did well to elude Storey but with only Tuffey to beat, he inexplicably thrashed a shot over the crossbar. During this period of pressure, Marvyn Wilson was brought on for the tiring Kettlewell.\n\nThistle\u2019s final effort on goal was to produce another stunning save by Hutton, with Paton looping an effort on target after good work by substitute Lucas Akins. Despite their need for three points, it was Clyde who came closest to scoring again in the final five minutes as the unbelievable effort of Gemmill saw him skip past Archibald but his drive was sliced into the side netting.\n\nRemarkably, Tuffey then almost produced a bigger blunder as he blasted a clearance against Gemmill, only for the Northern Ireland international to tackle substitute Dave McKay as he looked to burst clear. Clyde then played out the final couple of minutes at the corner flag and earned three points that, in terms of effort, were probably deserved.\n\nLike so many First Division games, this match lacked quality and skill with only McLaren providing some reasonable entertainment. However, Clyde competed well across the pitch from Gemmill\u2019s tireless running to the excellent efforts of Hutton. Mark Brown was arguably the star performer and Gibson has a fight on his hands to regain his spot in the team, whilst the return of Waddell gave the midfield five a good balance.
