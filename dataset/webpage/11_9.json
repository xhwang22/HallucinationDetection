View full image\n\nJust over 125 years ago, on October 30, 1893, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition was scheduled to end with closing ceremonies after a six-month run in Chicago. Created to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World, the fair was a showcase of American promise and achievement. And presiding over it was the city\u2019s popular mayor, Yale alumnus Carter Harrison Sr. \u201945. But the fair ended early when the mayor was assassinated on October 28.\n\nHarrison, who was related to US presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, was descended from early Virginia planters. According to the memoir of Carter Harrison Jr. \u201983LLB, who would match his father\u2019s record of five terms as mayor of Chicago, Harrison Sr.\u2019s years in New Haven changed him. \u201cFour years at Yale in a New England anti-slavery environment had confirmed his latent dislike for slavery,\u201d Harrison Jr. wrote. After two years of study and travel abroad, Harrison Sr. sold the 600-acre family plantation in Kentucky. Although he once wrote a relative that \u201cto sell a man is to me one of the most disagreeable things I could possibly do,\u201d Harrison also sold the enslaved people living there.\n\nIn 1855, after completing his law studies at Transylvania University and a honeymoon trip to Chicago, he and his bride \u201cknew where they wanted to live,\u201d in his son\u2019s words. \u201cThey had fallen in love with the lusty lake city.\u201d Harrison mainly devoted himself to Chicago real estate, but from 1874 to 1878 he served in Congress as a Democrat. During that period, in 1876, his wife died; they\u2019d had ten children, though six died early. He was elected mayor in 1879 and served until 1887\u2014the year his second wife died. During the year of the fair, Harrison was elected mayor for a fifth term.\n\nHarrison was known as a \u201ccommon man\u2019s mayor\u201d whose \u201cdoor was always open.\u201d He loved riding his white horse through Chicago neighborhoods, waving and stopping to shake hands. He was very proud of the fair, especially of its gleaming \u201cWhite City,\u201d which introduced neoclassical Beaux Arts architecture to America. (The fa\u00e7ades were painted white, and daylight was reproduced at night by brilliant electric illumination.) The fair also celebrated pioneering efforts to develop the telephone, photography, motion pictures, and the automobile.\n\nOn October 28, a young man called at Harrison\u2019s home. The maid showed him in, and the mayor, just up from an after-dinner nap, greeted his visitor in the hall. The stranger pulled out a gun and fired three times, mortally wounding Harrison.\n\nThe assassin, Patrick Eugene Prendergast, turned himself in at a nearby police station. In The Devil in the White City (2003), Erik Larson writes that Prendergast said he killed Harrison \u201cbecause he betrayed my confidence. I supported him through his campaign and he promised to appoint me corporation counsel. He didn\u2019t live up to his word.\u201d Prosecutors maintained that Prendergast was delusional but not insane. The jury agreed, and the verdict was \u201cguilty.\u201d A last appeal by Clarence Darrow for an inquest to commute the death sentence on grounds of insanity failed. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894.\n\nOn October 29, the celebratory close of the Exposition was canceled for a public memorial service. Harrison\u2019s funeral procession filled the city for an entire day. On the day of his death, Harrison had delivered his last public remarks\u2014at the fair\u2019s \u201cAmerican Cities Day,\u201d said to be the largest-ever gathering of American mayors. This final speech showed his pride in his adopted city: \u201cWhen the fire swept over our city and laid it in ashes in 24 hours, then the world said: \u2018Chicago and its boasting is now gone forever.\u2019 But Chicago said: \u2018We will rebuild the city better than ever\u2019 and Chicago has done it. . . . What is it now? The second city in America!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_harrison.html", "page_content": "Carter Harrison, Chicago Historical Society\n\nCarter Harrison was born in a log cabin in Kentucky in 1825. After attending Yale College and finishing law school, his disgust with the institution of slavery motivated him to move north, to Illinois. In Chicago, he made his money in real estate.\n\nHarrison was first elected as mayor in 1879 and ran the city with a... personal touch, much like aldermen \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin, or Edward F. (\"Foxey Ed\") Cullerton did. \"Bathhouse\" Coughlin, for example, was accused of having a profitable interest in the liquor store that supplied all the brotherls in the red light district of his ward.\n\nIn Chicago, the electorate expected a certain amount of corruption. \"Foxey Ed\" once ran on the idea that it was \"better [to] send back the man who has stolen enough already than to send in... a new man.\" On election day, some aldermen would give free drinks to anyone passing through (or passed out) in his district, in exchange for a vote. Still, when times were tough, the same aldermen were handing out free lunches to anyone who needed one, every day of the year.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, many people believed the Republican party to be patronizing and moralistic, and the Democrats more concerned with protecting \"individual liberties.\" Or, as one local pol put it: \"A Republican is a man who wants you to go t'church every Sunday. A Democrat says if a man wants to have a glass of beer he can have it.\" Harrison was a Democrat who let people have more than beer. \"This is a free town,\" he declared, and let the brothels and gambling parlors operate openly in the neighborhood called the Levee. By concentrating all the vice into one district, he checked its spread, and police patrols made sure that the businesses were fair and did not cheat their customers.\n\nHarrison supported and encouraged neighborhood ethnic saloons, local institutions that might function as meetinghouses, post offices and welfare offices in one. The saloon licenses also provided 12% of the city's revenue and paid for the electrical lines, streetcars, sewer pipes, fire and police stations that Harrison built. He was the first mayor to cater to the various ethnic groups in his city. On St. Patrick's Day he wore his finest green. Germans heard about his friendship with Bismarck. With Scandinavians he claimed a Viking heritage, and among blacks he recalled being raised by a \"colored mammy.\" He welcomed everyone to Chicago and did not try to acculturate them into Anglo-American society, the way Charles Hutchinson or Jane Addams did.\n\nEveryone who wanted a word with the mayor could come to his open morning office hours, and he would address their problems. He was a friend of organized labor, and gave health and factory inspector jobs to union leaders. Harrison was known to restrain police from breaking up strikes and supported the eight-hour workday. Because the mayor supported their cause, organizers of the national May Day general strike of 1886 focused on Chicago. Events escalated over the following days and violence broke out at Haymarket Square after the mayor left a rally there. After Haymarket, Harrison's leniency was cited disapprovingly as encouragement to the revolutionaries. He was voted out of office at the end of his fourth term.\n\nThen, as the World's Columbian Exposition was in preparation, Harrison made his comeback. He wanted to be mayor of Chicago for the most important event in its history. In his inaugural speech of 1893, he said:\n\n\"When years ago I stood before you, aldermen of Chicago, and took the oath which fitted me for this high office, Chicago had less than half a million population; to-day it is the sixth city on the face of the globe, the second in America in population, and the first city on earth in pluck, energy, and determination. Standing thus, I feel deep anxiety lest I may not fulfill the expectation of the vast majority of my fellow citizens who have honored me.\"\n\nThe fair was so successful that Harrison tried to keep it open for another season so that millions more people could come visit Chicago. In addition, he hoped the continued employment and infusion of tourist dollars would cushion Chicago from the looming economic depression. Two nights before the end of the fair, Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast, a lunatic demanding a city job, entered Harrison's home and shot him dead.\n\nA funeral procession of tens of thousands of Chicagoans followed Harrison's casket to Graceland Cemetery. Half a million stood in the street to watch as uniformed police officers and firemen, postal carriers and city clerks paraded by. Irish, German, Scandinavian, Polish and Italian communities all had representatives who marched. Union leaders mourned, as did the wealthy business elite who were Harrison's poker buddies."}, {"url": "https://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/legal/mayors/harrisonsr/", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison Senior, who served five terms and eight years as Mayor of Chicago until he was assassinated in 1893, came from a family which was, steeped in American history and political involvement dating back to 1635, when the patriarch of the Harrison family was Clerk of the Virginia Council. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great grandmother Susannah Randolph was a descendant of Pocahontas. What is remarkable, however, is that in Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s family line one finds a signator of the Declaration of Independence, and two U.S. Presidents. Carter Henry Harrison\u2019s great uncle, Benjamin Harrison not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but also introduced a resolution of independence to congress. One of Benjamin Harrison\u2019s sons, William Henry Harrison went on to become President of the United States in 1841, and President Harrison\u2019s great grandson Benjamin Harrison became President of the United States in 1889.\n\nWhile Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s father\u2019s side was noted for its politicians, his mother\u2019s side was distinguished for its soldiers. Carter Henry Harrison Senior\u2019s mother was Caroline Evalind, whose father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all notable soldiers in their time. Her great grandfather was an officer in the English Army, her grandfather was General William Russell famous for fighting the Indian Wars, and her father Colonel Russell, a cavalry captain, is credited for leading the attack in the Revolutionary War Battle, King\u2019s Mountain.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison Senior was born February 15th, 1825 to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Evalind. Although, Carter Henry Harrison Senior is known as \u201csenior,\u201d he is technically the III in his family to bear the name. He grew up in Elk Hill, Kentucky in a log cabin. His father died, shortly after his birth, and his mother schooled him until he was 15. At this time, he went to Lexington to study under Dr. Lewis Marshall who was the brother of Supreme Court Justice Thomas Marshall. In 1845 he began attending Yale, and after graduating at age 20, studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. After one year of law school, however, he decided to return home to live the life of a farmer on his family\u2019s plantation. In 1851, Harrison traveled Europe for two years where he began to develop an affinity for urban life. When he returned to the states he finished his law degree and graduated in 1853. The same year he married Sophonisba Preston and moved first to St. Louis and then finally to Chicago.\n\nAlthough Harrison intended to open a law office, he became involved in buying and selling real estate. However, a financial storm in 1857 affected him terribly and Harrison spent the next ten years trying to get on his feet financially. During this time, five of his children died in infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to move away from real-estate, Harrison made an unsuccessful attempt at running for the lower house of the State legislature, but it was not until the great Chicago Fire in 1871 that the catalyst for Harrison\u2019s life as politician would emerge. Harrison\u2019s support for the \u201cfire proof ticket,\u201d a ticket composed of both Democratic and Republican nominations for city offices, gained him a nomination and election as County Commissioner. After serving a three-year term as County Commissioner, Harrison decided to run again for congress. He was narrowly elected as the Democratic Representative for 44th National Congress, in March of 1875. Harrison quickly developed a reputation as a skilled orator, and was re-elected for a second term. During his re-election campaign his wife died suddenly of illness and Harrison immersed himself in his work. He served in congress until the end of his second term in 1878, and chose not to seek a third term. Harrison would lament later in life that he never fully enjoyed the life of a congressman. Harrison did not abandon statesmanship all together; in fact, he barely missed a beat. In the spring of 1879, Harrison was elected to be the mayor of Chicago.\n\nHarrison was elected to the office of mayor five times, serving from 1879-1887 and then again in 1893.. The time that Harrison served in office was a time of expansion and development for Chicago. When Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1855 the public revenue for taxation was slightly over $200,000; by the time of his death this number exceeded $15,000,000. Harrison was known, however, as a champion of people\u2019s rights. With railroads being built from one end of Chicago to the other, Harrison continually fought for workers\u2019 rights against the railroad companies that tried to usurp them. Harrison\u2019s commitment to the public is epitomized by his role in the Haymarket Riot. The night of March 4th, 1886 an unknown person threw a bomb at police officers during a workers\u2019 strike organized by local socialist party members. Harrison was quick to speak out against anti-socialist language in the media, not only saying that socialists did not sympathize with the bomb throwers, but also asserting that socialists represented the \u201cworkers, thinkers, and writers\u201d of the United States.\n\nHarrison made an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Illinois in 1884, and was only narrowly re-elected to his 4th term as mayor; he stepped down at the end of that term. Harrison decided he wanted to get back in public life, however, and ran for the mayorship unsuccessfully in 1891. Not to be easily dissuaded, however, he ran again, and was re-elected in 1893 in time to host the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. His term, however, was cut short by assassination. Two days before the World Fair opened, on October 28th, 1893, failed politician Patrick Eugene Prendergast killed Carter Henry Harrison in Harrison\u2019s home. Earlier that day Harrison had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d Carter Henry Harrison Senior was the first Chicago Mayor to serve five terms; the next Mayor of Chicago to serve as long a term, was his son Carter Henry Harrison II.\n\nNext: Johnny Powers\n\nSources:\n\nAbbot, Willis John.

He came here as a young man from his native Kentucky full of hope and vigor, and it was here that he rose to prominence by winning the city`s highest office, not once but five separate times. It was also here, on an October night in 1893, that he died, at age 68, the victim of an assassin`s bullets.\n\nHarrison was very much a man of his time. As with his adopted city, he was genial, robust and tolerant, a larger-than-life figure who embodied the best and the worst that the burgeoning metropolis had to offer. He was also the most contrary of men. Of aristocratic stock (President Henry Harrison was a relative), he was born in a humble log cabin but later, as mayor, lived in an elegant mansion in the most elite part of town. An honest man, his laissez- faire attitude as mayor helped create, in the words of one critic, ''the Gomorrah of the West.'' A popular politician, he was despised by reformers and the press alike. A worldly sophisticate, he also appealed to the common man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrison was first elected mayor in 1879, then re-elected in 1881, 1883 and 1885 (mayoral terms then were for two years). He ran again, as an independent Democrat, in 1891 but lost to Republican Hempstead Washburne. Washburne served only one term. As the city prepared for the 1893 World`s Columbian Exposition, held in honor of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, the citizens began looking for someone to symbolize their verve, celebrate their entrepreneurial success and exude the spirit of the New World. The Republican candidate, Samuel W. Allerton, was perfectly respectable but lacked the necessary spunk. Aware of the worldwide attention the city was about to get, Chicagoans for the fifth time chose the dapper Harrison as their leader.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1893, Harrison addressed a gathering of big-city mayors who had come to the fair from around the country. Proclaiming a new future he claimed to see on the horizon, he ironically said, ''I intend to live for more than a half-century, and at the end of that half-century London will be trembling lest Chicago shall surpass her.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe returned home that evening to his mansion at Ashland Avenue and Jackson Boulevard to enjoy a leisurely dinner with his youngest son, William Preston. Another son, Carter Henry Jr., was still at the fair. After a brief nap, Harrison received a visitor who had gained entry simply by telling a servant that he wished to have a word with the mayor. This was not unusual;\n\nthe mayor`s door was always open to all citizens. The visitor was Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a 25-year-old newspaper carrier who had illusions of becoming the city`s corporation counsel even though he was not a lawyer and his only legal ''training'' consisted of reading a popular legal tome, ''Every Man His Own Lawyer.'' Approaching the mayor and without saying a word, Prendergast pulled a six-shooter from his overcoat pocket and fired three shots at the mayor.\n\nHearing the shots, the family coachman raced into the room and saw Prendergast fire a final round at the mayor. The coachman then ran out to get his own revolver, but by the time he returned, Prendergast had vanished. William Harrison came in next and found his father lying across the doorway of a pantry passageway, moaning and bleeding profusely. W.S. Chalmers, president of the Allis-Chalmers steel company, who had rushed over from across the street upon hearing the shots and the ensuing commotion, helped William carry the mayor to a sofa. ''Chalmers,'' reportedly said the dying Harrison, ''this is death. I am shot over the heart.''\n\nMeanwhile, the assassin ran for several blocks, caught a streetcar, got off it and walked to the Desplaines Street police station, where he calmly told the desk sergeant that he had killed the mayor. Later, in a formal statement, Prendergast justified his action by saying: ''He deserved to be shot. He did not keep his promise to me.''\n\nThe assassination cast a pall over the city. ''Our Carter,'' the man who had been leader to a generation of Chicagoans, was gone. Mourners lined up outside the Harrison mansion into the night, talking, crying, trying to make sense out of a senseless act. At the world`s fair, the closing festivities were canceled, putting a mournful end to what had begun as a joyful celebration.\n\nPrendergast was convicted of murder and sentenced to die by hanging. ''I had no malice against anyone,'' he said as the noose was placed around his neck. The Harrison legacy, however, did not end with the mayor`s death. Mirroring his father`s political career, Carter Henry Harrison Jr. also served five terms as Chicago`s chief executive, establishing a family record unmatched in Chicago`s political history."}, {"url": "https://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/legal/mayors/harrisonjr/", "page_content": "Carter H. Harrison II was the 30th mayor of Chicago, in office from 1897-1905 and then again from 1911-1915. His father, Carter H. Harrison, also served as mayor of Chicago from 1879-1887. Harrison senior was re-elected 1893 for a fifth term, but was assassinated in his home by a failed politician named Patrick Eugene Prendergast on October 28th, 1893. Earlier that day Harrison Senior had announced in a speech \u201cI intend to live for more than half a century! And at the end of that half century London will tremble lest Chicago shall surpass her.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Daley family, (Richard Joseph Daley and Richard Michael Daley) are today noted for their domination of the Chicago political scene, the same can be said for the Harrison family in the late 19th and early 20th century. Both Carter H. Harrison Jr. and senior were elected to five terms in office accounting for 10 of 17 mayoral elections from 1879 until the outbreak of World War I. Carter H. Harrison Jr. greatly respected his father and resembled him in appearance and political policy.\n\nCarter Harrison Jr. was born on April 23, 1860 in Chicago. In 1873 Harrison\u2019s mother, who never took a liking to the Chicago lifestyle, took Harrison Jr. and his brother and sister to Germany. Harrison Jr. stayed in Germany with his brother and sister until his mother\u2019s death in 1876. Upon returning to Chicago, Harrison Jr. enrolled in a Catholic prep school where he received his high school and graduate educations. After graduating, Harrison Jr. chose to attend Yale Law School, the same place his father received his law degree.\n\nAfter Harrison Jr. graduated law school in 1883, he passed his time in Chicago working as a poet, and a journalist under the pseudonym Cecil H. Harcourt. During this time, Harrison developed a great respect for his father, and decided to carry on his legacy and run for the mayor of Chicago. Like his father Harrison appealed to the working class, but his elite upbringing also appealed to the Chicago\u2019s affluent community. He ran on a platform of progressive civic reform which was well received by the City\u2019s population, and in 1897 he was elected the 30th mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe largest controversy Harrison faced in his administration was known as the \u201cTraction Wars,\u201d traction referring to electric streetcar companies. In 1858 the Chicago City Council gave corporate rights to private streetcar companies to carry passengers on Chicago streets for profit. The original contract gave rights for twenty-five years, but in 1865 private companies received a ninety-nine year contract from a corrupt Illinois state legislature. A man named Charles Tyson Yerkes owned most of the streetcars in the city by the time that Harrison Jr. became mayor of Chicago. Yerkes was known to have a number of politicians in his pocket, one of them being state senator named John Humphrey. Humphrey introduced a series of legislation in 1896 which would expand private streetcar rights in Chicago by fifty years. The bills also only mandated minimal compensation from the streetcar companies to the city. Harrison Jr. took an ardent stance against the Humphrey bills and over the next decade fought any franchise expansion. Although Humphrey did very little in leading the fight against the streetcar companies, his visible stance on the issue earned him public approval.\n\nLike his father, Harrison Jr. was an ardent Democrat and believed morality should not be a part of politics. In regards to gambling, prohibition, prostitution and other vices, Harrison adopted a \u201clive and let live\u201d policy. However, the political opposition to vice which surrounded the 1911 mayoral election forced Harrison to use Chicago Police to close several brothels in the city. Ironically, coming down hard on prostitution is what Harrison is most remembered for in Chicago. At the end of his fifth term, Harrison was physically weary from the strain of politics, and after being defeated in the 1915 Democratic primary, he officially retired from politics.\n\nNext: Carter Harrison"}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8704/Carter-Henry-Harrison", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

Harrison of Chicago by Eugene Prendergast\n\nStory by Thomas Duke, 1910\n\n\u201cCelebrated Criminal Cases of America\u201d\n\nPart III: Cases East of The Pacific Coast\n\nCarter Henry Harrison was born in Lafayette County, Kentucky, on February 25, 1825, and graduated from Yale College in 1845.\n\nHe lived in Chicago many years, and accumulated a vast fortune. Harrison was a Democrat and was elected by that party to the office of Mayor of Chicago, taking his seat on April 18, 1893. He was a grand character and had friends and admirers galore.\n\nMr. Harrison was a widower and had two grown sons, named Preston and Carter, the latter subsequently serving as Mayor of Chicago for several terms.\n\nOn October 28, 1893, Harrison, Sr., visited the World\u2019s Fair, then being held in Chicago, and returned to his home at No. 231 Ashland Boulevard at 5 p. m. After dinner he retired to his room to rest. At 8 p. m. the door bell rang and was answered by a domestic named Mary Hansen who was confronted by a small man about 25 years old, with a wizened, smooth-shaven face. He stated that his name was Prendergast and that he had urgent business with the Mayor.\n\nThe servant proceeded to Mr. Harrison\u2019s room to deliver the message, but was surprised to see that the caller had followed her through the hall. The Mayor then stepped out of his room and engaged the stranger in conversation, while the servant went downstairs.\n\nAfter a brief conversation, the Mayor was heard to say: \u201cI tell you I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Immediately afterward, three shots rang out.\n\nW. J. Chalmers, who lived across the street, heard the shots and after rushing into his own house to notify his wife, he hurried over to the Harrison home. Just as he was leaving his own home he saw the assassin run out of the Harrison residence, pistol in hand, closely pursued by Harrison\u2019s hired man, who stopped when the murderer turned and fired at him.\n\nChalmers found the Mayor lying in the hall near his room.\n\nAn examination showed that one bullet had pierced the abdomen, a second had struck over the heart, and the third had passed through the dying man\u2019s hand.\n\nPreston Harrison was soon by his father\u2019s side, but the Mayor was rapidly sinking and in a feeble voice requested that Miss Annie Howard, his fiancee, be sent for, but he died before her arrival.\n\nSergeant of Police Frank McDonald was in command of the Desplaines Street station at the time of the tragedy and was in the act of receiving the news of the assassination mega the telephone when he was interrupted by a man who suddenly appeared in the station and remarked: \u201cI did the shooting and this is the gun I did it with.\u201d\n\nTurning around the sergeant beheld a small man with a revolver in his hand, and after disarming him the prisoner voluntarily made the following statement:\n\n\u201cMy name is Patrick Eugene Joseph Prendergast, and I was born in Ireland in April, 1868, but I came to this country with my mother when I was two years old.\n\n\u201cI have been a messenger boy for the Western Union Telegraph Co., but recently I have been employed as a distributor for the \u2018Inter Ocean\u2019 and \u2018Evening Post.\u2019\n\n\u201cI worked hard for the election of Mayor Harrison during his campaign and he promised to give me a position, but as he refused to keep his word I killed him.\u201d\n\nOn October 30, Prendergast was indicted by the grand jury and on November 2 he was arraigned.\n\nHe pleaded \u201cNot guilty;\u201d it having been decided to attempt to prove he was insane. A great deal of time was consumed in examining into his mental condition, but he was adjudged sane and on December 29 was found guilty of murder with the death penalty attached.\n\nMotions were made for a new trial which were overruled and his execution was set for March 23, 1894. Prendergast was held in contempt by all classes for his cowardly crime.\n\nOne Thomas Higgins was sentenced to be executed with Prendergast, and he stated that he did not fear the execution but hated to think of going to his death with Prendergast.\n\nAt the eleventh hour Prendergast obtained a reprieve until April 6, and Higgins expressed gratification when he learned that he would not be subjected to the disgrace of hanging with Prendergast.\n\nThe latter was granted a new trial and was again found guilty and hanged on July 13, 1894\n\n\u2014###\u2014"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Carter-Henry-Harrison-III/6000000020320319036", "page_content": "About Carter Henry Harrison III\n\n\u2022GRAD: 1845 Yale College \u2022Event: Elected BET 1879 AND 1887 Mayor of Chicago, IL \u2022Event: Elected BET 1875 AND 1879 U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois \u2022Event: Elected 1893 Mayor of Chicago, IL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Harrison,_Sr.\n\nCarter Henry Harrison, Sr. (February 15, 1825 \u2013 October 28, 1893) was an American politician who served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois from 1879 until 1887; he was subsequently elected to a fifth term in 1893 but was assassinated before completing his term. He previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives. Harrison was the first cousin twice removed of President William Henry Harrison.\n\nBorn near Lexington, Kentucky to Carter Henry Harrison II and Caroline Russell, he was only a few months old when his father died. He was educated by private tutors, and was graduated from Yale College in 1845 as a member of Scroll and Key. Following graduation, he traveled and studied in Europe from 1851 to 1853 before entering Transylvania College in Lexington, where he earned a law degree in 1855. He was admitted to the bar in 1855 and commenced practice in Chicago; Harrison came to Chicago because he saw it as a land of opportunity.\n\nHarrison ran an unsuccessful campaign in 1872 for election to the Forty-third Congress. Beginning in 1874, he served as a member of the board of commissioners of Cook County. He was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic National Conventions.\n\nA Summer's Outing\n\nIn 1890, Harrison and his daughter took a vacation trip from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. His letters from the trip were first published in the Chicago Tribune and later compiled into the book (1891): A Summer's Outing and The Old Man's Story.\n\nAssassination\n\nThe night of the Haymarket Riot in 1886, Harrison walked unmolested through the crowd of anarchists and advised the police to leave the demonstrators alone. The riot was sparked by a bomb, reportedly thrown at police by anarchists. After leaving office, Harrison was owner and editor of the Chicago Times from 1891 to 1893. He was re-elected in 1893, in time for the World's Columbian Exposition. His desire was to show the world the true Chicago, and he appointed 1st Ward Alderman \"Bathhouse\" John Coughlin to sit on the reception committee. On October 28, 1893, two days before the close of the Exposition, Harrison was murdered in his home by Patrick Eugene Prendergast, a disgruntled office seeker. Harrison was buried in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery. Prendergast was hanged on July 13, 1894. Harrison was Chicago's first five-time elected mayor; eventually his son, Carter Harrison, Jr., was also elected mayor five times.\n\nHarrison's career and assassination are closely connected with the World's Columbian Exposition, and are discussed at some length as a subplot to the two main stories (about the fair and serial killer H. H. Holmes) in The Devil in the White City. The celebration of the close of the Exposition was cancelled in lieu of a large public memorial service for Harrison."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/simple/Carter_Harrison,_Sr.", "page_content": "Carter Henry Harrison, Sr. (February 15, 1825 \u2013 October 28, 1893) was an American politician who was mayor of Chicago from 1879 until 1887; he was elected to a fifth term in 1893 but was assassinated before completing his term.\n\nQuick facts: Carter Harrison, Sr., Member of the U.S. Hous... \u25bc\n\nHe previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives.
