{"Carol Huston is best known for her roles in the films The Misfits (1961), The Unforgiven (1960), and The Mambo Kings (1992).": [{"url": "https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/film-fate-helped-make-classic-misfits", "page_content": "The Misfits (1961)\n\nWhat makes a film a classic?\n\nIs it the direction, the story and script, the choice of cast, the acting, the camerawork, editing or production design?\n\nIn the end, classic status can be the result of pretty much anything\u2026 including, I suspect, accidental or unintended factors. Making a movie is usually an expensive process involving extensive and meticulous planning. But however much one may try to minimise the role played by chance \u2013 by shooting, for instance, in a studio with a small cast and crew \u2013 one can never eradicate it altogether. Serendipity will always have an effect, which is why a producer or director will often feel relatively chuffed if a movie turns out to be 40 or 50 per cent of what they were aiming for.\n\nGet the latest from the BFI Sign up for BFI news, features, videos and podcasts. Email Sign up\n\nIt\u2019s also why a film can end up terrific despite the odds. Take, for example, John Huston\u2019s The Misfits (1961), starring Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. Now, before you say, \u201cWell, of course it was always going to be great with that cast, that director, and that writer on board,\u201d let\u2019s bear a few things in mind. Okay, Arthur Miller, then America\u2019s most respected playwright, wrote the film as \u2018a valentine\u2019 for his wife Monroe. But remember that he had next to no experience as a writer for the screen, that the marriage was on the rocks (they divorced shortly before the film\u2019s premiere in early 1961), and Monroe was in many ways a wreck, dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs, having difficulties with remembering her lines and turning up on time at the set. Director John Huston was often drunk, and apparently not averse to falling asleep on set. He would often display more interest in gambling than in the job at hand.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nThen there were the two male leads. The success of Clark Gable \u2013 a Hollywood star par excellence \u2013 had always rested rather more on his rugged masculinity, good looks and easy charm than on any particular range, depth or subtlety as an actor. Moreover, the postwar years had not been good for him, and even he regarded many of the roles offered by MGM as unsatisfactory.\n\nAs for Montgomery Clift, yes, he had been a performer of a different order, and for a decade he was undoubtedly one of the finest actors in Hollywood; but after his car accident in 1956, his health went downhill in all kinds of ways, and it tended to show on screen.\n\nIn other words, despite the big names, The Misfits didn\u2019t have too much going for it. Eli Wallach, Thelma Ritter and Kevin McCarthy were around to provide excellent support for the three stars, and few cinematographers could rival Russell Metty, whose CV included visual gems like Bringing Up Baby (1938), Touch of Evil (1958), Spartacus (1960) and a whole host of eye-catching Douglas Sirk titles. But a film usually needs a little more than superior camerawork and fine actors in minor roles to ensure its role as a classic.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nIndeed, just as the initial omens were not promising, so the film\u2019s release \u2013 it barely broke even \u2013 didn\u2019t suggest that it would in time become regarded as an important movie for all concerned and something we\u2019d still be watching more than half a century later.\n\nSerendipity played its part in The Misfits\u2019 long-term status, and not only because Gable, Monroe and Clift, notwithstanding the problematic shoot, ended up giving memorably fine performances. As it happened, it turned out to be the last completed film for both Gable (who died just 10 days after filming finished) and Monroe (who lived on for another year and a half). For his part, Clift had only two further major roles before his own demise in 1966.\n\nThe film\u2019s consequent association with premature death (though Gable, admittedly, was, at 59, no spring chicken) and the kind of celebrity worship which that can provoke hasn\u2019t harmed its reputation one bit. But I\u2019d suggest there\u2019s more to the film\u2019s enduring value than that kind of slightly morbid cult interest.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nAlongside the heartfelt performances, The Misfits is memorable for the way Metty\u2019s black-and-white cinematography creates taut, fraught, resonant relationships between the characters (and between humans and horses) in the Nevada desert. But perhaps most rewarding of all is how the almost palpable atmosphere of pain, disappointment and ubiquitous mortality reinforces, complicates and enriches the script\u2019s sometimes trite conception of damaged masculine souls (the ranchers and rodeo-riders played by Gable, Clift and Wallach) redeemed by their encounter with a woman (Monroe\u2019s divorcee Roslyn). Roslyn is essentially presented as a life-force corrective to their apparent indifference regarding the suffering of all the gentle, innocent and beautiful creatures on this earth.\n\nDue to their various personal circumstances, Gable, Clift and Monroe come across as fragile, vulnerable, indecisive and not quite sure where they\u2019re headed or why. That rather muddies Miller\u2019s \u2018message\u2019 (which was probably inspired by his own feelings about and experiences with Monroe), which is no bad thing. For all the (strikingly staged and shot) struggles with stallions and so on, the film consequently feels less like some sort of poetic fable about primal forces, and more like something recognisably human in scale and nature.\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nMisfits? Hardly. Aren\u2019t these folks actually just like the rest of us, trying to get by while turning a blind eye to the inevitable? Huston may have been stewed a lot of the time during shooting, but the film has more in common with his very finest works \u2013 The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Fat City (1972) and The Dead (1987) \u2013 than might at first be apparent. In his book The American Cinema, critic Andrew Sarris famously included Huston in the \u2018Less than Meets the Eye\u2019 category of directors. I\u2019d venture to suggest that with The Misfits, thanks in no small part to serendipity, the contrary might be the case."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055184/reviews", "page_content": "10 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nThis movie has generated a huge following in since it was made due to the acting by it's leads and directing (John Huston), but it is best known as \"the final movie\" of the stars. It was the final film for Clark Gable. Indeed, it killed Gable due to the scene where he stupidly did his own stunt of trying to restrain a wild horse. However, it was not the last film for Marilyn Monroe. She began work on a film with George Cukor which she was fired from and which was never completed. Since Monty Clift was also in it many people claim it was his last film too. Actually he made several complete films after it, including FREUD (also by John Huston). Thelma Ritter lived until 1969, and she was still making plenty of films until then. Estelle Winwood would reach her 100th year, and was still making films up to a decade before that. As for Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach - they are both ('bless 'em) going strong. However the final scene of the script gave a coda to Gable's and Monroe's career. This helps make the public point of view about the film understandable.\n\n\n\nIn his later years, Gable popped up in a series of films where his co-star was a leading lady of similar popular following, who was usually younger than him but his feminine sexual equivalent. These included TEACHER'S PET (with Doris Day) and IT STARTED IN NAPLES (with Sophia Loren). The film he did with Monroe (their only film together) was THE MISFITS, and it was not a comedy.\n\n\n\nTHE MISFITS was supposed to be a philosophical drama about why people can't be loners but have to find their way into some group where they are acceptable to each other. Philosophical films are very difficult ones to turn into box office gold. People go to films as an escape and rarely to feed their brains. But Marilyn's then husband (dramatist Arthur Miller) wrote the screenplay for the film. At the time the Miller-Monroe marriage was collapsing, and this may be why the screenplay seems to be lopsided. Marilyn's character \"Rosalind Taber\" seems to be flighty at points, but at other points too deep. We first see her willing to get through her divorce with Kevin McCarthy (who does a lot with his one brief scene in the film trying to stop the divorce). This shows determination - she even gives a vague reason to McCarthy that it was his fault for keeping her on the shelf while he concentrated on his career. Yet she shows a flakiness too. She tells Thelma Ritter she never wants to see an expensive car that was given to her again.\n\n\n\nThis follows her throughout the film. She is introduced to these modern cowboys through cab driver Eli Wallach (\"Guido\"), and she takes an offer from him to go up to his country house to chill out. Gable and Ritter accompany them. But soon she is showing a different personality: she is a mother-earth figure. Wallach is an ex military pilot who was married, but whose wife died in a fluke situation while pregnant (his car lacked a tire, and he could not rush her to the hospital). Marilyn tries to get to the bottom of Wallach's feelings and it is obvious that Wallach does not want to discuss this. Gable (\"Gay Langdon\") seems more settled - but we learn that daughter and son keep him at arm's length due to his tendency to carouse and get drunk. Marilyn and Gable do turn each other on, but Marilyn is upset by Gable's matter-of-fact feelings about animals like horses and rabbits.\n\n\n\nMontgomery Clift (\"Perce Howland) comes in later in the film when he joins the group headed for a rodeo. All of them have attended rodeos except Monroe. She is horrified at the injuries the cowboys get. Clift gets injured but while he and the other men accept his injuries as normal, Monroe wants to scream about them. Clift also has personal family problems: his mother remarried and the man has basically pushed Clift out of his property rights to his father's ranch. But the lack of his mother's interest in him (she is totally enthralled by the new husband) is what hurts him the most.\n\n\n\nEven the fifth wheel of this ensemble, Ritter (\"Isabelle Steers\") has a serious family problem that makes her a misfit (albeit one who has learned to accept it). Her husband left her for a best friend of her's years before, and has never paid her alimony - he sends her a potted rose once a year. At the end she leaves the film before the conclusion: she meets the husband and her best friend at the rodeo, and they go to her home to spend a few days! Ritter's character is a realist when she is not involved - she keeps warning Marilyn about cowboys and their ways - but she can be remarkably weak in defending her own rights and feelings.\n\n\n\nHow they all come to terms (or fail to come to terms) with their family and personality failures is what I leave to the viewers. It is worthwhile to watch this film to it's emotional climax (the scene with the wild horses), where Monroe's character finally gets her real voice - and Monroe achieved her acting height outside of her performance as \"Cherie\" in BUS STOP). But it is achieved at a ridiculous cost: as mentioned before Gable had to do his own stunt in that scene. The follow-up scene really shows how he was too old for it.\n\n\n\nThere is also that lovely coda: Clark and Marilyn in the pick-up truck looking at the star in the sky that Clark says is his guide. It does sort of seem an appropriate sign-off for those two movie icons."}, {"url": "https://www.filmsite.org/misf.html", "page_content": "Background The Misfits (1961) is a poignant modern-day western drama about the death of the old West, from director John Huston and screenwriter Arthur Miller (who was briefly married to star Marilyn Monroe from 1956-1960, wrote the film for her, and experienced a disintegrating marriage during the film's production). [Note: Ironically, the film was set in Reno, Nevada, where divorces were often sought by separating couples. The year the film premiered, Miller's marriage to Marilyn ended. The film reflected uncanny resemblances to Monroe's own personal life.] It was derived from scriptwriter Arthur Miller's own novelette (appearing in 1957 in Esquire Magazine), and from Milller's first screenplay (written specifically for his wife Marilyn Monroe at the time, during their rocky marriage). The film's budget of $4 million made it one of the most expensive B/W films of its time, and although it was a popular and well-received film, it was met with mixed reviews and responses, and didn't become profitable for United Artists until its home video release and later re-releases. The themes of the introspective picture were the issues of loneliness and lack of communication, and the rugged individualism of modern-day 1960 Nevada cowboys who rounded up wild \"misfit\" mustang horses to be sold for dog food. Some of the film's posters exclaimed the tagline: It shouts and sings with life...explodes with love! The introductions of the film's five main characters in the Nevada desert revealed that three were also 'misfit' cowboys who had failed family relationships (for various reasons) in their lives. Their shifting interactions with each other formed the basis for the film: Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe), a 30 year-old ex-stripper - temporarily renting a place in Reno, NV (a gambling and divorce mecca) after recently obtaining a divorce\n\nIsabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter), Roslyn's friendly landlady\n\nGuido Racanelli (Eli Wallach), a widowed ex-mechanic, tow-truck driver and WWII war pilot-aviator\n\nGaylord \"Gay\" Langland (59 year-old Clark Gable, the name \"Gay\" was short for Gable), an aging, strong-willed, old-school horse-wrangler and roper cowboy\n\nPerce Howland (Montgomery Clift), a death-defying rodeo bull- and bronc-riding drifter, who was destined to inherit his father\u2019s ranch, but denied by his step-father-in-law All three cowboys were captivated by Roslyn's spontaneity, sensual beauty, youthful vitality, and charm. Although Roslyn at first established a wary emotional relationship with Gay, both Guido and Perce appeared to be waiting for their chance to be with her. The thought-provoking film was best known for being the final, haunting, fully-completed film for two major screen legends: 59 year old Clark Gable (once \"The King of Hollywood\") and 35 year old Marilyn Monroe. Monroe had earlier worked with director John Huston when she performed in a small role in The Asphalt Jungle (1950). A film retrospective was made by director Gail Levin over 40 years later, titled Making the Misfits (2002), featuring interviews with Arthur Miller and star Eli Wallach and archival photographs. Huston's film became a precursor of two other 1960s-1970s modern-day western dramas: Hud (1963) and The Last Picture Show (1971). Plot Synopsis The minor classic film concerned a troubled divorcee Roslyn Taber (Marilyn Monroe) in Reno, Nevada who was just completing requirements for a quickie divorce to rid herself of her inattentive husband Raymond (Kevin McCarthy). With difficulty, she practiced her lines to a divorce judge with her experienced, wise-cracking landlady Isabelle Steers (Thelma Ritter). Through Isabelle, she was introduced first to ex-mechanic, former WWII pilot, and widower Guido Racanelli (Eli Wallach) and then in a local bar to aging, washed-out 'real-life' cowboy Gay Langland (Clark Gable), a rugged individualist. When Roslyn asked him: \"How do you just live?\", Langland replied: \"Well, you start by goin' to sleep. You get up when you feel like it. You scratch yourself. You fry yourself some eggs. You see what kind of a day it is. You throw stones at a can. Whistle.\" Isabelle toasted to the state of Nevada, known for gambling and for quickie divorces: (\"Here's to Nevada, the 'leave it' state...You got money you want to gamble, leave it here. You got a wife you wanna get rid of, get rid of her here. Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it up here. Nobody's gonna mind in the slightest. The slogan of Nevada is 'Anything goes, but don't complain if it went.'...I even left my Southern accent here....I love Nevada. You know, they don't even have regular meal times here. Never met so many people didn't own a watch. Might have two wives at the same time, but no watch. Bless them all\"). Both Gay and Guido were immediately interested in the young voluptuous blonde woman, although she eventually fell in love with the gallant Langland - who was old enough to be her father. During their time together, Gay complimented Roslyn's beauty, and they discussed her profound sadness in life: Gay: \"You're a real beautiful woman. It's almost kind of an honor sittin' next to ya. You just shine in my eyes. That's my true feelin', Roslyn. What makes you so sad? I think you're the saddest girl I ever met.\"\n\nRoslyn: \"You're the first man that ever said that. I'm usually told how happy I am.\"\n\nGay: \"That's because you make a man feel happy...Well, don't get discouraged, girl, you might.\" They were offered Guido's unfinished dream house in the desert, abandoned by heartbroken widower Guido after the death of his wife (during childbirth). Gay suggested that she sort her life out by remaining in the country with him - to be friends, and she agreed. They moved in together (in the ranch-house midway between civilization and the wide-open spaces), but both realized from their past experiences that it was very difficult to \"belong\" to someone else: \"Look, why don't you try it out here for a while, see what happens? You know, sometimes when a person don't know what to do, the best thing is to just stand still. I'll guarantee you'll have something out here you wouldn't find on every corner. I, uh, I may not amount to much in some ways, but I am a good friend...Let me take you back and get your things. Try it for a while, see what happens.\" [Note: Scenes of Roslyn's face are always in soft-focus, while the harsh light of the black and white film accentuates the crags and wrinkles on the faces of the cowboys.] A sexy paddle-ball game was played by Roslyn in her loose-fitting polka-dotted white dress in a bar, to win a bet. Roslyn was exhilarated by the freedom of the wide open spaces, and a new, growing passionate relationship with Langland. Gay and Roslyn engaged in an honest talk about love and his first failed marriage, when she asked: Roslyn: \"What happened? Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?\"\n\nGay: \"Well, I come home one night and she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella. Turned out to be an old friend. A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact...You know, in those days I thought you got married and that was it. But nothin' is it. Not for ever.\"\n\nRoslyn: \"That's what I can't get used to. Everything keeps changing.\"\n\nGay: \"I'll tell you this, though. I wouldn't know how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn. It surprises me.\" Conflict in a growing love triangle developed between Gay, Roslyn, and his friend Guido, who attempted to persuade her to ally with him: (\"You're through with Gay now, right? Well, tell me. He doesn't know what you're all about. He'll never know. Tell me, Roslyn. I been waitin'. I'm goin' out of my mind with waitin'. Come back with me. Give me a week, two weeks. Let me show you what I am. Tell me, Roslyn. Give me a reason and I'll stop it. There'll be hell to pay, but give me a reason and I'll do it\"). But Roslyn she rejected his offer: \"You never felt anything for anybody in your life. All you know is the sad words. You could blow up the world, and all you would feel is sorry for yourself!\" The trio of men -- Langland, Guido, and reckless, worn-out, injured 'rodeo cowboy' rider Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift) -- teamed up to go after a herd of wild horses in the desert highlands for a last roundup, and they took Roslyn along. After Guido's small airplane guided and terrorized the animals down from the hills, the others lassoed and rounded up the 'misfit' horses from a speeding pick-up truck. The animals included a stallion, four mares, and a colt. Roslyn was ultimately shocked to learn that these free and wild horses would be slaughtered and cheaply sold to a dog food company for pet food. She hysterically screamed at them, accusing them of being murderers - in a dramatic long shot - gesturing and attempting to persuade Langland to call off the roundup. When he refused, she successfully appealed to Perce to defy Langland and release the horses that had already been captured. This infuriated wrangler Langland, who had single-handedly recaptured the stallion leader of the horses after a rough struggle. [Note: After filming ended, sources claimed that Gable's subsequent heart-attack four days later (with his death 12 days later) was due to executing his own strenuous, bronc-busting stunts without a double.] After he had assertively and independently proved that he was the boss, Gay then decided to let the horses free, thereby reconciling with Roslyn: Don't want nobody makin' up my mind for me, that's all. Damn 'em all! They changed it, changed it all around. Smeared it all over with blood. I'm finished with it. It's, it's like, like ropin' a dream now. I just gotta find another way to be alive, that's all. If there is one anymore. (He stands). Perce, cut that mare loose for me, will ya? The roundup ended as a financial failure, but from the ordeal, Roslyn and Langland made a new start together. In the final scene from the front seat of a pick-up truck, Roslyn spoke to Langland about having a family together - he was now optimistic about taking the right path and entering a new phase of life with her: Roslyn: Gay, if there could be one person in the world, a child who could be brave from the beginning - I was scared to when you asked me, but I'm not so much now. Are you?\n\nGay: No.\n\nRoslyn: How do you find your way back in the dark?\n\nLangland: (nodding to the nighttime sky) Just head for that big star straight on. The highway's under it - it'll take us right home."}, {"url": "https://www.desertusa.com/desert-people/misfits.html", "page_content": "The Filming of a Desert Classic: The Misfits\n\nMarilyn Monroe - Clark Gable\n\nBy Joe Zentner\n\nIn the production of the motion picture The Misfits, released in 1961, some of the 20th century's most beguiling cinematic talent gathered in the Nevada desert in what, for several of them, would be a final stab at creating art.\n\nThe Misfits began life as a short story written by playwright Arthur Miller and published by Esquire Magazine in 1957. In the tale, Miller spoke of his memories of modern-day cowboys he had met in 1956 in and around Reno, Nevada, where he had come to divorce his first wife, Mary Grace Slattery. He had seasoned those memories about the cowboys in his story with his infatuation with his second wife, the legendary actress Marilyn Monroe, whom he married in 1956. He felt that she was a pure creature intimately connected to the spirit of life.\n\nIn search of a project that would allow them to work together, Miller and Monroe pitched a film version of The Misfits to United Artists. The studio agreed to produce the film and offered John Huston the job as director. Huston accepted with a one-word response: \u201cMagnificent!\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s visceral reaction to Reno\u2019s desert landscape had led him to choose the region as the setting for the film, which was not to be a conventional Western. The \u201cmisfits\u201d referred to by the title are physically crippled horses and emotionally crippled people. The horses fell to a cruel lariat and ended up canned, piece by piece, as dog food. The people struggled to find emotional stability and ended up picked off, one at a time, by fate.\n\nThe Plot\n\nQuasi-sophisticated but an emotional basket case, Roslyn Taber, Marilyn Monroe\u2019s character, has come to Nevada to get a quickie divorce from her husband, Raymond Taber (played by Kevin McCarthy). After her landlady introduces her to aging cowboy Gay Langland (Clark Gable), Roslyn finds herself at last, seemingly, with a person with whom she can communicate. Meanwhile, Gay and his fellow horsemen, Guido and Perce Howland (played, respectively, by Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift), scheme to capture a herd of wild mustangs, intending to sell them to a packing company for dog food.\n\nRoslyn accompanies the men on a horse-hunting expedition. She is horrified by the blatant acts of cruelty to the animals. Her anguish forces the men to take an introspective look at their own behavior and motivations.\n\nThe Tortured Marilyn Monroe\n\nBorn Norma Jean Mortenson (though christened Norma Jean Baker) in Los Angeles on June 1, 1926, the woman who would become known to the world as Marilyn Monroe was the daughter of Gladys Baker, an unmarried movie technician. Her mother\u2019s mental instability led to a childhood of foster homes, neglect and abuse for Norma Jean.\n\nAt age 16, Norma Jean married James Dougherty, a defense worker. During World War II, she posed for an army photographer, who shot pin-up pictures of her. Her images caught the attention of many people. She was soon signed by a modeling agency. She bleached her light brown hair, turning herself into a classic blond. In 1946, she divorced Dougherty. In that same year, she signed a contract with the motion picture studio 20th Century Fox, taking the new name of Marilyn Monroe. After several movie flops and in desperate need of money, she posed nude for a calendar photo that became the centerfold of the first issue of Playboy and helped propel her to stardom.\n\nMonroe secured small movie roles, most notably in The Asphalt Jungle (1950), as a crooked lawyer\u2019s niece, and in All About Eve (also 1950), as a \u201cgraduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art.\u201d Her rise to movie stardom came rapidly, due primarily to an intensive publicity campaign orchestrated by Fox studios, which realized, belatedly, her box-office potential.\n\nEarly in her film career, Marilyn Monroe starred as a ditzy blonde in such movies as How to Marry a Millionaire and The Seven Year Itch. She later won critical acclaim for her performance in the films Bus Stop and Some Like it Hot.\n\nAlways difficult to direct, Monroe, in her thirties, became increasingly unstable. After trying to take her life several times, she finally succeeded, on the night of August 4, 1962. It remains unclear whether she really meant to kill herself. It is also uncertain whether she had a liaison with President John F. Kennedy. Elton John\u2019s moving tribute to Britain\u2019s Princess Diana, \u201cCandle in the Wind,\u201d was originally written to commemorate Monroe\u2019s life.\n\nThe Doomed Clark Gable\n\nOriginally, John Huston had wanted Robert Mitchum to star as the washed-up cowboy who becomes involved with a divorc\u00e9e in Reno. But Mitchum considered the script incomprehensible. He dodged Huston\u2019s phone calls. Finally, Huston cast Clark Gable in the part. When Mitchum finally spoke to Huston, he warned about Gable\u2019s age and health. He said, \u201cYou get him at the end of a rope, fighting those horses, and that\u2019s going to be the end of him.\u201d Mitchum would prove to be prophetic.\n\nOn location, Gable was much like the cowboy he played in The Misfits: rugged, handsome and fiercely independent, according to Marilyn Newton, one of the movie\u2019s extras. \u201cHe was down to earth and would go out of his way to be nice to everyone,\u201d Newton once commented. \u201cHe was even warmer off the stage than his Hollywood image led people to believe.\u201d\n\nThe casting of Gable in the movie became a problem. \u201c...while he was intrigued with the script, he didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Arthur Miller once commented. Miller advised Gable, \u201cThink of it as an Easterner\u2019s Western. The preoccupation of the film is not typically that of a Western film. Instead, it\u2019s about people trying to connect with one another, and yet afraid to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Tumult of the Production\n\nBecause of Monroe\u2019s prior commitment to make the musical Let\u2019s Make Love, production on The Misfits didn\u2019t begin until July 1960, when the Nevada locations were baked by temperatures climbing to 120 degrees each day. Filming lasted through the blistering summer and was finally completed on November 4, 1960. Release came some three months later, on February 1, 1961.\n\nThose blistering days of production sound like a Tennessee Williams-inspired conundrum: Superstar siren lost and depressed. Playwright caught between the art of the cinema and the anguish of a failing marriage. The ailing King of the Movies taking unnecessary risks. A director addicted to the gambling tables. And an intense young method actor, Montgomery Clift, who had his own emotional stress but who nevertheless ended up being the most reliable actor on the set. (Gable\u2019s first reaction to playing a scene with Clift was: \u201cDamn, he\u2019s really good!\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt was an anxious set,\u201d one observer recalls. \u201cThere was a tremendous amount of tension.\u201d By the time everybody showed up for work in those July days of 1960, it was already 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. Monroe\u2019s habitual lateness didn\u2019t help. She was rarely called before 11:00 a.m., and she usually showed up even later than that. In her defense, she did have to stay up long after midnight trying to learn Miller\u2019s many script changes. At the same time, she was trying to deal with the effects of numerous pain and sleep medications. Though he often resented her tardiness, Gable went out of his way to help her through the shooting, enduring retake after retake while she tried to focus on her lines.\n\nCompounding Monroe\u2019s problems was the fact that the film, conceived while she and Miller were still in the flush of first love, was filmed as their marriage was falling apart. During the shooting, she moved out of their shared hotel room, electing to stay with her acting coach, Paula Strasberg. Moreover, Monroe was heartbroken that a role she had seen as her chance to prove she could play something other than \u201cMarilyn Monroe\u201d was being rewritten, turning into something different than the original vision. Miller would decide to include embarrassing elements from her personal life, for example, references to the failure of her marriage to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and to the mental problems of her mother. Even Gable\u2019s casting contributed autobiographical elements. Miller knew that his wife idolized \u201cThe King\u201d during her childhood, sometimes fantasizing that he was her father.\n\nStrangely, neither director Huston nor anyone else admonished Monroe for her constant tardiness. Huston was nonconfrontational. One might have thought he would have insisted that she be on time. Instead, he was benign. He felt that he couldn\u2019t push Monroe, \u201cbecause what would that get me?\u201d Huston said, \u201cIt will only upset her, so let\u2019s just play this thing out.\u201d\n\nHuston, meanwhile, had his own problems during the production. He was developing emphysema after decades of heavy smoking. Several days of production were lost when he felt too sick to work. Location shooting in the only U. S. state that had legal gaming at the time turned into a huge mistake because Huston usually spent most of his nights in the casinos, gambling until around 5:00 a. m. He would then fall asleep in the director\u2019s chair during filming.\n\nThe studio provided Huston with a gambling allowance. When his losses exceeded the allowance, he stopped production for a week to scrounge more money. He, in fact, convinced Monroe\u2019s psychiatrist to put her in a Los Angeles hospital for a week to deal with her drug dependency, making the actress bear the blame for lost production that he himself had caused.\n\nWith legend John Huston directing a cast of movie icons, in a screenplay written by a famed playwright, The Misfits was one of the most anticipated films ever. However, difficult shooting locations, an unstable leading lady, an aging leading man, a crumbling marriage and an undisciplined director all combined to make the behind-the-scenes event of the film\u2019s production more dramatic than The Misfits itself.\n\nThe film is less an entertaining Western than a cerebral exploration of what happens when discontents fall in love with an insecure woman. By most standards, Marilyn Monroe\u2019s acting in The Misfits is superb. Under John Huston\u2019s direction, she transforms her stunning good looks into something more vulnerable than sexuality. Her characterization of Roslyn Taber is full of haunting depth and subtlety.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nThe Misfits, filmed mainly in the Reno area, was the only movie Monroe and Gable appeared in together, and it was the last completed film for both. Only a few days after filming ended, Gable\u2019s failing health caught up with him. He died of a heart attack at age 59. The film may have contributed to the actor\u2019s death.\n\nThe most strenuous scenes were those shot near the end of production, when Gable and two other cowboys capture a wild horse herd in the desert and attempt to break the herd\u2019s lead animal. Rumors suggested that the scenes he played in trying to hold back the lead horse contributed to Gable\u2019s heart attack. A close analysis of the film, however, reveals that the dramatic action was more attributable to film direction and editing than to actual events. Gable, in fact, is rarely in the same shot as the lead horse. He did, however, have to shoot a scene in which the horse drags him mercilessly across the desert floor. In truth, the actor was actually holding a rope attached to a truck, with a camera in the truck bed. But even though Gable was heavily padded, he came back from the day\u2019s shooting a bloody mess. The actor tried to lie to his wife that it had just been an accident, but she knew better, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d\n\nProduction ended with studio work in Hollywood, but Gable was already too sick to attend the celebration party on November 4. He would suffer a massive heart attack two days later. He died 10 days after that. In an interview, Marilyn Monroe wondered mournfully whether she had somehow contributed to his death. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper blamed Gable\u2019s death on Huston. At the time, few persons seemed to consider that Gable\u2019s three-packs-a-day smoking habit or his overwhelming grief over the death of a good friend, Ward Bond, just days earlier, might have been contributing factors.\n\nSince Huston shot the scenes in sequence and edited the film as shooting progressed, Gable had already seen himself on the screen before becoming ill. He believed it to be his best acting performance ever. Following his death, the studio tried to get the film completed in time for the 1960 Academy Awards, hoping he would share a posthumous nomination. However, when composer Alex North protested that he couldn\u2019t possibly get the picture musically scored that quickly, the idea was dropped.\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller divorced on January 20, 1961. Monroe started filming another movie, Something\u2019s Gotta Give, in 1962. However, Monroe\u2019s deteriorating physical condition and her emotional instability, exacerbated by drugs and personal turmoil, eventually reached such a degree that she was dropped from the film. She forgot her lines. She missed numerous shoots. Less than 21 months later, Marilyn Monroe died by her own hand.\n\nSome film critics suggest that The Misfits was Monroe\u2019s finest acting performance. In playing a vulnerable divorc\u00e9e, she was really playing herself. The rest of the cast, including Gable and Clift, gave solid performances. However, The Misfits did not immediately receive wide critical acclaim. It was not a box-office smash. Still, its popularity has grown with time. There is a melancholy tone to this engaging black-and-white movie that hints at the tragedy that would soon consume Gable, Monroe and Clift.\n\nMontgomery Clift\u2019s film career did not end with The Misfits. In the same year the movie was released, Clift also starred in Judgement at Nuremberg. The following year he played Sigmund Freud in Freud.\n\nClift\u2019s dependency on drugs and alcohol and his shame about his homosexuality affected him profoundly throughout his career. His life ended on July 23, 1966, when his companion found him lying naked and dead in a New York City hotel room. According to the autopsy, the cause of death was \u201cocclusive coronary artery disease.\u201d\n\nThe fine line that often exists between art and life is remarkable in The Misfits because Monroe, Gable and Clift played characters so much like themselves. Though greeted coolly by critics and audiences in 1961, it is, undeniably, a film that still lives. It has that rare element, mystique.\n\nToday, The Misfits holds special interest as an example of the loss of traditional values in the modern Western. It is one of John Huston\u2019s trademark celebrations of a bunch of charismatic losers. It was the last film from two of Hollywood\u2019s greatest stars.\n\nLife produces few happy endings, but there are brief moments of hope. Perhaps the most metaphorically telling thing about The Misfits is that the \u201cstallions\u201d weren\u2019t really stallions. One must look carefully to observe this anatomical detail, just as one must watch carefully to discern the skill, talent and confusion that went into production of a desert classic."}, {"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/Carol_Huston", "page_content": "Dyan Cannon is an American actress, filmmaker and editor.
