Russell finished with 28 points in his return from injury.\n\nCalm and quick, all at once.\n\nIt\u2019s how D\u2019Angelo Russell can move with the basketball in his hands, slickly navigating defenses with patience before darting to the spot he wants to get to.\n\nIt\u2019s a deceptive speed, things happening faster than you\u2019d expect.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of how the game played out in Russell\u2019s return, quick, devastating spurts that took the direction of the game and sharply turned it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the Lakers point guard was behind the wheel, whipping it toward L.A.\n\nRussell was in the middle of the biggest runs, hitting transition threes and dishing assists as the game swung wildly to the Lakers during the second and fourth quarters.\n\nHe made five threes and scored 28 points to lead the Lakers to a 122-112 win in a game they trailed by at least 12 in each half.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s here,\u201d coach Darvin Ham said.\n\nFive Lakers scored in double figures, the team withstanding big games from Scottie Barnes (32 points) and O.G. Anunoby (31 points on 12-for-14 shooting).\n\nAnthony Davis took just seven shots and scored only eight points with the Raptors defense hounding him. He swished a jumper with 46.6 seconds left to seal the Lakers\u2019 third-straight win.\n\nLakers guard Austin Reaves, top center, drives to the basket against the Toronto Raptors in the first half. Reaves finished with 18 points. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press)\n\n\u201cIt just shows the character that he has,\u201d Austin Reaves said. \u201cHe was as happy as tonight winning scoring eight points as he was after scoring 39.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 depth dominated, Wenyen Gabriel finishing with a plus-19. It was the lowest plus-minus of any bench player who played for the Lakers on Friday night.\n\nThe Lakers made all 19 of their free throws and they allowed just 22 fourth-quarter points, but it was Russell\u2019s return that fueled them.\n\n\u201cHis size, his skill set, his brain,\u201d Ham said pregame when asked about what Russell brings to the floor. \u201cI just think he\u2019s a really talented, smart basketball player and you have to account for him. He\u2019s a smart defensive player as well, so he\u2019s just another added piece that we\u2019re truly, truly excited about, and the people got a taste of what he brings early. Coming off of injury is great timing with LeBron\u2019s circumstances. But we\u2019re looking forward to that great addition and expecting him to be a bit of a spark plug for us.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Man I love this team!!! #Lakeshow \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) March 11, 2023\n\nAfter a slow start with the Lakers quickly falling behind by 15, Russell led the Lakers on a 21-5 run in the second quarter, showing why the team valued him at the trade deadline.\n\nHis return also energized Dennis Schroder, who moved to the bench and was able to give more while being asked less, another playmaker and ballhandler back on the floor.\n\nWithout Russell, Schroder\u2019s offense took a serious hit, the wear-and-tear of running the offense visibly wearing him down.\n\nBut Friday, he played with more pace and burst, something Ham said pregame he expected to see.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you\u2019re the only traditional point guard in the lineup,\u201d Ham said. \u201cHaving [Russell] come out there and Dennis being able to see that initial wave and automatically know when he checks into the game what we need to do, what needs to be fixed or what needs to be sustained, it\u2019s definitely a good luxury to have with [Russell] now being back in the lineup. Just that one-two punch. So when he sits down. we\u2019ve got another orchestrator to come in and keep us organized and set a tone.\u201d\n\nSchroder was the fastest to loose balls, grabbing four steals while he scored 23.\n\n\u201cThat energy trickles down to everyone else,\u201d Reaves said.\n\nAnd with the Lakers\u2019 offense stuck in neutral against Toronto\u2019s size and strength in the third, Reaves kept them just close enough. He ignited the crowd later in the half, driving through the middle of the court for a two-handed slam.\n\n\u201cWe gave a really good effort,\u201d Reaves said. \u201c\u2026We had to make a couple adjustments and just play harder.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers went on a 32-11 run stretching between the third and the fourth to flip the game one final time.\n\n\u201cWe always say \u2018Don\u2019t get discouraged. Get more competitive,\u2019\u201d Ham said.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/07/14/report-wes-unseld-jr-darvin-ham-charles-lee-finalists-to-be-next-wizards-coach/", "page_content": "MIAMI \u2014 Erik Spoelstra, Michael Malone, and their staffs have been pouring over film and losing sleep, trying to come up with adjustments. Minor tweaks that can give their team even a little edge.\n\nBut four games into a series, there are not a lot of secrets left. Everyone knows what is coming. It is often more about execution and effort over adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of both,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely some things we can adjust on, and then it\u2019s also about a little bit more effort and just doing more. You always need more, always can do more\u2026 we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the floor, but you know, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d\n\nThe Heat need to figure it out before Game 4 on Friday night, because they can\u2019t afford to go down 3-1 to the Nuggets in this series. Game 4 is as close as it gets to must-win for Jimmy Butler and the Heat.\n\nHere are two things worth watching in Game 4, plus some betting advice from Vaughn Dalzell of NBC Sports Edge.\n\n1) Miami has to slow the Jokic/Murray two-man game. Somehow.\n\nDenver\u2019s defense has been impressive in these Finals, holding Miami to a 111.1 offensive rating through three games (for comparison, that is 7.2 below their offensive rating against Boston).\n\nPart of the reason is that Nikola Joki\u0107 can be a better rim protector and defensive player than people give him credit for. Another key is Malone has been able to lean hard into more defensive-based lineups because the two-man game of Jamal Murray and Joki\u0107 has been all the offense the Nuggets need.\n\nThe Murray/Jokic pick-and-roll has been a masterclass in this series \u2014 the Nuggets have a 126 offensive rating this series when running that play. In Game 3, the Denver stars ran 32 pick-and-rolls, and those plays were the foundation of each of them getting a 30-point triple-double (the first teammates to have a 30+ point triple-double in any NBA game).\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are the first pair of teammates with triple-doubles in Finals history! Jokic: 32 PTS, 21 REB, 10 AST\n\nMurray: 34 PTS, 10 REB, 10 AST DEN/MIA Game 4: Friday, 8:30pm/et on ABC pic.twitter.com/0hLcPvv0zN \u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 8, 2023\n\n\u201cI mean, the Murray/Jokic two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop,\u201d Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cBut we got great defensive players, got some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy [Butler] and Bam [Adebayo], so we\u2019re gonna figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies we can throw at Murray as well.\u201d\n\nMiami may need to sell out to stop Joki\u0107 and Murray and force any other Nugget to beat them. The Heat did blitz the pick-and-roll more in the fourth quarter of Game 3, but that led to Christian Braun cuts to the basket and Denver buckets. Miami may have to live with some of that, they have to keep Murray in particular in check (it feels like Joki\u0107 will get his no matter what).\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, you just can\u2019t do it all the time,\u201d Spoelstra said of defending the Nuggets duo. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolutes when you get to this level. It\u2019s the highest level of competition. You\u2019re getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they\u2019re trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThe first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn\u2019t need to go to any other part of their playbook.\u201d\n\nMiami needs to see the rest of that playbook.\n\n2) Miami has to make shots, rebound, set defense\n\nThe best way for Miami to limit the Jokic/Murray action and the Denver offense in general is to slow the game down. Make them go against a set defense every time down. That didn\u2019t happen enough in Game 3 \u2014 Denver was free-flowing on offense when Miami needs the game played in the mud.\n\nFor the Heat to change that dynamic two key things need to happen.\n\nFirst, Miami has to make shots. It\u2019s simplistic but it\u2019s true. Denver isn\u2019t going to run if they are taking the ball out of the net.\n\nThat starts with 3-pointers, because as has been noted everywhere the Heat are 6-1 when they shoot 45% or better from 3 this postseason (including Game 2 against the Nuggets), and unreasonably hot shooting has sustained their run to the Finals. The Heat starters were 5-of-19 (26.3%) from beyond the arc in Game 3, which is simply not good enough \u2014 Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and the rest of the role players must step up and knock down shots. However, the bigger concern in Game 3 was the Heat shooting 38.2% within eight feet of the basket. The Nuggets\u2019 size is clearly bothering the Heat. Jimmy Butler needs to get downhill and then make the shots, Bam Adebayo has to get the floater to fall, and the Heat need to attack and get to the free throw line.\n\nSecond, the Heat can\u2019t let the Nuggets win the rebounding battle by 25. Denver\u2019s size advantage has played out in this series in many ways (including how they contested 3s in Game 3), but it is most clearly on the glass. Miami is getting one shot and they\u2019re done, but the Nuggets grabbed the offensive rebound on 36.1% of their missed shots in Game 3, and if you give them that many second chances you will pay.\n\nIt will take gang rebounding and effort, but the Heat must be stronger on the glass.\n\n3) Vaughn Dalzell\u2019s betting recommendations\n\nOver/Under: The total continues to drop from game-by-game starting at 219.5 then going from 216.5 to 214.5 and now 210.5 for Game 4. Denver and Miami have struggled with consistency when it comes to scoring, Miami a little more than Denver. The Nuggets are shooting 51% to Miami\u2019s 41% from the field and averaging 10 more free-throw attempts per game. The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field. When betting player props in the NBA Finals, keep it simple stupid (KISS).\n\n(Check out more from Dalzell and the team at NBC Sports Edge.)"}, {"url": "https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/271451/Charles-Lee-Interviews-With-Raptors", "page_content": "For The Nuggets, Attention Isn't the Prize by John Wilmes Your life is certainly better if you don't make yourself think like a media executive, but the exercise may be useful to those acting confused about why a business-first basketball team with minimal mainstream history and no loud characters has been under-publicized.\n\nA Pastless And Futureless State by Colin McGowan You wonder if, given the choice, LeBron James would transform into his younger self.

They had a respected coach, Dwane Casey, who guided the franchise to its third straight 50-win season, and several promising young players.

The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field. When betting player props in the NBA Finals, keep it simple stupid (KISS).\n\n(Check out more from Dalzell and the team at NBC Sports Edge.)"}, {"url": "https://raptorsrapture.com/2023/05/04/could-raptors-hire-bucks-charles-lee/", "page_content": "How does the NBA Draft Lottery work? Raptors\u2019 odds of landing first overall pick by Mike Luciano\n\nThe Toronto Raptors have put some puzzling choices on their initial list of head coaching candidates, as names like Darko Rajakovic and Jordi Fernandez did not show up on many other team\u2019s shortlists. One name on their list that is an unusually hot name in the coaching circle is Milwaukee Bucks assistant Charles Lee.\n\nLee, who has been one of Mike Budenholzer\u2019s top assistants for the last nine seasons, was promoted to associate head coach after Darvin Ham took the Lakers job. Lee may have his pick of three available jobs, showing what a terrific job he has done of building a coaching resume.\n\nLee not only is on the Raptors\u2019 shortlist and interviewed with the Detroit Pistons for their coaching vacancy, but he appears to be one of the top candidates to replace the embattled Budenholzer if Milwaukee decides to move on following a very tough first-round exit.\n\nLee has the perfect combination of youth, experience, and history as a developer of young talent to warrant consideration from the Raptors. They need to act fast, as Lee is a hot name who will likely have the luxury of being able to pick the best spot for him on the open market.\n\nRaptors have gathered permission to interview the following coaches for the team's new head coach position: \u2014Becky Hammon\n\n\u2014Kenny Atkinson\n\n\u2014Charles Lee\n\n\u2014Kevin Young\n\n\u2014Mitch Johnson\n\n\u2014Darko Rajakovic\n\n\u2014Chris Quinn\n\n\u2014Adrian Griffin (via @wojespn, https://t.co/h9kVd3rmBj) pic.twitter.com/vZaNxsPNI6 \u2014 ClutchPoints (@ClutchPointsApp) April 27, 2023\n\nWill the Toronto Raptors hire Charles Lee?\n\nFor those who are worried that Lee doesn\u2019t have a background in player development, he can put those fears to bed. His work with Giannis Antetokounmpo will get attention, but names like Khris Middleton and Grayson Allen have also benefitted from Lee\u2019s sage advice.\n\nThe Budenholzer coaching tree, which started as a sampling derived from Gregg Popovich\u2019s venerable web of connections, has been quite fruitful in the last few years. Ham has revitalized the Lakers, Quin Snyder has succeeded in Utah and Atlanta, and Taylor Jenkins has turned the Grizzlies around.\n\nLee could be the next in that great line of coaches, as he could bring the Budenhozler offensive scheme to Toronto without the lack of adjustments that has often clouded the last few non-title seasons on Milwaukee. Anyone who comes promising an offensive upgrade must get consideration from Toronto.\n\nThe Pistons\u2019 coaching search is advancing to a second-round of interviews this week, including Milwaukee associate HC Charles Lee, ex-UConn and Overtime Elite coach Kevin Ollie and New Orleans assistant Jarron Collins, sources tell ESPN. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) April 24, 2023\n\nWhile hiring Lee over a known internal candidate like Adrian Griffin might go against how Masai Ujiri has operated in the last few years, everything about his resume suggests that he can bring a high-flying offense that benefits the young stars Toronto has on the team. That could be a winning formula."}, {"url": "https://www.hoopsrumors.com/players/charles-lee", "page_content": "JUNE 2: In a lengthy press release, the Pistons announced that Williams is officially the team\u2019s new head coach. The Pistons also described how the agreement came to pass.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud to have Monty joining us at this important time to lead us into the next decade of our future,\u201d said Gores. \u201cHe embodies all of the qualities we want in a leader for our Pistons franchise, and most importantly a teacher and mentor for our players. He will have an impact on every aspect of our franchise, on and off the court.\n\n\u201cAfter spending some time with Monty, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s found a unique balance between achieving victory at the highest level while at the same time nurturing a culture of growth, development and inspiration. I\u2019m beyond excited. This is a huge win for us.\u201d\n\nMAY 31: Monty Williams has reached an agreement to become the next head coach of the Pistons, tweets Shams Charania of The Athletic. The former Suns coach will receive a six-year contract and the deal is expected to be finalized within a few days, sources tell Charania.\n\nESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Williams\u2019 salary as $78.5MM, which makes it the largest coaching contract in league history (Twitter link).\n\nThe agreement also includes two additional team option years and could reach $100MM with incentives, according to Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo. Owner Tom Gores was heavily involved in the recruitment of Williams, Goodwill adds, as was general manager Troy Weaver, who worked with Williams in Oklahoma City.\n\nWilliams rejected Detroit\u2019s initial interest and had planned to take a year off before coaching again. However, Gores remained in contact with Williams and was able to get him to reconsider, Goodwill writes. The team prepared an offer and negotiations began over the weekend, sources tell Goodwill, adding that Gores and Williams held their first meeting Sunday night in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Pistons began an interview process shortly after Dwane Casey resigned to take a management role after the regular season ended. Former Overtime Elite head coach Kevin Ollie, Bucks assistant Charles Lee, and Pelicans assistant Jarron Collins were reported as the three finalists for the position way back on April 21, but the Pistons waited to see if a more experienced coach would become available.\n\nWith a young roster highlighted by former overall No. 1 pick Cade Cunningham, the Pistons are hoping that Williams can transform them the same way he turned around Phoenix after arriving in 2019. Williams took the Suns to the NBA Finals in 2021 and compiled a 194-115 record in four seasons, but new owner Mat Ishbia opted to make a coaching change after a second straight disappointing playoff exit."}, {"url": "https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/lists/lakers-ask-for-permission-to-interview-bucks-assistant-charles-lee/", "page_content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are continuing to do their due diligence when it comes to interviewing candidates for their head coaching vacancy.\n\nThey have now requested permission to interview Charles Lee, an assistant coach on Mike Budenholzer\u2019s staff with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nLee, who is just 37 years of age, broke into the NBA in the 2014-15 season as an assistant with the Atlanta Hawks under Budenholzer, who was then their head coach.\n\nWhen Budenholzer left Atlanta and joined the Bucks for the 2018-19 campaign, Lee went along with him to the Badger State.\n\nThe Bucks won the world championship last season, and they could end up repeating the feat this season.

This offseason, Lee has interviewed with the Hornets for their coaching vacancy but was more notably considered one of the frontrunners for the Pelicans head coach position last offseason. Reports indicated that the decision for New Orleans came down to Willie Green and Lee.\n\nUnlike his colleague Ham, Lee is not a former NBA player. After a four-year career at Bucknell, he spent four years playing overseas before returning to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 2012. Lee would join Mike Budenholzer\u2019s staff in Atlanta in 2014 and stayed on his staff in the transition to Milwaukee.\n\nKevin Pelton of ESPN included Lee in his recent annual look at the top NBA coaching prospects:\n\nAnother Bucks assistant, Charles Lee, has established himself as a multitool coach who projects confidence, emotional and tactical intelligence and affability. Colleagues marvel at his ability to relate to everyone, be it a two-way player (Lee played professionally overseas for four seasons) to an owner (he worked as a trader on Wall Street). A number of executives and coaches say that had Lee played one minute in the NBA (or had NBA bloodlines), he\u2019d be gainfully employed as a head coach today. Such is the case in the NBA circa 2022, where owners and front offices increasingly favor those who have an NBA entry on Basketball Reference.\n\nLee also sat down with Mike Vorkunov of The Athletic in March as part of their \u201cNBA 40 under 40\u201d series to discuss his desire to become an NBA head coach.\n\nFor the Lakers, Lee becomes the sixth coach the team has reportedly sought to interview, joining Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson as the latest on that list. He\u2019s also the fourth assistant coach \u2014 joining Ham, Atkinson and Adrian Griffin \u2014 the team has reached out to.\n\nFor more Lakers talk, subscribe to the Silver Screen and Roll podcast feed on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher or Google Podcasts.
