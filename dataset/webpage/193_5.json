In winning three of the four rounds held so far (Imola, Assen, Misano), the young Frenchman more than made up for his \u2018no-score' at Monza (due to an injury to his left shoulder), but his momentary stop has also given some hope to his key rivals.\n\n\n\nThe first name on this list is Lorenzo Savadori, the former European and Italian 125 GP champion, who is just 11 points away from the top on his Barni Racing Team Italia-prepared Ducati 1199 Panigale. Winner at Monza, and the first man to take the new Ducati sportbike to victory, the Italian has now been caught by his team-mate Eddi La Marra, poleman at Imola on his debut with Ducati.
