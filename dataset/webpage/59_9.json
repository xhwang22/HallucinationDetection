{"David Kappos was responsible for IBM's intellectual property litigation.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J. Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

Kappos as Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAccording to the press release:\n\nMr. Kappos is Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, for IBM Corporation. Based in Armonk, New York, Mr. Kappos directs IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Law function, providing legal counsel over all facets of protecting and licensing IBM\u2019s intellectual property assets and leading IBM\u2019s engagement of intellectual property law policy issues. In particular, Mr. Kappos is responsible for the management of IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios; protecting and licensing intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how and technology) worldwide; directing intellectual property law operations relating to the research, services, consulting, computer systems, storage products, semiconductor and technology development, software, marketing and other groups, divisions, and entities within IBM. In addition, Mr. Kappos has responsibility for IP policy and coordination with IBM\u2019s litigation and corporate development groups in matters relating to intellectual property. Mr. Kappos serves on the Board of Directors of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, and the International Intellectual Property Society. He is also the Vice President of the Intellectual Property Owners Association. He has held various previous leadership positions in intellectual property law associations in Asia and the U.S. He has spoken widely in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. on intellectual property topics. Mr. Kappos received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California Davis in 1983, and his law degree from the University of California Berkeley in 1990. He joined IBM in 1983 as a Development Engineer and has served as an Intellectual Property Law attorney in IBM\u2019s Storage Division and Litigation group, as IP Law Counsel in IBM Software Group, as Assistant General Counsel in IBM Asia/Pacific, IBM Corporate Counsel and as Assistant General Counsel prior to his current position.\n\nThis is sure to be a blow to Gene Quinn, of IPWatchdog, who nominated Alfred E. Neuman for PTO Director. Gene\u2019s rationale:\n\nA character like Al Neuman would be perfect because he wouldn\u2019t (and couldn\u2019t) get in the way of the progress being made by the quite able members of the PTO senior management team who are doing what is necessary to move the PTO forward. Amazing what can be accomplished without having the watchful eye (and meddling) of a political appointment.\n\nThe Coalition for Patent Fairness (CPF) has already issued the its statement regarding the nomination of Kappos as Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office:\n\nThe PTO has an important role to play in fostering an economic environment that promotes American innovation and global competitiveness, spurs new product development and creates jobs here in the United States. As leading U.S. patent holders, we look forward to the opportunity to work with Mr. Kappos in helping the PTO fulfill that important responsibility. We support President Obama\u2019s call for reforms to the US patent system that will spur innovation and job creation.\n\nThe IAM Blog thinks Kappos is good news for the USPTO and the wider IP community:\n\nFor my part, I think he will do an excellent job. He knows the issues; he has a strong IP background; he comes from an industry in which IP is hugely important; he knows all the major players; he has long management experience; and he thinks deeply about IP and its role in society. Frankly, I cannot think of anyone better to do the job. He is not perfect, but who is? President Obama has made a good choice.\n\nDennis Crouch at Patently-O is excited:\n\nAs someone who writes daily about US Patent Law, I am excited about the Kappos nomination because he is likely to open access to previously hidden data and information. He will also work to create systems that work and measures that are meaningful. I suspect that the biggest challenge for Mr. Kappos will be moving beyond the unique IBM perspective. Big Blue is an atypical patent owner in its internal systems, patenting volume, and licensing power. As I discussed earlier, it will be important for him to spend time understanding how the rest of the patent community operates.\n\nBiotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) President and CEO Jim Greenwood gave Kappos a thumbs up:\n\nWe believe Mr. Kappos will bring a thoughtful perspective to the Department of Commerce and the USPTO. He has a long history of industry experience, providing a point of view and insights we have always thought to be highly valuable in this position. He also has a demonstrated track record of managing a large organization, and a true appreciation for industrial innovation. As a prominent and respected member of the patent community, Mr. Kappos brings much goodwill to this position. We look forward to working with him and his leadership team over the coming years.\n\nThe Patent Prospector questions the nomination given that IBM has submitted some questionable patent applications (citing its 2009/0119,148 application for \u201cenhancing productivity,\u201d which appears to claims claims using shorter hours to facilitate shorter meetings):\n\nPresident Obama announced today nominees for two related governmental posts: Director, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy; and Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Warren F. \u201cPete\u201d Miller, Jr., a part-time Professor at Texas A&M University, got the easier job. Managing the real radioactive waste went to David J. Kappos, who, as long-time corporate mook, has shaped IBM patent policy, publicly spouting horse hockey in the process. People have been known to rise to a position, garnering dignity.

Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.
