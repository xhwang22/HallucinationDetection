He joined the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI) in the early 1970s and went on to act as its general secretary (1974-82). In addition he was to represent the party on Belfast City Council (1977-85) and in October 1982 was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of North Down (1982-86). Then in 1984 Cushnahan succeeded Oliver Napier as leader of the APNI (1984-87) and in this role attempted to strengthen his party's ties with the British Liberals. The biggest test of his leadership however came with the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) and he went on to ensure that the APNI largely supported its implementation. Frustrated with the lack of any immediate indication of devolved powers being returned to Northern Ireland, he then decided to resign as party leader in 1987. In 1989, after having moved to the Republic of Ireland, Cushnahan joined Fine Gael (FG) and succeeded in being elected in 1989 as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the constituency of Munster (1989-2004). He announced early in 2004 his intention to stand down as an MEP.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.calendarz.com/on-this-day/july/23/john-cushnahan", "page_content": "Birth\n\nJul, 23\n\nJohn Cushnahan\n\nJohn Cushnahan, Northern Irish educator and politician\n\nJohn Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\n\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.
