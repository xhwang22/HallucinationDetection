He used to be a check forger, impostor, and escape artist. He had a bad reputation in the 1960s for passing $2.5 million worth of carefully forged checks across 26 countries for five years, beginning when he was 16 years old.\n\nHe said he had created at least eight separate identities, pretending to be an airline pilot, a doctor, a prison agent, and a lawyer. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a moving airplane at the airport and once from an American prison), before he was 21 years old.[1]\n\nHe served less than five years in prison before starting to work for the American federal (national) government. He is a consultant and lecturer at the academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is the national police of the United States. He also runs Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.[2]\n\nAbagnale's life story was made into the movie Catch Me If You Can directed by Steven Spielberg in 2002 and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It is based on the autobiography Catch Me If You Can by Frank Abagnale. A Broadway musical Catch Me If You Can opened in April 2011 in New York City.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dazzled-by-creativity-why-we-excuse-dishonest-acts/", "page_content": "Con artists rarely inspire admiration. Frank Abagnale Jr., however, was hardly a typical con artist. Cunning and charismatic, Abagnale forged checks, diplomas, and transcripts en route to assuming at least eight identities and posing as a pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor\u2014all before his nineteenth birthday. Although he eventually was caught and sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for his cons, he served less than five years before the U.S. government recruited him to fight the very types of crimes that he had perpetrated so successfully himself. He also became the subject of a Hollywood blockbuster film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Catch Me If You Can.\n\nAbagnale\u2019s crimes were dangerous and harmful. When he forged checks, he had to convince the teller to break every rule in the bank to cash the check, thus putting the teller\u2019s job in danger. And though he did not fly a plane when he dressed up like a pilot, he flew for free to many locations and charged hotel expenses back to the airline. Despite the harm Abagnale\u2019s behavior created, we think about it differently from other crimes. To our eyes, his behaviors are not as morally problematic because they were creative. Their undeniable creativity garnered him respect rather than moral outrage.\n\nAs it turns out, we all have a tendency to view unethical behavior as less dishonest when it also is creative, as I found in recent research I conducted in collaboration with Scott Wiltermuth (of the University of Southern California) and Lynne Vincent (of the University of Syracuse). We are much harsher on people who rob banks than on people who achieve the same objective but through creative methods like those employed by Abagnale. This is important as it introduces a bias in the way we judge dishonesty and punish it, thus reducing the likelihood of seeing more of the same behavior in the future. But there is another reason why our research is potentially interesting: creative forms of unethical behavior are more likely to be imitated than other forms of unethical behavior because people admire the behavior\u2019s creativity, we discovered. It seems that people view creativity as a positive, valuable trait that provides creative cheaters with a halo that makes their transgressions more palatable and more socially contagious.\n\nIn one of our studies, we collected data from 247 master\u2019s degree students at a U.S. law school. The students read a short scenario describing a dishonest behavior that was either creative (creativity condition) or less creative (control condition) and then rated the perpetrator on a series of attributes. In both conditions, the victim of the transgression was a large retail store that presumably would be harmed, but not greatly, by a single theft of $50. In the control condition, students read, \u201cPat works as a cashier at a large retail store. One day, a customer purchases $50 worth of merchandise and pays with cash. After the customer leaves, Pat opens the cash register and takes the $50 bill. As several cashiers use that register during the day, Pat\u2019s theft will not be connected directly to Pat.\u201d In the creative condition, students read, \u201cPat works as a cashier at a large retail store. One day, a customer purchases $50 worth of merchandise and pays with cash. After the customer leaves, Pat processes a fake return for the merchandise and takes the $50 bill. As cashiers process multiple returns during the day, Pat's theft will not be connected directly to Pat.\u201d\n\nThe result? The students who participated in the study punished Pat less severely for the creative transgression than for the less creative transgression because they viewed the creative transgression as less unethical. Based on this result and others from follow-up studies we conducted, we conclude that there may be instances in which people facing fines or punishments for their transgressions would try to highlight their creativity when defending their actions. Transgressors who do so, however, risk giving the impression that they are proud and unremorseful about their acts\u2014an impression that generally increases the severity of punishment.\n\nPeople not only judge others less harshly for creative (as compared to less creative) transgressions; they judge themselves more leniently for creative transgressions as well. In one study, for instance, we asked participants to recall a time in their lives when they either \u201cbroke or bypassed rules\u201d or \u201ccreatively broke or bypassed rules.\u201d They were more forgiving of their rule-breaking behavior when it was creative.\n\nInterestingly, though people judge creative dishonest acts as less morally problematic than less creative ones, people do not agree in principle that creativity make a transgression less unethical, we find. A disconnect therefore exists between people\u2019s abstract beliefs and their judgments of specific creative transgressions.\n\nWe also found that unethical behaviors spread more or less quickly within a group depending on how creative those behaviors are. In earlier work I conducted with Dan Ariely (of Duke University) and Shahar Ayal (of IDC in Israel), we demonstrated that unethical behavior is contagious when it is seen as normative and legitimate, and when it is not explicitly punished or disapproved. In my work with Wiltermuth and Vincent, we took this research a step further and examined whether more creative unethical behavior spread more quickly than less creative behavior. In one of our studies, we asked 216 MBA students from a university in the Southeastern United States to work as a group on a series of trivia questions. In each group, a paid actor suggested and performed a creative method of cheating, a less creative method of cheating, or no method of cheating. We then looked at whether, across these different situations, participants adopted the actor\u2019s behavior. As we expected, participants who witnessed the confederate cheating in a creative manner were more likely to emulate that behavior than were those who witnessed the confederate cheating in a less-creative manner and than those who did not witness the confederate cheating.\n\nSo, next time you find yourself smiling at someone who was able to get around the rules in creative ways, make sure you do not lose sight of the fact that he or she may have crossed ethical boundaries. If this was the case, then whether the behavior was creative or not should not affect how you think about the transgression and make decisions on whether to condemn it or not. Without thinking about creative, dishonest acts more thoughtfully, in fact, we may find ourselves copying them.\n\nAnd we should also keep in mind that, despite the fact that unethical behavior usually results in some benefits in the short term \u2013 as in the case of Abagnale\u2019s free flights and hotel stays, it generally involves bigger costs in the long term, no matter how creative the behavior was. After spending many years in prison, Abagnale struggled to find legitimate work. In the end, he turned his skill into a consulting career, advising banks and businesses on how to avoid fraud, and he became a millionaire by legitimate means. But when he looks back, he is the first to say that he is not proud of the actions that led to years of prison and regrets the time he ended up spending behind bars. There are more productive ways to use one\u2019s creativity than in trying to get around rules."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/crime/frank-abagnale", "page_content": "(1948-)\n\nWho Is Frank Abagnale?\n\nThe son of a stationery business owner, Frank Abagnale entered the world of crime as a youngster with credit card and check schemes. He later impersonated various white-collar professionals, creating an overseas trail, and was arrested at 21 by the French police. Abagnale was eventually hired by the FBI as a consultant and then started his own agency, educating corporations, financial institutions and government organizations on how to detect and handle fraudulence. A portion of his life was the subject of the popular 2002 film Catch Me If You Can.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was born on April 27, 1948, in Bronxville, New York. Much of the information known to the public about his personal history was shared in his 1980 memoir Catch Me If You Can. Abagnale would later say via his website that some of the details in the book were exaggerated, with the preface also stating that certain details of the story were altered to protect other parties.\n\nAccording to the memoir, Abagnale was the third of four children born to parents Paulette Abagnale and Frank Abagnale Sr. The couple met in Algiers during World War II, while Frank Sr. was stationed in Oran, with Paulette still only in her teens when they wed. After the war, the two moved to New York, where Frank Sr. started his own business.\n\nAbagnale would later state that he had a stable childhood and was especially close to his father, who traveled often and became deeply involved in Republican local politics. When his mother decided to leave Frank Sr. due to her husband's absences, the younger Frank's life was turned upside-down. Not only were his siblings devastated, but so was his father, who was still in love with his wife. As his mother worked toward her independence, Frank Jr. decided to live with his father after the divorce, and he often tagged along on business dealings. It was during this time that Frank Jr. learned about white-collar transactions.\n\nCredit Card Schemes\n\nAs a teenager, Abagnale got caught up in petty crimes, including shoplifting. He soon grew tired of these practices, though, and decided to move into more sophisticated forms of burglary. Specifically, Abagnale began using his father's gas credit card to make a tidy profit. Abagnale convinced gas station attendants to give him a portion of his sale back in cash and allowed them to pocket a portion of the proceeds. The scam fell apart, though, when his father got the credit card bill, which added up to thousands of dollars. Unbeknownst to Abagnale, his father was struggling financially.\n\nDismayed over her son's delinquency, Abagnale's mother sent him to a school for wayward boys. Undone by his father's newfound circumstances and caught between his parents' tensions, Abagnale reportedly left home at 16 years old.\n\nAbagnale had little in his bank account and no formal education. Abagnale altered his driver\u2019s license to make himself 10 years older than he was and exaggerated his education. This helped him get better-paying jobs, but he still barely made ends meet.\n\nAbagnale decided to quit working and wrote bad checks to support himself. Before long, Abagnale had written hundreds of bad checks and overdrawn his account by thousands of dollars. Knowing that he would eventually be caught, he went into hiding.\n\nImpersonations Meant to Impress\n\nAbagnale realized that he could cash more bad checks if he dazzled bank tellers with a new, more impressive personality. He decided pilots were highly respected professionals, so he schemed his way into getting a pilot's uniform. Abagnale called Pan American Airlines' headquarters and told them that he had lost his uniform while traveling. HQ told him where to go to pick up a new one, which he did \u2014 and charged it to the company using a fake employee I.D.\n\nAbagnale then learned all he could about flying \u2014 once, by pretending he was a high schooler doing a student newspaper article on Pan Am \u2014 and cleverly forged his own pilot's I.D. and F.A.A. license. His ruse earned him valuable information about how to impersonate a pilot, which he did allegedly in order to hitch rides on planes all across the world.\n\nOnce Pan Am and police began catching on to Abagnale's lies, he decided to change identities again, this time becoming an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. When a local doctor came visiting, Abagnale thought his identity was blown \u2014 but instead, he was invited to visit the local hospital, where he became a regular visitor and purportedly landed a temporary job. Abagnale eventually gave up the gig and left town.\n\nOver the next two years, Abagnale was said to have bounced from job to job. But eventually, Abagnale's past caught up with him when he settled down in Montpelier, France. He had decided to live a straight life for awhile after having reputedly cashed $2.5 million in bad checks over the years. When a former girlfriend recognized his face on a wanted poster, she turned him in to authorities.\n\nJail Time and Consultancy\n\nAbagnale served time in France (reputedly in the harsh confines of Perpignan, where he became seriously ill), Sweden and the United States for his crimes, during which time his father died. Abagnale was eventually granted parole after several years from a Petersburg, Virginia prison. He eventually found lecturing work as a white-collar crime specialist, providing information to bank employees about ways to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nIn exchange for his freedom, the government told Abagnale that he had to educate them about his methods in order to prevent others from defrauding authorities. Abagnale worked with the FBI for more than 30 years as one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on document fraud, check swindling, forgery and embezzlement. He also started his own company, Abagnale & Associates, which educates others on how to avoid becoming fraud victims.\n\nMovie: 'Catch Me If You Can'\n\nIn 2002, Steven Spielberg made a film about Abagnale's life, Catch Me If You Can, based on the aforementioned memoir. Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the famous impostor, with Christopher Walken portraying Frank Abagnale Sr. and receiving an Oscar nod for the role. The movie later inspired a Broadway musical version which ran for several months in 2011 at the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nUpon the film's release, more questions were raised about what parts of Abagnale's story are true and can be verified. Abagnale has later said that he regrets that the film was made, preferring to have left that part of his life behind.\n\nBooks\n\nAbagnale wrote the books The Art of the Steal (2001) and Stealing Your Life (2007), both about fraud prevention.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1948\n\nBirth date: April 27, 1948\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: Bronxville\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Male\n\nBest Known For: Frank Abagnale gained notoriety in the United States and overseas for his fraudulent crimes.

According to Abagnale Jr, the movie only deviates in subtle ways. He argues that there are embellished details and added scenes, but most of his 20s unfolded just as the film presents. However, if you ask experts, journalists, or researchers who've dedicated years to investigating Abagnale's claims, there isn't a lot of evidence to back up the stories that the con man has been recounting for decades. Take, for example, the charming romance at the center of this film.\n\nIn 2020, journalist Alan C. Logan wrote \"The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Catching Truth, While We Can.\" The book debunks many of Abagnale's claims, including the story of his relationship with Paula Parks, the woman who became the basis of Amy Adams' Brenda. Logan spoke directly to Parks, who says that their relationship in the film is not only heavily exaggerated, but blithely mischaracterized. In reality, Parks was a stewardess who met Abagnale while he was posing as a pilot. Though they struck up a friendship, it was quickly derailed when he discovered her work schedule (through deceptive means) and followed her all over the Eastern Seabord.\n\nLogan spoke to WHYY-TV in 2021 and explained that \"Parks didn't know what to do with him. She tried to tell him that she wasn't interested, but he was persistent.\" After essentially stalking her through work, Abagnale showed up at her apartment in New Orleans where she told him that she was leaving to go visit her parents in Baton Rouge. He decided to tag along. After he met her parents, the duo parted ways and that seemed to be the end of it ... until Abagnale returned."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/884584/everything-catch-me-if-you-can-doesnt-tell-you-about-the-true-story/", "page_content": "Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the memoir \"Catch Me If You Can\" is a wild ride that explores the life of con-man and check fraudster Frank Abagnale Jr. While the film was made in good faith and only claims to be inspired by the book, the veracity of Frank's story have been disputed by journalists as early as 1978 and are still being refuted 20 years after the film was released.\n\nAbagnale's 1980 memoir was ghost-written by crime reporter Stan Redding and, as reported by the Los Angeles Times, contains a disclaimer, stating, \"This book is based on the true-life exploits of Frank Abagnale. To protect the right of those whose paths have crossed the author's, all of the characters and some of the events have been altered, and all names, dates and places have been changed.\" Abagnale wrote on his website at the time of the film's release that he was only interviewed four times by Redding and that the story was dramatized in the manner the editor wanted.\n\nThe timeline was further altered and condensed by screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, who stated, \"I don't know if anyone will ever know the actual truth.\" A sentiment echoed by Abagnale himself when he told the Los Angeles Times, \"Basically, I felt the movie was more accurate than the book, but in the final analysis only I really know.\" Join us while we parse out everything \"Catch Me If You Can\" doesn't tell you about the true story."}, {"url": "https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-prisons-incarceration/frank-abagnale/", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale was a famous check-forger, imposter, and con-artist.

While being transferred into prison by a United States Marshal, the Marshal forgot to give the prison Abagnale\u2019s detention commitment. This struck the administration as unusual, and caused the guards to believe that he was a prison inspector sent by the FBI. Using this information to his advantage he used his phone call to get his friend, Jean Sebring, to forge a business card to back up the story.\n\nSebring used a business card given to her by FBI Agent Joe Shea and altered it to include Abignale\u2019s information. Once delivered to Abignale, he told the guards that he was in fact an inspector sent by the FBI and that he had to get outside of the prison to talk to his fellow FBI agent.

Following the war, the two relocated to New York, where Frank Sr. established his own company.\n\nAbagnale\u2019s first victim was his father, who handed him a credit card for gasoline and a truck and was eventually responsible for a $3,400 payment. At the time, Abagnale was just 15 years old. According to Abagnale\u2019s book, he was sent to a Catholic Charities USA-run reform school in Westchester County, New York, for this crime.\n\nAt the age of 16, he enrolled in the United States Navy in December 1964. He was released after less than three months and was caught shortly after for forgery. Abagnale was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Eureka, California in 1965 for automobile theft after stealing a Ford Mustang from one of his father\u2019s neighbors.\n\nAbagnale was also accused of impersonating a US customs agent, but the case was eventually dismissed. This stolen automobile case was moved to the Southern District of New York on 2nd June 1965.

He also owns and operates Abagnale and Associates, a financial consulting firm.\n\nFrank Abagnale\u2019s Scams\n\nThere are a number of frauds that Frank Abagnale did to scam people. Here is the list of those scams\n\nCredit Card Scam\n\nAbagnale began making money with his father\u2019s petrol credit card. Abagnale persuaded gas station employees to refund him a portion of his transaction in cash, allowing them to keep a piece of the money. When his father received the credit card statement, which totaled thousands of dollars, the scheme fell apart.\n\nAbagnale had no idea that his father was having financial difficulties. Abagnale\u2019s mother, concerned about her son\u2019s misbehavior, enrolled him in a boarding school for misbehaving boys. Abagnale reportedly left home at the age of 16 because of his father\u2019s unexpected circumstances and the conflicts between his parents. Abagnale was a poor man with little money and no formal education.\n\nAbagnale forged his driver\u2019s license and overstated his schooling to appear ten years older than he was. He was able to secure better-paying employment as a result of this, but he was still barely scraping by. Abagnale decided to stop working and support himself by writing bogus checks.\n\nBefore he realized it, Abagnale had generated hundreds of bogus checks and it had overdrawn his bank by thousands of dollars. He went underground since he knew he would ultimately be discovered.\n\nImpersonations Scam\n\nAbagnale discovered that if he wowed bank telleprs with a new, more dazzling personality, he could cash more fraudulent checks. He believed that pilots were well-respected professionals and devised a plan to obtain a pilot\u2019s uniform.\n\nAbagnale contacted Pan American Airlines to report that he had misplaced his uniform while on the road. HQ directed him to where he could get a new one, which he did \u2014 and then charged it to the firm using a fictitious employee identification number.\n\nAbagnale then ingeniously manufactured his own pilot\u2019s I.D. and F.A.A. license by claiming to be a high school student conducting a student newspaper piece on Pan Am and learning everything he could about flying. His deception netted his important information on how to pass himself off as a pilot, which he used to reportedly hitch rides on flights all around the world.\n\nWhen Pan Am and the authorities discovered Abagnale\u2019s falsehoods, he decided to alter his identity once more, this time as an out-of-town doctor in Georgia. Abagnale feared his identity had been revealed when a local doctor paid him a visit, but instead he was invited to attend the local hospital, where he became a frequent visitor and allegedly obtained a temporary job. Abagnale finally quit his job and moved out of town.\n\nAbagnale was believed to have hopped from job to job during the following two years. When Abagnale moved to Montpelier, France, however, his history caught up with him. After allegedly cashing $2.5 million in fraudulent checks over the years, he had chosen to live a straight life for some time. His face was recognized on a wanted poster by a previous girlfriend, who handed him to investigators.\n\nAbagnale was believed to have hopped from job to job during the following two years.

His face was recognized on a wanted poster by a previous girlfriend, who handed him to investigators.\n\nTime in prison and consulting\n\nAbagnale was sentenced to prison in France (where he allegedly grew gravely ill), Sweden, and the United States for his crimes, at which time his father died. After serving several years in a Virginia prison, Abagnale was ultimately given release. He ultimately got a job as a white-collar fraud specialist, giving lectures to bank personnel about how to avoid fraud and theft.\n\nThe government informed Abagnale that in exchange for his freedom, he had to teach them about his tactics in order to avoid others from scamming authorities. For more than 30 years, Abagnale worked for the FBI as one of the world\u2019s leading specialists on document fraud, check defrauding, forgery, and misappropriation. He also founded Abagnale & Associates, a firm that teaches others how to avoid becoming victims of fraud.\n\nFacts\n\nHe was a check forger, imposter, and escape artist in the past. In the 1960s, he earned a terrible reputation by transferring $2.5 million in meticulously counterfeit cheques across 26 nations over a five-year period, starting when he was 16 years old.\n\nHe claimed to have assumed the identities of an airline pilot, a doctor, a jail guard, and a lawyer, among others.\n\nBefore he was 21 years old, he escaped from police custody twice once from a moving airplane at an airport and even once from an American prison.\n\nBefore beginning to work for the American federal (national) government, he spent fewer than five years in jail.\n\nHe works as a consultant and instructor for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States\u2019 national police force.\n\nHe also owns and operates Abagnale & Associates, a financial fraud consulting firm.\n\nThe film Catch Me If You Can, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, was based on Abagnale\u2019s life.\n\nThe film was inspired by Frank Abagnale\u2019s memoirs Catch Me If You Can. Catch Me If You Can, a Broadway musical premiered in April 2011 in New York City.\n\nFAQs"}, {"url": "https://www.wired.co.uk/article/frank-abagnale", "page_content": "Frank Abagnale's early life story has been told many times. A former conman who specialised in impersonation and forgery, he was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can. His story has also been told as a book, a musical and is drawn upon in TV series White Collar.\n\nAt the age of 16, Abagnale posed as a pilot for Pan Am Airlines in order to wangle free flights. He later pretended to be a doctor, before masquerading as an attorney \u2013 just some of the eight different identities Abagnale claims to have assumed. Throughout this time he became a master forger of cheques, defrauding banks of millions of pounds. He was arrested at the age of 21 in France and spent six months in prison there, six months in a Swedish jail and was then deported to the US (not before he'd escaped from the aeroplane intended to transport him). After serving five years of his 12-year sentence, he was paroled on the condition that he helped the FBI uncover cheque forgers. He has since made a career as a security consultant, working closely with the FBI for almost 40 years, and launching his own company Abagnale & Associates.\n\nAbagnale talks to WIRED about his past life as a conman, identity theft, the criminal opportunities made possible by the web and the efforts made by governments to fight cybercrime.\n\nHow would the technology available today have affected your ability to con people in your early years?\n\nWhat I did was almost 50 years ago and it's about 4,000 times easier today to con people than when I did it. To forge a cheque 50 years ago, you needed a Heidelberg printed press, you had to be a skilled printer, know how to do colour separations, negatives, type-setting... those presses were 90 feet long and 18 feet high. There was a lot of work involved in creating a cheque.\n\nToday, you open a laptop. If you are going to forge a British Airways cheque, you go to their website, capture the corporate logo and put it in the top right corner. You then put a jet taking off in the background and make a really fancy four-colour cheque in 15 minutes on your computer. You then go down to an office supply store, buy security cheque paper and put it in your colour printer."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/frank-abagnale-jr", "page_content": "According to a new book about the true story of \"Catch Me If You Can,\" many of Frank Abagnale Jr.'s alleged cons purportedly occurred while he was in prison.\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. was one of America\u2019s greatest con men. He pretended to be a doctor, a Pan American airlines pilot, a Georgia lawyer, and a Brigham Young University professor. He claimed to have cashed over $2 million in bad checks and maintains that he was caught only to be offered work at the FBI. But new research into the true story of Catch Me If You Can, his hit memoir, suggests that this entire narrative may be Abagnale\u2019s biggest hoax yet.\n\nCatch Me If You Can was famously adapted by Steven Spielberg in 2002. The silver screen version truncated events and conflated characters to serve an acceptable run-time, but the source material itself was never broadly in question \u2014 until journalist Alan C. Logan tried to verify its many claims.\n\nLogan remembered seeing the film years ago and leaving with a lingering feeling that things didn\u2019t add up. It seemed impossible to maintain the charade of a lawyer for the attorney general\u2019s office in Baton Rouge, and to navigate the world while making millions and evading the FBI as a teenager seemed preposterous.\n\nAccording to WHYY, the award-winning science journalist finally did some digging into the true story of Catch Me If You Can and has proved his instincts correct.\n\nThe Many Cons Of Frank Abagnale Jr.\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. started his grift in the mid-1960s, according to his own telling and that of the film. Born in 1948, the young New Yorker began forging checks at 15. He claimed that his skills allowed him to travel the world in luxurious style for years. While those tales are now in doubt, his 1969 arrest was certainly real.\n\nAbagnale claimed his capture in Montpellier, France was preceded by a string of adventures: fooling Pan American Airways as a pilot, practicing as a doctor in Georgia, teaching at Brigham Young University, and fleeing the FBI while becoming a lawyer for the Baton Rouge attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nHe was finally caught in 1969 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He claimed the federal government released him early to help the FBI catch like-minded con artists, but Logan found no bureau official ever having made a public statement on that relationship. There\u2019s not even a record of Abagnale having passed the bar exam.\n\nThe Surprisingly Dark True Story Of Catch Me If You Can\n\nLogan believes Abagnale managed to pull the wool over everyone\u2019s eyes with lectures, television appearances, and a bestselling memoir. According to Esquire, it was the Hollywood adaptation, however, that rubbed Logan the wrong way.\n\n\u201cI remember just having this nagging feeling that something just wasn\u2019t quite right about it,\u201d said Logan. \u201cAnd that was that. That thought, you know, went into the back of my mind for a couple of decades almost.\u201d\n\nLogan\u2019s new book The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Catching Truth, While We Can was forged out of public records and brand new interviews. He found that Abagnale\u2019s most alluring con of impersonating a commercial airline pilot was instead a case of petty theft and stalking.\n\n\u201cWhat really happened was that, dressed as a TWA (Trans World Airlines) pilot, which he only did for a few weeks, he befriended a flight attendant called Paula Parks,\u201d said Logan. \u201cHe followed her all over the Eastern Seaboard, identified her work schedule through deceptive means, and essentially stalked the woman.\u201d\n\nAbagnale purportedly even showed up at her New Orleans apartment one time. She tried to get rid of him by explaining she was going to visit her family in Baton Rouge. Instead, Abagnale invited himself to join her.\n\n\u201cSo Frank Abagnale meets her parents in Baton Rouge,\u201d explained Logan. \u201cFrank and Paula\u2026part ways, and a few days later, Frank Abagnale shows back up at the house in Baton Rouge and said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Paula\u2019s friend. Remember me? I\u2019m on furlough as a pilot.\u2019 And they invited him in out of kindness.\u201d\n\nThe generous family introduced Abagnale to their high-profile friends. Meanwhile, he stole $1,200 worth of checks from them and various businesses in the area \u2014 in stark contradiction to Abagnale\u2019s narrative of only ever defrauding hotels, banks, and airlines.\n\nThe True Legacy Of A Lifelong Con Man\n\nLogan believes Abagnale\u2019s fabricated construct of himself began around 1977, after being paroled and nurturing his legend through speaking engagements and a To Tell The Truth game show appearance \u2014 which was recreated for the film.\n\nThis led to nationally televised interviews on shows like The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, which cemented his narrative for good. Various local newspapers did expose some of Abagnale\u2019s fabrications, but a lack of communication between publications before the internet saw these discoveries buried.\n\n\u201cSo Abagnale\u2019s narrative that between the ages of 16 and 20, he was on the run, chased all over the United States and even internationally by the FBI. This is completely fictitious,\u201d said Logan. \u201cPublic records obtained by me show that he was confined for the most part in prison during those years.\u201d\n\nLogan even interviewed Pan Am spokesperson Bruce Haxthausen about their financial losses during the years in question \u2014 to shocking results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve checked with the security people and everyone here, and it never happened. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard of this, and we would have heard or at least remembered it if it happened,\u201d said Haxthausen.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t forget $2.5 million bad checks. I\u2019d say this guy is as phony as a $3 bill.\u201d\n\nAfter reading about Frank Abagnale Jr. and the true story of Catch Me If You Can, learn about nine of history\u2019s biggest con artists and the scams they almost got away with.
