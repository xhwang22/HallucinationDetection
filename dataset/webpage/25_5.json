The proposed planar wall is constructed by a periodic subwavelength unit cell (with a thickness of \u03bb/19) which consists of two different multiple-cavity resonators embedded into a plate structure with a groove. The sound absorption of the wall exists in two working bands (IandII) below 600 Hz which are created by two different mechanisms. In addition to the band I created by a conventional resonance coupling of the two multiple-cavity resonators, it is worth noting that the band II is realized by a mutual resonance coupling between the resonators and groove structure. The fractional bandwidths of the bands I and II can reach about 34.1 and 10.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the application of the proposed ultrathin planar wall in the design of a barrier-free anechoic room with omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption is further discussed in detail. The proposed planar wall has the advantages of ultrathin planar structure and omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption, which provides diverse routes to design advanced sound-absorption structures in noise control and architectural acoustics.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLow-frequency sound absorption has always been a research hotspot due to its wider applications in several important fields, including noise control, environmental protection, and architectural acoustics. In the recent years, the rapid development of metamaterial [1\u201310] and metasurface [11\u201318] structures have provided alternative ways to design advanced acoustic absorbers which effectively overcome the limitation of a relatively large size for conventional low-frequency sound absorbers [19\u201321].\n\nBy designing resonance-type unit cells with a subwavelength size, external sound energy can be absorbed in the unit cell based on different types of mechanisms, and part of energy is dissipated during its propagation inside the unit cell. So far, the previously demonstrated unit cells of sound absorbers mainly include Helmholtz resonators [22\u201326], Fabry-Perot resonators [27, 28], membrane resonators [29\u201331], split-ring resonators [32\u201334], coherent perfect absorbers [35, 36], and metasurface-based absorbers [37\u201342], and these types of sound absorbers can realize high-performance sound absorption with a subwavelength structure. However, most of these sound absorbers generally work in a single working band, and there still exist some difficulties in designing multiband sound absorbers.\n\nTo overcome this, by constructing a type of double-channel Mie resonator backed with a rigid wall [43], a multi-band sound absorber based on multi-order monopolar and dipolar resonances have been proposed. Additionally, a perforated composite Helmholtz-resonator [44] is designed by inserting several plates with a small hole into the interior of a Helmholtz resonator, and a multi-order sound absorption has been realized. Beyond that, other types of absorber structures, such as coiling-up space metasurfaces [45] by two nesting subchannels with a circular hole in series, checkerboard absorbers [46] composed of alternate distributions of inhomogeneous Helmholtz resonators with extended necks, and metaporous composite structures [47] by porous materials with Helmholtz and Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot resonances, can also be applied to the realization of dual- or multi-band sound absorption. In these demonstrated structures, dual- or multi-band sound absorption with high performance are realized. However, most of them are usually designed to be attached outside the wall, which greatly limits the use of space. Therefore, the design of low-frequency ultrathin planar wall with multi-band sound absorption becomes an urgent problem to be solved.\n\nIn this work, we propose an ultrathin planar wall with low-frequency dual-band sound absorption which is composed of a periodic unit cell designed by two different multiple-cavity resonators embedded into a plate structure with a groove. The designed wall can realize sound absorption in two working bands (I and II) below 600 Hz based on two different mechanisms. Besides the band I created by a conventional resonance coupling of the two multiple-cavity resonators, we here introduce a mutual resonance coupling between the resonators and groove structure to realize the band II. The fractional bandwidth of both bands can reach about 34.1 and 10.4%. The measured results agree well with the simulated ones. Finally, we simulate the sound absorption of the unit cell created by different incident angles, and discuss the application of the proposed wall in the design of a barrier-free anechoic room with omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption in detail.\n\nDesign of Model\n\nAs schematically shown in Figure 1A, we propose a type of ultrathin planar wall composed of periodic unit cells, and the cross section of a unit cell with the width of D is shown in Figure 1B. We can see that the unit cell consists of two multiple-cavity resonators (denoted as MRs I and II) with the distance of a embedded into a plate structure with a groove. The multiple-cavity resonator is composed of a central circular cavity surrounded by 8 interconnected identical cavities which are separated by 4 channels with the width of w. Here, the thickness of cavity walls, the open width and the radial length of 8 inner cavities, the outer and inner radii of resonators, and the distances between the resonator and the bottom, left and top surfaces of the plate are t, b, d, R, r, l 1 , l 2 and l 3 , respectively. In addition to the parameters d and r of the MRs I (d 1 and r 1 ) and II (d 2 and r 2 ), the other parameters of both MRs are the same. The unit cell is made of epoxy resin based on the 3D printing technology, and its photograph is shown in Figure 1C. Here, we introduce the software of COMSOL Multiphysics to numerically design sound absorbers. Due to the sound absorption created by the thermoviscous energy loss in the unit cell, the module of Thermoviscous Acoustic-Solid Interaction is used inside the unit cell, and that of Acoustic Pressure module is adopted in the other parts of the model. Beyond that, the surfaces inside the unit cell are set as the thermoviscous acoustic boundary layers, and the thickness of the thermoviscous acoustic boundary layer is d \u03c5 = 2 \u03bc / \u03c1 \u03c9 [37], in which the parameters \u00b5, \u03c1 and \u03c9 are the coefficient of dynamic viscosity, the density of air, and the angular frequency, respectively. In the simulations, the parameters R, r 1 , r 2 , d 1 , d 2 , t, b, w, a, l 1 , l 2 , l 3 and D are selected as 5.0 cm, 5.0 mm, 7.0 mm, 38.8 mm, 36.8 mm, 1.6 mm, 3.0 mm, 1.0 mm, 4.0 mm, 1.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 3.0 mm, and 31.0 cm, respectively, and the material parameters of air and epoxy resin are shown in Table 1.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFIGURE 1. (A) Schematic of an ultrathin planar wall with sound absorption, which is composed of periodic unit cells. (B) Cross section of the unit cell, (C) and sample photograph.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTABLE 1. Material parameters.\n\nPerformances and Mechanisms of Low-Frequency Dual-Band Sound Absorption\n\nHere, we conduct an experiment to measure the performance of the design ultrathin planar wall. As shown in Figure 2A, the experiment is carried out in a straight waveguide with a size of 2 \u00d7 0.33 \u00d7 0.06 m3 which is fabricated with acrylic plates to satisfy the condition of sound hard boundary. The sample of the unit cell is made of epoxy resin by a 3D printing technology, which is placed at the right side of the waveguide. Additionally, a loudspeaker with the size of 4 \u00d7 4 cm2 driven by a power amplifier is placed at the left side of the waveguide to obtain incident sound signals. Two 0.25-inch microphones (Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r type-4954, marked as Microphones 1 and 2) are inserted into the waveguide from two holes with the same size to experimentally detect sound signals. The measured data is recorded by the module of Br\u00fcel and Kj\u00e6r 3160-A-022, and is analyzed by the software of PULSE Labshop.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nFIGURE 2. (A) Experimental set-up. (B) Measured and simulated sound absorption spectra, and black shaded regions are two working bands of the unit cell (I: 145\u2013203 Hz, II: 490\u2013544 Hz). (C) Simulated pressure amplitude eigenfunctions of the unit cell at 163 Hz, 182 Hz, and 517 Hz. (D) Simulated distributions of pressure amplitude in the unit cell created by a normal incidence of sound (red solid arrows) at 170 and 518 Hz.\n\nFigure 2B shows the measured absorption spectra (red open circles) created by the sample, in which the corresponding simulated ones with the same conditions are also provided for comparison (black solid lines), and the parameters of the sample are the same as those in Figure 1. We can see that, there exist two absorption peaks around 170 and 518 Hz, and their maximum absorption coefficients can reach about 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, showing a typical characteristic of low-frequency dual-band sound absorption. Additionally, in the two black shaded regions (denoted as the bands I and II), the absorption coefficients are larger than 0.5, and thus the corresponding fractional bandwidths (the ratio of the bandwidth to the center frequency) can reach about 34.1 and 10.4%, respectively. The measured and simulated absorption spectra match well with each other. Moreover, the thickness of the unit cell is 104 mm, which is equal to \u03bb/19 (\u03bb is the wavelength), exhibiting a characteristic of ultrathin structure for the proposed wall.\n\nTo provide a further insight into its mechanism, we simulate pressure amplitude eigenfunctions of the unit cell around 170 and 518 Hz. As shown in Figure 2C, 3 types of eigenmodes exist at 163 Hz, 182 and 517 Hz. We can see that the distributions of pressure amplitude for the eigenmodes at 163 and 182 Hz are almost the same, and most of sound energy is concentrated into the cavities of the two MRs, showing that both eigenmodes are related to a resonance coupling of both MR structures. However, for the eigenmode at 517 Hz, the sound energy is mainly concentrated into the space between the MRs and groove structure, and little energy exists inside the cavity of both MRs. Thus, this eigenmode is determined by a mutual resonance coupling between the MRs and groove structure, which is different from the eigenmodes at 163 and 182 Hz. Figure 2D shows the pressure amplitude distributions in the unit cell created by the normal incidence of sound at the frequencies of both absorption peaks (170 and 518 Hz). We can see that the sound energy is mainly concentrated into the cavities of both MRs at 170 Hz, in which its distribution of pressure amplitude is the same as that of the eigenmodes at 163 and 182 Hz. It is therefore deduced that the absorption peak in the band I is created by the resonance coupling of both MRs. Additionally, the characteristics of the pressure amplitude distributions at 518 Hz are almost the same as those of the eigenmode at 517 Hz, indicating that the absorption peak in the band II is attributed to the mutual resonance coupling between the resonators and groove structure. Therefore, the observed dual-band sound absorption of the wall arises from two different mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, we discuss the influences of the parameters r 1 and l 3 on the sound absorption of the unit cell in detail (see Supplementary Material), and the results show that the sound absorption in the band II can be modulated by simply adjusting both parameters r 1 and l 3 , but that in the band I is only closely related to the parameter r 1 , which provides the feasibility of modulating both working bands.\n\nApplication of Ultrathin Planar Wall in Barrier-Free Anechoic Room\n\nFigures 3A,B show the simulated sound absorption spectra of the unit cell created by the incident waves with \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 in the bands I and II, respectively, in which \u03b8 is defined as the angle between the incident direction and the normal line (shown in the inset in Figure 3A). We can see that, with the increase of the angle \u03b8, the frequency of the absorption peak almost remains unchanged in the band I (Figure 3A), and that slightly moves to the high-frequency region in the band II (Figure 3B). Additionally, the absorption coefficients of these peaks are larger than 0.9, showing a high-performance sound absorption of the designed unit cell for different incident angles. Such a phenomenon provides a feasibility for constructing a barrier-free anechoic room.\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nFIGURE 3. Simulated absorption spectra of the unit cell in the bands (A) I and (B) II with the incident angle \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.\n\nFinally, we discuss the application of the designed unit cell in a barrier-free anechoic room. As shown in Figure 4A, the proposed structure of barrier-free anechoic room with the size of 3.41 \u00d7 3.41 m2 is composed of 40 unit cells, in which the parameters of each unit cell (shown in the inset in Figure 4A) are the same as those in Figure 1B. Moreover, the module of Thermoviscous Acoustic-Solid Interaction is used inside the unit cells, while the module of Acoustic Pressure is adopted in the other parts of the model. Figures 4B,C show the simulated sound absorption spectra created by the barrier-free anechoic room, in which a cylindrical sound source is placed at the center (point O) of the room. We can see that, the absorption coefficients are larger than 0.5 in the black shaded regions around the bands I (149\u2013194 Hz) and II (490\u2013543 Hz). The maximum values of absorption coefficients are 0.98 and 0.96 at 173 and 519 Hz, respectively, and the corresponding fractional bandwidths can reach about 26.0 and 10.2%, showing a typical characteristic of omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption.\n\nFIGURE 4\n\nFIGURE 4. (A) Schematic of a barrier-free anechoic room with omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption. A cylindrical sound source is located at the point O. Simulated absorption spectra created by the barrier-free anechoic room around the bands (B) I and (C) II. The absorption coefficients are larger than 0.5 in the black shaded regions.\n\nTo further present the performance of sound absorption, we also simulate the total pressure distributions and their corresponding reflected sound intensity distributions in the barrier-free anechoic room at 173 and 519 Hz, which are shown in Figures 5A\u2013D. We can see that the total pressure distributions in the barrier-free anechoic room at both frequencies are obviously different from those in the room with hard boundaries (see Supplementary Material), but are similar to those in the free space (see Supplementary Material). Beyond that, the reflected sound intensity distributions created by the anechoic room are very weak, indicating that the sound energy are almost absorbed by the unit cell in all directions of the room, showing a typical characteristic of omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption.\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nFIGURE 5. Simulated total pressure distributions in the barrier-free anechoic room at (A) 173 Hz and (B) 519 Hz, and its corresponding reflected intensity distributions at (C) 173 Hz and (D) 519 Hz. White points at the center of the room are the positions of cylindrical sound source.\n\nTo verify the robustness of the barrier-free anechoic room, we simulate the sound absorption spectra created by the anechoic room with a cylindrical sound source placed at the point O' (shown in Figure 6A), in which all parameters of the anechoic room remain unchanged. As shown in Figures 6B,C, the absorption coefficients are larger than 0.5 around the bands I (156\u2013185 Hz) and II (501\u2013534 Hz), which are shown in the black shaded regions, in which the maximum values of absorption coefficient can reach about 0.97 at 171 Hz and 0.96 at 519 Hz, and the corresponding fractional bandwidths are about 16.9 and 6.3%, respectively, showing high-robustness dual-band sound absorption of the designed room structure.\n\nFIGURE 6\n\nFIGURE 6. (A) Schematic of a barrier-free anechoic room with a cylindrical sound source placed at the point O'. Simulated absorption spectra created by the barrier-free anechoic room around the (B) bands I and (C) II. The absorption coefficients are larger than 0.5 in the black shaded regions.\n\nFigure 7 shows the simulated total pressure distributions and their corresponding reflected sound intensity distributions created by the barrier-free anechoic room at 171 and 519 Hz. We can see that the characteristics of total pressure distributions and corresponding reflected intensity distributions are almost the same as that in Figure 5. Therefore, the proposed ultrathin planar wall with omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption shows great potential for applications in architectural acoustics and noise control.\n\nFIGURE 7\n\nFIGURE 7. Simulated total pressure distributions created by the barrier-free anechoic room at (A) 171 Hz and (B) 519 Hz, and their corresponding reflected intensity distributions at (C) 171 Hz and (D) 519 Hz. White points represent the positions of cylindrical sound source.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusions, we have demonstrated an ultrathin planar wall with low-frequency dual-band sound absorption. The results show that the sound absorption of the wall exists in two frequency bands (I: 145\u2013203 Hz and II: 490\u2013544 Hz) based on two different mechanisms. The band I is created by the conventional resonance coupling of the two multiple-cavity resonators, but it is worth noting that the band II is realized by the mutual resonance coupling between the resonators and groove structure. The corresponding fractional bandwidth of both bands can reach about 34.1 and 10.4%, and the measured and simulated results agree well with each other. Additionally, the influences of incident angles on the sound absorption of unit cell are simulated, and the characteristics of sound absorption almost remains unchanged with different incident angles. Finally, the application of the proposed ultrathin planar wall in the design of a barrier-free anechoic room is discussed in detail. The proposed ultrathin planar wall with the characteristic of omnidirectional low-frequency dual-band sound absorption has wide prospects in noise control and architectural acoustics.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nY-WX and Y-JG contributed equally to this work.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2020YFC1512403), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12174159 and 11834008), and the Practice Innovation Training Program Projects of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 202110299082Z).\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Note\n\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

{"url": "https://windbandhistory.neocities.org/rhodeswindband_11_instrumentation", "page_content": "The symphonic band, as it exists today, is a monolithic monster, the unfortunate result of the attempt to equate the symphonic band with the symphony orchestra.\n\n\n\nRobert Milano (1963)1\n\nAs with any type of musical ensemble, the wind band has undergone periods of growth, development, and evolution. Throughout music history, there have been a variety of factors that have affected the size of ensembles, instrumentation and timbre, and literature, both original and transcribed.\n\n\n\n18th-century & modern clarinets 2\n\nThe formative years of orchestral music were naturally influenced by the formative years of the instruments that make up the modern orchestra. And, of course they all did not develop at the same time. Interesting studies of this phenomenon and how it has affected composition through the years have been explored through the scholarship of musicians such as Adam Carse and Gardner Reed. The whole concept of melding composition with instrumentation has been studied and compiled by a variety of scholars through the years. Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov wrote books that are classic studies in orchestration.\n\nFrom its inception in the Baroque opera pit to the contemporary concert stage, the string section has benefited from an earlier maturation than the woodwinds and brass. While the number of wind instruments has fluctuated from one piece to the next, the strings, with their consistent timbre and sheer enormity of numbers, provided a consistency that made them the foundation of the orchestra. By contrast, the identity of the wind band has been more divergent, being influenced by historical period, culture, and composer. This has made a generic description difficult at best. In early 17th century Germany the band might be described as an ensemble of cornettos and sackbuts which signaled the changing of the hour from the tower in the center of town. Or in 18th century England one might refer to Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks, scored for nine trumpets, nine horns, twenty-four oboes, twelve bassoons, side drums, and three kettle drums. Or consider the United States Marine Band of 1792: this group consisted of two oboes, two clarinets, bassoon, and two horns , an instrumentation based on those military bands found in England and the European continent, and similar to the decidedly non-military Harmoniemusik of Vienna.\n\nWhile the timbre of the 19th century band became more diverse, it also became more consistent, as the instruments were refined to more or less their present state. Due to the efforts of inventors and refiners such as Wilhelm Wieprecht (tuba, baritone), Johanne Stoelzel (valve), Theobald Boehm (flute), Adolph Sax (valve, saxhorn, saxophone), and Hyacinth Klose (clarinet key system), bands could enjoy all the instruments utilized today in a more or less contemporary state of development.\n\nIn America, from the middle of the nineteenth century through the Civil War, bands were predominantly brass bands, generally consisting of cornets, saxhorns, and drums. Afterward, due to the influence of legendary bandmasters such as Patrick Gilmore, the popularity of the military band rose. In 1878, the instrumentation of the 22nd Regiment Band of New York City, directed by Gilmore, included:\n\n2 piccolos\n\n2 flutes\n\n4 oboes\n\n1 A-flat clarinet\n\n3 E-flat clarinets\n\n16 B-flat clarinets\n\nalto & bass clarinets\n\n6 bassoons\n\n4 contrabassoons\n\nsoprano saxophone\n\nalto saxophone\n\ntenor saxophone\n\nbaritone saxophone\n\nbass saxophone E-flat cornet\n\n4 cornets\n\n2 trumpets\n\n2 fluegelhorns\n\n4 horns\n\n3 trombones\n\n2 alto horns\n\n2 tenor horns\n\n2 euphoniums\n\n5 double-B-flat tubas\n\nBy 1892, Sousa's first professional band (formed after his retirement from the Marine Band) consisted of:\n\n2 flutes\n\n2 oboes\n\n2 E-flat clarinets\n\n14 B-flat clarinets\n\n1 alto clarinet\n\n1 bass clarinet\n\n2 bassoons\n\n3 saxophones 4 cornets\n\n2 trumpets\n\n4 horns\n\n3 trombones\n\n2 euphoniums\n\n4 basses\n\n3 percussion\n\nThis instrumentation has a startling resemblance to contemporary practice, especially when contrasted to the instrumentation of bands performing many years later such as the 1938 University of Illinois Concert Band:\n\n10 flutes and piccolos\n\n4 oboes\n\n2 English Horns\n\n1 baritone oboe\n\n1 heckelphone*\n\n1 sarrusophone**\n\n5 bassoons\n\n1 contra-bassoon\n\n24 B-flat clarinets\n\n5 alto clarinets\n\n5 bass clarinets\n\n3 contrabass clarinets\n\n1 basset horn\n\n7 saxophones 7 cornets\n\n2 fluegelhorns\n\n1 alto fluegelhorn\n\n4 trumpets\n\n10 horns\n\n5 trombones\n\n2 bass trombones\n\n3 euphoniums\n\n2 baritones\n\n1 E-flat tuba\n\n5 double-B-flat tuba\n\n1 double-E-flat tuba\n\n2 string basses\n\n1 harp 2 marimbas\n\n5 percussion *Heckelphone: a baritone oboe pitched an octave lower than the oboe.\n\n**Sarrusophone: family of double reed instruments invented by Sarrus\n\nin 1856, and made in eight sizes from sopranino to subcontrabass.\n\nThis instrument was probably a contrabass in C.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Illinois band is approximately two and one half times the size of the Sousa Band, the timbre possibilities of the Illinois band under A. A. Harding were also more numerous and exotic. Notice the addition of a variety of double reeds, the inclusion of the basset horn and contrabass clarinets, along with the use of fluegel-horns and 3 types of tubas plus string bass. By 1956 Mark Hindsley had dropped the baritone oboe, heckelphone, basset horn, bass saxophone, fluegel-horns, and alto fluegel-horn from the instrumentation.2\n\n\n\nContrabass sarrusophone 3\n\nSince the music of the orchestra has enjoyed international acceptance, the standards of instrumentation are more or less consistent throughout the world. Band repertoire, in contrast, has not enjoyed the same stature. Although standards for instrumentation have been suggested numerous times by various authorities, no common standard has ever been totally achieved. One reason is that band music differs from one country to the next. Since much of the music does not enjoy an international reputation, instrumentation has reflected the styles and customs of individual countries, with less regard for an international market. Music from one country often has to be arranged to fit the accepted instrumentation of another country before it can be performed. This is true both in types of instruments used and in the balance between various sections within the band. The following chart suggests the wide variety of instruments available to the contemporary concert band:\n\nFlute Double\n\nReeds Clarinet Saxophone Cylindrical\n\nBrass Conical\n\nBrass Saxhorns Soprano flute\n\npiccolo oboe E-flat sop.\n\nB-flat sop. sop. tpt. cor. flglhn.

Contrabass - ctrabsn. E-flat contra\n\nB-flat contra bass bass tbn. - F,E-flat,C,double-B-flat tuba\n\nTypically, not every country has used all the wind instruments potentially available. For instance, writing in the Music Journal Annual in 1962, William Revelli explained that French and Italian bands use the complete family of saxhorns, providing a full spectrum of conical brass sound not found in British and American bands, which usually employ only the baritone and bass horns. In contrast to American bands, British bands emphasize cornets over trumpets. The bassoon is fundamental in English and German bands while American bands frequently double or supplant the bassoon with the saxophone. E-flat soprano clarinet and soprano saxophone are staples of the French and Italian bands not always accepted in American bands.3\n\n\n\nWilliam D. Revelli 4\n\nBalance between woodwinds and brass also differs from one country to the next. This is a direct reflection of past history, arrangers, publishers, composers, and individual directors. William Revelli described the balance as follows:\n\nGermany advocates one-third woodwinds; France and Italy recommend one-half woodwinds, including saxophones; English bands are approximately one-half woodwinds; America recommends two-thirds woodwinds for concert bands, with the reverse for military or gridiron and parade bands.\n\nRevelli continues:\n\nThe French and Italian bands maintain two separate and complete brass sections; hence, the woodwind sections must be augmented in order to balance the instrumentation properly. If sufficient woodwinds are not available, the brasses predominate, as they frequently do in all such instrumented groups.4\n\nThe result is that at times composers have been frustrated by the lack of standards, concerned that there would be a wide disparity in performances of their music. Today, with the growing international market for wind band literature, the disparity is not as great, though some European publishers still provide extra parts to fit the demands of divergent instrumentations.\n\nOne weakness in instrumentation has been the inherent doubling which thickens the quality of the band sound. The prevalent attitude in school bands in the past has seemed to be that everyone should play as much of the time as possible so at to not become bored. Thus many opaque sounds are destroyed by the addition of unlike voices playing the same line. All too frequently tenor sax, bass clarinet, and baritone horn played essentially the same part--or one finds that the 3rd B-flat clarinet, alto clarinet, and alto sax doubled what could have been a solo line for alto clarinet or alto saxophone. This emphasis in the middle register de-emphasizes the potential for the upper and lower registers--areas that often lack adequate personnel, such as piccolo and E-flat soprano clarinet, or bassoon and contra-alto or contrabass clarinet.\n\nOn occasion some instrument families are missing from the color spectrum, such as the frequently absent double reeds. Another problem is incomplete sections. Few bands utilize the full clarinet or saxophone section from soprano to contrabass voices, for example.\n\n\n\nGustav Holst 5\n\nSince instrumentation and bandstration are by necessity integrally meshed in the creative process, some advocate that instrumentation should be the composer's prerogative so as not to limit the creative process.5 In fact, Gustav Holst, considering the study of orchestration to be an artificial exercise, made the following comment concerning Berlioz' concept of orchestration:\n\nOrchestration? What do you mean? That's a question I cannot answer. You see, I'm not able to dissociate orchestration from the material which is being orchestrated. So Berlioz is no good to me. Once I tried to teach orchestration at the College (Royal College of Music), but I found it was impossible. The whole thing goes together, the material indicating the orchestration. If a drawing is bad, you can't show a student how to colour it.6\n\nObviously composers have to work within some pragmatic bounds, but to allow no additions or subtractions from instrumentation, or to insert certain doubling (such as resulted when Holst's Suite in E-flat arrived in America) is frustrating to a composer and potentially compromises the music's original intent.\n\nIn the United States, instrumentation was particularly inconsistent in early school bands. After the initial National School Band Contest in 1923, discussion ensued during subsequent years to address this problem so as to provide a working standard for all band programs interested in entering the contest. In 1927 the School Band Contests booklet listed the following acceptable instrumentation for a 68-piece band:\n\n2 flutes or 4 piccolos\n\n(interchangeable)\n\n2 E-flat clarinets\n\n2 oboes\n\n1 English horn\n\n24 B-flat clarinets\n\n2 alto clarinets\n\n1 bass clarinet\n\n2 alto saxophones\n\n(or 1 sop., 1 alto)\n\n1 tenor saxophone\n\n1 baritone saxophone\n\n1 bass saxophone\n\n2 bassoons 2 B-flat cornets\n\n2 B-flat trumpets\n\n2 B-flat fluegelhorns\n\n4 French horns\n\n3 trombones\n\n2 baritones\n\n2 E-flat tubas\n\n2 B-flat tubas\n\ntimpani\n\ndrums\n\nPromoting Saxophones American instrument manufacturers were ardent in their preference for bands make up of a majority of saxophones. As evidence of their tenacity, a 100-piece professional saxophone band, financed by the manufacturers, performed at the Music Educators National Convention in Chicago in 1928. Given his devotion to the saxophone, one wonders what Percy Grainger would have thought of such a performance! 1\n\nIt was the committee's intention to replace the strings of the orchestra with a full complement of clarinets. This seemed appropriate due to the wide pitch range which is accessible and the perception that clarinets could play for longer periods of time with less fatigue than some other instrument families.7\n\nThis instrumentation met opposition not only from directors, but also from school administrators, instrument manufacturers, and music publishers. Although the committee held its ground, it secured the additional services of John Philip Sousa, Frederick A. Stock, Edwin Franco Goldman, Captain Taylor Branson (U. S. Marine Band director), and Herbert L. Clarke to work out a standard instrumentation to be published in the 1928 edition of State and National School Band Contests. The result was fundamentally the same as the previous year's, with the exception of allowing a slightly larger number of players and slightly enhancing the flexibility of numbers within sections. The 1928 booklet further allowed:\n\n\n\nJay C. Easton with saxophones:\n\ncontrabass, bass, baritone, tenor, C tenor, alto,\n\nF mezzo-soprano, soprano, C soprano, sopranino 6\n\nLarge bands may double the number of saxophones. Additional instruments suggested for special effects or for additions to large bands: Harp, contra-bassoon, sarrusophone, 2 string basses, heckelphone, alto flute, E-flat trumpet, tenor horns . . . It is the desire of the Committee to encourage experimentation in instrumentation by large and well-developed bands in the hope that the above standard may be improved in the future, and for this reason no band will be penalized for \"overinstrumentation\" either as it applies to sections or additional instruments.8\n\nSchool band directors were concerned by the demand for alto and bass clarinet players, citing the inability of such players ever to find professional employment. School administrators cited the Committee as being in camp with the manufacturers by creating a market for the sale of more instruments. Instrument manufacturers felt the Committee was de-emphasizing those instruments that were the moneymakers in regard to sales - cornets and saxophones. They felt that by limiting the number of these two instruments, while supposedly promoting the use of clarinets, bassoons, oboes, low clarinets, and French horns that were primarily of European manufacture, they were put at an unfair disadvantage. Eventually, manufacturers began to make those instruments previously made only in Europe, but not without protest. They would have preferred that the new instrumentation consist of up to fifty percent saxophones, but had to settle for the clause, which only allowed their numbers to be doubled!\n\nMusic publishers were concerned that their entire catalogues would be rendered obsolete. Their argument was not unfounded. Music catalogues of the early 1920s listed the following instrumentation as standard for military band:9\n\nE-flat (D-flat) piccolo\n\nE-flat clarinet\n\n1st, 2nd, 3rd B-flat clarinet\n\nalto saxophone\n\ntenor saxophone\n\nE-flat cornet\n\nSolo, 1st, 2nd B-flat cornet\n\n1st, 2nd, 3rd alto horn\n\n1st, 2nd B-flat tenor horn\n\n1st, 2nd B-flat trombone (treble clef)\n\n1st, 2nd B-flat trombone (bass clef)\n\nbaritone (bass clef)\n\nB-flat baritone (treble)\n\nbasses (bass clef)\n\nB-flat bass (treble clef) 10\n\ndrums\n\nPublishers demanded the Committee draw up instrumentation that would fit existing publications. Meanwhile new publishers using the prescribed guidelines provided the needed literature to bide the time until the established publishers gave in to progress. Had the instrument manufacturers and more established music publishers had their way today's wind band movement might have a radically different appearance.\n\nEvery few years someone rediscovers, then publishes in a journal, the \"novel\" idea that the key to effective band instrumentation is to create a clarinet choir as substitute for the strings of the orchestra. In the United States the idea was practiced in the professional bands of the late 19th century and early 20th century (refer to Sousa's instrumentation as one example). This approach was pragmatic, since the bulk of the early repertoire came from orchestral literature. The Committee focused on this matter when considering instrumentation for the National School Band Contest.\n\n\n\nClarinet section of the Southwestern University Band, 1938 7\n\nA clarinet section as a substitute for the string section created two concerns. First, there must be a large enough number of clarinets to provide a dominant sound, and second, a full complement from at least the E-flat soprano down to the B-flat contrabass is necessary to allow for a full harmonic spectrum. Through the years noted experts in bandstration such as Alfred Reed and Lucien Calliet have advocated this method both in print and in personal practice.\n\nAt least two elements have kept this from becoming a universally pervasive practice. First, many advocates of the wind band maintain that this practice sets up the band to function as an inferior copy of the orchestra. Consequently, while desiring a full pitch complement from high to low, composers and conductors may not want the clarinets to be the dominant sound in the band. Others have argued that the E-flat soprano is hard to tune, and that the E-flat alto is an inferior instrument both in pitch and tone quality. The rationale continues that since flutes and saxophones already cover these two registers, these particular clarinets are unnecessary. As a result, the strength of the wind band is that in lieu of a single dominant color (as in the orchestra) there are several choirs within the tonal picture.\n\nThe second concern focuses on the repertoire written for orchestral winds, which is similar to a band without saxophones and euphoniums. This literature, substantial as it may be, cannot always be adapted for the concert band. This resulted in the formation of the Eastman Wind Ensemble by Frederick Fennell in 1952. Fennell created an ensemble with mostly one player to a part, and flexible instrumentation that allowed him to play both the literature of the wind band and the orchestral winds. It also gave the wind band an opaque quality in which individual timbres were not covered up by excessive doubling.\n\nEver since its inception, conductors and composers have argued the merits of the wind ensemble vs. the symphonic band. One concern is the doubling of parts. The elimination of doubling creates added clarity and precision. Also, when fewer parts are doubled, individual timbres project, in contrast to larger ensembles with a more homogeneous sound. Some pieces, such as Stravinsky's Symphonies of Wind Instruments written for wind ensemble or chamber winds, are best left alone. Lincolnshire Posey, while having been played successfully by groups of many different sizes, understandably takes on different qualities when played by a group of forty as opposed to a group of seventy or ninety. Balance becomes a factor when solo parts within the music have to play above a large ensemble. On the other hand, George Washington Bridge by William Schuman takes on striking differences when played by a large, rather than small, ensemble. The dissonance so common throughout the work takes on an edgy, almost brittle quality when played by a smaller group, while a large ensemble provides a depth of sonority establishing a quality of strength and foundation. The symphonic band also has the added advantage of greater dynamic contrast. An eighty-piece band playing a true pianissimo is a breathtaking experience. On the other hand, the wind ensemble has the jump on precision. Three trumpets playing a fast articulation, or three clarinets playing a demanding melodic sequence will play with more coordination than nine or twelve players trying to play in unison.\n\nSince there are advantages to both, ultimately the decision as to which size of ensemble is more acceptable has been largely a matter of taste. Unfortunately, a bit of snobbery has been manifested on both sides of this argument, which has not served the cause of music education. Increasingly, flexibility has become the order of the day, allowing each director to promote the composer's true intent no matter what size ensemble is used.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFinally, because a reasoned approach to instrumentation and bandstration has been increasingly adopted, the aesthetic potential for the wind band is stronger than ever. Composers have demonstrated that the power and sonority of the wind band is not an element of composition that needs to be over-emphasized to the detriment of musical taste. Compositions with continual, massive, homogeneous sounds have been increasingly replaced by works that provide variety through solo and small ensemble passages, and that promote opportunities for more imaginative color groupings, contrast in mood, and melodic development. Also, by limiting the amount of doubling, players are provided the opportunity to rest, which, in time, allows them to regain their endurance, especially in overly demanding works.\n\nThe color possibilities of the band, when compared to the orchestra, are limited only by the absence of the string section. Despite the lack of this fundamental sound of the orchestra, the wind band compensates with possibilities not regularly available to the orchestra. The orchestra generally does not use a full component of clarinets, while the saxophone family and the euphonium are seldom used. In the band, however, the general enlargement of flute, clarinet, and trumpet sections allows for harmonic possibilities within one timbre not possible in the generic orchestral instrumentation. This provides adequate power for a section not only to carry the melodic line above the rest of the ensemble, but also allows for harmonic support within the same section. With careful use of all sections it has become possible for the band to include not only a powerful sound, but also to escape the stereotype of a thick, dull homogeneous sound for one of clarity, refinement, and grace.\n\nDuring the 20th century eminent composers have written many new works for the wind band that fit these criteria. The result is a sophistication of sound both exciting and intriguing.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n1Robert Milano, \"Symphonic Band: A Monolithic Monster\", Music Journal Annual (1963), p. 32.\n\n2Harry I.

We could see a large community of Tracker\u2019s fans, which makes us very happy and proud that the scene is still attractive and inspiring for musicians. Many of you are still trying to figure out whether it is suitable for your music style. Quick answer: yes, it is. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a techno producer, jungle creator, ambient enthusiast, or guitarist.\n\nToday we\u2019re visiting Noir to find out what\u2019s new. What are his Tracker\u2019s inspirations? Noir: In this period, I am dedicating myself mainly to two things: a techno live set (the tech sketches that I am publishing on my YouTube channel) built solely on the Tracker. I\u2019m working on my new album, which could be released by the end of the year, or early 2023. Also composed solely in the Tracker and performed with Tracker & which is my standard setup these days, some examples on my YouTube Channel also).\n\nPolyend: What is the most crucial device used throughout your career? Presently? Noir: I have two crucial tools, which are Polyend Tracker and Elektron Octatrack. Usually in my standard setup, the compositional is created in the Tracker, to then be performed with the performative effects of the Tracker itself and the Octatrack, which is used as FX box, manual samples launching, and live resampling. They are two machines that work great together!\n\nPolyend: Can you reveal one sound design or music production secret to us? Noir: One of my favorite things to do with the Tracker, in terms of sound design, is to use a high pass filter, with a good resonance notch, to \u201cpump\u201d kicks and bass. It\u2019s like taking advantage of a single band eq. Another creative \u201ctrick\u201d with the Tracker is to write the parts of the track, without going into too much detail of the transitions from one section of the track to another. You can do the transitions live, using the Perform section of the Tracker, creating the necessary transitions, always different, directly live.\n\nI am a musician with a \u201ctraditional\u201d background (guitar, bass and vocals), so I NEED to be able to play these instruments. With the Tracker this is possible, and for me it is CRUCIAL.\n\nPolyend: Why do you choose Polyend devices? Noir: The choice of the Tracker came by chance. I was citing new solutions to have a portable and complete setup. After a few days of use, I practically fell in love with it. The ease with which you can get ideas out of your head is absolutely mind blowing. In no time you have the song in hands! Now I couldn\u2019t do without it anymore. The Tracker has become an integral part of MY sound.\n\nNoir prepared and published a new instruments pack for Tracker/Play. Noir: Most of the sounds on this track, come from my new instruments pack, specific for genres such as Techno (all declensions), IDM, house. This New pack for Tracker/Play contains: basses, techno rumble, drum kit (single shots and chain + bonus chain kit coming from my first pack), techno chords, up to 50 instruments in .pti format for Polyend Tracker, 1 kit for Polyend Play, and wav files. New instrument pack for Tracker/Play download\n\nWatch the demo, see how these sounds can inspire you!\n\nJust recently Noir prepared a new Polyend Tacker \u2013 \u201cThe Freak\u201d pack: more than 500 files, PTI instruments, WAV files (each patch samples 3 times over 3 octaves), project files for the Tracker, and more! Basses, leads, pads, you are all covered!

Hence, it seems more appropriate to talk about musics (plural) rather than in the singular (Goble, 2015). Furthermore, research by anthropologists as well as ethnomusicologists suggests that music has been a characteristic of the human condition for millennia (cf. Blacking, 1976; Brown, 1999; Mithen, 2005; Dissanayake, 2012; Higham et al., 2012; Cross, 2016). Nevertheless, whilst the potential for musical behavior is a characteristic of all human beings, its realization is shaped by the environment and the experiences of individuals, often within groups (North and Hargreaves, 2008; Welch and McPherson, 2018). Listening to music, singing, playing (informally, formally), creating (exploring, composing, improvising), whether individually and collectively, are common activities for the vast majority of people. Music represents an enjoyable activity in and of itself, but its influence goes beyond simple amusement.\n\nThese activities not only allow the expression of personal inner states and feelings, but also can bring about many positive effects in those who engage in them. There is an increasing body of empirical and experimental studies concerning the wider benefits of musical activity, and research in the sciences associated with music suggests that there are many dimensions of human life\u2014including physical, social, educational, psychological (cognitive and emotional)\u2014which can be affected positively by successful engagement in music (Biasutti and Concina, 2013). Learning in and through music is something that can happen formally (such as part of structured lessons in school), as well as in other-than-formal situations, such as in the home with family and friends, often non-sequentially and not necessarily intentional, and where participation in music learning is voluntary, rather than mandated, such as in a community setting (cf. Green, 2002; Folkestad, 2006; Saether, 2016; Welch and McPherson, 2018).\n\nSuch benefits are evidenced across the lifespan, including early childhood (Gerry et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2015; Linnavalli et al., 2018), adolescence (McFerran et al., 2018), and older adulthood (Lindblad and de Boise, 2020). Within these lifespan perspectives, research into music's contribution to health and well-being provides evidence of physical and psychological impacts (MacDonald et al., 2013; Fancourt and Finn, 2019; van den Elzen et al., 2019). Benefits are also reported in terms of young people's educational outcomes (Guhn et al., 2019), and successful musical activity can enhance an individual's sense of social inclusion (Welch et al., 2014) and social cohesion (Elvers et al., 2017).\n\nThis special issue provides a collection of 21, new research articles that deepen and develop our understanding of the ways and means that music can impact positively on human development and well-being. The collection draws on the work of 88 researchers from 17 different countries across the world, with each article offering an illustration of how music can relate to other important aspects of human functioning. In addition, the articles collectively illustrate a wide range of contemporary research approaches. These provide evidence of how different research aims concerning the wider benefits of music require sensitive and appropriate methodologies.\n\nIn terms of childhood and adolescence, for example, Putkinen et al. demonstrate how musical training is likely to foster enhanced sound encoding in 9 to 15-year-olds and thus be related to reading skills. A separate Finnish study by Saarikallio et al. provides evidence of how musical listening influences adolescents' perceived sense of agency and emotional well-being, whilst demonstrating how this impact is particularly nuanced by context and individuality. Aspects of mental health are the focus for an Australian study by Stewart et al. of young people with tendencies to depression. The article explores how, despite existing literature on the positive use of music for mood regulation, music listening can be double-edged and could actually sustain or intensify a negative mood.\n\nA Portuguese study by Martins et al. shifts the center of attention from mental to physical benefits in their study of how learning music can support children's coordination. They provide empirical data on how a sustained, 24-week programme of Orff-based music education, which included the playing of simple tuned percussion instruments, significantly enhanced the manual dexterity and bimanual coordination in participant 8-year-olds compared to their active control (sports) and passive control peers. A related study by Loui et al. in the USA offers insights into the neurological impact of sustained musical instrument practice. Eight-year-old children who play one or more musical instruments for at least 0.5 h per week had higher scores on verbal ability and intellectual ability, and these correlated with greater measurable connections between particular regions of the brain related to both auditory-motor and bi-hemispheric connectivity.\n\nYounger, pre-school children can also benefit from musical activities, with associations being reported between informal musical experiences in the home and specific aspects of language development. A UK-led study by Politimou et al. found that rhythm perception and production were the best predictors of young children's phonological awareness, whilst melody perception was the best predictor of grammar acquisition, a novel association not previously observed in developmental research. In another pre-school study, Barrett et al. explored the beliefs and values held by Australian early childhood and care practitioners concerning the value of music in young children's learning. Despite having limited formal qualifications and experience of personal music learning, practitioners tended overall to have positive attitudes to music, although this was biased toward music as a recreational and fun activity, with limited support for the notion of how music might be used to support wider aspects of children's learning and development.\n\nEngaging in music to support a positive sense of personal agency is an integral feature of several articles in the collection. In addition to the Saarikallio team's research mentioned above, Moors et al. provide a novel example of how engaging in collective beatboxing can be life-enhancing for throat cancer patients in the UK who have undergone laryngectomy, both in terms of supporting their voice rehabilitation and alaryngeal phonation, as well as patients' sense of social inclusion and emotional well-being.\n\nOne potential reason for these positive findings is examined in an Australian study by Krause et al.. They apply the lens of self-determination theory to examine musical participation and well-being in a large group of 17 to 85-year-olds. Respondents to an online questionnaire signaled the importance of active music making in their lives in meeting three basic psychological needs embracing a sense of competency, relatedness and autonomy.\n\nThe use of public performance in music therapy is the subject of a US study by Vaudreuil et al. concerning the social transformation and reintegration of US military service members. Two example case studies are reported of service members who received music therapy as part of their treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other psychological health concerns. The participants wrote, learned, and refined songs over multiple music therapy sessions and created song introductions to share with audiences. Subsequent interviews provide positive evidence of the beneficial psychological effects of this programme of audience-focused musical activity.\n\nRelatedly, McFerran et al. in Australia examined the ways in which music and trauma have been reported in selected music therapy literature from the past 10 years. The team's critical interpretive synthesis of 36 related articles led them to identify four different ways in which music has been used beneficially to support those who have experienced trauma. These approaches embrace the use of music for stabilizing (the modulation of physiological processes) and entrainment (the synchronization of music and movement), as well as for expressive and performative purposes\u2014the fostering of emotional and social well-being.\n\nThe therapeutic potential of music is also explored in a detailed case study by Fachner et al.. Their research focuses on the nature of critical moments in a guided imagery and music session between a music therapist and a client, and evidences how these moments relate to underlying neurological function in the mechanics of music therapy.\n\nAt the other end of the age span, and also related to therapy, an Australian study by Brancatisano et al. reports on a new Music, Mind, and Movement programme for people in their eighties with mild to moderate dementia. Participants involved in the programme tended to show an improvement in aspects of cognition, particularly verbal fluency and attention. Similarly, Wilson and MacDonald report on a 10-week group music programme for young Scottish adults with learning difficulties. The research data suggest that participants enjoyed the programme and tended to sustain participation, with benefits evidenced in increased social engagement, interaction and communication.\n\nThe role of technology in facilitating access to music and supporting a sense of agency in older people is the focus for a major literature review by Creech, now based in Canada. Although this is a relatively under-researched field, the available evidence suggests that that older people, even those with complex needs, are capable of engaging with and using technology in a variety of ways that support their musical perception, learning and participation and wider quality of life.\n\nRelated to the particular needs of the young, children's general behavior can also improve through music, as exampled in an innovative, school-based, intensive 3-month orchestral programme in Italy with 8 to 10-year-olds. Fasano et al. report that the programme was particularly beneficial in reducing hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity, whilst enhancing inhibitory control. These benefits are in line with research findings concerning successful music education with specific cases of young people with ADHD whose behavior is characterized by these same disruptive symptoms (hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity).\n\nExtra-musical benefits are also reported in a study of college students (Bachelors and Masters) and amateur musicians in a joint Swiss-UK study. Antonini Philippe et al. suggest that, whilst music making can offer some health protective effects, there is a need for greater health awareness and promotion among advanced music students. Compared to the amateur musicians, the college music students evaluated their overall quality of life and general and physical health more negatively, as did females in terms of their psychological health. Somewhat paradoxically, the college students who had taken part in judged performances reported higher psychological health ratings. This may have been because this sub-group were slightly older and more experienced musicians.\n\nMusic appears to be a common accompaniment to exercise, whether in the gym, park or street. Nikol et al. in South East Asia explore the potential physical benefits of synchronous exercise to music, especially in hot and humid conditions. Their randomized cross-over study (2019) reports that \u201ctime-to-exhaustion\u201d under the synchronous music condition was 2/3 longer compared to the no-music condition for the same participants. In addition, perceived exertion was significantly lower, by an average of 22% during the synchronous condition.\n\nComparisons between music and sport are often evidenced in the body of existing Frontiers research literature related to performance and group behaviors. Our new collection contains a contribution to this literature in a study by Habe et al.. The authors investigated elite musicians and top athletes in Slovenia in terms of their perceptions of flow in performance and satisfaction with life. The questionnaire data analyses suggest that the experience of flow appears to influence satisfaction with life in these high-functioning individuals, albeit with some variations related to discipline, participant sex and whether considering team or individual performance.\n\nA more formal link between music and movement is the focus of an exploratory case study by Cirelli and Trehub. They investigated a 19-month-old infant's dance-like, motorically-complex responses to familiar and unfamiliar songs, presented at different speeds. Movements were faster for the more familiar items at their original tempo. The child had been observed previously as moving to music at the age of 6 months.\n\nFinally, a novel UK-based study by Waddington-Jones et al. evaluated the impact of two professional composers who were tasked, individually, to lead a 4-month programme of group composing in two separate and diverse community settings\u2014one with a choral group and the other in a residential home, both funded as part of a music programme for the Hull City of Culture in 2017. In addition to the two composers, the participants were older adults, with the residential group being joined by schoolchildren from a local Primary school to collaborate in a final performance. Qualitative data analyses provide evidence of multi-dimensional psychological benefits arising from the successful, group-focused music-making activities.\n\nIn summary, these studies demonstrate that engaging in musical activity can have a positive impact on health and well-being in a variety of ways and in a diverse range of contexts across the lifespan. Musical activities, whether focused on listening, being creative or re-creative, individual or collective, are infused with the potential to be therapeutic, developmental, enriching, and educational, with the caveat provided that such musical experiences are perceived to be engaging, meaningful and successful by those who participate.\n\nCollectively, these studies also celebrate the multiplicity of ways in which music can be experienced. Reading across the articles might raise a question as to whether or not any particular type of musical experience is seen to be more beneficial compared with another. The answer, at least in part, is that the empirical evidence suggests that musical engagement comes in myriad forms along a continuum of more or less overt activity, embracing learning, performing, composing and improvising, as well as listening and appreciating. Furthermore, given the multidimensional neurological processing of musical experience, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that it is perhaps the level of emotional engagement in the activity that drives its degree of health and well-being efficacy as much as the activity's overt musical features. And therein are opportunities for further research!\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nThe editorial was drafted by GW and approved by the topic Co-editors.
