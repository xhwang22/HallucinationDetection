{"Emily Gielnik started her career in the Brisbane Roar youth system.": [{"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-i-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "If there was ever a moment that encapsulates the evolution of Emily Gielnik, it was a superb strike against Korea Republic in the 2019 Cup of Nations.\n\nDeep in the match, the 26 year old drifted in from the left wing, sized up the full back, cut inside and rifled a strike at the near post.\n\nIt was a strike of a player full of confidence and at the height of her powers.\n\nGielnik has become a hot topic of conversation for women\u2019s football fans of late, with her newly-commanding presence on the pitch leaving those new to the game wondering where this prolific forward came from.\n\nHer story is one of resilience, grit and determination. One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/player-profile-emily-gielniks-lifelong-olympic-dream", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik has been to a FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and an AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and can now finally add the Olympics to her resume.\n\nHer career is defined by perseverance and grit. Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut. Instead, she travelled as an alternate player.\n\nAt the time, Gielnik said her omission left her genuinely heartbroken and described it as the biggest emotional toll football had ever taken on her.\n\nFollowing on from being so close to selection, Gielnik moved to Norway before linking back up with Jeff Hopkins, this time at Melbourne Victory in the W-League.\n\nA \u2018feel good, play well\u2019 kind of player, Gielnik returned to the national team fold and began to cement herself in the team, adding more goals to her tally.\n\nShe was selected to go to Jordan in 2018 for the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and to France in 2019 where she played in three of Australia\u2019s four matches.\n\nA move to German giants Bayern Munich saw her learn plenty about herself but she returned to Scandinavia and the W-League once again.\n\n\n\nA scintillating 2020-21 season with Brisbane Roar saw Gielnik take home the golden boot before she signed for Vittsj\u00f6 in Sweden. With 10 goals in 42 games for her country, the determined and dedicated Gielnik is inching ever close to half a century of caps.\n\nA strong presence with the ability to play on the wing and more centrally, Gielnik is an invaluable asset to the Matildas in Tokyo."}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2018/04/05/gielnik-quest-golden-boot/", "page_content": "The Matildas touched down in Jordan last week, with the squad hitting their straps with the aim of adding a second AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup to their trophy cabinet.\n\nFootball Queensland journalist Chloe Walker spoke with Matildas and Brisbane Roar striker Emily Gielnik about her road to Jordan.\n\nThe shoe fits! Like Cinderella it was a race against the clock for Australian football player Emily Gielnik, but she has managed to escape the confines of her moonboot, trading Velcro straps for leather lace-ups just in time to make the Matildas squad for the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan. Moments before boarding her plane to Portugal for the 2018 Algarve Cup in early March, Gielnik received news that the excruciating pain in her ankle was a result of bone stress. She says it was a blessing in disguise as any further strain would have caused a fracture, sidelining the Matildas forward for 3-6 months. With a grueling strength and conditioning program combined with some TLC, Gielnik has beaten the odds and found her happily ever after in the Australian squad.\n\nGielnik says her most recent injury is the result of a prior ankle fracture following one of the biggest performances that sparked her professional career in 2012. Gielnik made her debut for the Young Matildas in the FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Vietnam scoring a hat-trick and changing the game for the green and gold, from three goals down to a 4-3 win. She says however, an evolution in her career has occurred more recently, coincidently in last year\u2019s Algarve Cup, scoring three goals during the tournament against big name teams including China and The Netherlands.\n\n\u201cIt was a turning point for me not just scoring the goals but having a good tournament and the realisation that I wanted to do it (football) full-time and take it more seriously,\u201d Gielnik says.\n\nGielnik, 25, was a late bloomer to the sport at age 12 when she began playing for Redlands United, already setting her sights high towards Brisbane Roar and Young Matildas. She says her pathway into the sport was quite different to others as it happened during a school trip to the Australian Institute of Sport where the Matildas were holding a training session.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my sports teacher who asked the coach at the time, Tom Sermanni, if I could have a session with them,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cHe (Sermanni) asked me to come back the next day and I played a game with them. Straight away he made the call to get me into the QAS (Queensland Academy of Sport) with Jeff Hopkins who was the head coach at the time.\u201d\n\nGielnik\u2019s professional football career began with the Brisbane Roar in 2009 where she later was dubbed the super-sub coming off the bench time and time again to score 12 goals in 2011-12 season.\n\n\u201cI got second highest goal scorer for that year and I only played 5-10 minutes every game,\u201d She says.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure to keep going on and scoring but it actually just kept happening.\u201d\n\nHaving recently finished her eighth season loyal to her club, Gielnik is eager to go all the way with Brisbane Roar after they were knocked out in a devastating loss in Westfield W-League semi-final despite finishing minor premiers.\n\n\u201cSo we didn\u2019t win and that\u2019s just football; in the most important games any team can win on any given day and unfortunately it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gielnik\u2019s season never ends with W-League. Throughout her career she has ventured to international clubs including Liverpool, Ottawa Fury in Canada, Urawa Red Diamonds in Japan and Avaldsnes IL in Norway. She says although the style of play differs from place to place, the W-league provides a high standard of football.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are far behind and sometimes I think we are a little bit ahead. Now we are starting to attract international big names as well as those in the American league coming over to play W-League.\u201d\n\nDespite the W-League producing strong competition Gielnik says women\u2019s football has a lot of catching up to do in the male oriented sport but it is growing every year. She says Brisbane Roar is already contributing to that growth by including the young Roar girls under-17s team to compete in the NPL Queensland Women\u2019s competition.\n\n\u201cI think it is a foot in the door for the girls to be exposed.\u201d\n\nShe says the biggest issue is the lack of opportunities for exposure and is why Brisbane Roar are trying to provide a platform for youth girls teams as young as 13-14.\n\n\u201cI think it needs a bit of work (the football pathway) but its heading in the right direction, so it\u2019s a positive.\u201d\n\nShe says her biggest advice to young up and comers is to be doing extra work outside of training.\n\n\u201cThose willing to work a bit hard will be rewarded in the end.\u201d\n\nOn top of her already busy schedule Gielnik also holds private coaching for girls that she believes are quite talented, this is on top of owning her own strength and condition gym ShedEm, teaching 16 classes a week.\n\nBeing selected to play for the green and gold in the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup has crossed one goal off Gielnik\u2019s list and if all goes well she is eager to compete in 2018 Tournament of Nations in the US after Matildas won the major competition last year putting them on the map.\n\nThe Matildas kick-off their Asian Cup campaign in Jordan on Sunday, April 8.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup group stage fixtures\n\nAustralia | v | Korea Republic\n\nApril 8 | King Abdullah Stadium II, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sports\n\nVietnam | v | Australia\n\nApril 11 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan\n\nKick-off: 3.00am (EST) Fox Sport\n\nJapan | v | Australia\n\nApril 13 | Amman International Stadium, Amman, Jordan.\n\nKick-off: 11:45pm (EST) on Fox Sports\n\n2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup groups\n\nGroup A: Jordan (Current FIFA world ranking: 50), China PR (13), Thailand (29), Philippines (70)\n\nGroup B: Japan (8), Australia (6), Korea Republic (15), Vietnam (31)\n\nMatildas squad:\n\nLydia Williams (GK), Caitlin Cooper, Aivi Luik, Clare Polkinghorne, Laura Alleway, Chloe Logarzo, Steph Catley, Elise Kellond-Knight, Alex Chidiac, Emily van Egmond, Lisa de Vanna, Casey Dumont (GK, Tameka Butt, Alanna Kennedy, Emily Gielnik, Hayley Raso, Kyah Simon, Mackenzie Arnold (GK), Katrina Gorry, Sam Kerr, Ellie Carpenter, Larissa Crummer, Michelle Heyman."}, {"url": "https://beyond90.com.au/part-ii-the-making-of-emily-gielnik/", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik\u2019s road to the national team from a 14 year old in the stands to a 20 year old Matildas debutante was the prologue.\n\nThe main feature would begin once she reached her dream. It also meant that reality would hit quickly and often as she moved in and out of the national team program.\n\n\u201cMy first couple of years in the Matildas, I had some big ups and some really big downs,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI was just very inconsistent. I lost that sense of self-belief and I questioned whether or not I belonged in the team anymore.\u201d\n\nLike many women\u2019s footballers in the Australian system, Gielnik was juggling working and football. Unlike many others, Gielnik had decided go out on her own by creating a small fitness business, Shred Em fitness.\n\nStarted in her garage, it quickly grew to become a thriving business that kept the young entrepreneur occupied.\n\nHowever, the success off the field began to impact Gielnik\u2019s success on it.\n\n\u201cAt one stage, Staj (Alen Stajcic) left me out of a tournament against China, which was actually the best thing for me. He had every right to do that because I didn\u2019t believe I was worthy of being there,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t training or performing the way I should\u2019ve been and representing your country is a performance-based privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt served as a good chance for me to consider if and how I could come back from that. I was in and out of the squad for a couple of years and was juggling my personal training business, Shred Em, and was just not choosing football, so I had to make a tough decision.\u201d\n\nGielnik made the call and put her business aspirations on hold to fully commit to football.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be at the top level you need to make those changes and really live at the top level, there is no 50/50 you are either all in or all out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo in the end I gave up Shred Em, which I loved, but once I fully committed and just indulged myself into living and breathing the game, that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BreDwIXB7bS/\n\nRe-finding focus\n\nDespite her re-commitment to the football, Gielnik found her form just a little too late ahead of the 2015 World Cup.\n\nWhile there were big changes occurring for the 24 year old off the pitch, there were more subtle but no less career altering changes occurring on the pitch.\n\nAt six feet, Emily Gielnik cuts a commanding figure on the football pitch. As a striker, there is the inclination to play her in the traditional centre forward role to utilise her height and strength.\n\nThat number 9 role was basis of her early success and selection in the Matildas. The problem with pigeon holing the forward into that traditional mindset is that it didn\u2019t utilise all of Gielnik\u2019s attributes.\n\nAs well as her height, Gielnik has always possessed deceptive pace. Running Shred Em Fitness and practicing what she was preaching saw her increase her aerobic capacity and become a more honed athlete. Along with her fitness work, she was also refining her football skills and touch and developing her final ball.\n\nSpeed, stamina, dribbling, crossing and goal scoring; Emily Gielnik was no longer a centre forward, she was a now built to be a winger. And out wide she went.\n\nA familiar theme\n\nBy the time 2016 Rio Olympic Games qualification came around in February 2016, the 24-year-old was back to feeling like she belonged.\n\n\u201cI really got back into it after the World Cup, I was playing good football. I was happy and Alen brought me back into the squad.\u201d\n\nThe Matildas had a barnstorming run to qualify for Rio. They finished the qualifiers undefeated, on top of the standings and, for the first time, the number one ranked team in Asia.\n\nRight in the thick of the action was Emily Gielnik, in her new role out wide.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Olympic qualifiers and did really well, it was the first time I\u2019d felt good in a long time. My coach was positive and I was in the best physical condition I\u2019d ever been in.\u201d\n\nWhat followed next was six months of intense preparation for the chance at realising another lifetime dream \u2013 becoming an Olympian.\n\nScoring goals, playing her best football, with her confidence at an all-time high and her body in peak condition, Gielnik wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.\n\n\u201cI had that dreaded meeting where I was told I was the first player on standby for the Rio Olympics and had missed out by one spot,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t just a tournament I was missing out on, the Olympics are so special and so prestigious, every kid dreams of being an Olympian one day, so to miss out was completely devastating.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest emotional toll football has ever taken on me. I was genuinely heartbroken.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, again\n\nAfter all the sporting adversity, the blow of missing out on the Olympic Games could have been the final straw for Gielnik.\n\nWhen asked if she considered throwing in the towel she said, \u201cNot for a second.\u201d In fact, it spurred the Queenslander on once again.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I chose to never feel that again. I wanted to be in a position where, \u2018No, you\u2019re not coming,\u2019 wasn\u2019t an option anymore.\u201d\n\nThe tenacious forward carried on with this mindset and into the 2017 Algarve Cup.\n\nThe tournament proved to be another breakthrough moment where she reminded naysayers why she deserved to be in the squad.\n\nScoring three goals during the Matildas campaign, the 2017 Algarve Cup was a tournament where Gielnik used everything in her arsenal to demonstrate why she is an imposing figure for full backs to contend with.\n\nWhile an ankle injury ruled Gielnik out of the 2018 Algarve Cup, by the time the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup around, the winger was ready for her first major senior international tournament.\n\nGielnik played in three of Australia\u2019s matches helping the Matildas qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nVictorious mentality\n\nThe months following the 2018 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup have been Emily Gielnik\u2019s best yet.\n\nFootball was again the focus when the 26 year old moved her life from Brisbane to Melbourne to play for the Melbourne Victory.\n\nIt also saw a reunion with Jeff Hopkins, her first senior coach at Brisbane Roar. The result was a stellar season with her four goals and two assists helping her new side transform from two-time wooden spoon winners, to 2018/19 W-League Premiers.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that although her athletic abilities are considerable, Emily Gielnik\u2019s path to a Matildas regular is really a story about mindset.\n\nAs every inspirational sports instagram quote will tell you, sport is about mentality.\n\nWhen asked where her upbeat outlook and mental toughness comes from, Gielnik says it was something she needed to learn.\n\n\u201cI was always my harshest critic and put so much pressure and expectation on myself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to learn to take a step back and just enjoy the game without worrying what others think about me or how I should play.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shift came when I just got back to doing what\u2019s natural and playing my own game.\n\n\u201cWhen I got back to the old me, I realised how happy that made me both within and outside of football,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Gielnik's brilliant Matildas form 13 November \u26bd\ufe0f. 28 February \u26bd\ufe0f. 3 March \u26bd\ufe0f. Emily Gielnik has three goals in her last three appearances for the Westfield Matildas! Posted by Westfield Matildas on Sunday, 3 March 2019\n\nAnd her mindset extends to beyond just herself, also wanting the best for her team as a whole.\n\n\u201cI think I am just a positive person, towards myself and towards other players. Even if someone plays over me, I genuinely want them to do well, I want that player to feel so good and I want us to win together.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love scoring goals, I love setting others up, so they get the glory.\u201d\n\nThe next time Emily Gielnik pulls on the green and gold jersey, there will be an inscription on the inside that reads \u2018Never Say Die.\u2019 It is fitting for the poster girl for perseverance.\n\nIf Gielnik\u2019s evolution is any indication, her greatest feats are yet to come."}, {"url": "https://footballqueensland.com.au/2019/05/28/emily-gielniks-journey-from-queensland-to-her-first-world-cup/", "page_content": "In football there are stories of disappointment but there are also the ones of triumph and dedication, where players fight tooth and nail to get their chance. Westfield Matildas forward Emily Gielnik is one of those stories.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the age of 12 that Gielnik started playing football, after injuries in basketball convinced her parents to encourage her to give a different round ball game a go.\n\nPlaying most of her junior football with Redlands United FC, Gielnik worked under the guidance of current Junior Matildas coach Rae Dower, who was Technical Director at the Cleveland-based club at the time.\n\n\u201cRae coming up was good for my development; she more or less gave me the confidence to be free as a player, take players on and score goals,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what made me become more of a goal scorer so most definitely she had impact when I was younger and obviously as I got older and matured as a player there are a lot of other coaches and people.\u201d\n\nIn her first season of playing, the Melbourne-born attacker made the Queensland squad for the National Championships at Coffs Harbour however, at the age of 15 with teammates and friends making the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team, Gielnik didn\u2019t receive a letter.\n\nIt was a disappointing moment for the teenager.\n\nHowever, opportunities pop up in the strangest of ways and it was while on a school trip to Canberra when she visited the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), that an unbelievable chance came about.\n\nThe Matildas were training at the AIS with then Head Coach Tom Sermanni when Gielnik\u2019s sports teacher asked him if she could join the training session.\n\n\u201cI must have trained out of my skin even though I was so intimidated because it was all the best players in Australia, and all the really old-school Matildas were there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom Sermanni asked me to come back the next day and I played a training match with the Matildas.\u201d\n\nImpressed with Gielnik, Sermanni called Jeff Hopkins who was heading up the women\u2019s football program at QAS and recommended he get her into the program.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how my journey kicked off,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nShe played a whole season with the QAS before earning a contract the following year with Brisbane Roar, however an injury would keep her sidelined for the whole 2009 Westfield W-League season.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the following season at 18 that she made her debut.\n\nGielnik had to work incredibly hard to get her Westfield W-League opportunity and even in her first two seasons with the club she wouldn\u2019t see much game time with 15 of her 19 appearances coming from the bench.\n\nHowever, after a successful 2011-12 season with Roar, where she was dubbed the \u2018super sub\u2019 for her ability to score goals as a substitute, Gielnik earnt a call up to the Westfield Matildas.\n\nIt was a tough squad to break into at the time, particularly being a striker, with the likes of Sam Kerr, Lisa De Vanna and Kyah Simon just some of the players who had cemented spots in the national team.\n\nAfter making several appearances, Gielnik spent a couple of years away from the national team but fought her way back into Westfield Matildas fold for the 2016 Olympic qualification campaign.\n\nHowever, there was heartbreak when she just missed out on going to the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to be out of the squad but once you are it makes you realise how hungry you are to get back in,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlways one to work hard, she continued to keep pushing and made the decision to leave Roar for Melbourne Victory ahead of the 2018-19 Westfield W-League season to reach new heights as a player.\n\nAll her hard work paid off when Gielnik got the phone call that she was selected in the Westfield Matildas FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup squad for the France tournament this year.\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the 27-year-old, who cried after hearing the news.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really put a word on it to be honest,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a sense of relief and satisfaction in a way with the build-up and how everything has come together.\n\n\u201cI know I spoke about it in W-League and how desperate I was to make this one so it was more the relief of what I had done had been recognised and I\u2019ve been rewarded for it.\u201d\n\nGielnik puts her recent selection for the national team down to perseverance and dedication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just persistence and I think that\u2019s the key for me, the earlier I learnt that it takes more than training with the teams and that it takes dedication then that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be rewarded,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Westfield Matildas are currently in Antalya, Turkey for a 10-day camp as they prepare for their opening game of the

W-League seasons, Brisbane Roar striker Emily Gielnik has gradually transitioned from \"super sub\" to regular starter and goalscorer.\n\nHowever for the 22 year old, Season 6 was not the easiest with injury curtailing her game time and impact on the Roar's run to a fifth grand final.\n\nA good pre-season, and off the pitch activities, have seen the striker return to some of her best form and, with her three goals this season, Gielnik has been one of the leading lights in the Roar forward line.\n\nDani Brady caught up with Emily Gielnik ahead of this Sunday's Grand Final re-match with defending champions Melbourne Victory.\n\n1. You sustained quite a heavy knock to the knee during the Western Sydney match. Can you describe what happened and how your knee is shaping up for Round 6?\n\nI'm not 100% sure but the ball was sent high into the box from a free Western Sydney kick. I had my eyes on the ball for a header and I believe that the GK jumped up to grab the ball and that's when her knee collided with my leg!\n\nEssentially it was a really bad cork and was extremely painful. I've had to rest it initially but will hopefully train fully on Saturday and be fit enough to be available for selection.\n\n2. Obviously the result against Western Sydney was not what the team wanted. What do you think the Roar could have done differently to have won the game?\n\nI think we could have worked together more as a unit. We didn't expose their weaknesses enough and allowed expectations to overwhelm us.\n\n3. Brisbane are currently in the uncharacteristic position of sitting in the bottom 4. What is the mood and feeling around the team right now?\n\nGielnik with her Shred'Em Fitness clients (supplied)\n\nObviously we're all disappointed after the string of losses but we're not dwelling on the disappointment.\n\nThe friendships and the bonds are definitely still there, so it's just about supporting each other and working towards the same goals.\n\nNow we're focused on our performances and are taking it one game at a time. We can absolutely turn this around!\n\nWe've been together for so long now that I sometimes think that we take each other for granted and we allow outside pressures to weigh in.\n\nWhen we stay relaxed, focused and enjoy our football, that's when we get results!\n\n4. The victory that you had recently against the Newcastle Jets demonstrated the potential of the Roar. What positives do you take out of that game and look to apply going forward?\n\nWe had a great warm up and were switched on, yet relaxed at the same time.\n\nWe just took to the park with a bag of confidence, minus the usual pressure and enjoyed our playing together. We were in sync and pressed as a team and our plays were unselfish. It was just a great game.\n\n5. After playing teams who have struggled in past seasons, such as Newcastle and Western Sydney; would you agree that the standard of play is lifting in the W-League?\n\nAbsolutely! There was quite a few players changing clubs pre-season so teams are definitely getting stronger. Everyone is doing their homework too so preparation verse your opposition is key. Every team in the league deserves respect.\n\n6. You spent your off season coaching Women's Premier League side Redlands United and also as Strength & Conditioning coach for the men's team.\n\nDo you believe your involvement with the grassroots club is a good endorsement for the W-League and would you recommend other players to consider coaching in their off seasons?\n\nI played at Redlands United (Brisbane East) and from there I was given an opportunity to train one session with the Matildas.\n\nRight place, right time! I was 16 and was so scared and overawed by the national players.\n\nI must have done alright because it was after that session, Tom (Sermanni) called Jeff (Hopkins) and recommended I be considered for the Queensland Academy of Sport. So I'm a bit of a local success at Redlands and I like to give back to the club.\n\n\"It's been a great experience coaching grassroots because they are the 'up and coming' of the next generation of elite footballers.\"\n\n7. You're also a very successful business owner of a thriving personal training business/fitness gym. \"ShredEm Fitness\" has kept you busy for the last 2 years. What is it about your job that complements your footballing career?\n\nFirstly, it keeps me very fit and body aware but mostly, it's the values of how I run my business that reflect my own ethics towards football.\n\nMy clients inspire me every day with their continual hard work and self-belief. I see big changes in their bodies and their minds.\n\nI purposely undercharge, because for me I want everyone to be able to afford to come & exercise, and love the benefits. I specialise in giving that extra attention and care to the individual!\n\nIt's not about the money for me. In women's football it's the same; it has never been about the money or lack of!\n\n\"I really want to help people make a big difference in their lives and that is when I experience success.\"\n\n8. Do you have any Game Day rituals?\n\nYes! I eat chocolate Marvellous Creations seems to help me score goals (haha).\n\nBrooke Spence (L) and Emily Gielnik (supplied) Brooke Spence (L) and Emily Gielnik (supplied)\n\n9. Who is your favourite team mate and why?\n\nSpencey (Brooke Spence)! She's just always so positive, always works so hard and is a great motivator for me.\n\nShe's just so down to earth, and always cares for others before herself. Great role model!\n\n10. If you could write a little note to all your team mates for this weekend's game against Melbourne Victory, what would it say?\n\nKnow your ability and work for every single player out there because that will mean everyone else is also working for you - and then the result will come.\n\nThanks Em..

Born in Melbourne, Gielnik grew up in Queensland playing a different kind of round ball sport: basketball. Injuries saw her eventually pick up football at age 12.\n\nShe played her junior football at Redlands United. Current Junior Matildas coach and Football Australia Women\u2019s Technical Advisor Rae Dower was the Technical Director at the club when Gielnik was there.\n\nDespite making the Queensland squad for the National Championships, Gielnik didn\u2019t make it into the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) team.\n\nShe would end up in the QAS team eventually, thanks to a school trip to Canberra where she took part in a Matildas training session at the AIS under then-coach Tom Sermanni.\n\n\n\nSermanni suggested Gielnik to the QAS coach at the time, Jeff Hopkins, who would go on to work with Gielnik in the W-League at Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.\n\nGielnik\u2019s domestic career mirrored that of her national team one. A strong season in orange saw her earn the \u2018super sub\u2019 tag where she helped the Roar make a grand final. Later in 2012, she made her senior national team debut against Japan at the age of 20.\n\nBut after breaking into the national team, she spent some time away from the W-League and the Matildas.\n\nShe explored passions outside football and opened a gym, working on her own fitness and helping others. Fitness is still something that interests her as she is currently undertaking a Bachelor of Exercise Science alongside club and country teammate Clare Polkinghorne.\n\nGielnik worked hard to get back onto the national team radar. While she didn\u2019t make the squad for the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Canada, she was a part of the team which qualified for the Rio Olympics the following year.\n\n\n\nThe forward scored her first national team goal in that tournament in a 9-0 win over Vietnam.\n\nHowever, with plenty of talent and a small squad, Gielnik didn\u2019t make the final cut.

If I could\u2019ve, I would\u2019ve stayed at Brisbane for the rest of my life, the rest of my football career.\n\n\u201cBut I really think that looking at the bigger picture in terms of the World Cup, this was a really critical move for me and \u2026 when I made the decision, it wasn\u2019t overnight it was weeks and weeks and it was an emotional one.\n\n\u201cSo it was a really calculated decision and I think so far for me, it\u2019s proven to be a good one.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik and Laura Alleway celebrate (Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images\n\nSix weeks into the W-League season, Gielnik is reaping the rewards of her bold move.\n\nVictory is sitting pretty, undefeated and outright top of the table, with the winger nominated for the PFA\u2019s recent W-League player of the month award.\n\nIn her five appearances for Victory, Gielnik has scored one goal, assisted one, made 10 key passes, created 11 chances and provided 23 crosses.\n\nShe\u2019s also combined beautifully with captain Natasha Dowie and star playmaker Christine Nairn, with the trio comprising one of the W-League\u2019s most intimidating attacks.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at it in the perspective of a couple of weeks, it feels really good, obviously because of where we are as a team and everything,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cAnd me personally, I\u2019ve already felt a lot of improvement. Most importantly, it\u2019s just in my happiness and my mentality more than anything and I\u2019ve got a really good support network in terms of leaving home as well.\n\n\u201cAnd obviously the staff here is great and obviously Jeff has the best intentions for me, so they\u2019re really going above and beyond to try and cater for everything that I need football-wise.

So that was a big thing for me.\n\n\u201cPurely because football is not forever and that dream job is something I can always come back to, no matter the age. So I really just want to \u2014 after years and years of sacrifice to football, I thought this was really the ultimate thing to do just to give it everything that I\u2019ve got and enjoy every single challenge and experience because I\u2019m obviously lucky enough to have the opportunity to be a contracted Matilda at the moment.\n\n\u201cSo I weighed up some options and it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t take it (football) seriously before, it\u2019s just more that I\u2019ve really made it a massive part of my life, which it has been for a long time.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think I\u2019ve been a lot happier and a lot more focused and I\u2019ve really dedicated a lot of my time to it off the field as well now, more from a mental aspect and keeping myself in good condition and in other parts of fitness to make sure that I\u2019m physically good on the park.\u201d\n\nEmily Gielnik.

One of being knocked down and finding your steel.\n\nMaking choices\n\nIt was not a forgone conclusion that Gielnik would end up in football. Like many Matildas, Gielnik was a naturally gifted athlete from a young age with a penchant towards competing with the best.\n\nA basketballer to begin with, it was a serendipitous intervention from her mother that led to her finding a ball at her feet.\n\n\u201cI was one of those kids who could play any sport, I was very competitive and would play basketball and rugby against the boys,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\n\u201cMum would stress about me getting injured, so as a compromise, I convinced her to let me play football instead and that\u2019s where my journey started.\u201d\n\nGielnik realised early on that she had a knack for scoring goals \u2013 it would be a theme of her career.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was never about the discipline or the skill of football, I just played for fun and would score from anywhere and everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually scored 62 goals the first school season I played and most of them were toe punts because I\u2019d never had a coach to teach me that technique back then.\u201d\n\nOnce she received the proper coaching her transition to the beautiful game was seamless. Soon the Queenslander would be impressing those around her, resulting in her selection for U12s State Team.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started playing in a proper team, I had a world of confidence,\u201d she remembered.\n\n\u201cI was in my prime. I wasn\u2019t the most skilled player, but I had the speed, agility and competitiveness that helped me pick things up really quickly.\u201d\n\nThis natural athletic ability would continue to guide her to success.\n\nTaking the long road\n\nCheryl Salisbury, Diane Alagich, Joey Peters, Heather Garriock \u2013 they are some of the luminaries of Australian women\u2019s football.\n\nAnd in 2007 in Coffs Harbour, they were preparing for what would be a history making FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup campaign in China.\n\nWatching on was a young Emily Gielnik and what she saw on that day changed the trajectory of her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw the Matildas play in Coffs Harbour when I was 14, I knew I wanted to make the team one day,\u201d Gielnik said.\n\nAlthough the decision was made in her young mind, Gielnik\u2019s pathway to elite football was not going to be easy, nor conventional.\n\nShe learnt early on, that she was going to have to make the journey her own.\n\n\u201cThat year [2007] was really tough for me as I\u2019d had some bad injuries and missed out on selection. So I took a year off, which was really make or break for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends received invitations from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) but having that year off combined with some injuries meant I didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to play in the Young Matildas and the W-League. I saw everyone get ahead of me, which was tough, but it didn\u2019t deter me, it motivated me to find another way.\u201d\n\nWhile it felt like doors were closing around the young footballer, in another fortuitous moment, a door opened up for Gielnik. And again, it involved the Matildas.\n\n\u201cAfter I missed out on QAS, I went on a school tour to the Australian Institute of Sport and the Matildas just happened to be training there with Tom Sermanni. My school coach asked if I could join in and I had an absolute blinder,\u201d Gielnik recalled.\n\n\u201cI was 15, totally intimidated and playing against the best female footballers in the country, but Tom called my coach afterwards wanting to get me into the QAS program and that was where I found my way in.\u201d\n\nMastering the art of resilience\n\nBeing a part of the QAS program opened new avenues for Gielnik.\n\nThat same year she also achieved another one of her goals by making the Brisbane Roar squad for the inaugural W-League season in 2008.\n\nCoached by Jeff Hopkins, it was a Brisbane Roar team littered with some of the greats of Australian women\u2019s football in Kate McShea and future stars including Clare Polkinghorne, Tameka Butt and Elise Kellond-Knight-Knight.\n\nAgain, the progress was tempered by a setback, The 16 year old was sidelined for the entire season after sustaining a stress fracture to her ankle.\n\nNot for the first time in her young career, Gielnik would have to call on her resilience. Gielnik didn\u2019t have time to grieve, as her eyes were firmly set on recovering and proving herself to her teammates and to herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first made the Brisbane Roar squad, I was so nervous and more than anything I just wanted to gain the respect of the older players,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to believe I deserved to be there. I was disciplined and just spent the first few seasons earning my spot and spending a lot of time in the grandstands and on the bench.\u201d\n\nGielnik believes it was a change in mindset that led to her performance improving and earning her moniker, the \u2018super sub.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter years of injury, missing out on squads and spending finals in the grandstands, I finally got my chance in the 2011/12 season.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was subbed on in extra time and in that season scored 12 goals, all while only being on for five or 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started to believe in myself and prove my worth, that everything came together.\u201d\n\nHer form continued and Gielnik ticked another goal off her list, making the Young Matildas squad.\n\nDuring her junior national team debut at the AFC U19 Women\u2019s Championships, the then 19-year-old took the Young Matildas from a 3-1 deficit to a 4-3 win, when she scored an incredible hattrick in the second half.\n\n\u201cDuring that game, I really felt like I hadn\u2019t played a good first half of football,\u201d she said of her first match as a Young Matilda.\n\n\u201cWe were down 1-0 and I was panicking. I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to be subbed off on my debut,\u2019 but then I scored that first goal which gave me so much confidence and I just kept scoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat game was a real turning point in my career and one of my key memories in the green and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time I felt like I belonged and deserved to be in that team. It showed me that even though you may have some bad minutes or a bad half there is always a way to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAnd turn it around she did, making her debut for the senior Matildas the following year in Japan.\n\n\u201cIt was so overwhelming because there were so many girls in that team I had idolised and never truly believed I would be up there with,\u201d Gielnik recounted of her Matildas debut.\n\n\u201cInstead of looking up to them as a fan, I was now competing for their position which was pretty surreal.\n\n\u201cIt came to a point where I had to see myself as an equal and understand that I had a job to do in representing my country.\n\n\u201cInstead of thinking about how lucky I was, I had to embrace that this was now my reality.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old who had watched her heroes years before was now playing alongside them in the jersey she dreamed to pull on.\n\nPART II: The making of Emily Gielnik will be published on 17 March\n\nRelated Images:"}, {"url": "https://www.matildas.com.au/news/westfield-matildas-made-w-league", "page_content": "The Westfield W-League is a competition which has nurtured, tested, and built some of the biggest names to then go on and don a Westfield Matildas jersey.\n\nFor 12 seasons, the best of Australia\u2019s best have played right here in our own backyard.\n\n\n\nAlthough there have been incredible moves overseas for our players and those familiar names won't be on the backs of shirts, the Westfield W-League is still where Westfield Matildas were made. And most importantly, it will continue to be where Matildas are made.\n\nFrom our most prolific striker in Lisa De Vanna to one of our newest Westfield Matildas in Jenna McCormick who debuted just over a year ago, the Westfield W-League has been an integral part in the careers of our national team players.\n\nDe Vanna started her career in the Women\u2019s National Soccer League, eventually plying her trade in the USA, in Sweden, and in Italy. But the Westfield Matildas all-time leading goal scorer has always returned to the Westfield W-League. A born entertainer, she has always put on a show from Perth to Brisbane and all the way down the eastern seaboard.\n\nDe Vanna brings success with her wherever she goes, winning championships with Brisbane, Sydney, and both Melbourne clubs. And trophies follow her with the Westfield Matildas picking up silverware too, namely the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup.\n\nWith almost 130 appearances in the Westfield W-League, Tameka Yallop has always brought the same energy in an orange jersey as she does in a green and gold one.\n\n\n\nYallop is the Roar\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer and a big game player. She has scored in four of Brisbane\u2019s five grand final appearances, which include championship wins in the inaugural season and the 2010/11 season.\n\nThat silverware winning form translated to the national team as she was a part of the 2010 AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup squad. A Julie Dolan medal winning season in 2013/14.\n\nShe wrote herself into the Westfield Matildas history books, scoring against the USWNT to help Australia record its first win over the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup champions.\n\nKatrina Gorry started her Westfield W-League career in the country\u2019s south with two stints in the navy blue of Melbourne Victory and one season in the red of Adelaide. A move to her hometown club saw the beginning of her rise.\n\nThere was a Westfield W-League premiership, and strong performances in the national team over a number of years. This all culminated in her being named the AFC Women\u2019s Player of the Year in 2014.\n\nAnother premiership with the Roar and stints overseas have seen her once again return to league, ready for a tilt at the Tokyo Olympics squad.\n\nEmily Gielnik is set to make her 100th Westfield W-League appearance during this season. Starting out in 2009 in the orange jersey, she has won trophies \u2013 with the Roar and Victory \u2013 and gone from being an Olympics alternate to playing in an AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup and a FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nA championship with the Roar preceded her Matildas debut. She\u2019s now back in a Brisbane shirt and a strong W-League season could be the start of a strong 2021 for both Gielnik and the Matildas.\n\nJenna McCormick has featured in the W-League since 2012, with stints at Adelaide, Canberra, and Brisbane.\n\nBeginning as a midfielder, she eventually moved back into the heart of defence. There was a premiership in green and the juggle of Westfield W-League football and Aussie rules over the summer months. But McCormick\u2019s move to Melbourne Victory for the 2019/20 signalled a focus on the beautiful game.\n\n\n\nHer Westfield Matildas debut followed not long after, in that central defensive role. And now she has returned to the league, this time with the reigning champions in Melbourne City. With the Tokyo Olympics on the horizon, it is the Westfield W-League where she and other players will push their case for selection.\n\nThey will continue to be tested and work hard for national team selection, and in the process, play their role in developing the next generation of Westfield Matildas."}, {"url": "https://www.avfc.co.uk/players/womens/emilygielnik/", "page_content": "We announced the signing of Australia international Emily Gielnik from Swedish club Vittsj\u00f6 GIK on September 2nd 2021.\n\nGielnik, joined the Club ahead of the 2021/22 campaign and took up the number nine shirt.\n\nThe forward arrived with over 40 international caps under her belt.\n\nGielnik has previous experience in England\u2019s top flight with Liverpool.\n\nThe Australian striker made her debut against West Ham United before netting her first goal two weeks later in a win over Brighton & Hove Albion."}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/exclusive-melbourne-victory-to-sign-matildas-forward-emily-gielnik-for-201819-wleague-season/news-story/526e5840e57ba713ce3ee40c694f0d65", "page_content": "Emily Gielnik has signed for Victory.
