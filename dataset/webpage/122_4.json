The majority justified the discrimination that maintained its privileges.\n\nIn 1955, Thomas Wilson, economic adviser to the Stormont government, said Catholics were made to feel inferior because \u201cthey often were inferior\u201d. In 1960 the ruling Unionist Party debated whether Catholics could join. They decided they could not.\n\nIan Paisley articulated nakedly sectarian views which led to the forced resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister Terence O\u2019Neill in 1969 when he looked favourably on the political accommodation of Catholics. A sectarian force policed this sectarian system.\n\nCivil rights demands from people like John Hume, Ivan Cooper and Austin Currie aimed to bring about, by peaceful means, equality of treatment. Their attempts to win peace and justice were rejected by unionism.\n\nIf unionists had acted with a modicum of common sense and political integrity, the nightmare of the armed struggle might never have evolved \u2014 and this island may well have been spared the horrors of the following 30 years.\n\nFor half a century Catholics were abandoned in politically constructed ghettoes, denied equal access to housing and jobs, and denied the right to vote themselves out of this sectarian predicament.\n\nFor President Higgins to accept an invitation to commemorate the centenary of Northern Ireland would be to endorse the fact that from partition in 1921 \u2014 with its carefully cultivated territorial and demographic carve-up until Stormont was prorogued in 1972 \u2014 unionists enjoyed the exclusive trappings of power.\n\nTom Cooper, Templeogue, Dublin 6\n\nSaying \u2018yes\u2019 would be a welcome gesture\n\nSir \u2014 In the search for peace and reconciliation, heads of state and politicians have made important gestures to assist progress.\n\nAs President of Ireland, Mary Robinson in 1993 shook the hand of Gerry Adams \u2014 this was regarded as a \u201chistoric\u201d gesture in the search for peace.\n\nAs the UK head of state, Queen Elizabeth has also made courageous gestures. In 2011, she attended a wreath-laying ceremony in the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin. The monarch bowed her head as she laid a wreath at the memorial for those who died fighting for Irish freedom, before observing a minute\u2019s silence.\n\nThen in 2012, in a further spirit of reconciliation she shook the hand of ex-IRA leader Martin McGuinness, despite the IRA having murdered Lord Mountbatten, her husband\u2019s uncle.\n\nIn 2015, her son and heir as head of state, Charles, shook hands with Gerry Adams who has always unapologetically justified the murder of Mountbatten.\n\nAll these gestures were warmly welcomed throughout Ireland at the time. By accepting the October invitation, President Higgins would have added to the many gestures he has already made in the search for reconciliation.\n\nJohn Cushnahan, Former Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP, Lisnagry, Co Limerick\n\nPresident\u2019s stance is an insult to unionists\n\nSir\u2014 I am disappointed by our President Michael D Higgins in refusing to give a reason for not attending a church service on the centenary of Northern Ireland.\n\nIt\u2019s an insult to unionists of Ulster/Northern Ireland, and shows a lack of empathy towards reconciliation.\n\nPresident Higgins is supposed to be impartial. I wonder.\n\n\u00dana Heaton, Limerick\n\nEntity has always sat uneasily with people\n\nSir \u2014 Northern Ireland was created by the UK\u2019s Government of Ireland Act 1920, in the middle of the War of Independence.\n\nIn that year, with Black and Tan atrocities at their most vicious, Irish leaders were by word and deed vociferously opposed to such a creation.\n\nIt was only with the Good Friday Agreement that the claims of the Republic of Ireland to a united Ireland were abandoned by referendum \u2014 subject to the proviso that should a majority north and south vote for such a union, then it would legally have to come about.\n\nPresident Higgins is perfectly entitled and within his legal rights to refuse to attend the commemoration of such an entity, which has always sat uneasily with Irish people. Increasingly so, it seems, as the clamour for a united country grows louder.\n\nMaurice O\u2019Callaghan, Mount Merrion, Co Dublin\n\nSkipping service was easy decision to make\n\nSir \u2014 Michael D Higgins is President of Ireland. Why he will not attend a service to commemorate the partitioning of our country by a foreign power should be obvious to all.\n\nKeith Nolan, Carrick-on-Shannon, Leitrim\n\nAcceptance would be a tacit endorsement\n\nSir \u2014 The Church Leaders Group, organisers of the event that President Higgins will not be attending, may have got the idea that the centenary is an opportunity to heal the past and show solidarity between the faiths.\n\nHowever, it would not be wise for the President to rubber-stamp the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nIt would infuriate republicans and nationalists beyond measure. Victims of the Troubles would be quick to remind Michael D of the bloody past and the British government\u2019s misrule \u2014 as admitted by Westminster.\n\nTo attend would endorse just about everything which went on in Northern Ireland, throughout its very troubled history.\n\nDid church organisers \u2014 and they came from Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist faiths, joined by the Council of Churches of Ireland \u2014 really think the President would attend the creation of one of the controversial parts of the UK, which is still disputed by hard-line republicans? Or did they just send out an invite as they were sending it out to everyone else?\n\nMaurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork\n\nChurch has a duty to all of its members\n\nSir \u2014 In 2012, a priest in the west of Ireland, Fr Tony Flannery, was suspended from duties by the Catholic Church for supporting women\u2019s ordination, same-sex marriage and his liberal views on homosexuality. Fr Flannery remains suspended.\n\nWhen President Higgins met the Pope in Rome last week, did he remind the Catholic leader of the hierarchy\u2019s duty to all community members, regardless of archaic rules and policies?\n\nOr is President Higgins only taking moral stances on what he describes as \u2018political issues\u2019, like his refusal to attend the partition event in Northern Ireland? Let us hope the President avoids the curse of double standards.\n\nDeclan Monaghan, Screggan, Tullamore, Co Offaly\n\nNo long-term future to come at Stormont\n\nSir \u2014 The latest policy from the DUP is an attempt to blackmail the EU into removing the NI Protocol and the sea border and setting up a land border instead.\n\nThis is hypocrisy of the worst kind. The DUP themselves voted to support Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted against it.\n\nNow they have shown their contempt for nationalists by stating that if Sinn F\u00e9in got the majority of seats in the Assembly they would not take their seats in Government. This is the type of thing that nationalists have had to put up with from extreme unionists since partition.\n\nThe British government and others thought that problem was one of community relations and continued to put millions of pounds into lectures and meetings throughout Northern Ireland \u2014 all to no effect.\n\nThe population of Northern Ireland is too small to put pressure on the extremes that exist. The problems we now experience are the fault of partition being introduced into such a small island and it has cost thousands of lives.\n\nMost reasonable people in Northern Ireland are tired of southern politicians, clergymen and so called \u2018do-gooders\u2019 metaphorically patting them on the back and telling them to go back to Stormont and continue to work for reconciliation.\n\nAnyone who listens to the DUP knows full well there is no long-term future or reconciliation to be found in Stormont.\n\nThe majority of unionist people know this to be true but will only accept a united Ireland if the Irish and British Governments spell out the terms and conditions of a deal to guarantee their rights and inheritance on this island. This is the most appropriate time to start talks that will offer hope to the long-suffering people in Northern Ireland.\n\nFrank Feely, Founding member of the SDLP and former Assembly member, Newry, Co Armagh\n\nSl\u00e1intecare billions could pay for private care for all\n\nSir \u2014 In 1945, just after Aneurin Bevan introduced the NHS to the British public, he was asked how he convinced the medical profession to sign up to the plan.\n\n\u201cI stuffed their mouths with gold,\u201d was his reply \u2014 but he also introduced an awards system for putting in the extra effort which at the top end could double your salary and, more importantly, double your pension.\n\nI worked in the NHS in the North of England in the 1970s when all the staff turned up on time and getting through a busy day\u2019s work was the norm. It had more to do with the mindset, though most consultants did benefit from the much sought-after merit award.\n\nThere was very little private practice, but the top advice was to give the public patients an excellent service and nobody could complain.\n\nI am afraid this doesn\u2019t hold in Ireland and I cannot see it ever changing. If only the HSE could prove they can tackle one simple problem, like the waiting list for cataract surgery.\n\nA GP fishingfriend suggested that a good eye surgeon with a functioning anaesthetist, a good nurse and an operating microscope could do 10 cataracts in an afternoon in the back bar of a well-known pub in Kilgarvan\u2014 but then we have the presumably half-empty Eye and Ear Hospital, unaffected by Covid, so can they do it?\n\nThe plan to introduce Sl\u00e1intecare with a reduced consultant salary is doomed unless staffed by yellow-pack doctors from elsewhere, but what a waste of the resources we spend producing hundreds of doctors each year \u2014 even though many of them don\u2019t seem to buy into the idea of hard work.\n\nIreland\u2019s first standalone hospital was built not as a money spinner, but because the founder was fed up with the public service he was offered.\n\nNow that we have a private service that is super efficient with no waiting lists, why not just leave it to them and forget about Sl\u00e1intecare?\n\nThe planned billions to be spent on it could probably fund the best of private cover for all those who don\u2019t already have it.\n\nDr Michael Foley, retired consultant, Rathmines, Dublin 6\n\nTime to throw out the rule book on hurling\n\nSir \u2014 My compliments to Messrs Donohoe, Healy, Ahearne and Kitt on their well- worded letters in your newspaper over the last two weeks.\n\nI fully concur with the sentiments they expressed about hurling becoming nothing more than a \u201cthrowing fest\u201d, with hurlers feigning to handpass the ball, when in reality they are throwing it.\n\nRegrettably, after watching the All-Ireland camogie final last week, it was apparent that the ball throwing virus now also afflicts the ladies\u2019 game.\n\nThere is a cure, however.\n\nIn advance of the All-Ireland senior final last month I personally delivered a simple solution to hurling\u2019s handpass problem to GAA headquarters.\n\nThis solution proposes the introduction of a new playing rule which will state it is a foul to either handpass the ball or palm the ball directly from the same hand that is holding the ball. The introduction of this rule will instantly eradicate all instances of ball throwing in hurling, and also camogie.\n\nFor the record, the delivery of my solution to Croke Park was accompanied by a petition, signed by more than 100 hurling fans, in support of my proposal.\n\nConor O\u2019Donovan, Tipperary All-Ireland winner, 1989 and 1991\n\nYou have to hand it to terrific Treaty team\n\nSir \u2014 I read with interest the debate about Limerick and the art of the quick handpass, which the Treaty men have become masters of in this great game of ours.\n\nI know some letters have been stating it is a throw, but if those refereeing the rules see nothing wrong with it and deem it to be within the rules, then who are we to question it?\n\nWe could go back through the years and question teams and their methods \u2014 from the Tipperary team of old with the \u2018Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 full-back line, or the great Cork team of the 1970s and the many handpass goals they got \u2014 but I think that would be a sorry road to go down.\n\nInstead we should admire this present Limerick team and the supreme skill level and high standards they have set.\n\nPat O\u2019Brien, Glenroe, Co Limerick\n\nGame has bigger problems to tackle\n\nSir \u2014 After the \u2018throwing\u2019 in hurling debate of the last few weeks, I wish to ask a few \u2018whys\u2019.\n\nWhy is the kick-out in football being taken from a spot that makes one eighth of the pitch redundant?\n\nWhy are there so many substitutes that games are now finished with little more than half the team that started?\n\nWhy are officials allowed to take part in hurling matches without wearing headgear? I know of a coach of underage hurlers who lost an eye recently after being accidentally struck by a sliotar.\n\nMichael Teehan, Moyglass, Co Tipperary\n\nBrolly wrong to put the boot in on Mayo\n\nSir \u2014I write with regard to Joe Brolly\u2019s overly harsh assessment of Mayo\u2019s All-Ireland final defeat in last Sunday\u2019s paper.\n\nHe labels the Green and Red as the great time wasters, yet they beat Galway and Dublin to reach their fourth final in six years, and this consistency should at least be admired.\n\nJoe criticised the decision to take off P\u00e1draig O\u2019Hora, but the Ballina man, while he did make some good runs forward, struggled on Darren McCurry and was also on a black card.\n\nThe loss of Cillian O\u2019Connor on the eve of championship was also a factor and this was not acknowledged in the article. Mayo in fact did very well to reach the final without their leading scorer of all time. A valid comparison would be Kilkenny missing TJ Reid for the championship.\n\nCongratulations to Tyrone, and, who knows, maybe next year will be Mayo\u2019s turn at last. But for now they deserve to be cut some slack.\n\nRichard Holden, Maynooth, Co Kildare\n\nTalk of ecological disaster is overplayed\n\nSir \u2014 I refer to John Fitzgerald\u2019s letter of September 5 (\u2018Irish hare could be wiped out by disease\u2019), and submit there is no scientific evidence to support the claims of an \u201cecological catastrophe\u201d made by the writer.\n\nFar from being a harbinger of extinction, the scientific evidence points in the opposite direction, indicating that the hare is not under threat.\n\nRHD2 is a rabbit disease as indicated by its name and its presence in the Republic of Ireland was confirmed in a wild rabbit as far back as January 2016 \u2014 as published by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s All- Ireland Surveillance Disease Report. There are no reports of RHD2 in Northern Ireland and, given we are an island nation, this demonstrates its lack of transmissibility.\n\nIt is of course pragmatic and important to monitor the health of the hare for any emergent threats and the Irish Coursing Club will continue to support the conservation of the Irish hare and assist in measures to monitor, preserve and protect its status, as it has done since 1916.\n\nDJ Histon, CEO, Irish Coursing Club, Clonmel, Co Tipperary\n\nGarth\u2019s got kindred spirits in westerners\n\nSir \u2014 Well Garth, ya boy ya. I can\u2019t believe you may actually be coming here after the last fiasco. Have to hand it to you Garth, you are as determined to play in Croke Park as the Mayo football crowd \u2014 they keep coming back like boomerangs.\n\nIf you come, you might play a special request for them, maybe Same Old Story or Victim of the Game. It might be a bit raw for them to hear \u2018Unanswered Prayers\u2019. I\u2019ll leave the choice up to you.\n\nAnn Navin, Stradbally, Co Waterford"}, {"url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-40789602.html", "page_content": "AWARE that the 30th anniversary of the Teebane Massacre would occur this week, I emailed all the usual news outlets. In my email, I drew their attention to the forthcoming anniversary, providing them with a link to the details of it \u2014 in which the IRA attempted to murder 14 Protestant workers 16 miles from Omagh.\n\nThis was a naked sectarian act. Eight of them died in the bombing of their vehicle, and the remainder suffered horrific injuries.\n\nOn this Sunday and Monday, the event of 30 years ago was given widespread coverage in the daily newspapers in the North, and the BBC and UTV. Here, I only saw two reports of the anniversary of the Teebane slaughter, and the Examiner was the only paper to contact me directly and asked me to write an opinion piece on the subject, which you are now reading.\n\nMy purpose in sending the email was hoping to encourage them to report on this atrocity, because I have become increasingly frustrated and annoyed at the imbalance in the coverage of the atrocities that occurred during the Northern Ireland Troubles.\n\nMy perception is that there appears to be a concentration in the Irish media primarily on atrocities that involved collusion between loyalist paramilitary organisations and a small number of corrupt members of Northern Ireland\u2019s security forces, and also on the British Parachute Regiment who murdered innocents, particularly Catholics in Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday in Derry, but not only there.\n\nLet me state unequivocally that I totally support the exposure of proven instances of collusion and murder by the security forces and the prosecution of those responsible.\n\nAtrocities analysis\n\nHowever, my perception is that the media in this part of Ireland in recent times rarely broadcasts documentaries or publishes analytical articles detailing the scale and sectarian nature of IRA atrocities that happened during the Troubles, particularly when the Provisional IRA was responsible for the murders of 52% of the 3,523 victims that were killed.\n\nFive other republican terrorist groups were responsible for another 7%; 1,020 (20%) were attributed to loyalist paramilitary groups; 368 (10%) to security forces (and many of these were killed in firefights between the security forces and either loyalist or republican terrorists).\n\nWhen these figures are analysed further, it emerges that victims consisted of 1,855 civilians; 1,123 members of the security forces; 394 members of republican terrorist groups, and 151 members of loyalist paramilitary groups.\n\nI pose this question to our media; if you were to analyse the recent publication and broadcasting of the major and controversial incidents of the Troubles, would you not agree that it does not accurately reflect where the true responsibility lies for the suffering and heartbreak and pain that was callously inflicted on the families of the victims?\n\nI am not claiming that there is any bias or deliberate misleading by journalists here.\n\nAs a leading politician in the North during the worst of the Troubles, I worked very closely with Belfast- and Dublin-based journalists of RT\u00c9, the Irish Times, the Irish Independent, the Irish Press and the Examiner. The quality, integrity, and courage of their reporting was beyond reproach.\n\nI would say the same about their successors in their present-day reporting of Northern Ireland matters. A particular example of this is the recently retired northern editor of RT\u00c9, Tommie Gorman.\n\nHowever, I still maintain my main point \u2014 the recent reporting of those\n\nresponsible for violence in the North prior to the Good Friday Agreement is unbalanced\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that too many of our journalists (and voters) are too young to remember what happened in the northeastern part of our country in the years between 1970 and 2000.\n\nBut no matter what the reason, I hope that my comments will provide cause for reflection, not least of all because, in my opinion, there are significant consequences that flow from the current imbalance. I know my view on this is shared by many people, not only across the political divide here in the Republic, but also across the traditional divide in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nI believe it influences young people in the Republic of Ireland to believe that the IRA campaign was justified. It feeds the Sinn F\u00e9in narrative, and encourages them to continue to glorify and excuse the murders that the IRA committed; and to continue to refuse to offer any apologies for what happened and therefore prolong the suffering and pain which continues to be experienced by the families whose fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters they callously murdered.\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former leader of the Alliance Party and a former Fine Gael MEP"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/nyregion/stonewall-inn-nyc-1969.html", "page_content": "Hours before it was to become a flash point in the modern gay rights movement and a landmark visited with awe and reverence half a century later as if a shrine, it was just a dark, dingy bar called the Stonewall Inn, just another Friday night in June.\n\nA mobster named Fat Tony with the Genovese crime family had bought the place two years earlier for a song \u2014 it had been a restaurant damaged in a fire \u2014 and reopened it as a gay bar.

The people that really took the risks for peace down the years were those in the northern Catholic community (and indeed outside it also) who defied the IRA and whose political and moral courage often cost them their lives.\n\nI also challenge yesterday\u2019s claim made by Adams himself ,and his acolytes, that the intertwining campaigns of Sinn F\u00e9in and the IRA have made a united Ireland an achievable dream hence their call for a border poll.\n\nIn my opinion nothing could be further from the truth. Having served in public life in the Republic of Ireland for almost two decades, I believe that a majority in the Republic of Ireland would not support Irish unity at any stage in the near future.\n\nI believe this for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, the brutal terrorist campaign of the IRA diminished the desire for imminent Irish unity in the Republic of Ireland itself.\n\nSecondly, in a post Brexit world, taxpayers in the Republic would not be prepared to pay higher taxes of almost \u20ac10 billion a year to absorb the north.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Adams has nonetheless played a major role in bringing about an IRA ceasefire which eventually paved the way for the establishment of power -sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and better North- South and East-West relations.\n\nOn that point I am in total agreement about his recent legacy. But it must also be acknowledged that he was merely re-establishing the imaginative political experiment that had been first introduced in 1974.\n\nNor should it be forgotten Gerry Adams and IRA/Sinn Fein also sought to undermine the historic 1985 Anglo - Irish Agreement which was seminal in eventually bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBut even if those historical actions are set aside, the question has to be posed to Mr. Adams as he prepares to depart the political stage - what does he intend to do before he leaves it to resurrect the north\u2019s power-sharing institutions so that together we can minimise the economic and political fallout from Brexit.\n\nMy plea to him is: \u201cYou have huge political acumen and also immense political capital and good will especially with northern nationalists please use it to restore devolution and then we can all agree that you will have left a real and lasting political legacy to all the people of this island\u201d.\n\nJohn Cushnahan\n\nFormer Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP\n\nRead more: Francie Molloy says he won't quite Sinn F\u00e9in over abortion but has criticised the \"gloating\" of some delegates at the ard fheis\n\nMichelle O'Neill likely to take Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader post"}, {"url": "https://irishelectionliterature.com/tag/john-cushnahan/", "page_content": "From the 1989 General Election a small flyer for Fine Gael North Kerry candidate Jimmy Deenihan \u201cThe People\u2019s Champion\u201d.

The reality is that the white community still enjoy many privileges and opportunities beyond the reach of minority communities.\n\nFor example, young black men without a high school diploma are more likely to be in prison than employed.\n\nIn Northern Ireland how many times have you met someone who says, \u201cI\u2019m not into any of that old political nonsense. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d Many times, I would guess.\n\nWhen, if ever, have you ever met someone who says, \u201cI hate them, they\u2019re persecuting us, the Police Service of Northern Ireland is the PNS-IRA/PSNI-RUC.\u201d\n\nYou might have heard it on the radio, but in person, I would guess never. Do we live with a mad minority?\n\nOn the Ormeau Road on Easter Tuesday loyalism was sent into a spin by policing and by the dissident republican parade in Lurgan.\n\nMost of the country was on holiday or leisuring themselves, but the concerns of two swaggering minorities gripped the whole body populace.\n\nThe march in Lurgan happened, and if it is unlawful it will be pursued. It is not for loyalism or anyone to prejudge and do the job of the police and prosecution services.\n\nAs for the Ormeau Road, I was dismayed that scuffles between marchers and forces of law and order broke out. I was doubly dismayed to hear loyalism attack the PSNI as partisan and politically motivated, as opposed to being the most accountable service on the continent.\n\nMy dismay redoubled when I heard loyalist and unionist politicians, including the First Minister Arlene Foster, undergird the wild and outlandish claims of loyalist bandsmen.\n\nThe inflamed passions and jealousies of loyalism, totally misplaced, reminded me of what happened in 1969 when British troops arrived on the streets of Belfast.\n\nIn 1969 soldiers were welcomed warmly and with open arms by the Catholic community. Somehow some loyalists perceived this as a threat to their community, their standing and to the Union. This led to a riot on the Shankill Road, the death of an RUC officer, and a clamp down on catholics to please loyalists, thus eventually throwing Catholics into the arms of what would emerge as the Provisional IRA and into the resolutely anti-Union camp.\n\nSpeaking with Robert Kee of the BBC, a number of key personalities remembered this phase of history \u2013 Old IRA man Joe Cahill, independent Labour republican politician Paddy Kennedy and John Cushnahan of the Alliance Party.\n\nCahill speaking with Kee of (circa 1980) said:\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that when the British troops first came in in 1969 that they were received with open arms by the people, the majority of the people. I felt as a republican at that time that we didn\u2019t have any great opportunity of striking against them the Brits. But it is fair to say or right to say that the British developed the situation themselves. Whilst they claim to have come in as the peace keepers in 1969, they were seen by the ordinary people to become the aggressor.\u201d\n\nPaddy Kennedy, independent Labour republican politician said:\n\n\u201cWhen British troops were welcomed on Catholic-Nationalist-Republican areas (using these terms interchangeably) it set off a counter-reaction in Protestant areas, and if you remember there was sporadic rioting that broke out in the Shankill Road where an RUC man was killed and I think that the British government looked at the situation and they wanted to maintain a balance between the two communities. They were virtually embarrassed by he reception the British troops got, so they had to lean on the Catholic side. So British troops then started what\u2019s called cordon-and-search, of condoning-off an area and searching houses and this gave rise to resentment and it later grew and it was greatly heightened by the Falls curfew (1970).\u201d\n\nJohn Cushnahan said:\n\n\u201cThe curfew on the Falls in 1970 was a crucial period in Northern Ireland\u2019s history in relation to the growth of the PIRA. There had been a belief that there were a small number of IRA men operating in the lower Falls and they chose a sledgehammer to crack a nut. And I remember coming out of that area that particular night, I managed to get out before the curfew was imposed, while there was saturation of the area with tear-gas and total surrounding of the area in a cordon of steel by the army. That action on that particular night alienated the entire Catholic community, which I would stress before that had not been anti-army. But so alienated the Catholic community to the extent the provisionals were able to represent themselves as the defence of the Catholic community.\u201d\n\nPaddy Kennedy also said:\n\n\u201cI think that if the British had not been so clumsy in their dealing with the situation in areas like West Belfast, the IRA would not have gone on the offensive.\u201d\n\nI look at what happened the years in 1969 and 1970 with amazement and disbelief. Loyalists managed to turn catholics from being pro-British to fervently anti-British.\n\nThis is the conduct we have seen again and again in recent years. Hysteria and outlandish behaviour that purports to serve the Union but that is immensely damaging to it.\n\nAs I highlighted at the start, there is a difference between perception and reality. Paul nolan has shown repeatedly, fears and perceptions of the loyalist community are misplaced and out of step with reality and research.\n\nAs the former British Prime Minister John Major said more bluntly, fears of persecution are \u201cphantom\u201d.\n\nThe story of loyalism for the last decade and more has been that of Jeremiah, \u201cWoe is me, a man of strife and contention.\u201d Where is the positivity?\n\nWhat kind of Northern Ireland do we want? A happy and respected place or a place torn apart by hysterics and the squalling of an outlandish minority?\n\nEveryday of the week we meet someone who says \u201cI\u2019m not into that kind of thing\u201d or \u201cnot into dinosaur politics\u201d, young and old. Perhaps it is time we heard more these people and less from those who are \u201cinto that kind of thing.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/john-cushnahan-birth-1956-death-1976-australia/146209305", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during John's lifetime.\n\nIn 1956, in the year that John Cushnahan was born, this was the year that the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, became an international sensation.

Video: Reuters\n\nBefore the return of Hong Kong in July 1997 to the People's Republic of China, the latter signed an international agreement in 1984 known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n\nThe autonomy of Hong Kong was guaranteed in all areas apart from defence and foreign affairs. Under it, Hong Kong\u2019s laws and \u201ccommon law\u201d legal system would remain in place. The independence of its courts and their right to exercise the power of final adjudication were assured.\n\nIn doing this, both the UK and Chinese Governments had accepted the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d proposal based on the rule of law and which was to remain unaltered and in place until 2047.\n\nThe rule of law, therefore, is the cornerstone. However, over the last 22 years a number of attempts have been made by the Chinese government and its allies in the Hong Kong political system to undermine this fundamental principle and weaken Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. The latest has led to the current massive demonstrations.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nHowever, this is not a new phenomenon. It had happened previously and is fuelled by two main factors.\n\nThe first is widespread frustration at the lack of progress towards the introduction of universal suffrage, despite commitments to introduce democratic reforms after 2007. The current political system falls far short of democratic accountability. The legislative council is only partially democratically elected.\n\nIn July 2003, an estimated 500, 000 Hong Kong people took to the streets\n\nThe top political post of chief executive is selected by an election committee which is structured to ensure that a pro-Beijing candidate will be chosen. The 32-strong executive council which includes the 16 \u201ccabinet type\u201d ministers is accountable to the chief executive and not the legislative council.\n\nSecond, several attempts to introduce security and legislative measures to suppress political freedoms, human rights and political dissent are perceived as an attempt to make the region become more like mainland China.\n\nShelved legislation\n\nBack in 2002/2003 the Hong Kong government introduced an anti-subversion Bill under article 23 of the basic law and this led to a series of huge demonstrations. In July 2003, an estimated 500,000 Hong Kong people took to the streets. Although the Hong Kong government (HKSAR) was obliged to introduce anti-subversion legislation under article 23, it was felt that the legislation went beyond its original scope.\n\nWhat was being proposed was the prohibition of any act of treason, secession, subversion against the Central Peoples Republic of China; the prohibition of foreign political organisations or bodies conducting political activities in Hong Kong; the prohibition of Hong Kong political organisations from establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies and the banning of political organisations which are banned in mainland China.\n\nSignificantly, in wake of the demonstrations, the legislation was shelved which is a point that will not be lost on leaders of the current protests although they should also take note of what happened in 2014.\n\nThen, street protest in Hong Kong also became the focus of the international media. When the Chinese government published a White Paper declaring that Hong Kong does not enjoy full autonomy, it aroused fears that China was about to alter the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy.\n\nAnd when China announced in proposed reforms to the electoral system that candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s top political position had to be pre-screened by the Chinese Communist party, it sparked demonstrations by tens of thousands who demanded the introduction of universal suffrage as had been promised.\n\nThis protest was called the \u201cumbrella protest\u201d, because large numbers of those involved used umbrellas to protect themselves from police pepper sprays. Although the protests paralysed central areas of Hong Kong for 77 days it eventually petered out without achieving any concessions. Nine of its leaders were convicted in April of this year on public nuisance charges, some of them receiving sentences of 16 months.\n\nUndermine autonomy\n\nThe latest controversial decision by chief executive Carrie Lam to introduce new extradition laws between Hong Kong and mainland China is directly responsible for what is happening at the moment.\n\nAlthough claiming that the purpose behind it is to close loopholes in order to prevent Hong Kong being a safe haven for criminals, many civic leaders are concerned that it will undermine the region\u2019s autonomy particularly its judicial system and expose its citizens to the deeply flawed Chinese justice system which is used more as a political tool to suppress dissent and human rights rather than uphold justice.\n\nPowerful business leaders and the International Chamber of Commerce have also expressed concern\n\nThe opposition to it is widespread across all sections of Hong Kong society, Before the recent protests, 3,000 lawyers, prosecutors, academics and legal students held a silent vigil urging scrapping of the proposal. Powerful business leaders and the International Chamber of Commerce have also expressed concern that it will have a negative impact on foreign investment.\n\nThe most damning criticism has come from former legislator and pro-democracy leader Martin Lee QC who said:\u201cAll they need is a witness statement saying you committed some crime 20 years ago. That is enough, and then you\u2019ll be tried according to Chinese law in a Chinese court. And who can trust that system?\u201d\n\nIn addressing a crowd of thousands outside government headquarters he went on to say:\u201cIf we lose this one, it is not Hong Kong anymore. It is just another Chinese city.\u201d\n\nWhile I understand the frustration, the outbreak of violence at the demonstrations is regrettable and could be counterproductive. The international community has to step up, help defuse the situation and ensure that China does not overreact.\n\nThe US, UK, Canada and the EU have all criticised the extradition proposals, but given the fact that China often turns a deaf ear to international criticism the concerns should be taken to a new level.\n\nChina and the UK are joint signatories to the Sino- British Joint Declaration which guarantees Hong Kong freedoms. It is a legally binding bilateral treaty registered with the United Nations. The UK has a responsibility to forget Brexit for a moment and inform the UN that China is not honouring its obligations under the treaty and request them to take urgent action.\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former MEP and European Parliament rapporteur for Hong Kong 1997-2004"}, {"url": "https://www.calendarz.com/on-this-day/july/23/john-cushnahan", "page_content": "Birth\n\nJul, 23\n\nJohn Cushnahan\n\nJohn Cushnahan, Northern Irish educator and politician\n\nJohn Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\n\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.

In my email, I drew their attention to the forthcoming anniversary, providing them with a link to the details of it \u2014 in which the IRA attempted to murder 14 Protestant workers 16 miles from Omagh.\n\nThis was a naked sectarian act. Eight of them died in the bombing of their vehicle, and the remainder suffered horrific injuries.\n\nOn this Sunday and Monday, the event of 30 years ago was given widespread coverage in the daily newspapers in the North, and the BBC and UTV. Here, I only saw two reports of the anniversary of the Teebane slaughter, and the Examiner was the only paper to contact me directly and asked me to write an opinion piece on the subject, which you are now reading.\n\nMy purpose in sending the email was hoping to encourage them to report on this atrocity, because I have become increasingly frustrated and annoyed at the imbalance in the coverage of the atrocities that occurred during the Northern Ireland Troubles.\n\nMy perception is that there appears to be a concentration in the Irish media primarily on atrocities that involved collusion between loyalist paramilitary organisations and a small number of corrupt members of Northern Ireland\u2019s security forces, and also on the British Parachute Regiment who murdered innocents, particularly Catholics in Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday in Derry, but not only there.\n\nLet me state unequivocally that I totally support the exposure of proven instances of collusion and murder by the security forces and the prosecution of those responsible.\n\nAtrocities analysis\n\nHowever, my perception is that the media in this part of Ireland in recent times rarely broadcasts documentaries or publishes analytical articles detailing the scale and sectarian nature of IRA atrocities that happened during the Troubles, particularly when the Provisional IRA was responsible for the murders of 52% of the 3,523 victims that were killed.\n\nFive other republican terrorist groups were responsible for another 7%; 1,020 (20%) were attributed to loyalist paramilitary groups; 368 (10%) to security forces (and many of these were killed in firefights between the security forces and either loyalist or republican terrorists).\n\nWhen these figures are analysed further, it emerges that victims consisted of 1,855 civilians; 1,123 members of the security forces; 394 members of republican terrorist groups, and 151 members of loyalist paramilitary groups.\n\nI pose this question to our media; if you were to analyse the recent publication and broadcasting of the major and controversial incidents of the Troubles, would you not agree that it does not accurately reflect where the true responsibility lies for the suffering and heartbreak and pain that was callously inflicted on the families of the victims?\n\nI am not claiming that there is any bias or deliberate misleading by journalists here.\n\nAs a leading politician in the North during the worst of the Troubles, I worked very closely with Belfast- and Dublin-based journalists of RT\u00c9, the Irish Times, the Irish Independent, the Irish Press and the Examiner. The quality, integrity, and courage of their reporting was beyond reproach.\n\nI would say the same about their successors in their present-day reporting of Northern Ireland matters. A particular example of this is the recently retired northern editor of RT\u00c9, Tommie Gorman.\n\nHowever, I still maintain my main point \u2014 the recent reporting of those\n\nresponsible for violence in the North prior to the Good Friday Agreement is unbalanced\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that too many of our journalists (and voters) are too young to remember what happened in the northeastern part of our country in the years between 1970 and 2000.\n\nBut no matter what the reason, I hope that my comments will provide cause for reflection, not least of all because, in my opinion, there are significant consequences that flow from the current imbalance. I know my view on this is shared by many people, not only across the political divide here in the Republic, but also across the traditional divide in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nI believe it influences young people in the Republic of Ireland to believe that the IRA campaign was justified. It feeds the Sinn F\u00e9in narrative, and encourages them to continue to glorify and excuse the murders that the IRA committed; and to continue to refuse to offer any apologies for what happened and therefore prolong the suffering and pain which continues to be experienced by the families whose fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters they callously murdered.\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former leader of the Alliance Party and a former Fine Gael MEP"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/John-Cushnahan", "page_content": "John Walls Cushnahan (born 23 July 1948) is a former politician in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who served as leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and then as a Member of the European Parliament for Fine Gael.\n\nCushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics.

Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of first ministers.\n\nThere is still no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the nationalist and unionist traditions, and \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of republican and loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. He calls for public apologies from those who perpetrated and supported paramilitary violence, greater efforts on integrated housing and education, action plans to remove peace walls (the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, actually entrenching division), and more reciprocal, mutual respect, criticising for instance Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s veto of a monument to commemorate the Northern Ireland Centenary at Stormont.\n\nIn the case of a border poll, Cushnahan wants to avoid the pitfalls of Brexit, where voters had minimal information on the realistic options and consequences after a Leave victory. He calls for the British and Irish governments to fund a multi-university research project, to explore in detail the options for Irish unification. This work should examine different state models for a united Ireland \u2013 a \u201cunitary, federal or confederal\u201d state \u2013 as well as possible \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, \u201cgovernment culture and citizenship\u201d, and how contingencies such as Scottish independence would affect unification. This research would provide \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d, without recommending a particular course of action. The ultimate decision would lie with the electorate, but they should be as well informed as possible.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nJohn Cushnahan is a former student Civil Rights activist and General Secretary of the Alliance Party (1974-82) when he was the party\u2019s only full-time politician. John was a Councillor for North Belfast 1977-85 and in 1982, was elected as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the staunchly unionist constituency of North Down. John was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee and was Alliance Party Chief Whip (1982-4 ) and party leader 1984-7. When the Unionist parties used the Assembly's procedures to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in December 1985, John called on the British Government to dissolve the Assembly. This terminated his income as a full-time politician. Despite this, he led the Alliance Party into the June 1987 Westminster Election where the party doubled its share of the vote from 5-10% (this tally was not exceeded until 2019). He retired as Alliance Leader in September 1987. In 1989, he was invited by Fine Gael to contest the European Parliament (EP) election in the strongly nationalist Munster constituency. After being re-elected twice, he retired in 2004. During this period, John was elected Vice President of the EP Regional Policy and Foreign Affairs Committees and was EP rapporteur on Interreg, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Kashmir. John was also appointed by the EU Council as Head of Mission to lead multi-national and multi-disciplinary teams in South Asia on five occasions, the objective of which was to strengthen Democracy and Human Rights in the region.\n\nWatch the conversation\n\nWhat was said?\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement was a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d, says John Cushnahan, but it has fallen far short of its aspirations. After the Agreement was ratified, \u201ccomplacency then set in\u201d, and we began to \u201cdeceive ourselves about what was happening\u201d. Cushnahan paints a bleak picture of the peace process and democracy\u2019s success in post-conflict Northern Ireland. There is no bill of rights, no \u201cequality of respect\u201d for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions, and \u201ctotally insufficient progress\u201d on integration in education and housing. The \u201csupporters of the violent campaigns of Republican and Loyalist terrorist organisations continue to glorify their actions, and continue to inflict suffering and pain on the families of their victims, denying them closure\u201d. The biggest failure for Cushnahan, however, is the \u201cinability to deliver stable political institutions\u201d. He notes how the Stormont Executive has collapsed at least six times since 1999 (nine according some academics), and hasn\u2019t sat for ten out of twenty two years since power-sharing was installed. But Cushnahan is still convinced and determined that the Good Friday Agreement can be amended to finally meet aspirations.\n\nJohn Cushnahan was born in 1948 to a working-class Catholic family in the lower Falls, Belfast. He was involved in student civil rights activism before entering elected politics. He became General Secretary of the Alliance Party in 1974, at the time the party\u2019s only full time employee, and sat on the Belfast City Council from 1977-85. He served as Alliance Party leader from 1984-7, a difficult period in which Alliance backed the Anglo-Irish Agreement against concerted Unionist opposition. When Unionists blocked the Agreement, which would give the Irish Republic a consultative role in governing Northern Ireland, Cushnahan called on the British Government to prorogue Stormont. Stormont was dissolved in 1986, and Cushnahan soon after resigned his position in Alliance and moved to the Republic. Joining Fine Gael, he served as a member of the European Parliament from 1989-2004. Barry Colfer commends him for having \u201cdone more than most to build bridges North-South and East-West in British and Irish politics\u201d. Long retired from elected office, Cushnahan is still deeply engaged with politics, brimming with analysis and suggestions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should just discard the Good Friday Agreement\u201d, Cushnahan says. We should \u201creview it, see where it\u2019s defective and make corrective decisions\u201d. He particularly wants revisions to the power-sharing system established by Good Friday and the subsequent St Andrew's Agreement (2006), in which the largest party in the Assembly takes the First Minister role, and the largest party from the other tradition takes the Deputy First Ministership. Cushnahan argues that this system has led voters to coalesce around the largest party from their community \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP. These centrifugal tendencies have weakened the political centre in Northern Ireland \u2013 the UUP, Alliance and SDLP \u2013 and have failed to produce working executives. Cushnahan proposes replacing this system with governing coalitions of parties, requiring two thirds of the Assembly\u2019s backing, \u201ccross-community support\u201d and sharing of the first minister roles.\n\nCushnahan also wants greater efforts towards reconciliation, to meet the unfulfilled aspirations of Good Friday. Audience member, former Alliance Chairman, Phillip McGarry, asks whether Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cunapologetic\u201d defence of IRA violence serves to \u201cundermine\u201d reconciliation, while Fergal McCarthy enquires about possible policies for reconciliation? Cushnahan offers some solutions. He calls for a roadmap to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in cities such as Belfast \u2013 they are the \u201cgreatest misnomer\u201d, and only entrench segregation. He also calls for greater efforts at integrating education and housing. With regards to housing, he suggests removing all paramilitary murals as a productive first step. Cushnahan is scathing about all attempts to defend paramilitary violence. \u201cHow can anyone expect reconciliation in Northern Ireland when paramilitaries on both sides continue to glorify their actions?\u201d They should publicly apologise and commit to peaceful, democratic methods in future. Apologies would \u201cgive some comfort to the 3000 families whose relatives were slaughtered in the Troubles. And that would be an important psychological first step.\u201d\n\nCushnahan also addresses the framework for a border poll. Noting the ambiguities of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Northern Ireland Act of 1998 on how a poll should be initiated, Cushnahan argues that two thirds of Assembly votes should be required to schedule one. If a poll is scheduled, Cushnahan is determined to avoid the pitfalls of the Brexit referendum, where voters had minimal information on the realistic consequences of a Leave vote. He criticises Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s campaigns for reunification as \u201csloganizing\u201d and insubstantial, and draws parallels between the party and Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories \u2013 both are \u201ccynically exploiting narrow nationalisms for electoral advantage\u201d.\n\nCushnahan wants voters to be as informed as possible before a border poll, and calls for the British and Irish governments to fund multi-university research projects with \u201cdetailed analysis of the options\u201d for Irish unification. This research, \u201ccoordinated under a single organisational umbrella\u201d, would explore diverse aspects of unification. It would cover potential state models (unitary, federal and confederal), \u201clegislative and structural changes\u201d, options for protecting minority rights, government and citizenship in a united Ireland, and the effects of \u201cpossible shocks\u201d such as Scottish independence. Publishing this research should \u201cinform the public and encourage a constructive and ongoing debate well in advance of any border poll\u201d.\n\nHowever, Cushnahan doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s \u201cany possibility in the near future of an all-Ireland settlement.\u201d So, in the meantime, we have to try and make Stormont work. \u201cIf we can\u2019t unite Northern Ireland, how the hell can we unite Ireland?\" A question which will inevitably be asked again in this series and as the political fallout from Brexit continues to animate these islands."}, {"url": "https://vlex.co.uk/vid/cushnahan-francis-v-british-853224263", "page_content": "2\n\n(b) The second was entitled \u201cThe NAMA Tapes: Corruption and Cover - up:\n\nMandy McAuley uncovers secret rec ordings that expose corrup tion around\n\nNAMA\u2019s billion pound Northern Ireland property deal.\u201d (\u201cSpotlig ht T wo\u201d).\n\nIt was broadcast on 6 September 2016. It was re - broadcast on 7 Sep tember\n\n2016. It remained available to view on the BBC iPlayer until 8 October 2016.\n\n(1/173/35).\n\n[2] The plaintiff states that both Spotlight programmes allege either that he w as\n\ncriminally corrupt or that he w as reasonably suspected of such corruption. In\n\nessence the Spotlight programmes allege that the plaintiff, whilst a member of the\n\nNorthern Ireland Advisory Committee (\u201cNIAC\u201d) of the National Asset Managemen t\n\nAgency (\u201cNAMA \u201d) and whilst being paid b y NAMA, was at the same time acting on\n\nbehalf of and being paid by the purchaser of NAMA\u2019s Northern Ireland loa n\n\nportfolio and on behalf of and bein g paid by developers who owed money to\n\nNAMA. In particular that one developer, Mr Miskelly, paid the plaintiff \u00a340,000 in\n\ncash in August 2012 . The plaintiff is concerned that the BBC will re - broadcast one or\n\nother or both of the Spotlight programm es or alternatively will broadca st another\n\nprogramme (\u201cSpotlight T hree\u201d) containing furth er material alleging that he was\n\ncorrupt or is suspecte d of corruption. He has brought this application s eeking an\n\ninterlocutory injunction to prevent such eventualities . The context in which the\n\nplaintiff seeks a n interlocutory injunction is that in Jul y 2015 the National Crime\n\nAgency (\u201cNCA\u201d) com menced a criminal investigati on into the sale by NAMA to\n\nCerberus Capital Management (\u201cCerberus\u201d) for \u00a31.241 billion of its loans to\n\nNorthern Irish property developers. The plaintiff is a suspect in that crimina l\n\ninvestigation , which is ongoing.\n\n[3 ] The plaintiff primarily asserts that he is entitled to an interlocutory injunction\n\non the basis that any further b roadcast by the BBC stating th at he is corrupt or is\n\nsuspected of corruption would be a contempt of co urt under the strict liability rule in\n\nArticle 6 breach of his rights under ECHR in any potential criminal trial to an\n\nimpartial tribunal and his presumption of innocence . The plaintiff also asserts that\n\nhe is entitled to an interlocutory inju nction on the basis of the tort of misus e of\n\nprivate information, under the P rotection from Harassment (Northern I reland)\n\nOrder 1997 to prevent anticipated harassment and also under the Dat a Protection\n\nAct 1998 to prevent an anticipated fail ure by the BBC to comply with the data\n\nprotection principles . The plaintiff , whilst asserting in corresponden ce that both\n\nSpotlight One and Two were defamatory of him , has not sued for defamation. This\n\napplication involves a consideration of the interplay between the var ious causes of\n\neen strict liability contempt under the Contempt between interaction action and also the ontempt of court and A rticle 6 ECHR. of Court Act 1981 , common law contempt of court [4] For their part t he defendants have applied u nder Order 18 Rule 19 (d) of the Rules of the Court of Judic ature (Northern Ireland) 1980 to strike out the plaintiff \u2019s action on the grounds that its instituti on and or its continuation amounts to an abus e of the process of the Court as it is c ontended that in reality the p laintiff\u2019s claim is for 3 the protection of his reputation an d has been brought on ground s other than defamation as an improper attempt to ci rcumvent the rule in Bonnard v Perryman the p laintiff\u2019s claim is an application in respect of allege d [1891] 2 Ch. 269 ; and (b) contempt of court which h e states has already been c ommitted and for which the p laintiff does not have the cons ent of the Attorney General, as requ ired by s ection 7 1 and at common law . F urthermore that these of the Contempt of Court Act 198 proceedings have been brought a fter the p laintiff sought and was refused the consent of the Attorney General and that t his was not disclosed to the Court when the p laintiff\u2019s proceedings were issued. [5 ] On 5 October 2016 , when the plaintiff\u2019s applicatio n first came into my list for under section 4(2) of the Contempt directions, I imposed a reporting restriction order of Court Act 1981 which still remains in force , see Cream Holdings Limited and others v. ee and others [2004] UKHL 44 at paragraph [22]. I considered that an injunction Banerj was necessary to enable the court to hear and give proper consideration to this application for an interlocutory injunction before arrivi ng at a concluded view as to whether t o maintain the reporting restriction ord er. I should also record that the court order incorrectly fails to identify section 4(2) as the jurisdiction under which the reporting restriction order was made. [6 ] Mr O\u2019Donoghue QC and Mr Girvan appe ared on beha lf of the plaintiff instructed by Johnsons. Mr S impson QC and Mr Scherbel - Ball appeared on behalf of the defendants instructed by C & J Bla ck. I am grateful to counsel for their ass istance in relation to the complex legal is sues and to both firms of solic itors for the meticulous way in which the factual issues were addressed and for the orderly preparation of the voluminous papers. Further introductory matters (a) The interlocutory injunction which the p laintiff seeks [7] As originally framed the ord er which the plaintiff sought was to compel the defendants \u201cto both remove and to take s teps to prevent the further broadca st or publication \u2026 of the two Spotlight progra mmes \u201d. However, there is material in the Spotlight programmes which does not suggest corruption on the part of the pl aintiff and about which the plaintiff could not complain. Furthermore, the desired requirement on the BBC \u201cto take steps\u201d s uggests that what was being sought wa s an interlocutory mandatory injun ction rather than a prohibito ry injunction. The reason for the suggestion that the BBC should \u201ctake steps\u201d is c ontained elsewhere in the plaintiff\u2019s application in that the two Spotlight programmes are available on YouTube in breach of the BBC\u2019s copyright. Initially , it was suggeste d that the BBC should be compelled to require You Tube to remove the two Spotli ght programmes by commencing proceedings again st YouTube if necessary. I was subs equently informed that the plaintiffs did not seek such an order , b ut rather that the order soug ht was to prevent or prohibit the BBC from re - broadcas ting the two Spotlight programmes.
