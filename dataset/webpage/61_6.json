This analysis was holistic, moving from an overview of specific components with their basic characteristics to understanding the whole system and environment (Crawley & Aho, 1999). As could be expected, the analysis revealed large variability in the selected project schools with respect to multiple parameters including characteristics of physical localities, curriculum orientation; occupation characteristics; operational patterns; management approaches; building and energy use elements and typologies. Such diversity is also a reflection of the variability of the national education systems, which vary widely in terms of structure and curricular content (UNESCO Institute for Statistics n.d.). The national education systems of different European countries also feature diverse approaches with respect to the way funds and other deliverables are distributed (European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice, 2019; Pedreschi, 2020). Despite these differences, the ENERGE project aims to develop a generalized framework (though adaptable for specific conditions) for achieving energy efficiency that can be applicable across diverse national and regional contexts.\n\nThe building stock across the project schools varied greatly in many different aspects including heating provision (local boilers using gas, kerosene or woodchip, use of district heating, etc.), building fabric (stonework, blockwork, prefabricated units, single-glazed windows, triple-glazed windows, etc.), and other aspects. The curriculum orientation type of the project schools included general/classic (e.g., Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands), technically oriented (e.g., Luxembourg), agricultural (e.g., France), and scientific (e.g., Germany). There was also presence of the vocational element (e.g., Luxembourg, France, Germany), which meant good acquaintance with technical and energy-related subjects. To account for differences in curricula, interventions aimed to improve energy efficiency should account for the fact that there will be a range of knowledge among the staff and student cohorts.\n\nOwnership structures varied between countries. The Diocese of Galway was stated as the school building owner of Col\u00e1iste \u00c9inde (Ireland), while for the second Irish school (Seamount College Kinvara), the owner was the Department of Education. In Luxembourg, all three schools were owned by the Administration des B\u00e2timents Public or the public building administration, affiliated to the central government. For the French schools, school ownership was at a regional level\u2014at the regional council of Centre-Val de Loire. Ownership rested at a local (city) level with schools in the Netherlands, where schools have large autonomy. In the two Dutch schools, the school owners were vo Haaglanden (the secondary education board in Hague region) and Stichting Boor & Gemeente Rotterdam. In Germany, the city administration of Trier owned Max-Planck-Gymnasium Trier gymnasium and the district administration of Eifelkreis Bitburg-Pr\u00fcm owned Berufsbildende Schule Pr\u00fcm. In all project schools, budget allocation for school maintenance was executed by school owners.\n\nThe sizes of the project school populations, inclusive of students and staff, varied from 500 to several thousand people (Fig. 1). Interventions which focus on overall change across the school cohort should consider the varying level of effort which may be required to apply an intervention due to different school size levels. Purely quantitative differences in the school population may also lead to differences in school interactions and population segments (for a review of the effects of school size on school practice and outcomes, see Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2007).\n\nFig. 1 School population in the project schools Full size image\n\nThe project schools demonstrated a certain level of variance with respect to their operational days and hours (Fig. 2a, b). The term \u201cschool operational days\u201d refers to the annual duration of the school operation, starting from the official staff planning event at the beginning of the school year until the end of the school year (when final teaching classes are held), excluding weekend days and recognized holiday periods. It is clear from Fig. 2a that the project schools in France and Ireland have fewer operational days, which could affect energy consumption. However, the difference mainly refers to summertime when energy consumption is generally lower (low/no heating requirement). This is evident from analysis of monthly energy consumption (for both electrical and heating energy) in all project schools over several years. For example, to illustrate this point, energy consumption in the Lyc\u00e9e Gaudier Brzeska (France) in July 2019 was almost 8 times lower than in January 2019. The same pattern applies to all other project schools. This offsets the difference in energy consumption caused by the variation in operational days. The minor influence of operational days can be also confirmed by comparing energy consumption in some project schools. For instance, the Berufsbildende Schule Pr\u00fcm (Germany), which has less operational days and smaller GIA than the OSG Hugo de Groot (Netherlands), demonstrates higher specific energy consumption.\n\nFig. 2 Operational days (a) and hours (b) in the project schools Full size image\n\nThe term \u201cschool operational hours\u201d refers to the number of hours the school remains operational during each working day, starting from the morning arrival of the first personnel to the time all staff and students have left the school, but does not include boarding school activities (i.e., late-evening/night operation). Actual school operational hours might feature very diverse and complex patterns associated with mixed use of school buildings, including activities of after-school clubs and volunteer organizations, parent meetings, school theatrical performances, etc. These complex operational patterns mean that any energy efficiency measures focusing on out-of-hours energy checks should accommodate these differences.\n\nThe context analysis revealed various dichotomies in educational contexts of the project countries, like levels of centralization/control vs levels of autonomy/independence. For instance, despite a general trend for increasing school autonomy in Europe, there are still significant differences between countries. While some countries (e.g., Netherlands, Estonia, Finland) grant a high degree of autonomy to secondary schools for managing financial and human resources, in other countries (e.g., Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Turkey), schools have very limited or no freedom in this area (OECD, 2013). This variation between countries is dynamic both at temporal (i.e., could vary over time) and geographic levels (i.e., subject on specific location). Therefore, the project schools featured a varying level of managerial autonomy. For instance, the Irish schools (or their management boards) and Gymnasium Haganum (Netherlands) are responsible for their own maintenance. For the French, German, and Luxembourgish schools and one Dutch school (OSG Hugo de Groot), the responsibility for the maintenance of their schools lies with specialized technical agencies. These diverse maintenance patterns can affect the applicability of both managerial and technical interventions; some schools may not be able to easily adjust maintenance, operational, or managerial procedures where inefficiencies are detected.\n\nThe project schools present with varying annual energy consumption values due to characteristics which are unique to each school. This is not an uncommon result when comparing energy consumption or efficiency across various buildings; to tackle this, there are many ways in which to report energy consumption figures. For instance, variables which can affect energy efficiency key performance indicators (KPIs) include floor area (as detailed above); occupancy rates; occupancy hours per year; building use; building characteristics such as construction, age, and orientation; external weather (typically corrected using degree days (DD)); and more. The authors of this paper have spent considerable time focusing on the selection of appropriate KPIs (which will be presented in a separate paper due to the complex nature of the topic).\n\nFor the purpose of this paper, energy efficiency is reported based on the gross internal area of each school (Fig. 3). With respect to total annual energy consumption per GIA, the highest value of this parameter was observed at the Lycee Technique du Centre (Luxembourg) and the lowest at the Col\u00e1iste \u00c9inde (Ireland). Lyc\u00e9e Technique du Centre (LTC) provides an interesting case study in terms of relatively high energy consumption. This could be attributed to several factors. Each year, LTC hosts 3600 students and apprentices with more than 800 candidates enrolled in adult courses, all supervised by 340 teachers (Da Cruz Antunes, 2019). This provides the largest school population and the highest student-to-staff ratio among all project schools. This is within a GIA of 23,971 m2\u2014similar to the GIA of Lyc\u00e9e Gaudier-Brzeska (France), which has a much smaller school population. The main building dates to 1965 and was modestly renovated in 1985. The school building structure is divided into three different blocks and six departments. Since the school specializes in such areas as engineering, mechanics, optics, and numerous fields of professional training, all departments have a lot of energy-intensive facilities, like workshop rooms, IT sections, laboratories, chemistry sections, etc. Significantly, the school also has a swimming pool, a large sports center, and a festival hall. The electrical system caters for lighting, circulating pumps, ventilation, cooking and kitchen appliances, IT equipment, and large workshop machines. The lighting system comprises thin fluorescent tubes with the following power specifications: 2 \u00d7 49 W tubes for workshops, 4 \u00d7 18 W tubes for classrooms, and 4 \u00d7 28 W tubes for corridors (there are 117 available rooms in the school). These lighting devices are often not able to respond to presence detectors. Three large areas of the school are ventilated, including the swimming pool (with a volume flow of 9500 m3/h), the workshops (with a volume flow of 14,000 m3/h), and the festival hall (with a volume flow of 15,000 m3/h). The LTC heating system uses three large fuel oil tanks with a total volume of 90,000 L. In addition, three fuel oil combustion plants operate in the school, two with a maximum output of 1400 kW each and one with 1970 kW. All premises are heated by radiators with valves positioned in fixed control positions. Therefore, the combination of these factors, i.e., a modestly renovated building, a significant school population and relatively smaller GIA (as compared to other project schools), abundance of energy-intensive facilities (e.g., a swimming pool) and dated energy systems, provides the high level of energy consumption in this school. This example also illustrates how the interdependence of such factors could determine the large diversity of energy consumption values among the project schools. It is pertinent to mention here that some of the factors influencing school building energy consumption may not render a direct impact on such consumption. For example, according to Hoos et al. (2016), the final heat energy consumption in schools does not directly correlate with school building age due to subsequent partial or full renovation.\n\nFig. 3 Annual total consumption of energy (electrical and heating energy) per square meter of gross internal area (GIA) in the project schools by energy and fuel type. GIA is defined as the total useable school floor area (classrooms, storerooms, utility rooms, inside walls, corridors, etc.), measured to the internal face of the perimeter (outside) walls of school building(s), excluding these outside walls Full size image\n\nAs discussed in the \u201cMethods\u201d section, it was of interest to compare at least some of the project schools with other corresponding schools at the national level. In order to perform this, the project partners obtained a dataset on energy consumption in over 400 Irish schools (Fig. 4). Energy consumption was measured as a ratio (kWh/m2/year) of total primary energy requirement (TPER) to gross internal area (GIA). These schools were segmented into the following three categories: (a) schools with low use of energy; (b) schools with medium use of energy; and (c) schools with high use of energy. This categorization was based on the research by Hoos et al. (2016). The mean value of energy use for this sample was about 120 kWh/m2/year. The analysis reveals that the bulk of the sampled schools in Ireland is within low- (n = 188) and average-energy users (n = 184), which nevertheless may mean that they could benefit from various energy efficiency measures.\n\nFig. 4 Energy consumption in 408 Irish schools Full size image\n\nWith respect to school maintenance and infrastructural operational issues, as well as the greatest challenges/barriers to their resolution, the project schools primarily noted the following issues:\n\nFinancing issues (a lack of financing; a difficulty of seeking funding from national institutions; incremental character of financing, which arrives in installments and thus covers only specific areas)\n\nListed property type of building\n\nFinding proper entities who perform infrastructural maintenance in schools\n\nSome schools reported a lack of substantial sustainability-related programs, or that such programs could be sporadic and involve small initiatives, such as reduction in plastic use and teaching sustainability in chemistry/physics classes (e.g., telling students to bring their own bottles). Comfort and thermal comfort surveys were not commonly found to occur in the project schools, and when they did, they were not applied consistently. For instance, one school management board conducts a survey every 2 years. This survey includes a question about how students rate the indoor climate on the scale from 1 to 5. However, the survey did not ask about (thermal) comfort in buildings directly, but rather about the general social atmosphere. There were also issues with electricity use measurements and controls (e.g., fragmented character of reporting; metering logistics issues; issues connected with the change in energy suppliers and interrelationships with them; etc.).\n\nPower-versus-interest grid method of stakeholder analysis\n\nUsing the methodology of the power-vs-interest grid exercise, the members of the ENERGE Committee mapped the stakeholders, related to energy use at their homes (Fig. 5a) and their schools (Fig. 5b). The power-vs-interest grid exercise for stakeholder classification helped to improve the students\u2019 capacity for mental modeling in comparison with simply brainstorming lists of possible stakeholders. It identified new stakeholders (e.g., guest speakers in schools, green school committee) and stimulated students\u2019 ability to recognize complex relationships between stakeholders. Members of the ENERGE Committee were able to see a variability inside bigger groups, thus segmenting larger groups of stakeholders into separate stakeholders with different power/interest statuses (e.g., adults that \u201care and are not the bill payers\u201d at home). With the help of the grid, they could also \u201cfine-tune\u201d stakeholder mapping with respect to their perceived power/interest statuses. It is worth paying attention that, in the school environment, \u201cteachers\u201d were considered to have more power than the \u201cgovernment\u201d and more interest in the issue than the \u201cDepartment of Education.\u201d This demonstrates a sometimes misplaced perception regarding the level of autonomy of individual schools. The ENERGE Committee members identified that the power/interest boundaries between some stakeholders could be fuzzy (e.g., architects/designers for schools). They also recognized that stakeholder mapping with respect to power/interest status in the system is an intricate task, which depends on multiple considerations and viewpoints.\n\nFig. 5 Power-vs-interest mapping of stakeholders related to energy use at home (a) and school (b) by members of the ENERGE Committee. Some stakeholders are viewed as occupying transboundary positions Full size image\n\nIn addition to its conceptual value, the exercise has a practical value. Usually, \u201ccrowd\u201d stakeholders are monitored on a regular basis; \u201csubjects\u201d need to be completely informed; \u201ccontext setters\u201d must be kept satisfied by anticipating their needs, while \u201cplayers\u201d need to be thoroughly managed. If, for instance, the interest and power status of stakeholders is unclear, this may impede interventions within the project. In this case, effective tools, such as communication, commitments, social norms, or social diffusion, may not work effectively. For example, commitment (i.e., getting a verbal or written pledge to perform some behavior(s)) is directly related to a person\u2019s interest (McKenzie-Mohr, 2020). If a person is not interested, it may not be efficient to heavily engage resources in commitment\u2014particularly if they also lack power. Therefore, knowledge of the power/interest status of stakeholders helps to fine-tune related strategies in the project realization.\n\nAnother case of power-vs-interest grid exercise methodology application for the analysis of non-school stakeholders pertinent to energy use in the project schools was among the project partners, who represented various project countries. Figure 6 shows the results of mapping such stakeholders by the project partners.\n\nFig. 6 Power-vs-interest mapping of non-school stakeholders related to energy use in schools by the project partners Full size image\n\nThis resulted in several important conclusions about the non-school stakeholders. Firstly, project partners, like the students in the previous exercise, were able to see a variability inside bigger stakeholder groups, thus segmenting larger groups of stakeholders into separate stakeholders with different power/interest statuses. Secondly, the project partners could adjust mapping stakeholders with respect to their perceived power/interest statuses and in relation to one another. They managed to see that some stakeholders could hold a transboundary position on the grid, which complicated the assigning of stakeholders to specific categories. Thirdly, another important result was that the project partners revealed the presence of inter-regional variability in assessing stakeholders. It became clear that the positions of some stakeholders with respect to their power and interest in the focal issue may vary, subject to a specific project country. Some stakeholders may be present in certain countries, but may not operate in other countries, while different stakeholders may perform identical or similar functions in various countries. For instance, regional educational authorities, which are strong in France and Northern Ireland, are not as prominent in Ireland, where their functions are managed either on the central or local level. This may pose a certain challenge for formalization of key stakeholders within the ENERGE project. It was also recommended to (a) establish a participation group of diverse stakeholders, which could broadly represent the focal issue to further analyze stakeholders, and (b) rely on a viable methodology for further stakeholder assessment. The latter could include such methods as focus groups (Morgan, 1998), value network analysis (Allee, 2008), and other methodologies.\n\nStakeholder analysis survey\n\nThe implications of the stakeholder assessment survey for further research are multifaceted. The survey generated data for several important areas of school-based stakeholder interactions with energy. Figure 7a highlights the relation of school personnel to energy-related activities by answering the following question: \u201cAre you engaged in any of the following energy-related activities within the school?\u201d It is of interest that a modest number of the respondents deal with energy saving and conservation (42 responses out of 166, which make up less than 30% of the respondents). However, a larger amount of school personnel (about 40%) are engaged in energy-related education.\n\nFig. 7 Stakeholder analysis survey results: (a) engagement of school personnel in energy-related activities (question: \u201cAre you engaged in any of the following energy-related activities within the school?\u201d) and (b) perception of control (locus of control) with respect to some comfort, environmental, and school operation issues (question: \u201cIn your opinion, do you have an opportunity to change or influence any of the following in school?\u201d) Full size image\n\nFigure 7b shows how respondents perceive the level of their control (locus of control) over some comfort, environmental, and school operation issues by answering the following question: \u201cIn your opinion, do you have an opportunity to change or influence any of the following in school?\u201d The highest level of control is perceived to be over lighting in classrooms (125 positive responses out of 166, which account for about 75%), while the lowest level of control is over water usage in schools (47 positive responses out of 166, which account for less than 30%). In general, the level of control over other issues is not high and could average at around 50%.\n\nThe survey demonstrated how often the respondents performed concrete energy-related activities (question: \u201cHow often do you perform the following activities in school?\u201d; Table 1). The highest level of regularity in performance of the activities is shown in activity 5 (\u201cTurn off the lights when I leave the classroom or other school room, which won\u2019t be occupied after me\u201d). The lowest level of performance is demonstrated in relation to activity 4 (\u201cAsk other experts to tell me more about energy and how to save it\u201d). As alluded to before, it is known that those who engage in self-reporting tend to over-report environmental-conscious behavior. Different literature sources and case studies confirm that the level of over-reporting could be by several orders of magnitude (McKenzie-Mohr, 2020).\n\nTable 1 Frequency of performance of energy-related activities by the respondents Full size table\n\nThe data on stakeholder duties, energy-related activities, relevant communication patterns, and loci of control (with respect to energy use) suggest that school personnel could be roughly subdivided into the following four distinct (though possibly intersecting) categories:\n\n1) School personnel that show a high degree of interest and activity in energy use and saving, which might be regular learners about energy saving and those asking other experts to tell them more about energy and its saving. The latter might be related to their professional jobs in school energy system maintenance and management. 2) Casual (routine) and regular performers of energy-saving activities. These activities might be small in effect but quite regular (both conscious and unconscious). Of course, as it was stated before, the regularity of performing these activities might be over-stated and affected by other factors. 3) Occasional performers of the energy-saving activities. This group might be prospective for energy efficiency\u2013targeted projects. It is worthwhile to elucidate which factors block the school personnel from performing these activities regularly and then to address these factors via interventions. 4) Non-performers. There is a cohort of the school population that is not interested in energy use/saving and is not engaged in energy-saving activities. The important questions are why this negligence and non-performance happen and what can be done to tackle them.\n\nEnergy literacy\n\nWithin the ENERGE project, energy literacy encompasses not only the cognitive domain, but also the affective and behavioral characteristics\u2014enabling citizens to think critically, solve problems, and make informed decisions about energy (Solomon, 1992). These three domains make up the essence of the ENERGE energy literacy model (Fig. 8).\n\nFig. 8 ENERGE energy literacy model Full size image\n\nSince the development of the elements of the model shown on Fig. 9 requires enduring efforts, the implementation of energy literacy modules, to supplement existing school curricula for students aged 12\u201318, can contribute primarily to the long-term impacts. ENERGE offers practical and affordable energy and building climate-related educational materials that are compliant with STEM curricula. This allows teachers to educate their students in science and technology\u2013related topics using real-life data from the school building and its context, allowing for a more engaging and less abstract learning experience. At the same time, the students\u2019 experiments in energy efficiency and indoor climate improvement strategies can result in a decrease in the energy use of the school and can allow school management to make evidence-based decisions on investments on energy efficiency measures. Therefore, the ENERGE project positions itself between a tool of building energy management and a resource of educational materials, thus bridging both domains.\n\nFig. 9 The ENERGE framework of energy efficiency in schools Full size image\n\nInitial piloting of the ENERGE literacy modules, units, and activities in the project schools resulted in several recommendations. Firstly, it was recommended to broaden the scope of the ENERGE educational materials to address sustainability and energy and include related topics like water, waste, or circular economy. The interviews with the project school principals and teachers highlighted that there was a preference for implementing interdisciplinary STEM-related topics. Secondly, educational materials need to be matched with the skills and competences of each specific age group. Not only age but also education level needs to be considered when designing the ENERGE educational propositions. For instance, general and vocational education address different student learning outcomes. Moreover, the ENERGE educational materials need to align with national curriculum. In the targeted countries, two types of curricula are evident, the common core curriculum and differentiated curriculum. Thirdly, it is important that appropriate support is available for teacher professional learning to design and implement these educational materials, as teachers are key influencers on student engagement and learning.\n\nKey informant interviews with school management boards/administration\n\nInterviews with the project school management boards/administration and teachers were instrumental in generating important insights. The question \u201cHave you currently implemented energy efficiency solutions at your school(s)?\u201d demonstrated the lack of systemic and consistent approaches to energy efficiency. Schools highlighted activities such as infrastructural changes (e.g., new windows, LED lights), the establishment of green/eco teams in the schools, and some behavioral change strategies (e.g., using energy-saving prompts, PCs in standby mode, visiting energy management training by administration officials, etc.). One of the project schools pointed to the controversy between the need to implement energy-saving steps (\u201cplans to set up the computers to turn off automatically\u201d) and the inconvenience of such practices (\u201cteachers said they [PCs] took too long to start up in the mornings\u201d).\n\nThe answers to the question \u201cWho decides on taking energy efficiency measures and the selection of providers/installers?\u201d confirmed the importance of senior administration of the schools, i.e., the board of management and principals, at the local (school) level. However, the decisive roles were played by the government or national education authorities. The question about 5-year expenditures on energy efficiency measures revealed that the activities directly related to energy saving (e.g., new window installations) were often funded on the basis of health and safety needs, rather than energy saving.\n\nA panorama of responses was obtained when the interviewees answered the question \u201cDo you currently use educational materials to educate students on energy, energy efficiency and/or sustainability? If yes, what materials do you use and where did you obtain them?\u201d Firstly, such educational materials are based on curriculum, but are often developed by the teachers themselves. Secondly, there was an evident shortage of such materials and some issues with resourcing them. Thirdly, there can be a student contribution in the preparation of these materials. Finally, the specific focus on energy efficiency seems either rare or non-existent; the materials mostly cover general topics, like energy use, renewables, and sustainability. There is good potential for the ENERGE to provide educational materials to improve energy literacy in schools.\n\nWhen reacting to different statements in the questionnaire, the interviewees provided valuable feedback. There a definite lack of clear-cut strategies and the required knowledge of formulating such strategies for making schools carbon neutral in the foreseeable future. All interviewees unanimously confirm the absence of sufficient funding to make school buildings healthy and energy neutral as they \u201chave to fight for everything\u201d and experience a \u201chuge gap\u201d with financing. The process of funding was described in the following ways: \u201cIt is always challenging to get funding for anything. Projects need to have a short payback and save money in order to have a better chance of getting funded.\u201d and \u201cSeeking funding takes a lot of work, the schools need to \u2018play the game\u2019 and chase the source of funding.\u201d Such experience was not surprising, since, according to Eurostat data, in the period 2010\u20132019, the average general government expenditure on education as a ratio to GDP follows a decreasing trend (Eurostat 2022). While answering the question \u201cSchool buildings should be used as living labs for teaching students on water, energy, waste etc.\u201d, the interviewees marked the difficulty of getting student buy-in for such approaches. The vital role of family and parents was highlighted since the school cannot drive this transition to carbon neutrality alone.\n\nImportant results were generated when the interviewees were asked to assess preferable outcomes from the ENERGE project. The interviewees marked the importance of both key components of ENERGE, i.e., energy literacy education and data-based energy management. On the one hand, its educational component is paramount. On the other hand, ENERGE can give an opportunity \u201cto get real-time insight in the energy performance and comfort of their school building, enabling evidence-based decision making on energy efficiency measures and tracking the impact of implemented measures.\u201d However, it all depends on the practicality of ENERGE in both components as the educational component should produce important knowledge and skills, while the energy management component should make real savings and facilitate energy monitoring. As such, the interviewees suggest to \u201cmarket\u201d ENERGE as a holistic, all-in-one and continuous approach. Moreover, among some interviewees, there is a perception of an energy efficiency approach as a top-down, technology-driven, and totally deterministic tool where the role of schools is passive and active engagement of school building occupants is not pivotal, which is also governed by tight budgets of the schools. As one of the interviewees remarked: \u201c\u2026energy-efficiency plans need to be integrated into the school, not bolted on. It should be done by teachers in a bottom up approach from the students right up to the management level.\u201d\n\nThe interviewees confirmed the vitality of stakeholders in energy efficiency, in general, and in the project realization, in particular:\n\nYou need to have the right person on the ground to drive it. You need someone that is naturally motivated to put in the effort to motivate others, otherwise it probably wouldn\u2019t get used. Also, some of the teachers feel that they do not know enough to be educating the students on energy efficiency. They would need training on energy efficiency and sustainability in order to feel comfortable enough to work with the students and answer their questions. A network of teachers would be useful so that teachers from different schools can talk to each other and offer tips and tricks for engaging with the students.\n\nTo this extent, building relationships between various stakeholders, for example, between teachers and students in different countries or between schools and universities, is paramount.\n\nENERGE energy efficiency framework for schools\n\nFigure 9 visualizes the ENERGE energy efficiency framework for schools. The ENERGE framework builds on the above methodological and research contributions and consists of the eight key elements, each of which can generate vital outcomes (\u201cclouds\u201d on Fig. 9). Each of these elements implies a set of methods, tools, and techniques aimed at directly or indirectly influencing energy efficiency in schools. All elements are interlinked. For instance, the proprietary energy- and IEQ-monitoring ENERGE Digital Platform provides actionable insights about energy and buildings, but it can also be used to raise energy literacy by engaging students in energy-monitoring exercises, so it has a pedagogical as well as a practical value.\n\nIt is pertinent to single out several important interlinking features that distinguish this framework from other approaches described in the literature review. Firstly, the framework strongly relies on sociological studies, especially on different types of stakeholder analysis (box 1, Fig. 9), which should become an indispensable part of approaching the issue of raising energy efficiency in schools. Secondly, there is a significant focus on participation, collaboration, engagement, empowerment, and community building, including on a cross-country basis (boxes 4 and 5, Fig. 9). Moreover, this collaboration permeates all elements of the framework, including the Digital Platform operation (box 2, Fig. 3) and energy literacy development (box 3, Fig. 9). The framework confirms that energy efficiency is not only a technological challenge, but also a personal and social issue requiring a thorough understanding of various characteristics of relevant stakeholders and engaging them in collaborative efforts. Thirdly, special care is given to raising energy literacy, which demonstrates rigor, consistency, and active consultations with various stakeholders. The elements on intervention strategies (box 8, Fig. 9) and business scenario development are beyond the scope of this publication as the ENERGE project is still in progress, while the stages of interventions and post-project maintenance will be reported separately due to the large volume of generated materials and longitudinal character of these elements."}, {"url": "https://www.ethnologue.com/", "page_content": "This graph shows the profile of languages in the world with respect to their level of language vitality.\n\nInstitutional \u2014 The language has been developed to the point that it is used and sustained by institutions beyond the home and community.\n\nStable \u2014 The language is not being sustained by formal institutions, but it is still the norm in the home and community that all children learn and use the language.\n\nEndangered \u2014 It is no longer the norm that children learn and use this language.\n\nExtinct - The language is no longer used and no one retains a sense of ethnic identity associated with the language.\n\nThese four summary levels have been derived by grouping levels in the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS), which is the more fine-grained scale that Ethnologue uses to assess the status of every language in terms of development versus endangerment; see Language Status for a description of the levels of that scale.

During this period, French citizens radically altered their political landscape, uprooting centuries-old institutions such as the monarchy and the feudal system. The upheaval was caused by disgust with the French aristocracy and the economic policies of King Louis XVI, who met his death by guillotine, as did his wife Marie Antoinette. Though it degenerated into a bloodbath during the Reign of Terror, the French Revolution helped to shape modern democracies by showing the power inherent in the will of the people.\n\nCauses of the French Revolution\n\nAs the 18th century drew to a close, France\u2019s costly involvement in the American Revolution, combined with extravagant spending by King Louis XVI, had left France on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nNot only were the royal coffers depleted, but several years of poor harvests, drought, cattle disease and skyrocketing bread prices had kindled unrest among peasants and the urban poor. Many expressed their desperation and resentment toward a regime that imposed heavy taxes\u2014yet failed to provide any relief\u2014by rioting, looting and striking.\n\nIn the fall of 1786, Louis XVI\u2019s controller general, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, proposed a financial reform package that included a universal land tax from which the aristocratic classes would no longer be exempt.\n\nEstates General\n\nTo garner support for these measures and forestall a growing aristocratic revolt, the king summoned the Estates General (les \u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux) \u2013 an assembly representing France\u2019s clergy, nobility and middle class \u2013 for the first time since 1614.\n\nThe meeting was scheduled for May 5, 1789; in the meantime, delegates of the three estates from each locality would compile lists of grievances (cahiers de dol\u00e9ances) to present to the king.\n\nRise of the Third Estate\n\nFrance\u2019s population, of course, had changed considerably since 1614. The non-aristocratic, middle-class members of the Third Estate now represented 98 percent of the people but could still be outvoted by the other two bodies.\n\nIn the lead-up to the May 5 meeting, the Third Estate began to mobilize support for equal representation and the abolishment of the noble veto\u2014in other words, they wanted voting by head and not by status.\n\nWhile all of the orders shared a common desire for fiscal and judicial reform as well as a more representative form of government, the nobles in particular were loath to give up the privileges they had long enjoyed under the traditional system.\n\nTennis Court Oath\n\nBy the time the Estates General convened at Versailles, the highly public debate over its voting process had erupted into open hostility between the three orders, eclipsing the original purpose of the meeting and the authority of the man who had convened it \u2014 the king himself.\n\nOn June 17, with talks over procedure stalled, the Third Estate met alone and formally adopted the title of National Assembly; three days later, they met in a nearby indoor tennis court and took the so-called Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), vowing not to disperse until constitutional reform had been achieved.\n\nWithin a week, most of the clerical deputies and 47 liberal nobles had joined them, and on June 27 Louis XVI grudgingly absorbed all three orders into the new National Assembly.\n\nThe Bastille\n\nOn June 12, as the National Assembly (known as the National Constituent Assembly during its work on a constitution) continued to meet at Versailles, fear and violence consumed the capital.\n\nThough enthusiastic about the recent breakdown of royal power, Parisians grew panicked as rumors of an impending military coup began to circulate. A popular insurgency culminated on July 14 when rioters stormed the Bastille fortress in an attempt to secure gunpowder and weapons; many consider this event, now commemorated in France as a national holiday, as the start of the French Revolution.\n\nThe wave of revolutionary fervor and widespread hysteria quickly swept the entire country. Revolting against years of exploitation, peasants looted and burned the homes of tax collectors, landlords and the aristocratic elite.\n\nKnown as the Great Fear (la Grande peur), the agrarian insurrection hastened the growing exodus of nobles from France and inspired the National Constituent Assembly to abolish feudalism on August 4, 1789, signing what historian Georges Lefebvre later called the \u201cdeath certificate of the old order.\u201d\n\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\n\nIIn late August, the Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (D\u00e9claration des droits de l\u2019homme et du citoyen), a statement of democratic principles grounded in the philosophical and political ideas of Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nThe document proclaimed the Assembly\u2019s commitment to replace the ancien r\u00e9gime with a system based on equal opportunity, freedom of speech, popular sovereignty and representative government.\n\nDrafting a formal constitution proved much more of a challenge for the National Constituent Assembly, which had the added burden of functioning as a legislature during harsh economic times.\n\nFor months, its members wrestled with fundamental questions about the shape and expanse of France\u2019s new political landscape. For instance, who would be responsible for electing delegates? Would the clergy owe allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church or the French government? Perhaps most importantly, how much authority would the king, his public image further weakened after a failed attempt to flee the country in June 1791, retain?\n\nAdopted on September 3, 1791, France\u2019s first written constitution echoed the more moderate voices in the Assembly, establishing a constitutional monarchy in which the king enjoyed royal veto power and the ability to appoint ministers. This compromise did not sit well with influential radicals like Maximilien de Robespierre, Camille Desmoulins and Georges Danton, who began drumming up popular support for a more republican form of government and for the trial of Louis XVI.\n\nFrench Revolution Turns Radical\n\nIn April 1792, the newly elected Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria and Prussia, where it believed that French \u00e9migr\u00e9s were building counterrevolutionary alliances; it also hoped to spread its revolutionary ideals across Europe through warfare.\n\nOn the domestic front, meanwhile, the political crisis took a radical turn when a group of insurgents led by the extremist Jacobins attacked the royal residence in Paris and arrested the king on August 10, 1792.\n\nThe following month, amid a wave of violence in which Parisian insurrectionists massacred hundreds of accused counterrevolutionaries, the Legislative Assembly was replaced by the National Convention, which proclaimed the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the French republic.\n\nOn January 21, 1793, it sent King Louis XVI, condemned to death for high treason and crimes against the state, to the guillotine; his wife Marie-Antoinette suffered the same fate nine months later.\n\nReign of Terror\n\nFollowing the king\u2019s execution, war with various European powers and intense divisions within the National Convention brought the French Revolution to its most violent and turbulent phase.\n\nIn June 1793, the Jacobins seized control of the National Convention from the more moderate Girondins and instituted a series of radical measures, including the establishment of a new calendar and the eradication of Christianity.\n\nThey also unleashed the bloody Reign of Terror (la Terreur), a 10-month period in which suspected enemies of the revolution were guillotined by the thousands. Many of the killings were carried out under orders from Robespierre, who dominated the draconian Committee of Public Safety until his own execution on July 28, 1794.\n\nDid you know? Over 17,000 people were officially tried and executed during the Reign of Terror, and an unknown number of others died in prison or without trial.\n\nThermidorian Reaction\n\nThe death of Robespierre marked the beginning of the Thermidorian Reaction, a moderate phase in which the French people revolted against the Reign of Terror\u2019s excesses.\n\nOn August 22, 1795, the National Convention, composed largely of Girondins who had survived the Reign of Terror, approved a new constitution that created France\u2019s first bicameral legislature.\n\nExecutive power would lie in the hands of a five-member Directory (Directoire) appointed by parliament. Royalists and Jacobins protested the new regime but were swiftly silenced by the army, now led by a young and successful general named Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nFrench Revolution Ends: Napoleon\u2019s Rise\n\nThe Directory\u2019s four years in power were riddled with financial crises, popular discontent, inefficiency and, above all, political corruption. By the late 1790s, the directors relied almost entirely on the military to maintain their authority and had ceded much of their power to the generals in the field.\n\nOn November 9, 1799, as frustration with their leadership reached a fever pitch, Napoleon Bonaparte staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, abolishing the Directory and appointing himself France\u2019s \u201cfirst consul.\u201d The event marked the end of the French Revolution and the beginning of the Napoleonic era, during which France would come to dominate much of continental Europe.\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nMarie Antoinette was an Austrian princess who married Louis XVI, then the Dauphin of France, at the age of 14. Her extravagant lifestyle made her an unpopular figure and symbol of the monarchy's decadence. On July 14, 1789, a group of Parisian revolutionaries seized the Bastille prison in a dramatic act of protest against King Louis XVI. The storming of the Bastille was the symbolic start of the French Revolution. At the height of the French Revolution, Louis XVI was tried before the National Convention and convicted of high treason. He was executed by guillotine on January 21, 1793. Georges Jacques Danton was an early leader of the French Revolution. He was executed by guillotine in 1794 during the Reign of Terror. Fireworks burst over Paris' Eiffel Tower during traditional Bastille Day celebrations on July 14, 2009.

Among all selenoproteins, the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) family plays a critical role in many redox responses involved in male reproduction. The key function of these enzymatic isoforms is to defend and guard the cells by catalyzing the reduction of organic hydroperoxides (via glutathione), hydrogen peroxide (H), and lipid peroxides from oxidative stress as described above. Many of these are tissue-specific and seems to be expressed in sex-specific manners [ 124 ] as discussed below.\n\nThe significance of GPX4 is illustrated by the death in GPX4 homozygous embryonic mice (KO) after a specific target disruption to GPX4. However, heterozygote mice in gestational stage were unremarkably alive and were born as healthy looking fertile pups [ 129 ]. This indicates that not only GPX4 is an essential requirement in the early embryo development but also in gametogenesis. For example, Parillo et al., [ 130 ] documented strong expression of GPX4 protein in seminiferous tubules of Chianina bulls at different spermatogenesis stages i.e., spermatogonia, round spermatids, elongated spermatids and cytoplasmic content of maturing sperm. This robust expression of GPX4, while sperm mature at various phases, is consistent with previous physiological findings that GPX4 is crucial for the optimal production and functioning of bovine sperm similar to other mammalian species [ 130 ]. Interestingly, the expression of GPX4 in the acrosomal region has been thought to play anchoring role with zona pellucida, highlighting its significance not only at developmental stages of sperm but during fertilization process [ 130 ].\n\nAdditionally, phospholipid hydroperoxide GSHPx, also known as PHGPx, is highly expressed in testes with antioxidant and structural functions. The structural role is prominent because it accounts for over half of the mitochondrial capsule in the mid-piece of a mature sperm (as an oxidatively inactivated protein) and thus plays a critical role in sperm motion [ 108 ]. For natural conception, motility is one of the key fertility parameters essential to reach the female oocyte for fertilization. GPX4 is thought to shield the sperm from DNA damage caused by oxidative stress in the initial phases of spermatogenesis, in spite of that, in later stages of spermatogenesis it provides sperm mid-piece stability by being a part of the structure of flagellum-surrounding mitochondrial sheath, an important element in providing integrity and motility to sperm [ 125 128 ].\n\nSimilar with the case with GPX4, selenoprotein P (SelenoP) encoded by the SELENOP gene is thought to have pivotal role in the male reproductive functions. It acts as a Se transporting protein and is also present in vesicle structures in the basal region of Sertoli cells [ 131 ]. Sertoli cells are essential in the spermatogenesis process, as not only do they provide anchoring function but also nutrition and endocrine regulation of spermatogenesis in the developing spermatozoa [ 132 ]. Male mice with SeppKO (gene responsible for SelenoP protein production) showed considerable reduction in fertility, lower Se levels, and decreased GPX activity [ 133 ]. These changes suggest that optimal levels of SelenoP are paramount in sperm functions and fertility. Even high Se diet failed to restore the levels of the testicular Se or the normal phenotype of sperm in SeppKO male mice, which again iterates the significance of Se in spermatogenesis [ 131 ].\n\nGPX1 and GPX3 selenoproteins, though less abundant are also present in male reproductive tissues and secretions involved in male reproduction. These are well-expressed and defined in sperm and epididymal epithelial cells [ 134 ]. In some studies, the epididymal parenchyma and maturing sperm are guarded by these two selenoproteins against the oxidative stress [ 134 ]. In addition, GPX3 moves throughout the epididymis lumen with spermatozoa to defend against ROS throughout the maturation process [ 134 ].\n\n5.4. Selenium Supplementation and Male Fertility\n\nSperm maturation is closely associated with sperm quality and ejaculation, as well as reproductive efficacy in males. Any anomalies in these processes may therefore lead to insufficient, lower quality ejaculates, and decreased male fertility [ 135 ]. Increased consumption of Se-enriched food has been shown to improve GPX antioxidants activity, consequently enhancing fertility in males [ 136 ]. For example, Asri-Rezaei et al. [ 137 ] reported the Se concentration in testis in male Mus Musculus mice was significantly increased after intraperitoneal injections of sodium selenite (0.50 mg/kg body weight) and Se-nanoparticles (0.50 mg/kg body weight) daily for 7 days (observation made after the 28th day post-injection). Likewise, the antioxidant biomarker enzyme activities catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) also increased substantially while decreasing the level of the oxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) after Se supplementation.\n\nMost importantly, the parameters of the quality of sperm including gross count and motility in the treatment group was also improved compared to control group [ 137 ]. These findings generally confirm that Se supplementation can have positive impacts on male reproductive health through reduction of oxidative stress. However, currently not a single form of Se supplementation has added value over others and the doses of available Se supplementations beneficial to male reproductive health are highly debatable. Increased intake of Se supplementations may not offer therapeutic benefit and can even reduce the general reproductive potential in males. While increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to oxidative stress, sperm DNA damage and/or apoptosis, membrane peroxidation and decreased sperm motility; an optimal degree of ROS is required to support some essential sperm functions such as capacitation and acrosome reactions [ 138 ].\n\nIncreased ROS levels have been strongly associated with infertility [ 139 ]. Thus, for the optimal functioning of sperm, establishing an equilibrium of Se in the body is important in redox control of male reproduction. Changes in Se level have been shown to affect redox status and induce oxidative stress that might negatively affect male fertility by modifying the expression of relevant biological markers and the behavior of antioxidant enzymes. For instance, Kaushal and Bansal [ 140 ] reported that changes in Se levels contributed to oxidative stress through modification of HSP70 protein (heat shock proteins) expressions. Interestingly, a substantial increase in the levels of oxidative stress related markers, including lipid hydroperoxide (LPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ROS, was observed in mice with both Se-deficient (0.02 ppm inorganic Se) and Se-excess diets (1.0 ppm inorganic Se).\n\nThis outcome demonstrates the need to reconsider which Se form should be promoted for supplementation to the public and how much is needed to maintain homeostasis. In an Se-deficient diet, a reduced GPX level has also been observed, whereas Se-excess group showed comparatively high GPX levels [ 141 ]. It is noteworthy that in both categories, the relative markers associated with fertility have decreased significantly [ 140 ]. In another related study, elevated LPO, raised oxidative stress and diminished GPX levels were reported in male mice fed with Se-deficient diets [ 142 ]."}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/3/617", "page_content": "However, the question arises whether this contamination occurs before or during the food packaging or preparation process. The same is true for water. There are many dilemmas regarding microplastics that come from plastic bottles [ 137 ].\n\nBecause of their presence in a large part of the water column, microalgae can interact with a large number of particulate materials of different densities [ 139 ]. In addition, microalgae can adsorb certain small microplastics on their surface and these can cover their pores, leading to a limitation of energy, O/COand nutrient transfers [ 140 ].\n\nVery recently, microplastics have been detected in mineral water contained in plastic bottles. A quantitative study estimated the concentration and number of microplastics smaller than 10 \u00b5m contained in 500 mL plastic bottles. These bottles are made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The scientists analyzed plastic water bottles from 10 different brands. For each brand, 3 bottles were selected, i.e., a total of 30 bottles analyzed. In parallel, three procedural blanks were carried out. The results show the presence of microplastics in all samples. The concentration varies between 3.16 +/\u2212 0.7 particles/L and 1.1 +/\u2212 0.8 particles/L. It is believed that hard plastic bottles would release larger sized fragments [ 138 ] as opposed to easily deformable bottles with an alkaline pH which would release microplastics of smaller sizes but in greater numbers. The most contaminated mineral water is that from plastic bottles of poor quality, i.e., thin and easily deformable [ 87 ].\n\nThe Mediterranean ecosystem is one of the most heavily polluted with plastic, heavy metals, etc. According to a study of 16 brands of table salt marketed in China, the content of MP particles was 550\u2013681 elements/kg in sea salt, 43\u2013364 elements/kg in lake salt and 204 elements/kg in rock salt [ 135 ]. The most common plastic is polyethylene (22.9%) and polypropylene (19.2%) According to another studies, salts are not only contaminated by aquatic sources; in addition, there is a high risk of MP contamination of table salt during the manufacturing process [ 142 143 ].\n\nNew research has shown that microplastics are present in the vast majority of brands of table salt sampled in Africa [ 102 ]. According to a new study by researchers in South Korea, 36 out of 39 brands of salt tested had microplastics in them. Using previous studies on salt, this new effort is the first of its kind to examine the geographic distribution of microplastics in table salt and its correlation with where plastic pollution is found in the environment [ 141 ].\n\nMuch research has been done in recent years into the effects that microplastic contamination has on terrestrial and aquatic systems, but the impact of microplastics on bees in addition to their transfer into hive products is less clear. Unfortunately, in recent years, large losses have been recorded for bee colonies; this fact is worrying considering the ecological importance they have. There are many factors considered incriminating for colony damage (presence of pesticides, parasites, microbial infections, toxic metals) [ 151 152 ], although the potential link between the exposure of bees to microplastics and the damage that can be caused has not yet been sufficiently investigated; this is an assumption that is brought to the attention of future research [ 153 154 ].\n\nIn addition to honey samples, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyacrylamide polymers were also found in beer, milk and soft drinks collected in Ecuador [ 149 ]. In 2017, researchers analyzed five honey samples from Switzerland following a standardized protocol. In the study, they used a microscope to separate fibers and fragments based on their color or transparency. However, to more precisely identify the presence of microplastics, they also used Raman spectroscopy and the FTIR method. The researchers performed procedural blanks and minimized the risk of sample cross-contamination. Most of the fibers detected were identified as cellulose, which is a natural fiber, or PET. The most likely origin is believed to be from textiles [ 150 ].\n\nLikewise, another study conducted on 47 honey samples from supermarkets but also purchased directly from beekeepers in Germany, reported the presence of fibers (10 to 336 fibers/kg) and fragments (from 2 to 82 fragments/kg). The presence of fibers was also observed at the plant level (on average 77.9 \u00b1 19.0%,= 27), which suggests that these foreign particles reach the level of flower nectar, where they are transferred to the hive by bees and from there end up in bee products that humans consume. When discussing synthetic organic fibers, the following are included: polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide and polytetrafluoroethylene. Atmospheric particles can be derived from a variety of sources: sewage, clothing abrasion and the fragmentation of macroplastics in environmental conditions (oxygen, sunlight action, temperature, humidity). This raises the alarm that the environment is increasingly affected by microplastic particles, particles that end up on people\u2019s dinner plates [ 148 149 ].\n\nIn the analysis of 19 honey samples from different geographical areas (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Mexico), non-pollen particles were identified in all the samples studied. Both colored and transparent fibers and particles were detected. To differentiate natural fibers such as cellulose or chitin fibers from synthetic fibers, they were subjected to fuscine and rose bengal staining. Fibers and fragments that are not colored by fuchsia and rose bengal are considered synthetic polymers. The non-pollen particles in all the samples taken in the study had an average fiber value of 166 \u00b1 147/kg honey, and other types of fragments had a number with an average value of 9 \u00b1 9/kg honey [ 147 ].\n\nEven if for a long time it was considered that plastic, implicitly microplastics, has dimensions that cannot cross the physical barriers of intact plant tissue, studies have shown that microplastics and nanoplastics have the significant potential to contaminate plants, for example, wheat () and lettuce (). The small particles penetrate through the roots to the shoots, reaching nectar and pollen [ 145 ]. It is believed that the presence of microplastics can prevent the proper absorption of nutrients and water by plant roots. Thus, microplastics can change the biomass of plants, the characteristics of the roots, but also the microbial activities at the soil level. The smaller the plastic particles, the greater the animal exposure; for example, in the soil, ingesting larger amounts of microplastics could cause damage to the intestinal tract of earthworms and thus reduce their survival. This process could introduce microplastics into the food chain ( Figure 5 ) implicitly affecting not only humans, bees and plants but also the entire soil ecosystem [ 146 ].\n\nThe environment is increasingly invaded by microplastics; they have become ubiquitous, and their presence can be signalized in ecosystems that few think about. An example is to be found in bees for which it has been observed that they can be samplers of microplastics through their presence on the surface of the animal\u2019s body, especially on the edge of the wings and head ( Figure 4 ). For a very long time, bee products and bees have been analyzed in laboratories with the aim of using them as bioindicators for polluting agents. Due to their increased sensitivity and large flight area, bees are considered to be potential models for monitoring environmental quality. In this way, the degree of pollution present in a certain region is evaluated but also the type of pollutant that predominates (pesticides, insecticides, heavy metals). Bees, through their ability to fly many kilometers, penetrate hard-to-reach places and come into contact with all elements of the environment (from the nectar of flowers to the air) to bring pollutants into their hive, where eventually they accumulate and end up in honey and other beehive products. Various polymers have been identified, the most common of which was polyester [ 144 ].\n\nIn studies analyzing the contamination of fish with microplastics in laboratories, it should not be overlooked that these fish generally ingest high concentrations. In addition, most experiments are carried out with spherical microplastics of a predefined size. However, in the environment, microplastics come in a variety of shapes and sizes [ 161 ].\n\nContamination of marine animals with plastic particles can occur through direct ingestion or trophic transfer. For example, when people eat small fish, they eat them whole, including the intestines where the microplastics are found; there is contamination by direct ingestion. On the other hand, trophic transfer, also known as bioaccumulation, exposes humans to chemicals released by microplastics indirectly. More precisely, these chemicals are compounds that enter into the composition of microplastics or persistent pollutants adsorbed by them (pesticides, toxic metals) [ 155 159 ]. These chemicals accumulate in the body from multiple sources. For example, with a crustacean contaminated by direct ingestion of microplastics, the latter may be ingested by a predator that becomes indirectly contaminated. If this predator ingests several contaminated shellfish, the chemicals from the various shellfish will accumulate in its digestive tract. This is called the phenomenon of bioaccumulation [ 160 ]. Therefore, humans may face higher exposure when consuming a marine species whose digestive tract has accumulated a high concentration of these chemical compounds.\n\nSince the toxicity of MPs is mainly related to their ingestion and disruption of energy balance, it seems unlikely that these particles have an impact on gametes and embryos of marine organisms. On the other hand, due to their size and possible translocation capacity, NPs are more likely to interact with these young life stages. There are no available data on the effect of NPs on spermatozoa and oocytes, while in assessing the impact of different contaminants (e.g., metal nanoparticles, toxic algae), gametes have been shown to be very sensitive stages [ 235 238 ]. Regarding the effects on the embryonic development of marine species, a dose-dependent toxicity of NPs (PS 50 nm) was observed in the mussel(EC50\u2014half maximal effective concentration = 0.14 \u03bcg mL) [ 239 ] and the sea urchin(EC50\u2014half maximal effective concentration = 2.61 \u03bcg mL) [ 205 ], associated with the modulation of the molecular pathways of apoptosis for the sea urchin and shell mineralization for mussels. Ingestion of MPs by larval stages of different species has been demonstrated in natural [ 240 ] or controlled environments [ 241 242 ]. However, most studies have seen a limited effect, even at very high doses. For example, in two different works [ 243 244 ], chronic exposure (8 days (a) and 15 days (b) oflarvae to MPs (a) 1 and 10 \u03bcm, 100 MPs mLand (b) 2 and 6 \u03bcm, 2000 MPs mLhad no effect on larval growth or food consumption. The same result was observed in the musselwith 2 \u03bcm particles after 15 days of exposure (42\u2013282 \u03bcgL) [ 243 ]. In contrast, in the same study, larvae exposed to NPs (100 nm) showed numerous malformations at the end of exposure [ 244 ]. Behavioral changes, neurotoxic and cellular effects (e.g., decreased energy production, disruption of cardiac activity and antioxidant system) were also observed in larvae of 245 ] and 247 ] after NP exposures. Thus, while larvae appear to be little affected by MPs, nanoparticles could have superior effects on these stages, mainly due to their reactivity and size favoring interaction with biological membranes and the development of lesions.\n\nMost of the studies in the specialized literature evaluated the toxicity of MPs on organisms in the adult stage [ 234 ]. However, many marine organisms (e.g., bivalves, sea urchins) have a mode of reproduction by external fertilization with a pelagic larval life. Thus, the young stages (gametes, embryos, larvae) are in direct contact with plastic debris from the environment.\n\nCommunity stability and ecosystem functioning are related to the ability of populations to maintain and acclimatize to anthropogenic disturbances. Most ecotoxicological studies focus on effects over a single generation, but assessing ecological risk to marine ecosystems requires exploring the effects of a contaminant over multiple generations. To date, four studies have examined MP effects across at least two distinct generations [ 230 232 ]. Regarding MPs, Zhang et al. (2019) observed no consequence of exposure to generations 1 and 2 ofon generation 3 [ 233 ]. However, in the same species, Lee et al. (2013) observed higher toxicity of nanospheres (50 and 500 nm, respectively) in the first generation, as well as increased sensitivity to NPs (50 nm) in generation 2 [ 230 ].\n\nThe presence of MPs can induce changes in the behavior of organisms directly or as a result of cellular/technological/energetic perturbations [ 187 ]. In the laboratory, MP ingestion has been shown to reduce the jumping ability of sea fleas [ 225 ], alter fish locomotion/feeding (e.g., distance traveled, feeding time) [ 211 227 ] or induce daphnia immobilization [ 228 ]. These behavioral changes can impact prey\u2013predator interactions. Additionally, depending on particle shape (e.g., sphere, fiber), zooplankton species may alter their feeding preferences to limit the risk of ingesting plastic particles with a shape similar to that of natural prey [ 169 229 ].\n\nIngestion and simple transit of MPs can influence the energy metabolism of individuals. One of the first effects of MP ingestion is that of satiety, changing the body\u2019s eating behavior. Thus, in most cases, a reduction in food consumption is observed [ 215 218 ]. However, the opposite phenomenon was already observed in oysters (a 3% increase in filtration activity) after two months of exposure to PS microspheres (2 and 6 \u03bcm), probably as part of an energy compensation mechanism [ 202 ]. The effect on food consumption may depend on particle size depending on the species. A 70% decrease in algal consumption was found inlarvae exposed to 1 \u03bcm particles but no effect was found with 10 \u03bcm particles [ 219 ]. In addition, there was also no difference between the effects of 2 \u03bcm microspheres and 100 nm nanospheres on food consumption in 216 ]. This disruption of food consumption, and therefore of reserve accumulation, can lead to an effect on growth, metabolic activity or reproductive effort to maintain organisms [ 203 223 ]. For example, analyzing the energy budget of oysters, Sussarellu et al. (2016) highlighted an increase in maintenance energy at the expense of reproductive effort (e.g., the amount of gametes produced) [ 202 ]. This modulation of energy balance was also observed under NPs with a size- and dose-dependent effect [ 218 ]. For example, PS nanospheres (50 nm; 20 \u03bcg mL) induced a 59\u201370% decrease in fecundity (number of fry produced) of the rotiferand the copepod, while no effect for microspheres (6 \u03bcm) was observed [ 224 ].\n\nVarious tissue reactions can occur following MP ingestion. Thus, necrosis, increased mucus production, inflammation and damage to the intestine were observed [ 213 214 ]. For example, the brain of the freshwater fishshowed various lesions (e.g., discoloration, swelling) following exposure to PS nanospheres (30 nm) [ 211 ], which could explain the observed behavioral changes.\n\nDisturbance of the oxidative system of the organism infested with microplastics, i.e., the defense system against external stress, is one of the major processes observed in the specialized literature [ 171 203 ]. For example, Jeong et al. (2017) observed the stimulation of molecular pathways (e.g., MAPK\u2014the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase) associated with the defense of the copepodafter 24 h of exposure to PS nanospheres (50 nm) [ 203 ]. This oxidative stress can be associated with dysregulation of the immune system [ 178 204 ], stimulation of molecular pathways related to apoptosis [ 205 206 ], membrane damage (e.g., lipid peroxidation, loss of integrity) [ 179 208 ], destabilization of the lysosomal system [ 14 ] or genotoxicity (e.g., loss of DNA integrity, DNA breaks) [ 209 210 ]. Omic methods (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) allow unbiased characterization of a set of molecular pathways involved during exposure and are therefore to be preferred in future studies [ 202 212 ] to understand the response of the organism exposed to plastics and also to explore resilience mechanisms.\n\nBased on laboratory exposures, ingestion of MPs is rarely lethal to exposed organisms. However, the accumulation or simple transit of these particles in the digestive tract and external organs (e.g., gills) can cause disturbances at different scales: molecular, cellular, individual and population [ 187 201 ]. It should be noted that in some cases the effects observed after exposure to plastic particles could be associated with the release of chemical compounds (e.g., additives), but this remains to be further studied [ 202 ].\n\nIn the marine domain, NP translocation has been observed experimentally in several fish species [ 194 196 ], in clams [ 164 ] and in daphnia [ 197 198 ]. The potential passage of MPs (<10 \u03bcm) and NPs could be promoted or reduced depending on the chemical nature of the eco- or bio-corona via membrane recognition mechanisms [ 177 200 ]. In the case of translocation, the retention time would increase, and the release of the particles would prove difficult. Thus, in accordance with their experimental data, Al-Sid-Cheick et al. (2018) estimate the annual bioaccumulation of NPs (24 nm) byat 123 \u03bcg NP g, 12 \u03bcg NP gand 1.8 mg NP gfor a constant concentration of 1 \u03bcg L, 100 \u03bcg Land 15 \u03bcg L, respectively [ 164 ].\n\nTheoretically, the translocation efficiency mainly depends on the particle size. In the absence of previous damage to the digestive tract, the risk of MPs passing through the epithelium of the digestive tract of marine organisms is low, for example, in fish [ 183 ]. No physiological effects were found on the rainbow trout gut (e.g., permeability, ion and amino acid transport) after 4 weeks of exposure (PS; 100\u2013400 \u03bcm) [ 184 ]. The use of MPs in medical studies demonstrated low translocation efficiency (translocation efficiency < 0.05%) of particles <5 \u03bcm, while this translocation efficiency was 0.2\u201310% for NPs [ 185 186 ]. As the size decreases, the surface-to-volume ratio and reactivity of the particles increases, facilitating membrane interactions and barrier crossing [ 187 189 ]. Depending on the surface properties, the ability of NPs to cross barriers changes. Indeed, membrane interactions are facilitated for positively charged particles due to attraction processes with negatively charged membrane residues [ 190 ]. For example, polystyrene nanospheres positively charged at amino groups (-NH) (50 and 100 nm) show a higher rate of internalization inside mammalian cells compared to particles negatively charged at carboxyl groups (-COOH) [ 191 ]. Three types of passage mechanisms may be involved: endocytosis, phagocytosis and passive membrane exchange [ 192 193 ].\n\nTranslocation corresponds to the passage of microparticles or nanoparticles through the epithelia of an organism to the circulatory system and to different organs and tissues by crossing different membranes [ 177 ]. Experimentally, the translocation of plastic microspheres has been observed in the circulatory and lysosomal system of bivalves [ 170 178 ], in the liver of zebrafish 179 ] or in the hepato-pancreas of crabs [ 177 181 ]. For example, visualization of MPs in the hemolymph of bivalves is performed by sampling with a syringe through the mantle; it is recognized that MPs can adhere and accumulate on external organs (e.g., mantle, leg) [ 182 ].\n\nIngestion of MPs in the laboratory has been observed many times with the help of histological sections or with the help of fluorescent spheres on a wide range of taxa: zooplankton [ 168 169 ], bivalves [ 170 171 ], crustaceans [ 172 173 ]. Despite cessation of exposure, MPs can persist for several days in the body without being excreted, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal obstruction and inflammation [ 162 ]. For example, in the crab 173 ], the presence of MPs was observed 14 days after cessation of exposure. Particle shape will also modulate retention time [ 174 175 ]. The smooth and perfectly spherical shape of commercially available MPs facilitates rapid transit in the digestive system of organisms [ 176 ]. For example, after 24 h of depuration, 99% of daphnia exposed to microspheres showed complete MP excretion, compared to only 1% of daphnia exposed to micro-fragments [ 174 ].\n\nThe path of plastic particles to an aquatic or terrestrial organism will determine the possible toxic effects. After ingestion, MPs can either block the digestive system [ 162 ] or simply pass through it (the main route observed in the laboratory, for example) [ 163 ] or, in the case of the smallest particles, pass through digestive membranes and migrate to the circulatory system or even to other organs [ 164 165 ]. MP that is not released in feces could be transferred along the food chain as experimentally demonstrated [ 166 167 ].\n\n5.6. Impact of Plastic Waste on Human Health\n\nToday, the main talk is about the physical effects of plastic debris on marine animals. Indeed, these animals can be endangered by old fishing nets or plastic bags. As a result, they no longer know how to move to feed or avoid predators and sometimes even come to the surface to breathe. Others may be so exhausted that they sink or cut, causing an infectious process later. Numerous studies report that large numbers of marine animals ingest macroplastics. A recent study reveals that 100% of sea turtles have plastic waste in their digestive systems. The same is true for 59% of whales, 36% of sea lions and 40% of birds [ 248 ]. This can cause a satiety effect when nutrient intake is not sufficient. On the other hand, pieces of plastic can obstruct the intestinal tract. All this can lead to the death of the animal due to malnutrition and deterioration of health.\n\nThe physical effects caused by microplastics are less studied. However, there is evidence that small particles can attach to the internal or external surface of marine organisms. This can lead to physical damage that causes stress or inflammation, or even go so far as to block the absorptive surface of the intestinal lining. Consequently, these organisms experience a decrease in energy intake. However, no studies report that this information is transferable to humans.\n\nUnlike macro- and mesoplastics, which mainly have physical effects on wildlife, microplastics have the potential to have chemical effects. They would be considered vectors of persistent chemical pollutants [ 249 ].\n\nPlastic is mostly made up of synthetic polymers. They are made up of a chain of monomers. There is a wide variety of synthetic polymers, and the most widely used is polyethylene. It constitutes more than 40% of the plastic materials produced. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is used in food films, plastic bags, agricultural films and many other materials and packaging. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is harder and more opaque, and more resistant to tension and higher temperatures (120 \u00b0C) than LDPE. It is used for the manufacture of toys, crates and boxes, bottles for food products, detergents, cosmetics, etc. The second most used polymer worldwide is polypropylene (PP). It is less chemically resistant but has better thermal and mechanical properties. Plastic bottles are mainly made from the polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In turn, synthetic clothing fibers are mainly made of polyester but also of acrylic fibers [ 250 ].\n\nLactobacillus [ All these polymers are included in the composition of microplastics. During the degradation of these microplastics, residual monomers can be released. They are a known hazard to human health. For example, polyurethanes and polyvinyl chloride have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in humans. First, I3A (indole-3-aldehyde) is known to be a metabolite of dietary L-tryptophan that is synthesized by gastrointestinal bacteria, especially species of the genus 251 ]. I3A acts as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in intestinal immune cells and in turn stimulates the production of interleukin-22 (IL22), which facilitates mucosal reactivity [ 252 ]. Furthermore, I3A is an indole derivative that triggers glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in intestinal L cells and acts as a ligand for the AhR. Indole can also be metabolized in the liver to indoxyl sulfate, a compound that is toxic at high concentrations and associated with vascular disease and renal dysfunction. Beyond this, I3A causes cell differentiation and apoptosis. It up-regulation results in the attenuation of liver fat and promotes remission of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [ 253 ], while its down-regulation promotes the formation and worsening of NAFLD. A significant decrease in I3A levels in the liver was observed after one week of exposure to microplastics, suggesting that the ability of intestinal tryptophan to convert and transport I3A to the liver is impaired. This is potentially associated with the production of indole sulfate, a toxicant associated with oxidative stress in the liver [ 254 ].\n\nThe effects of ingesting microplastics have been identified and classified by researchers into three stages: the first is related to the blockage and damage of the digestive system, the second refers to the release of toxic chemicals into the body, and the third stage is represented by the assimilation of these substances by organs and tissues. Due to the increased human exposure to microplastics, they can be absorbed into the body through various pathways and accumulate in organs such as the liver, kidneys and intestine. Scientific studies have found that exposure to microplastics causes intestinal inflammation and liver metabolic disorders, but it is not yet known whether the damage and inflammation can cause the subsequent development of serious diseases. What the mouse study found is that daily exposure to microplastics has effects on the gut\u2013liver axis, effects that ultimately lead to insulin resistance and even diabetes ( Figure 6 ). These results indicate the urgent need regarding the prognosis of insulin resistance after exposure to microplastics [ 255 ].\n\n\u22121 of PS and polyethylene in cerebral and epithelial human cells was not able to induce cytolysis but increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) to high concentrations, contributing to cytotoxicity [ Overwhelming of antioxidant responses may result in oxidative stress. Microplastics may be at the origin of this oxidative stress, caused by their high surface area, release of oxidizing species adsorbed to their surface (e.g., metals) or due to reactive oxygen species released during the inflammatory response [ 256 257 ]. For instance, oxidative stress after exposure to microplastics has been reported in mice [ 258 ]. In polypropylene (PP) prothesis, after insertion acute inflammatory response culminates with the release of oxidants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid) inducing degradation, hydrolysis, cracking and additive leaching of the polymer producing a positive feedback loop of free radical production and revealing potential mechanisms of plastic removal from the organism [ 259 ]. Cytotoxicity is a result of particle toxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation. Cellular internalization of microplastics has been described for PS (polystyrene) in cell cultures, including macrophages, erythrocytes [ 260 ] and rat alveolar epithelial cells [ 261 ]. Inside the cell, microplastics are not membrane bound, potentially interacting with intercellular structures [ 260 ]. In vitro testing has been able to show cytotoxicity caused by plastic particles collected from the environment [ 262 ]. On the other hand, exposure to 0.05\u201310 mg Lof PS and polyethylene in cerebral and epithelial human cells was not able to induce cytolysis but increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) to high concentrations, contributing to cytotoxicity [ 263 ]. Furthermore, exposure of macrophage and lung epithelial cell cultures to PS (60 \u00b5m) caused ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress (caused by the aggregation of misfolded proteins) leading to autophagic cell death [ 264 ]. Thus, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress may be important mechanisms of microplastic toxicity.\n\nDicentrarchus labrax ), microplastics are reported to cause inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), oxidative stress with increase in lipid peroxidation levels and an increase in the anaerobic pathway of energy production [ Exposure to contaminants may lead to neurotoxicity, which is related to neurodegenerative diseases. Neurotoxicity has been reported in vivo after exposure to particulate matter, possibly due to oxidative stress and the activation of the microglia in the brain (immune cells) due to direct contact with translocated particles or through the action of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (from other inflammation sites), resulting in damage to neurons [ 265 ]. Indeed, exposure to traffic pollution, including particulate matter, has been associated with mild cognitive impairment in the elderly, increasing the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease development [ 266 ] and higher incidence of dementia [ 267 ]. Through the same mechanisms, and depending on individual susceptibility, microplastics could contribute to the increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, in vivo toxicity testing has shown that microplastics can impact neuronal function and behavior. In the brain of European seabass (), microplastics are reported to cause inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), oxidative stress with increase in lipid peroxidation levels and an increase in the anaerobic pathway of energy production [ 268 ]. In the same species, exposure to microplastics has been shown to impact swimming performance, a behavioral indicator [ 269 ]. Exposure to PS has also been reported to cause adverse effects on neurotransmission in mice, such as increased activity of AChE and changes in serum neurotransmitters [ 258 ]. In in vitro studies using neural cell types, 40\u201370 nm PS nanospheres were also able to induce toxicity and changes in metabolic activity, dependent on cell-type and concentration, with increased toxicity after long in-shelf storage periods of PS due to increased aggregation and presence of bioactive compounds [ 270 ]. Due to the evidence of neurotoxicity when testing microplastics in organism or cells and resulting from human exposure to particulate matter, which microplastics are a part of, there is a need to understand how microplastics could be involved in neurotoxicity in humans, contributing to an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease development [ 271 272 ].\n\nAlthough microplastics may not have major immediate effects, they likely potentiate or exacerbate many medical conditions, especially respiratory problems. An inflammatory gene, TRPV4, that was up-regulated by microplastics is activated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, causing lung edema, a condition of respiratory distress found in workers exposed to microplastics in the plastic manufacturing industry [ 273 274 ]. The cell-to-cell loss of adhesion we report here is likely the first step of the dysfunction seen by others in cell and tissue barriers in vivo on exposure to microplastics, providing further evidence that long-term exposure to the inhalation of PS-MPs presents a serious hazard to lung health, while short-term health has not been found to be endangered by microplastics except at high concentrations in industrial settings [ 275 ].\n\nDuring the production of plastic, additives are usually added. They would constitute on average 4% of plastic. These additives can be antioxidants, pigments and stabilizers, and perform various functions such as increasing the flexibility, durability and transparency of the plastic. Additives include phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Bisphenol A is also the monomer used in the manufacture of polycarbonate. During the fragmentation of microplastics, additives can migrate more easily from the center of the polymer to the surface [ 105 ]. Therefore, the size of the microplastic may play an important role in the release of chemicals [ 109 ].\n\nThis release of additives into the marine environment worries scientists. Indeed, these chemicals can cause harmful effects to the health of marine animals and humans. Certain additives such as phthalates and bisphenol A are endocrine disruptors. These endocrine disruptors work through different modes of action, such as binding to natural hormone receptors. For example, bisphenol A is an estrogen mimetic, meaning it binds to alpha and beta estrogen receptors. This can lead to reproductive disorders. EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) has established the tolerable daily dose of bisphenol A: 0.004 mg/kg body weight/day. Therefore, people should be exposed to a lower dose than this to avoid harmful problems to their health. Endocrine disruptors can also act in other ways, either by mimicking the action of a natural hormone or by antagonizing the production or regulation of hormones or receptors.\n\nHowever, these particles could be absorbed in the digestive tract by other transport mechanisms. In the study by Wright and Kelly (2017), two hypotheses are presented: uptake by endocytosis and absorption. Endocytosis is thought to be carried out by M cells of Peyer\u2019s patches, mainly in the ileum. Microplastics between 0.1 and 10 \u00b5m would therefore be transported from the intestinal lumen to the lymphoid tissues of the digestive tract [ 110 ]. Persorption would consist of paracellular transport, i.e., absorption of particles smaller than 130 \u00b5m between two cells. This would occur mainly in unstratified epithelia and where there is junctional weakness between cells ( Figure 7 ). Dendritic cells would then phagocytose the particles and transport them to the lymphatic vessels and portal vein. Therefore, there would be a possible distribution to tissues such as liver, muscle and brain [ 105 ].\n\nThe major problem lies in assessing the risks to human health. No studies have yet been conducted on the possible accumulation and toxicological effects of microplastics after the ingestion of these foods. No threshold has been established to ensure that there is no risk to humans [ 94 ]."}, {"url": "https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/07/27/disparities/", "page_content": "Visualizing the racial disparities in mass incarceration\n\nRacial inequality is evident in every stage of the criminal justice system - here are the key statistics compiled into a series of charts.\n\nby Wendy Sawyer, July 27, 2020\n\nRecent protests calling for radical changes to American policing have brought much-needed attention to the systemic racism within our criminal justice system. This extends beyond policing, of course: Systemic racism is evident at every stage of the system, from policing to prosecutorial decisions, pretrial release processes, sentencing, correctional discipline, and even reentry. The racism inherent in mass incarceration affects children as well as adults, and is often especially punishing for people of color who are also marginalized along other lines, such as gender and class.\n\nBecause racial disparity data is often frustratingly hard to locate, we\u2019ve compiled the key data available into a series of charts, arranged into five slideshows focused on policing, juvenile justice, jails and pretrial detention, prisons and sentencing, and reentry. These charts provide a fuller picture of racial inequality in the criminal justice system, and make clear that a broad transformation will be needed to uproot the racial injustice of mass incarceration.\n\nFollowing the slideshows, we also address five frequently asked questions about criminal justice race/ethnicity data.\n\nThere are racial disparities in policing and arrests:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are racial disparities in the arrest and confinement of youth:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are racial disparities in local jails and pretrial detention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are racial disparities in prisons, extreme sentences, and solitary confinement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are racial disparities in homelessness, unemployment, and poverty after release:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently asked questions about race and ethnicity in criminal justice data\n\nQ: Why are terms used inconsistently, such as \u201cHispanic\u201d and \u201cLatino/a\u201d?\n\nA: Sharp-eyed readers will notice some inconsistency in the terms used in the charts above, and across the literature more generally. For example, the Census Bureau and most national criminal justice data uses the category \u201cAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\u201d to describe indigenous people in the U.S., but the juvenile justice system data uses the term \u201cAmerican Indian.\u201d Likewise, \u201cHispanic\u201d is used most frequently in various national data sets to refer to those with Spanish-speaking ancestry, but some sources use Latino/a (or Latinx), which specifically refers to those with Latin American ancestry. In these charts (and in most of our publications), we use the terminology of the original data sources.\n\nQ: Why are some racial/ethnic categories not represented in the data?\n\nA: The question of how accurately race and ethnicity data reflect justice-involved populations goes beyond inconsistent labels. Most obviously, not all racial or ethnic groups are consistently represented in the data; less populous Census-identified groups, such as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Asian, and American Indian or Alaska Native \u2013 as well as the sizable but less specific \u201cTwo or more races\u201d and \u201cSome other race\u201d \u2013 are very often excluded in publications, even when they are collected. Moreover, all of these categories are so broad that they lump together groups with very different experiences with the U.S. justice system. They disregard tribal differences, sweep people of East Asian and South Asian origins into one category, and somehow ignore Arab Americans entirely. As a result, our observations of racial and ethnic discrimination are limited to these broad categories and lack any real nuance.\n\nQ: Where can I find data about racial disparities in my state\u2019s criminal justice system?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the more specific you want to get with race/ethnicity data, the harder it is to find an answer, especially one that\u2019s up-to-date. State-level race and ethnicity data can be hard to find if you are looking to federal government sources like the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). BJS does publish state-level race and ethnicity data in its annual Prisoners series (Appendix Table 2 in 2018), but only every 6-7 years in its Jail Inmates series (most recently the 2013 Census of Jails report, Table 7). The Vera Institute of Justice has attempted to fill this gap with its Incarceration Trends project, by gathering additional data from individual states. Individual state Departments of Correction sometimes collect and/or publish more up-to-date and specific data; it\u2019s worth checking with your own state\u2019s agencies.\n\nQ: Where can I find criminal justice race/ethnicity data disaggregated by sex?\n\nA: Disaggregating racial/ethnic data by sex is unfortunately not the norm in reports produced by the federal government (i.e. BJS). For people able to access and analyze the raw data, such analyses are often possible, but most people rely on the reports published by government agencies like BJS. As you can see in the chart showing prison incarceration rates by sex and race/ethnicity, BJS does sometimes offer this level of detail. But again, the same level of detail is not available for jails, and an analysis of both race/ethnicity and sex by state is all but unheard-of \u2013 even though it is precisely this level of detail that is most useful for advocates trying to help specific populations in their state.\n\nQ: How are the data collected, and how accurate are the data?\n\nA: Finally, the validity of any data depends on how the data are collected in the first place. And in the case of criminal justice data, race and ethnicity are not always self-reported (which would be ideal). Police officers may report an individual\u2019s race based on their own perception \u2013 or not report it at all \u2013 and the surveys that report the number of incarcerated people on a given day rely on administrative data, which may not reflect how individuals identify their own race or ethnicity. This is why surveys of incarcerated people themselves are so important, such as the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the Survey of Prison Inmates, but those surveys are conducted much less frequently. In fact, it\u2019s been 18 years since the last Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, which we use to analyze pretrial jail populations, and 16 years since the last published data from the Survey of Inmates were collected.\n\nHow to link to specific images\n\nBecause some readers might want to link to specific images in this briefing out of the context of these slideshows, we\u2019ve created these special URLs so you can link directly to a specific image:"}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/2325", "page_content": "Decentralized ventilation is often used in situations where the space for ducts throughout the building is limited and there are no existing ducts. From a heritage point of view, the solution can, however, be problematic since exhausts and inlets will typically have to be done through the facade. However, sometimes it is possible to have these openings through the building envelope in areas that are not considered culturally protected, e.g., gables or generally unseen portions at the back of the building.\n\nThere are a lot of different solutions for heat recovery [ 80 ], but for residential buildings, typically, fixed plate exchangers are used. Ventilation with heat recovery is particularly relevant to consider in the following situations:\n\nAs mentioned, it is possible during the summer that natural ventilation through window openings is used instead and the mechanical system is only turned on by occupancy sensors in the bathroom and if the cooker hood (integrated with the building ventilation system) is turned on. The latter needs a dispensation from the local building authorities in many countries.\n\nDuring winter, the ventilation systems are controlled individually by the moisture content in each flat, though with a minimum airflow to ensure adequate fresh air in the indoor climate. As an example, in Denmark, the minimum required fresh airflow is 0.3 L/s per m 2 floor space, equal to approximately 0.5 air changes per hour.\n\nThe solution implements a full individual ventilation system in each flat with inlet and outlet through the facade and heat recovery inside each unit. The system can also work as a hybrid solution, where the mechanical ventilation is stopped during summer, resulting in lower electricity consumption compared to a full-year operation. The lower electricity consumption comes partly from the short ducts and partly from the summer stop. Concerning cooling, e.g., during summer months, natural ventilation is a much better option than mechanical ventilation.\n\nIn a decentralized solution, a ventilation unit is placed in each apartment ( Figure 6 ). There are several different possibilities for decentralized solutions. The following description deals with decentralized room-by-room ventilation through the facade with constant airflow.\n\nMechanical ventilation with heat recovery, as opposed to natural ventilation, has the added benefit of recovering some of the heat that would have otherwise been lost. Typical system efficiencies range from 75% to 95% heat recovery. Experimental testing has demonstrated very high efficiencies [ 77 ] that has also been confirmed with installations in existing multi-family residential buildings [ 78 ]. For historic buildings, which often utilize natural ventilation (making it difficult to control airflow), installing mechanical ventilation with heat recovery can significantly improve indoor climate conditions and reduce energy use [ 79 ].\n\nIn the case of active overflow systems, it is clear that the strengths lie in the spatial, tectonic, and structural impacts. Buildings with low airtightness make the implementation of a solution more complex, often requiring protection of internal facades to mitigate elevated moisture accumulation risks. Furthermore, the solution is relatively neutral in terms of visual impact and is highly dependent on the particular characteristics of the building. Most of the other assessment criteria are positively influenced.\n\nThe concept has been implemented in several buildings and its function and feasibility has been confirmed. The system has been successfully implemented in non-residential buildings [ 76 ] as well as in historic buildings such as the Br\u00fcnnengut manor house in Bern, Switzerland ( Figure 5 ).\n\nThe advantage in terms of space savings through the elimination of supply air ducts was demonstrated in the city of Zurich in 2010. There, a design competition for products that use the principle of active transfer led to the development and launch of numerous active transfer products [ 75 ].\n\nIn rooms with high levels of humidity, pollutants, and odors (e.g., toilet and kitchen), the exhaust air is extracted and connected to the central ventilation unit [ 73 ]. It can be combined with heat recovery, as demonstrated in a school in Innsbruck, Austria, during the EU-project SINFONIA [ 74 ].\n\nIn the concept of active overflow openings, the supply fresh air ductwork is limited to one room, the so-called \u201cmixed air room\u201d ( Figure 3 ). From this fresh air reservoir, which can be the corridor or the living room, depending on the floor plan, the fresh air is transported to the bedrooms by means of an active transfer (mechanically generated overflow with fans). The active transfer can be installed in the partition walls or directly in the room door panels. The air can flow back into the mixed air zone via passive overflow openings (for example the slot under the door panel). In the case of leaky buildings (often the case for historic buildings), it is recommended not to blow fresh air from the \u201cmixed air room\u201d into the bedrooms. Instead, the exhaust air should be extracted from the bedroom and the fresh air should flow in through passive overflow openings ( Figure 4 ). Blowing in can cause overpressure in the bedrooms and moist warm air can be forced into the construction, which can lead to condensation and damage.\n\nIn addition, with the aim of conservation of finite natural resources and minimizing environmental load, ventilation of historic buildings through local/seasonal winds provides the additional benefit of reducing a building\u2019s carbon footprint and pollutants to the atmosphere [ 72 ].\n\nIn colder climates, the utilization of natural ventilation systems may increase heat losses and energy costs, while in temperate climates, it contributes to heat rejection, economic savings, and better thermal comfort [ 69 71 ]. Therefore, the geographical location and local microclimate are the key factors influencing decision-making for improving energy performance of historic buildings when considering natural ventilation.\n\nThe manual control strategy based on long-term local experience of users is mostly enough to operate the building, yet at the same time, it hosts hygrothermal and biological risks. The manual control strategy can lead to thermal bridge occurrences in the case of unexpected climate changes and faulty control strategies by the building users. Even if natural ventilation is one of the key user-driven passive techniques, it may not always be guaranteed due to high levels of noise, concerns about security, air pollution, and adaptive reuse of buildings and changing urban density [ 69 70 ].\n\nNatural ventilation systems have provided a traditional means of indoor climate control that has been used widely in historic buildings [ 67 68 ]. The continued use of natural ventilation solutions minimizes interventions in historic building restorations and supports conservation of the heritage significance of buildings with minimum disturbance.\n\nNatural ventilation, air movement generated by air pressure differences between indoor and outdoor, is controlled by openings on the building enclosure such as windows, doors, and vents ( Figure 3 ). Differing from air leakage, natural ventilation is the intentional passive transfer of air directed through openings of the facade and/or roof of the building. Determining the opening direction and total opening area is the subject of design for natural ventilation systems in order to obtain the best benefit from local and seasonal breezes.\n\nTo explain the topic of energy efficiency of natural ventilation and justify its inclusion in this paper, a more detailed description of a possible natural ventilation system in warmer climates is described in the following.\n\nThe table of the measures provides a visual decision-making support tool to illustrate where the strengths and weaknesses of the measures are. The tool helps visualize the assessment trend of the individual categories. Since the solutions listed are refurbishment measures without specific renovation cases, different factors are described in the respective criteria and different variants are evaluated as possible considerations. A case-specific general evaluation of ventilation systems is not possible within the assessment standard because the assessment would depend on the characteristics of a specific building. For ventilation systems, this issue is mainly related to the criterion \u201cHeritage significance of the building and its settings\u201d as many variations will exist due to unique circumstances. For this reason, Table 2 is supplemented by Table 3 (active overflow system) and Table 4 (decentral room-by-room ventilation), which also include characteristics of the building stock in the assessment. Table 3 and Table 4 are essentially a matrix representation of the decision tree previously shown. For this reason, it is also evident that the decision-making approach can be roughly limited by the questions within the decision tree.\n\nTo demonstrate the application of the standard and to show a structured process in the selection of refurbishment measures, three different measures are presented below ( Table 2 Table 3 and Table 4 ) using the quick assessment method previously mentioned ( Table 1 ). The big difference to the quick assessment specified in the standard is that a general assessment on the suitability of the measure in historic buildings is carried out and that the evaluation is not based on a specific object. The selected measures (in the Table 2 example) describe the general implementation of an \u201cactive overflow\u201d system, a decentralized room-by-room through the facade ventilation system with constant airflow, as well as an alternative solution with natural ventilation.\n\nIn order to carry out a quick assessment of a renovation measure, the framework conditions of the refurbishment must be precisely defined. With ventilation systems, these varying factors are easier to identify than with an evaluation of a wall solution. For example, the hygrothermal risks of ventilation systems are generally considered relatively low. Regardless of which ventilation system is installed, it has a positive effect on moisture removal and helps to minimize the hygrothermal risks of the building envelope. The different criteria should be seen as a checklist to consider all important aspects in connection with the renovation of historic buildings. Some solutions require a detailed consideration of a certain point which may be trivial to answer in another system.\n\n4.2. Detailed Assessment\u2014Active Overflow System\n\nIn this section, the assessment of an active overflow system is demonstrated and examined in detail using a fictitious refurbishment case as an example. Due to the wealth of information that is requested in the course of a detailed assessment, it is necessary to relate the information to a specific case. In the course of IEA SHC Task 59 [ 25 ], the criteria of the standard have been specified in detail in order to conduct a detailed assessment of the individual topics. The aim is to show how the assessment criteria should be applied and to convey the scope of such a detailed assessment. Furthermore, the differences with the quick assessment will be illustrated.\n\nThe fictitious refurbishment case is represented by a farm building in Tyrol from the 18th century ( Figure 7 ). Shortly after the end of the Second World War, a cellar was built. The entire farm was built with timber block construction (log walls) and has an average room height of 2.40 m in the living rooms. The attic is not a finished living space and contains roof trusses within an unconditioned space. The building is not a listed building but is subject to local heritage protection of the village. In order to enable contemporary use, the building will be thermally upgraded. Due to the protection of the historic appearance of the village, the external appearance of the building is not allowed to be changed. In order to guarantee at least a room height of 2.40 m and thus maintain the parapet heights of the windows and the external appearance, the wooden ceilings are only structurally strengthened and not extended by any additional depth in the floor construction. In the following sections, the criteria mentioned in EN 16883:2017 [ 27 ] are assessed in detail.\n\n4.2.1. Technical Compatibility The category \u201ctechnical compatibility\u201d assesses the solution for various risks in connection with the building structure and feasibility. Hygrothermal risks: Ventilation generally has a positive influence on the structure and materials of a historical building. Excess moisture loads are removed through the exchange of air. Like any other classical ventilation system, the active overflow system also has to ensure the required air exchange in order to achieve the desired relative humidity. With an active overflow system, the exchange of air between rooms must be implemented. This can be achieved by leaving the interior doors open or by increasing the air flow rate through active transfer. However, the system must be designed to ensure that no significant overpressure is created in ventilated rooms by the overflow fans. As a result, moist warm air could penetrate the construction via leaks, condense, and cause damage. To avoid this, the flow direction of the active overflow should be chosen from the room to the mixed air room. Biological risks: Depending on the design and construction, biological risks can arise from the above-mentioned overpressure. In the case of the wooden construction, presented in this example, special attention must be paid in this regard. Through the thermal refurbishment of the external walls, a higher airtightness level is achieved, which must be verified by a blower door test. Robustness/buildability/design/application: Due to the typical arrangement of the rooms of agricultural buildings in Tyrol, the corridor is well-suited to be used as a distribution zone, the so-called \u201cmixed air room\u201d ( Figure 8 ). The main access for fresh air is from the attic via the existing chimney of the smokehouse. The installation of the active overflow units must be coordinated with the appearance and structure but can be integrated into the interior doors and in the internal log walls. For this reason, no special structural knowledge or conservation skills are required, but a certified system should be selected for the overflow units. Thermal bridges/connection: Due to the installation of the ventilation unit in the unconditioned attic, no thermal bridges are created by the penetration of the insulated ceiling. Reversibility: The system is not completely reversible due to the penetrations made for piping of the supply and exhaust air channels and the openings for the active overflow units.\n\n4.2.2. Heritage Significance of the Building and Its Settings Different impacts of the building\u2019s materials, appearance, and proportions regarding aspects of historic preservation are investigated. Material, tectonic, structural impact: The active overflow system has a minimal impact on the structure of the existing building. Penetrations for supply and exhaust air must be taken into account. The fans of the overflow system require a power connection which must be hidden within the wooden walls. Possibilities for this are the placement of cables in the skirting boards as well as a hidden routing of the cables in the door frames. Architectural, aesthetic, visual impact: This solution is particularly beneficial from an architectural point of view. Only one air supply opening for the ventilation unit is required on the facade. This opening can be integrated into the facade in different ways, such as hidden by wooden grilles in the ridge region. In the northern hemisphere, care must be taken to install the air intake opening on the north facade to avoid the intake of very warm air in the summer months. Due to the limited number of supply and exhaust air openings, with proper design attention, there are hardly any visual impairments ( Figure 9 ). Thus, these openings must be included in the refurbishment concept in order to be installed such that they are as hidden as possible. The primary challenge is the integration of the active overflow units. However, there are a number of solutions to integrate them into the design concept while maintaining the historic fabric. Various solutions to integrate the units in walls and doors are available on the market. In the example of a historic farmhouse, the fans can be integrated quite well into wooden log walls. Old wood covers can be integrated into the architectural concept. Noise protection should also be considered.\n\n4.2.3. Economic Viability Capital costs: Due to reduced supply air ductwork, less silencers, and supply air inlets, the capital costs are low for a mechanical ventilation system. Operating costs, including maintenance costs: The total electricity costs of the active overflow system are approximately 20\u201330% higher, depending on the floor plan configuration, compared to a standard heat recovery system. The reason is the higher flow rate for the mixed air zone (only partly compensated by the lower pressure drop of the supply air duct system) [ 73 ] (p. 77). Economical return and savings: Economically, there is almost no significant savings when compared to the existing building before refurbishment, the advantage is the reduced visual impact on the historic building while increasing comfort and IEQ. The main savings with mechanical ventilation are in the recovery of heat, although this by itself would not justify the investment costs from an economic point of view. The topic of mechanical ventilation must be considered within the context of other points of evaluation such as heritage value, which cannot be easily quantified in terms of economic costs. By integrating active ventilation, the indoor comfort is increased and the damage potential due to moisture accumulation in the building is reduced.\n\n4.2.4. Energy The higher the air exchange rate through active transfer, the lower the global air exchange rate (air exchange rate of outdoor air and indoor air) of the system can be. This should be taken into account especially in the winter months as too high of a global air exchange rate can result in air that is too dry. Due to the higher air exchange rates used in active transfer, a higher energy demand results from the fans. By installing a heat recovery system, the ventilation system provides a considerable contribution to improving the energy efficiency of the building.\n\n4.2.5. Indoor Environmental Quality Indoor environmental conditions suitable for building content preservation: In the example case, there are no special objects, paintings, or other furnishings that require very controlled climate conditions. Indoor environmental conditions suitable for building fabric preservation: Thanks to the new ventilation system, high moisture loads in the building can be controlled and avoided. Especially in combination with internal insulation, this ventilation solution represents a decisive advantage and is recommended due to the increased air tightness resulting from the refurbishment measures. Indoor environmental conditions suitable for achieving good occupant comfort levels: This point can be answered in general terms. The controlled air exchange not only removes excess moisture from the rooms but also other indoor air pollutants such as particle matter, VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), and radon. Emission of other harmful substances: There are no risks to be expected with regular maintenance of the filters and the system. Harmful substances from indoor air are diluted by the mixing of fresh air controlled by the air exchange rate.\n\n4.2.6. Impact on the Outdoor Environment The heat recovery system saves energy, which has a direct positive effect on the CO 2 balance of the building. The installation of a ventilation system also makes sense in order to improve the function and durability of the building."}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/10/12/780", "page_content": "P. tricornutum\n\nP. tricornutum\n\nP. tricornutum\n\nU. lactuca\n\nU. lactuca\n\nThe stress exerted on photosynthesis can affect the pathways that use photosynthetic by-products. Regarding energy allocation and consumption, there were no significant changes in either species. Nevertheless, in, a significant decrease was detected towards carbohydrate content, probably associated with constraints related to light-dependent reactions. In other diatom species, the depletion in stored carbohydrates can be associated with impairments regarding the thylakoid membrane integrity since the photosynthetic capability and the plasmalemma controls between the intra- and extracellular contents were compromised [ 48 107 ]. These alterations in photosynthesis efficiency could be related to the lipid environment surrounding the ETC [ 48 ]. Microalgae tend to vary their lipid content to overcome stress, though this response is species-specific [ 108 ]. Membrane lipids have distinctive signatures when it comes to fatty acid composition, and it is possible to infer changes in relative lipid abundance through variations in lipid-specific fatty acids. In, the chloroplastidial fatty acid C16:3n-4 increased at the highest SDS concentration, and its presence is often associated with plastidial galactolipids, indicating a possible increase of these compounds that participate in FCP and ET stabilization and OEC dissociation prevention [ 106 110 ]. Another important lipid that constitutes thylakoid membranes is sulfoquinovosyldiacyl-glycerol, which is rich in C16:0 and C16:1 [ 48 110 ], the former showing a tendency to decrease. In SDS-treated diatoms, despite no significant variance, most individual FAs were observed; differences are highlighted when they are grouped together, resulting in an increase in UFA, being directly connected to membrane fluidity. This increase in the overall FA double bonds, together with the decrease observed in the percentage of the major saturated fatty acid C16:0, could be related to an inhibition of de novo FA synthesis and an enhancement of elongase and desaturase activities. Coupled with the results of the oxidative stress biomarkers, it is possible to conclude that mild stress onwas mostly felt at the chloroplast level but rapidly counteracted by changes in absorption and fatty acid unsaturation. On the other hand, the absence of changes in lipid composition inis in line with the abovementioned results, showing that SDS imposed almost no stress on, as previously observed [ 93 ]."}, {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/1164", "page_content": "The water (in all its forms\u2014solid, liquid or vapors) represents one of the most important factors affecting the integrity of stones: it can interact with the substrate (dissolution, hydrolysis, oxidation-reduction), it can transport other substances (for example sulfates or other pollutants), it represents a medium for chemical reaction (and for the development of microorganisms) or (in case of temperature variation) can produce microcracks in the materials (in its solid form). Closely related to the presence of water, the soluble salts can damage the materials through two pathways (crystallization and hydration).\n\nA particular and very important area of cleaning procedures is dedicated to the graffiti removing methods. This can be achieved by chemical or mechanical methods, laser cleaning [ 92 ] or biocleaning (using, for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria or enzymes) [ 95 ]. A preventive action (protective) is represented by the anti-graffiti coatings, based on organic or inorganic agents (either temporary\u2014waxes, silicones, or permanent\u2014polyurethanes, fluorocarbon, alkyl alkoxy silanes) [ 96 ].\n\nAmong the new materials used for cleaning purposes, the most encountered are the TiOnanoparticles, which, due to their photocatalytic properties, can be used in self-cleaning protective layers. For example, La Russa et al. [ 93 ] proposed the use of this property of anatase-form nanoTiOby incorporation in three types of commercial coatings (acrylic polymer in organic solvent\u2014Paraloid B72, fluorinated polymer in an alcoholic solvent\u2014Akeogard P, compared with a commercial aqueous suspension of TiOand an acrylic polymer\u2014Fosbuild). The poorest results were obtained for the material using the nanoparticles/Paraloid composition (intense alteration of the surface, poor photo-degradation effect), while the best results were obtained for the commercial formulation (Fosbuild). The composition based on fluorinated polymers also led to good results, with significant photo-degradation and water repellency. A similar approach was adopted by Quagliarini et al. [ 94 ], combining the hydrophilic and photocatalytic photo-induced properties of the nanoparticles into a coating that decreased the water adsorption by 50%. Other examples regarding the use of nano-TiOas self-cleaning materials are provided in Table 5\n\nCleaning of stone artifacts is usually performed by mechanical (brushing, projection) [ 88 ] or chemical methods (using different solvents, such as methylene, acetone, acids, alkali or even commercial mixtures) [ 89 90 ]. More recently, the use of lasers was proposed for a wide variety of stone types (marble, sandstone, etc.) [ 91 ]. Removal of biofilms is usually performed using the same techniques, followed by a biocidal treatment (presented in Section 3.1 ). Regardless of the chosen technique, great care should be paid to not provoke damages to the original material; the processes should be gradual, selective and economically feasible [ 92 ].\n\n3.3.3. Consolidation and Protection Agents\n\nConsolidation represents the treatment applied in order to restore its mechanical properties, affected by weathering [ 86 ]. At the border between cleaning and consolidation, desalinization is often necessary; the removal of soluble salts is usually made by applying wet poultices consisting of clays or cellulosic mixtures [ 97 98 ], the alternative treatments proposed being represented by the application of ohmic technologies [ 99 ] and electrochemical methods [ 98 ], limewater (calcium hydroxide solution [ 100 ], crystallization modifiers (ferrocyanides, borax, etc. [ 101 102 ], or diammonium hydrogenphosphate [ 103 ].\n\nAs it emerges from the literature review, most of the authors treat the desalinization process as a secondary process (accompanying the main consolidation procedure), thus usually the traditional, well-established procedure being followed. This, in turn, leaves serious room for improving, by the development of new materials.\n\nAt this time, on the market are available a wide range of both organic and inorganic consolidants [ 104 105 ] with proven efficiency in consolidating different types of masonry materials. The stone consolidants can be divided in three main classes: (i) organic products (alkoxysilanes, recently reviewed by Xu et al. [ 106 ]); (ii) organic-inorganic mixtures and (iii) purely inorganic products (usually apatitic materials), relevant examples being provided in Table 5\n\n2 nanoparticles), consolidation (based on calcium oxalate nanoparticles) and a protective hydrophobic layer. The approach was successfully applied on different types of masonry materials (limestones of different porosity, ceramic materials and mortars). A good example regarding the application of organic products for the consolidation of stone materials is represented by the study of Liu and Liu [ 107 ]. The authors proposed the use of a composite polymeric material (tetraethoxysilane with additives as hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) for the consolidation of sandstone. After treatment, the sandstone showed crack-free surface homogeneity, acid resistance, as well as salt crystallization resistance, the polymeric layer also exhibiting very good hydrophobic properties (demonstrated by a water contact angle of 110\u00b0). Generally speaking, the organic products (as well as many of the organic/inorganic composites) used as consolidants also possess very good hydrophobicity, which also makes them very good protective compounds. A particularly interesting study was recently published by Kapridaki et al. [ 108 ]. In a three-layer treatment, the authors offered a complex conservation solution for stone monuments, incorporating a self-cleaning (based on TiOnanoparticles), consolidation (based on calcium oxalate nanoparticles) and a protective hydrophobic layer. The approach was successfully applied on different types of masonry materials (limestones of different porosity, ceramic materials and mortars).\n\n112,113, The use of in situ formed hydroxyapatite represents a very good alternative to other methods. It is achieved by the reaction of a phosphate salt and the substrate (marble, limestone, sandstone, sulfated stone, gypsum stucco, concrete, etc.). The topic was recently reviewed by Sassoni [ 109 ], so a very thorough presentation of the method would be redundant. We have chosen to discuss only a modification of the method, proposed by Pesce et al. [ 110 ]. The in situ formation of a hydroxyapatite consolidating layer was achieved using aqueous solution of diammonium phosphate and two types of calcium nanosuspensions, calcium hydroxide and calcite (calcium carbonate), on limestone and sandstone. The authors observed an improvement of the compactness of the stones, accompanied by a risk of incompatibility (proven by the substantial reduction of water sorption, especially for sandstone). The authors also proposed the effective order of reactants deposition on the stone (the phosphate followed by the calcium source) and drew attention to a possible drawback of the method, respectively an elevated risk of yellowing on the surface. A particular approach was developed by our group, regarding the application of synthesized hydroxyapatite and apatitic materials, especially for the protection of limestone, but also for antimicrobial purposes [ 111 114 ]. However, due to the significant color changes recorded, the optimization of these recipes still represents a subject for future research.\n\ncocciopesto ) was proposed by Santarelli et al. [ The incorporation of basalt fibers (chopped fibers, continuous filaments or milled fibers) into mortars (prepared using natural hydraulic lime, dry premix and inert aggregates, respectively dry premix and inert aggregates with crushed bricks and tiles\u2014) was proposed by Santarelli et al. [ 115 ]. The authors observed that the fibers addition increased the compressive properties of the mortars, while the chopped fibers imparted post-peak stress of the hydraulic lime mortar. For all the proposed materials, was also observed a decrease in the capillary water adsorption coefficient. Similar approaches were published by Moropoulou et al. [ 116 ] (using several pozzolanic additives), Andrejkovi\u010dov\u00e1 et al. [ 117 ] (using palygorskite and metakaolin), Ventol\u00e0 et al. [ 118 ] (using commercial phase changing materials), Rosato et al. [ 119 ] (using commercial cellulose nano-fibrils), Gour et al. [ 120 ] (using natural polymers) or Pavl\u00edk et al. [ 121 ] (using crushed lava granulates). However, regarding the reconstruction/consolidation mortars, the best approach, in our opinion, is the one presented by Stefanidou et al. [ 122 ], respectively designing the mortars according to the nature of the natural stone (in the cases presented by the authors marl limestone, nummulitic limestone, marble, biogenic calcitic sandstones), and as, often as possible, reclaiming local materials.\n\nA particular case is represented by the earth (unfired) masonry materials (such as earth-blocks\u2014cob, adobe, mud-bricks or mud mortars). In those cases, considering the limited viability of the materials, the best approach is their replacement/grouting with materials as similar as possible, or, at least, compatible [ 123 124 ].\n\n\u00ae\u00ae SI30). The hybrid mixture was airbrushed on the surface of different types of stones (marble, dolomite), obtaining superior values of hydrophobicity, compared with the pure commercial product. In the case of marble, was even achieved a superhydrophobicity character (contact angle > 150\u00b0). The same approach was used by Aslanidou et al. [ As already stated, many of the polymeric composites previously presented possess hydrophobic properties, thus having a protective role for the masonry materials. The usually applied conservation materials are primarily represented by siloxanes [ 125 ] and elastomers [ 126 ], with proven efficiency over a large variety of masonry materials. More interesting, the use of hybrid nanomaterial/polymeric coatings was proposed by some authors. Corcione et al. [ 127 ] proposed a mixture containing commercially available micrometric hydroxyapatite and multiple polymeric components (trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethoxypropyl silane methacrylate monomer, vinyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane and 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane). The mixture was applied by brushing on two calcarenitic stones, with different porosity and photo-cured by UV-lamp. The coatings led to a surface hydrophobic character of the treated material (demonstrated by the contact angle\u2014129\u00b0\u2013136\u00b0, depending on hydroxyapatite amount, compared with the untreated sample\u201496\u00b0). Considering the hydrophobicity results and the observed color changes, the authors proposed an upper limit of 5% hydroxyapatite filler for future applications. Cappelletti et al. [ 128 ] incorporated nano-titania in a commercial silane resin (AlphaSI30). The hybrid mixture was airbrushed on the surface of different types of stones (marble, dolomite), obtaining superior values of hydrophobicity, compared with the pure commercial product. In the case of marble, was even achieved a superhydrophobicity character (contact angle > 150\u00b0). The same approach was used by Aslanidou et al. [ 129 ]. Using commercially available silica nanoparticles dispersed in commercial alkoxy silanes and organic fluoropolymer emulsion obtained superhydrophobic and superoleophobic coatings, successfully applied for the protection of masonry (marble, sandstone) and other materials (concrete, paper, silk), proving a good versatility of the method. The use of hydrophobic components (such as calcium stearate or silane/stearate) was also proposed Falchi et al. [ 130 ] as a viable alternative in order to develop restoration mortars with hydrophobic properties (thus, protection action). The authors introduced the water-repellent admixtures into pozzolana lime-mortar (0.5%\u20131.5%), obtaining materials with reduced water vapor permeability, without significantly affecting the mechanical properties of the mortar."}], "K\u00e9vin Gameiro made his senior international debut in 2010.": [{"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/42276181/Kevin-Gameiro", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

He mainly operates as a forward, but can also appear as a right winger.\n\nHe is a strong striker with a clinical finish, which compensates for his relatively light frame.\n\nGameiro began his football career playing for clubs along the Oise such as Marly-la-Ville and US Chantilly. In 2004, he moved to the Alsace region to join professional club RC Strasbourg. He made his professional debut in the 2004\u201305 season and appeared in the UEFA Cup with Strasbourg. After three seasons with the club, in August 2008, Gameiro signed a four-year deal with FC Lorient. With Lorient, he finished his first two seasons with the club as top scorer. In the 2009\u201310 season, Gameiro contributed to the team that achieved a 7th-place finish; the club's highest finish in Ligue 1 ever.\n\nGameiro is a former France youth international having earned caps at under-18, under-20, and under-21 level. At under-20 level, he played on the team that won the 2007 edition of the Toulon Tournament. Gameiro scored a hat trick in the final and finished the competition as its top scorer. In August 2010, he was called up to the senior team for the first time and made his senior international debut on 3 September 2010 in a match against Belarus.\n\nEarly career\n\nGameiro was born in Senlis, a commune in Oise, 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Paris. He began his football career playing for ES Marly-la-Ville not far from his hometown at the age of six. Prior to turning 13, he opted to remain in the region of Picardie and joined US Chantilly. While excelling at US Chantilly, Gameiro was spotted by former RC Strasbourg player and scout Jacky Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux who recommended the player join his former club. In 2004, Gameiro completed his move to the Alsatian club joining as a youth player.\n\nClub career\n\nStrasbourg\n\nUpon arrival, Gameiro was inserted onto the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. He spent the entire 2004\u201305 season playing with the team. Gameiro featured in 20 matches and scored four goals. In 2005, with Dugu\u00e9p\u00e9roux now managing the team, Gameiro made his professional debut on 10 September 2005 in a match against Paris Saint-Germain appearing as a substitute in the 59th minute of a 1\u20130, Ligue 1 defeat. On 14 December, Gameiro made his European debut in a UEFA Cup match against Serbian club Red Star Belgrade. With Strasbourg trailing 2\u20130 late in the match, Gameiro scored his first professional goal for the club in the 79th minute. In the final minutes of play, he scored the equalizing goal to draw the match at 2\u20132. The stalemate ensured Strasbourg won the group and the team later advanced to the Round of 16 where they suffered elimination losing 4\u20132 on aggregate to Swiss club FC Basel. A month later, Gameiro converted his third goal of the season in the team's 4\u20130 victory over Nancy in the Coupe de France. In league play, Gameiro scored his first career league goal on 4 February 2006 in a 2\u20131 loss to Lens. Three weeks later, his season was cut short after rupturing ligaments in one of his knees following a tackle from Troyes midfielder Blaise Kouassi. The injury required six months of rehabilitation, which resulted in Gameiro missing the Coupe Gambardella competition, which the Strasbourg under-19 team won, defeating Lyon 3\u20131 in the final at the Stade de France. Overall, Gameiro's season was a success, however, due to the club focusing more on Europe, the team suffered relegation to Ligue 2 for the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nDue to undergoing rehabilitation on his knee, Gameiro made his debut with Strasbourg in Ligue 2 late in the season on 19 September 2006 in the club's 2\u20130 loss to Auxerre in the Coupe de la Ligue. He scored his first goal two months later in a 2\u20130 victory over Istres. Through the rest of the season, Gameiro alternated between the bench and the starting eleven. He only scored two goals, against Gueugnon and Istres, again, for the rest of the season as Strasbourg achieved promotion back to Ligue 1 courtesy of the club's 3rd-place finish. In his first full season as a professional, Gameiro scored six total goals in 36 total appearances. He scored in back-to-back matches during the early portion of the season against Auxerre and Toulouse, but went cold mid-season scoring only two goals. He scored his final two goals for the club in the final two matches of the season against Caen and Marseille. Strasbourg lost both matches., causing Strasbourg to again suffer relegation to Ligue 2.\n\nLorient\n\nGameiro training with Lorient in 2010 Gameiro training with Lorient in 2010\n\nDespite strong interest from Marseille, on 17 June 2008, Gameiro agreed to a four-year deal with Brittany-based outfit Lorient. The club paid Strasbourg a transfer fee of \u20ac3 million for his services. Gameiro was given the number 9 shirt and installed as the club's head striker. He made his club debut on 9 August 2008 playing the entire match in a 1\u20130 victory over Le Mans. Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 defeat to Valenciennes. On 25 October, he contributed to Lorient's 3\u20130 rout of Brittany rivals Nantes. The following month, Gameiro scored goals in back-to-back matches on two occasions. Lorient went undefeated in the four matches. In the Coupe de France, Lorient reached the Round of 16. Gameiro scored goals against Alen\u00e7on and Tours in the Round of 64 and Round of 32, respectively. Gameiro continued his consistency during the spring portion of the season scoring goals against Sochaux, Grenoble, Marseille, and Nancy. Gameiro scored a double against the latter club. He finished the season with 39 total appearances and 13 goals. Lorient finished the season in 10th, tied for the club's highest finish ever in the first division.\n\nGameiro continued his rise in French football in the 2009\u201310 Ligue 1 season. He scored on his season debut on 8 August 2009 in a 2\u20131 win over Lille and converted another goal the following week against Montpellier in a 2\u20132 draw. A month later, he scored in back-to-back matches against Nancy and Grenoble as Lorient won both matches. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 4\u20131 victory over Nice and, on 7 November, scored a double in the club's 5\u20130 thrashing of Boulogne. On 28 October, Gameiro scored the equalizing goal in Lorient's 2\u20132 stalemate with Grenoble converting the goal in injury time. The draw rose Lorient to 5th in the standings, the club's highest position that late in the season ever. On 27 January 2010, Gameiro scored the only goal in Lorient's upset victory over Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue. Two weeks later, he scored in Lorient's 3\u20130 humiliation of Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. The following week, Gameiro scored in a 1\u20131 draw with Toulouse. His consistent form prompted analysts to declare that Gameiro should be considered for the French national team, however, prior to the friendly against Spain on 3 March, Gameiro picked up an injury, which led to coach Raymond Domenech not considering him for the squad. Gameiro finished the 2009\u201310 campaign by scoring seven goals in the final nine league matches. He scored a brace against Saint-\u00c9tienne and converted opening goals in wins over Bordeaux, Grenoble, and Lille. In the six matches he scored in, Lorient won five and ultimately finished the campaign in 7th place; the club's highest finish in Ligue 1 ever.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Gameiro remained consistent. After missing the opening league match of the season, he returned to the team in mid-August. On 28 August, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Lyon. Following the international break, Gameiro scored a goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Monaco. On 6 November, he scored both goals in a 2\u20131 win over Saint-\u00c9tienne.
