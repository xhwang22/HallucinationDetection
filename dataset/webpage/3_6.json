He was the son of John Blair, a colonial official and nephew of James Blair, founder and first president of the College of William and Mary. Signer Blair graduated from that institution and studied law at London's Middle Temple. Thereafter, he practiced at Williamsburg. In the years 1766-70 he sat in the Virginia House of Burgesses as the representative of William and Mary. From 1770 to 1775 he held the position of clerk of the colony's council.\n\nAn active patriot, Blair signed the Virginia Association of June 22, 1770, which pledged to abandon importation of British goods until the Townshend Duties were repealed. He also underwrote the Association of May 27, 1774, calling for a meeting of the colonies in a Continental Congress and supporting the Bostonians. He took part in the Virginia constitutional convention (1776), at which he sat on the committee that framed a declaration of rights as well as the plan for a new government. He next served on the Privy Council (1776-78). In the latter year, the legislature elected him as a judge of the General Court, and he soon took over the chief justiceship. In 1780 he won election to Virginia's high chancery court, where his colleague was George Wythe.\n\nBlair attended the Constitutional Convention religiously but never spoke or served on a committee. He usually sided with the position of the Virginia delegation. And, in the commonwealth ratifying convention, Blair helped win backing for the new framework of government.\n\nIn 1789 Washington named Blair as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he helped decide many important cases. Resigning that post in 1796, he spent his remaining years in Williamsburg. A widower, his wife (born Jean Balfour) having died in 1792, he lived quietly until he succumbed in 1800. He was 68 years old. His tomb is in the graveyard of Bruton Parish Church.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-GW-533b)\n\nJames Madison, Virginia\n\nThe oldest of 10 children and a scion of the planter aristocracy, Madison was born in 1751 at Port Conway, King George County, VA, while his mother was visiting her parents. In a few weeks she journeyed back with her newborn son to Montpelier estate, in Orange County, which became his lifelong home. He received his early education from his mother, from tutors, and at a private school. An excellent scholar though frail and sickly in his youth, in 1771 he graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), where he demonstrated special interest in government and the law. But, considering the ministry for a career, he stayed on for a year of postgraduate study in theology.\n\nBack at Montpelier, still undecided on a profession, Madison soon embraced the patriot cause, and state and local politics absorbed much of his time. In 1775 he served on the Orange County committee of safety; the next year at the Virginia convention, which, besides advocating various Revolutionary steps, framed the Virginia constitution; in 1776-77 in the House of Delegates; and in 1778-80 in the Council of State. His ill health precluded any military service.\n\nIn 1780 Madison was chosen to represent Virginia in the Continental Congress (1780-83 and 1786-88). Although originally the youngest delegate, he played a major role in the deliberations of that body. Meantime, in the years 1784-86, he had again sat in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was a guiding force behind the Mount Vernon Conference (1785), attended the Annapolis Convention (1786), and was otherwise highly instrumental in the convening of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. He had also written extensively about deficiencies in the Articles of Confederation.\n\nMadison was clearly the preeminent figure at the convention. Some of the delegates favored an authoritarian central government; others, retention of state sovereignty; and most occupied positions in the middle of the two extremes. Madison, who was rarely absent and whose Virginia Plan was in large part the basis of the Constitution, tirelessly advocated a strong government, though many of his proposals were rejected. Despite his poor speaking capabilities, he took the floor more than 150 times, third only after Gouverneur Morris and James Wilson. Madison was also a member of numerous committees, the most important of which were those on postponed matters and style. His journal of the convention is the best single record of the event. He also played a key part in guiding the Constitution through the Continental Congress.\n\nPlaying a lead in the ratification process in Virginia, too, Madison defended the document against such powerful opponents as Patrick Henry, George Mason, and Richard Henry Lee. In New York, where Madison was serving in the Continental Congress, he collaborated with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in a series of essays that in 1787-88 appeared in the newspapers and were soon published in book form as The Federalist (1788). This set of essays is a classic of political theory and a lucid exposition of the republican principles that dominated the framing of the Constitution.\n\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives (1789-97), Madison helped frame and ensure passage of the Bill of Rights. He also assisted in organizing the executive department and creating a system of federal taxation. As leaders of the opposition to Hamilton's policies, he and Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nIn 1794 Madison married a vivacious widow who was 16 years his junior, Dolley Payne Todd, who had a son; they were to raise no children of their own. Madison spent the period 1797-1801 in semiretirement, but in 1798 he wrote the Virginia Resolutions, which attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts. While he served as Secretary of State (1801-9), his wife often served as President Jefferson's hostess.\n\nIn 1809 Madison succeeded Jefferson. Like the first three Presidents, Madison was enmeshed in the ramifications of European wars. Diplomacy had failed to prevent the seizure of U.S. ships, goods, and men on the high seas, and a depression wracked the country. Madison continued to apply diplomatic techniques and economic sanctions, eventually effective to some degree against France. But continued British interference with shipping, as well as other grievances, led to the War of 1812.\n\nThe war, for which the young nation was ill prepared, ended in stalemate in December 1814 when the inconclusive Treaty of Ghent which nearly restored prewar conditions, was signed. But, thanks mainly to Andrew Jackson's spectacular victory at the Battle of New Orleans (Chalmette) in January 1815, most Americans believed they had won. Twice tested, independence had survived, and an ebullient nationalism marked Madison's last years in office, during which period the Democratic-Republicans held virtually uncontested sway.\n\nIn retirement after his second term, Madison managed Montpelier but continued to be active in public affairs. He devoted long hours to editing his journal of the Constitutional Convention, which the government was to publish 4 years after his death. He served as co-chairman of the Virginia constitutional convention of 1829-30 and as rector of the University of Virginia during the period 1826-36. Writing newspaper articles defending the administration of Monroe, he also acted as his foreign policy adviser.\n\nMadison spoke out, too, against the emerging sectional controversy that threatened the existence of the Union. Although a slaveholder all his life, he was active during his later years in the American Colonization Society, whose mission was the resettlement of slaves in Africa.\n\nMadison died at the age of 85 in 1836, survived by his wife and stepson.\n\nImage: Courtesy of the Collection of Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa\n\nGeorge Mason, Virginia\n\nIn 1725 George Mason was born to George and Ann Thomson Mason. When the boy was 10 years old his father died, and young George's upbringing was left in the care of his uncle, John Mercer. The future jurist's education was profoundly shaped by the contents of his uncle's 1500-volume library, one-third of which concerned the law.\n\nMason established himself as an important figure in his community. As owner of Gunston Hall he was one of the richest planters in Virginia. In 1750 he married Anne Eilbeck, and in 23 years of marriage they had five sons and four daughters. In 1752 he acquired an interest in the Ohio Company, an organization that speculated in western lands. When the crown revoked the company's rights in 1773, Mason, the company's treasurer, wrote his first major state paper, Extracts from the Virginia Charters, with Some Remarks upon Them.\n\nDuring these years Mason also pursued his political interests. He was a justice of the Fairfax County court, and between 1754 and 1779 Mason was a trustee of the city of Alexandria. In 1759 he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. When the Stamp Act of 1765 aroused outrage in the colonies, George Mason wrote an open letter explaining the colonists' position to a committee of London merchants to enlist their support.\n\nIn 1774 Mason again was in the forefront of political events when he assisted in drawing up the Fairfax Resolves, a document that outlined the colonists' constitutional grounds for their objections to the Boston Port Act. Virginia's Declaration of Rights, framed by Mason in 1776, was widely copied in other colonies, served as a model for Jefferson in the first part of the Declaration of Independence, and was the basis for the federal Constitution's Bill of Rights.\n\nThe years between 1776 and 1780 were filled with great legislative activity. The establishment of a government independent of Great Britain required the abilities of persons such as George Mason. He supported the disestablishment of the church and was active in the organization of military affairs, especially in the West. The influence of his early work, Extracts from the Virginia Charters, is seen in the 1783 peace treaty with Great Britain, which fixed the Anglo-American boundary at the Great Lakes instead of the Ohio River. After independence, Mason drew up the plan for Virginia's cession of its western lands to the United States.\n\nBy the early 1780s, however, Mason grew disgusted with the conduct of public affairs and retired. He married his second wife, Sarah Brent, in 1780. In 1785 he attended the Mount Vernon meeting that was a prelude to the Annapolis convention of 1786, but, though appointed, he did not go to Annapolis.\n\nAt Philadelphia in 1787 Mason was one of the five most frequent speakers at the Constitutional Convention. He exerted great influence, but during the last 2 weeks of the convention he decided not to sign the document.\n\nMason's refusal prompts some surprise, especially since his name is so closely linked with constitutionalism. He explained his reasons at length, citing the absence of a declaration of rights as his primary concern. He then discussed the provisions of the Constitution point by point, beginning with the House of Representatives. The House he criticized as not truly representative of the nation, the Senate as too powerful. He also claimed that the power of the federal judiciary would destroy the state judiciaries, render justice unattainable, and enable the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. These fears led Mason to conclude that the new government was destined to either become a monarchy or fall into the hands of a corrupt, oppressive aristocracy.\n\nTwo of Mason's greatest concerns were incorporated into the Constitution. The Bill of Rights answered his primary objection, and the 11th amendment addressed his call for strictures on the judiciary.\n\nThroughout his career Mason was guided by his belief in the rule of reason and in the centrality of the natural rights of man. He approached problems coolly, rationally, and impersonally. In recognition of his accomplishments and dedication to the principles of the Age of Reason, Mason has been called the American manifestation of the Enlightenment. Mason died on October 7, 1792, and was buried on the grounds of Gunston Hall.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CP-121)\n\nJames McClurg, Virginia\n\nJames McClurg was born near Hampton, VA, in 1746. He attended the College of William and Mary and graduated in 1762. McClurg then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and received his degree in 1770. He pursued postgraduate medical studies in Paris and London and published Experiments upon the Human Bile and Reflections on the Biliary Secretions (1772) in London. His work and writings were well-received and respected by the medical community, and his article was translated into several languages. In 1773 McClurg returned to Virginia and served as a surgeon in the state militia during the Revolution.\n\nBefore the end of the war the College of William and Mary appointed McClurg its professor of anatomy and medicine. The same year, 1779, he married Elizabeth Seldon. James McClurg's reputation continued to grow, and he was regarded as one of the most eminent physicians in Virginia. In 1820 and 1821 he was president of the state medical society.\n\nIn addition to his medical practice, McClurg pursued politics. In 1782 James Madison advocated McClurg's appointment as secretary of foreign affairs for the United States but was unsuccessful. When Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry declined to serve as representatives to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, McClurg was asked to join Virginia's delegation. In Philadelphia McClurg advocated a life tenure for the President and argued for the ability of the federal government to override state laws. Even as some at the convention expressed apprehension of the powers allotted to the presidency, McClurg championed greater independence of the executive from the legislative branch. He left the convention in early August, however, and did not sign the Constitution.\n\nJames McClurg's political service did not end with the convention. During George Washington's administration McClurg served on Virginia's executive council. He died in Richmond, VA, on July 9, 1823.\n\nEdmund Randolph, Virginia\n\nOn August 10, 1753, Edmund Randolph was born in Tazewell Hall, Williamsburg, VA. His parents were Ariana Jenings and John Randolph. Edmund attended the College of William and Mary and continued his education by studying the law under his father's tutelage.\n\nWhen the Revolution broke out, father and son followed different paths. John Randolph, a Loyalist, followed the royal governor, Lord Dunmore, to England, in 1775. Edmund then lived with his uncle Peyton Randolph, a prominent figure in Virginia politics. During the war Edmund served as an aide-de-camp to General Washington and also attended the convention that adopted Virginia's first state constitution in 1776. He was the convention's youngest member at age 23. Randolph married Elizabeth Nicholas in 1776.\n\nRandolph continued to advance in the political world. He became mayor of Williamsburg and Virginia's attorney-general. In 1779 he was elected to the Continental Congress, and in November 1786 Randolph became Governor of Virginia. In 1786 he was a delegate to the Annapolis Convention.\n\nFour days after the opening of the federal convention in Philadelphia, on May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph presented the Virginia Plan for creating a new government. This plan proposed a strong central government composed of three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial, and enabled the legislative to veto state laws and use force against states that failed to fulfill their duties. After many debates and revisions, including striking the section permitting force against a state, the Virginia Plan became in large part the basis of the Constitution.\n\nThough Randolph introduced the highly centralized Virginia Plan, he fluctuated between the Federalist and Antifederalist points of view. He sat on the Committee of Detail that prepared a draft of the Constitution, but by the time the document was adopted, Randolph declined to sign. He felt it was not sufficiently republican, and he was especially wary of creating a one-man executive. He preferred a three-man council since he regarded \"a unity in the Executive\" to be the \"foetus of monarchy.\" In a Letter . . . on the Federal Constitution, dated October 10, 1787, Randolph explained at length his objections to the Constitution. The old Articles of Confederation were inadequate, he agreed, but the proposed new plan of union contained too many flaws. Randolph was a strong advocate of the process of amendment. He feared that if the Constitution were submitted for ratification without leaving the states the opportunity to amend it, the document might be rejected and thus close off any hope of another plan of union. However, he hoped that amendments would be permitted and second convention called to incorporate the changes.\n\nBy the time of the Virginia convention for ratification, Randolph supported the Constitution and worked to win his state's approval of it. He stated his reason for his switch: \"The accession of eight states reduced our deliberations to the single question of Union or no Union.\"\n\nUnder President Washington, Edmund Randolph became Attorney General of the United States. After Thomas Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State, Randolph assumed that post for the years 1794-95. During the Jefferson-Hamilton conflict he tried to remain unaligned. After retiring from politics in 1795, Randolph resumed his law practice and was regarded as a leading figure in the legal community. During his retirement he wrote a history of Virginia. When Aaron Burr went on trial for treason in 1807, Edmund Randolph acted as his senior counsel. In 1813, at age 60 and suffering from paralysis, Randolph died while visiting Nathaniel Burwell at Carter Hall. His body is buried in the graveyard of the nearby chapel.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CCD-40)\n\nGeorge Washington, Virginia\n\nThe eldest of six children from his father's second marriage, George Washington was born into the landed gentry in 1732 at Wakefield Plantation, VA. Until reaching 16 years of age, he lived there and at other plantations along the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers, including the one that later became known as Mount Vernon. His education was rudimentary, probably being obtained from tutors but possibly also from private schools, and he learned surveying. After he lost his father when he was 11 years old, his half-brother Lawrence, who had served in the Royal Navy, acted as his mentor. As a result, the youth acquired an interest in pursuing a naval career, but his mother discouraged him from doing so.\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1748, Washington joined a surveying party sent out to the Shenandoah Valley by Lord Fairfax, a land baron. For the next few years, Washington conducted surveys in Virginia and present West Virginia and gained a lifetime interest in the West. In 1751-52 he also accompanied Lawrence on a visit he made to Barbados, West Indies, for health reasons just before his death.\n\nThe next year, Washington began his military career when the royal governor appointed him to an adjutantship in the militia, as a major. That same year, as a gubernatorial emissary, accompanied by a guide, he traveled to Fort Le Boeuf, PA, in the Ohio River Valley, and delivered to French authorities an ultimatum to cease fortification and settlement in English territory. During the trip, he tried to better British relations with various Indian tribes.\n\nIn 1754, winning the rank of lieutenant colonel and then colonel in the militia, Washington led a force that sought to challenge French control of the Ohio River Valley, but met defeat at Fort Necessity, PA - an event that helped trigger the French and Indian War (1754-63). Late in 1754, irked by the dilution of his rank because of the pending arrival of British regulars, he resigned his commission. That same year, he leased Mount Vernon, which he was to inherit in 1761.\n\nIn 1755 Washington reentered military service with the courtesy title of colonel, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, and barely escaped death when the French defeated the general's forces in the Battle of the Monongahela, PA. As a reward for his bravery, Washington rewon his colonelcy and command of the Virginia militia forces, charged with defending the colony's frontier. Because of the shortage of men and equipment, he found the assignment challenging. Late in 1758 or early in 1759, disillusioned over governmental neglect of the militia and irritated at not rising in rank, he resigned and headed back to Mount Vernon.\n\nWashington then wed Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy widow and mother of two children. The marriage produced no offspring, but Washington reared those of his wife as his own. During the period 1759-74, he managed his plantations and sat in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He supported the initial protests against British policies; took an active part in the nonimportation movement in Virginia; and, in time, particularly because of his military experience, became a Whig leader.\n\nBy the 1770s, relations of the colony with the mother country had become strained. Measured in his behavior but strongly sympathetic to the Whig position and resentful of British restrictions and commercial exploitation, Washington represented Virginia at the First and Second Continental Congresses. In 1775, after the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord, Congress appointed him as commander in chief of the Continental Army. Overcoming severe obstacles, especially in supply, he eventually fashioned a well-trained and disciplined fighting force.\n\nThe strategy Washington evolved consisted of continual harassment of British forces while avoiding general actions. Although his troops yielded much ground and lost a number of battles, they persevered even during the dark winters at Valley Forge, PA, and Morristown, NJ. Finally, with the aid of the French fleet and army, he won a climactic victory at the Battle of Yorktown, VA, in 1781.\n\nDuring the next 2 years, while still commanding the agitated Continental Army, which was underpaid and poorly supplied, Washington denounced proposals that the military take over the government, including one that planned to appoint him as king, but supported army petitions to the Continental Congress for proper compensation. Once the Treaty of Paris (1783) was signed, he resigned his commission and returned once again to Mount Vernon. His wartime financial sacrifices and long absence, as well as generous loans to friends, had severely impaired his extensive fortune, which consisted mainly of his plantations, slaves, and landholdings in the West. At this point, however, he was to have little time to repair his finances, for his retirement was brief.\n\nDissatisfied with national progress under the Articles of Confederation, Washington advocated a stronger central government. He hosted the Mount Vernon Conference (1785) at his estate after its initial meetings in Alexandria, though he apparently did not directly participate in the discussions. Despite his sympathy with the goals of the Annapolis Convention (1786), he did not attend. But, the following year, encouraged by many of his friends, he presided over the Constitutional Convention, whose success was immeasurably influenced by his presence and dignity. Following ratification of the new instrument of government in 1788, the electoral college unanimously chose him as the first President.\n\nThe next year, after a triumphal journey from Mount Vernon to New York City, Washington took the oath of office at Federal Hall. During his two precedent-setting terms, he governed with dignity as well as restraint. He also provided the stability and authority the emergent nation so sorely needed, gave substance to the Constitution, and reconciled competing factions and divergent policies within the government and his administration. Although not averse to exercising presidential power, he respected the role of Congress and did not infringe upon its prerogatives. He also tried to maintain harmony between his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose differences typified evolving party divisions from which Washington kept aloof.\n\nYet, usually leaning upon Hamilton for advice, Washington supported his plan for the assumption of state debts, concurred in the constitutionality of the bill establishing the Bank of the United States, and favored enactment of tariffs by Congress to provide federal revenue and protect domestic manufacturers.\n\nWashington took various other steps to strengthen governmental authority, including suppression of the Whisky Rebellion (1794). To unify the country, he toured the Northeast in 1789 and the South in 1791. During his tenure, the government moved from New York to Philadelphia in 1790, he superintended planning for relocation to the District of Columbia, and he laid the cornerstone of the Capitol (1793).\n\nIn foreign affairs, despite opposition from the Senate, Washington exerted dominance. He fostered United States interests on the North American continent by treaties with Britain and Spain. Yet, until the nation was stronger, he insisted on the maintenance of neutrality. For example, when the French Revolution created war between France and Britain, he ignored the remonstrances of pro-French Jefferson and pro-English Hamilton.\n\nAlthough many people encouraged Washington to seek a third term, he was weary of politics and refused to do so. In his \"Farewell Address\" (1796), he urged his countrymen to forswear party spirit and sectional differences and to avoid entanglement in the wars and domestic policies of other nations.\n\nWashington enjoyed only a few years of retirement at Mount Vernon. Even then, demonstrating his continued willingness to make sacrifices for his country in 1798 when the nation was on the verge of war with France he agreed to command the army, though his services were not ultimately required. He died at the age of 67 in 1799. In his will, he emancipated his slaves.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nGeorge Wythe, Virginia\n\nGeorge Wythe, the second of Thomas and Margaret Wythe's three children, was born in 1726 on his family's plantation on the Back River in Elizabeth City County, VA. Both parents died when Wythe was young, and he grew up under the guardianship of his older brother, Thomas. Though Wythe was to become an eminent jurist and teacher, he received very little formal education. He learned Latin and Greek from his well-educated mother, and he probably attended for a time a grammar school operated by the College of William and Mary.\n\nWythe's brother later sent him to Prince George County to read law under an uncle. In 1746, at age 20, he joined the bar, moved to Spotsylvania County, and became associated with a lawyer there. In 1747 he married his partner's sister, Ann Lewis, but she died the next year. In 1754 Lt. Gov. Robert Dinwiddie appointed him as acting colonial attorney general, a position that he held for only a few months. The next year, Wythe's brother died and he inherited the family estate. He chose, however, to live in Williamsburg in the house that his new father-in-law, an architect, designed and built for him and his wife, Elizabeth Taliaferro. They married in 1755, and their only child died in infancy.\n\nAt Williamsburg, Wythe immersed himself in further study of the classics and the law and achieved accreditation by the colonial supreme court. He served in the House of Burgesses from the mid-1750s until 1775, first as delegate and after 1769 as clerk. In 1768 he became mayor of Williamsburg, and the next year he sat on the board of visitors of the College of William and Mary. During these years he also directed the legal studies of young scholars, notably Thomas Jefferson. Wythe and Jefferson maintained a lifelong friendship, first as mentor and pupil and later as political allies.\n\nWythe first exhibited revolutionary leanings in 1764 when Parliament hinted to the colonies that it might impose a stamp tax. By then an experienced legislator, he drafted for the House of Burgesses a remonstrance to Parliament so strident that his fellow delegates modified it before adoption. Wythe was one of the first to express the concept of separate nationhood for the colonies within the British empire.\n\nWhen war broke out, Wythe volunteered for the army but was sent to the Continental Congress. Although present from 1775 through 1776, Wythe exerted little influence and signed the Declaration of Independence after the formal signing in August 1776. That same year, Wythe, Jefferson, and Edmund Pendleton undertook a 3-year project to revise Virginia's legal code. In 1777 Wythe also presided as speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nAn appointment as one of the three judges of the newly created Virginia high court of chancery followed in 1778. For 28 years, during 13 of which he was the only chancellor, Wythe charted the course of Virginia jurisprudence. In addition, he was an ex officio member of the state superior court.\n\nWythe's real love was teaching. In 1779 Jefferson and other officials of the College of William and Mary created the first chair of law in a U.S. institution of higher learning and appointed Wythe to fill it. In that position, he educated America's earliest college-trained lawyers, among them John Marshall and James Monroe. In 1787 he attended the Constitutional Convention but played an insignificant role. He left the proceedings early and did not sign the Constitution. The following year, however, he was one of the Federalist leaders at the Virginia ratifying convention. There he presided over the Committee of the Whole and offered the resolution for ratification.\n\nIn 1791, the year after Wythe resigned his professorship, his chancery duties caused him to move to Richmond, the state capital. He was reluctant to give up his teaching, however, and opened a private law school. One of his last and most promising pupils was young Henry Clay.\n\nIn 1806, in his eightieth year, Wythe died at Richmond under mysterious circumstances, probably of poison administered by his grandnephew and heir, George Wythe Sweeney. Reflecting a lifelong aversion to slavery, Wythe emancipated his slaves in his will. His grave is in the yard of St. John's Episcopal Church in Richmond.\n\nBack to Main Founding Fathers Page"}, {"url": "https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation", "page_content": "Transcript\n\nTo all to whom these Presents shall come, we, the undersigned Delegates of the States affixed to our Names send greeting.

After beginning his formal education at Marischal College, Aberdeen, Blair studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1669 to 1673, when he received the degree of master of arts. He remained at Edinburgh for several additional years studying theology. In the summer of 1679 he was ordained by John Paterson, bishop of Edinburgh. Henry, Bishop of London That same summer Blair was appointed minister at Cranstoun Parish, a few miles outside Edinburgh. He remained two and a half years, serving, according to the bishop, \u201cwith exemplary diligence, care and gravity,\u201d although a dispute with parish landowners over his reimbursement for repairs to the manse suggests that the combative nature that he later exhibited in Virginia was already well developed. In December 1681 Blair was removed from his parish after he refused to subscribe to a test oath that the Scottish Parliament imposed because it would have required him to accept the Roman Catholic duke of York as head of the Scottish church when he became king. Blair left for England, where he gained the support of Gilbert Burnet, a fellow Scottish cleric who later became bishop of Salisbury. Burnet secured Blair a clerkship in the Rolls Office and provided him an opportunity to meet other influential Anglican clerics, including Henry Compton, who as bishop of London had jurisdiction over the Anglican church in the American colonies. Compton persuaded Blair to accept an appointment in Virginia as rector of Henrico Parish (then frequently referred to as Varina Parish).\n\nIn Virginia Sarah Harrison Blair Blair\u2019s career advanced rapidly after his arrival in Virginia late in 1685. Preaching at other parish churches as well as at his own, he came to know and be known to members of the colony\u2019s most important families. Within two years he made the first of many land purchases, and on June 2, 1687, he married seventeen-year-old Sarah Harrison, of Surry County. The marriage was unhappy. At the wedding she adamantly refused to assent to the portion of the ceremony obliging her to obey her husband. They apparently had no children, and she may have become an alcoholic. Sarah Harrison Blair died on May 5, 1713, and James Blair lived another thirty years as a widower. Blair\u2019s marriage brought him into the inner circle of the colony\u2019s leading families, and his relatives often dominated the influential governor\u2019s Council. His ecclesiastical career prospered. In mid-May 1690 a new lieutenant governor, Francis Nicholson, arrived in Virginia, bringing a commission of December 15, 1689, from Bishop Compton naming Blair commissary, or the bishop\u2019s representative with authority to preside over the Anglican clergy of the colony in administrative matters. Often thought to have been the first to hold that office in Virginia, Blair had in fact been preceded in the post by John Clayton. Royal Charter for the College of William and Mary Blair moved without delay to establish his authority by calling a convocation of the clergy for July 23, 1690. Neither his Scottish origins nor his tendency to side with the Virginia laity in religious affairs endeared him to the larger number of his fellow clerics, who often opposed him vigorously, especially in the infrequent convocations that he called. The convocations held in August 1705 and April 1719 proved particularly rancorous. In the latter meeting his fellow clergymen unsuccessfully challenged the validity of his ordination in Scotland, a move that could have lost him his influential positions as rector and commissary. Blair\u2019s initial convocation was more auspicious, however, for he there first advanced \u201cSeveral Propositions\u201d for the founding of a college in the colony and won enthusiastic support. In cooperation with Nicholson, who deserves to rank with Blair as a cofounder, he cultivated the support of Virginia\u2019s political leaders. By June 1691 Blair left for England to seek the backing of King William, Queen Mary, and others. His mission required almost two years and resulted in the grant of a royal charter for the College of William and Mary on February 8, 1693, as well as substantial public and private financial support.\n\nEducation and Politics Sir Edmund Andros Blair returned to Virginia in triumph. Named president for life in the charter, he launched the new college on land acquired at the crossroads settlement of Middle Plantation a few miles from the capital at Jamestown. His task was not easy. In his absence enthusiasm for the project had declined, and Sir Edmund Andros, the new governor, was openly hostile. Blair nonetheless managed to inaugurate one branch of the institution, its grammar school, and to commence construction of a building. Over Andros\u2019s objections Blair also secured a place on the Council, taking his seat for the first time on July 18, 1694. The next year he consolidated his position when he became rector of James City Parish, close to the seat of government as well as the new college. Blair\u2019s relations with the governor soon worsened, and following his public criticism of Andros and the other councillors, they suspended him on April 26, 1695. He was reinstated on September 25, 1696, but suspended again on April 20, 1697. The infighting between Blair and Andros culminated in the summer of 1697 when, with financial and political backing from Francis Nicholson, Blair returned to England to present his grievances to ecclesiastical and political authorities. A key hearing before the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London was a one-sided affair with Blair able to speak in person to the sympathetic panel. The absent Andros was primarily represented by the young William Byrd (1674\u20131744), who was never allowed to deliver the lengthy brief he had prepared. On May 31, 1698, Andros was granted permission to resign and return to England on personal business. The Present State of Virginia, and the College. During his English sojourn Blair collaborated with two other men experienced in the government of Virginia, Henry Hartwell and Edward Chilton, in preparing a long report for the newly created Board of Trade on the state of affairs of the colony and how to improve it. Published nearly thirty years later as The Present State of Virginia, and the College (1727), it quickly became one of the more influential contemporary books about the condition of Virginia and the lives of Virginians at the end of the seventeenth century. Nicholson succeeded Andros as governor in December 1698 shortly after Blair\u2019s return to Virginia. Blair was eventually reappointed to the Council, taking his seat on June 9, 1701, and serving for the remainder of his life. Although he cooperated with Nicholson in 1699 in a successful effort to move the capital from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, which was renamed Williamsburg, the two equally imperious men came into conflict during the next few years. The ill will culminated in Blair\u2019s second trip to England to lobby for the removal of a governor. He left in 1703, bearing a petition that he and five other Council members had signed. Nicholson was at a distinct disadvantage due to his inability to appear in person, the death early in the hearings of his principal defender, and the capture by the French of the vessel carrying his supporting documentation. On April 5, 1705, the Board of Trade removed Nicholson as governor of Virginia. Old Bruton Church, Williamsburg, Virginia, in the Time of Lord Dunmore Blair\u2019s success was, however, hardly complete. Nicholson remained a trustee of the college and continued with the support of most of Virginia\u2019s Anglican clergy to oppose Blair\u2019s direction of the college and his attempts to govern the colonial church. Then on October 29, 1705, the main college building caught fire and burned to its exterior walls. The resultant inquiry stirred further animosity between Blair and his opponents. In 1710 the death of one of his most outspoken clerical opponents, Solomon Whateley, afforded Blair the opportunity to become rector of Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, and for more than a decade he had no serious difficulty with Governor Edward Nott or his successor, Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood. Blair used the time to solidify his position with Virginia political leaders. By that time, too, his brother Archibald Blair (by 1665\u20131733), a physician who had also immigrated to Virginia, had established himself as a successful Williamsburg merchant in a firm in which James Blair, to his considerable profit, became a silent partner. Alexander Spotswood Rebuilding the college was a more serious challenge, but Blair made the first of two rescues of William and Mary from the brink of failure. With the help of Spotswood and others, he found new money in England and America, began reconstruction of the college building that was first occupied by 1716 and largely completed by 1721, and for the first time expanded instruction beyond the grammar school by appointing a master of the Indian School and the first professor of natural philosophy and mathematics, Hugh Jones. As early as 1718 or 1719, however, Blair became embroiled in a controversy with Spotswood. The issues at stake had more to do with religious and political matters than with the college, and they again brought Blair into conflict with his fellow clerics, including the faculty. In 1721 he set off for England again. On this occasion, however, Spotswood was already in difficulty with his superiors on other grounds, and thus the commissary\u2019s role in his dismissal has often been overemphasized, adding to Blair\u2019s not entirely deserved reputation as a breaker of governors. The trip afforded Blair an opportunity to arrange for publication in London of Our Saviour\u2019s Divine Sermon on the Mount (1722), a five-volume collection of 117 sermons he had delivered between 1707 and 1721. True to character, Blair was dissatisfied with sales, but the sermons were reprinted in four volumes in 1740 and in Danish in 1761. The sermons dealt more with matters of morality and personal conduct than with doctrine, a reminder that, despite his other concerns and interests, Blair was an active parish minister throughout his long career.\n\nLater Years The Bodleian Plate Engraved Copperplate of Colonial-Era Williamsburg\n\nPrint Made from Bodleian Copperplate\n\nHugh Drysdale Blair was in his late sixties when he returned from England on the same ship with the new lieutenant governor,. Blair appeared to be at the height of his power in the political establishment of Virginia. Yet despite its new building the college that he had founded and headed for more than three decades was once again on the verge of extinction, with a dearth of funds and students and a curriculum confined to precollegiate instruction in the grammar and Indian schools. Blair set to work and by the end of the 1720s had achieved nothing less than a second founding of the institution, helped again by a period in which few political issues diverted him from the task. A round of new construction added the Brafferton (1723) to house the Indian school and the library, a chapel wing on the main building (1732), and a president\u2019s house (1733). The crowning achievements, however, were the preparation of the first college statutes in 1727; the hiring for the first time of the full complement of six masters, including professors of moral and natural philosophy and divinity; and with those preconditions met, the transfer of the original charter of 1693 into the hands of the president and masters on August 15, 1729. Blair was able to use his secure position in the social and political elite of Virginia to contribute significantly to the evolution of autonomous institutions in the colony. Rather than an outpost of imperial culture controlled by a largely English clerical faculty, under Blair\u2019s guidance William and Mary became a college governed primarily by prominent colonists who sat on its board of visitors and shaped it to serve their educational goals. Likewise, Blair\u2019s actions as commissary aided the development of an established Anglican church dominated by laymen who ran its parish vestries, a model that more closely resembled the operations of the church in Scotland during Blair\u2019s youth and ministry in that country than it did the functioning of the parent Church of England during the eighteenth century. Blair\u2019s relations with Lieutenant Governor William Gooch, the last chief executive on whose Council he served, were amicable. Gooch\u2019s private opinion of Blair was negative, but he resolved to \u201ckill him with kindness.\u201d By then Blair was declining in health and vigor. In his last years he retained all of his official positions as president of the college, commissary, parish rector, and councillor, although he was not always able to perform all of his duties. The senior member of the Council, Blair served as president (in effect, acting governor) from October 15, 1740, to July 1741 while Gooch was away on a military expedition to the West Indies.

He made several charitable bequests, including \u00a3100 for teaching poor children and \u00a3500 for the education of a clergyman. He left his books to the library of the College of William and Mary and the remainder of his estate, estimated at \u00a310,000, to his favorite nephew John Blair (ca. 1687\u20131771), whose education he had overseen. James Blair died in Williamsburg of a gangrenous rupture on April 18, 1743. He was buried beside his wife in the Jamestown churchyard."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/protestant-christianity-biographies/james-blair", "page_content": "James Blair\n\nThe British educator James Blair (1655-1743) was commissary of Virginia for the bishop of London and founder and first president of the College of William and Mary.\n\nBorn to a Presbyterian minister and his wife in Scotland, James Blair attended Marischal College, Aberdeen, for 2 years. He received a master of arts degree from the University of Edinburgh, where he remained to study divinity. In 1679 he settled as a minister of the Scottish Episcopal Church near Edinburgh. Two years later, because he scrupled to sign the Scottish Test Act, he was deprived of a living anywhere in Scotland. He went to London, where he became acquainted with Henry Compton, the bishop of London, who persuaded him to go to Virginia as a missionary.\n\nAfter 5 years in Virginia, Blair was appointed commissary (deputy) to the bishop of London, with authority to supervise the discipline of the Anglican clergy, though without the power to confirm baptisms or ordain American-born ministers. In one of his first acts he convened the clergy to urge them to found a college. They readily complied with a plan for a grammar school, a philosophical college, and a divinity school, which soon won the approval of Governor Francis Nicholson and the General Assembly.\n\nIn 1691 Blair went to England to obtain a charter and funds for the college. When he returned to Virginia 2 years later, he was the first president and rector of the board of visitors of the College of William and Mary, founded \"to the End that the Church of Virginia may be furnished with a Seminary of Ministers of the Gospel, and that the Youth may be piously educated in good Letters and Manners, and that the Christian Faith may be propagated amongst the Western Indians, to the Glory of Almighty God.\"\n\nFor its first 36 years the college was no more than a grammar school, without enough funds to hire the six professors contemplated in the charter. Some of the blame must be laid to Blair; he did no teaching yet demanded his annual salary of \u00a3150, which cut deeply into the college's funds. And although Blair could have done much for the college from the seat on the governor's council he assumed in 1694, his feuds with a succession of governors eroded his influence and alienated both the clergy and the gentry.\n\nBlair brought a measure of English religion and culture to colonial Virginia through his control of the Anglican Church and promotion of education. When he died on April 18, 1743, he left an estate of \u00a310,000 to a nephew and only his library and \u00a3500 to the college.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe introduction by Hunter Dickinson Farish in the 1940 reprint of Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton, The Present State of Virginia, and The College (1727), contains useful information on Blair.

Baldwin was a Georgia representative in the Continental Congress and served in the United States House of Representatives and Senate after the adoption of the Constitution.\n\nBaldwin was born at Guilford, Connecticut. He was the second son of a blacksmith who fathered 12 children by two wives. Besides Abraham, several of the family attained distinction in life. His sister Ruth Baldwin married the poet and diplomat Joel Barlow, and his half-brother Henry became an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Their ambitious father went heavily into debt to educate his children.\n\nAfter attending a local village school, Abraham graduated from Yale University in nearby New Haven in 1772. Three years later, he became a minister and tutor at the college. He held that position until 1779, when he served as a chaplain in the Continental Army. Two years later, he declined an offer from Yale for a divinity professorship. Instead of resuming his ministerial or educational duties after the war, he turned to the study of law and in 1783 was admitted to the bar at Fairfield.\n\nAfter Baldwin turned down a prestigious teaching position as professor of divinity at Yale, Georgia governor Lyman Hall persuaded him to accept the responsibility of creating an educational plan for both secondary and higher education in the state. Baldwin strongly believed that education was the key to developing frontier states like Georgia. Once elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in the state legislature, he developed a comprehensive educational plan that ultimately included land grants from the state to fund the establishment of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia. Through Baldwin's efforts, UGA became the first state-chartered school in the nation when UGA was incorporated on January 27, 1785. Baldwin served as the first president of the institution during its initial planning phase, from 1785 to 1801. In 1801, Franklin college, UGA's initial college, opened to students with Josiah Meigs succeeding Baldwin as president to oversee the inaugural class of students. The school was architecturally modeled on Baldwin's alma mater, Yale.\n\nWithin a year, Baldwin moved to Georgia, won legislative approval to practice law, and obtained a land grant in Wilkes County. In 1789 he sat in the assembly and the Continental Congress. Two years later, his father died after a heart attack. He later also sat in the Constitutional Congress and helped in the bringing down of the Articles of Confederation and signed the Constitution which helped shape America into the form of government it has today.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was a veteran of the American Revolution, a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, and a member of the Federalist Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly, as Governor of Delaware, and as U.S. Senator from Delaware.\n\nBassett was born at Bohemia Ferry in Cecil County, Maryland, son of Arnold and Judith Thompson Bassett. His father was a part time tavern owner and farmer, but deserted the family when Bassett was young. Richard married Ann Ennals in 1774 and they had three children, Richard Ennals, Ann (known as Nancy), and Mary. After his first wife\u2019s death he married Betsy Garnett in 1796. They were active members of the Methodist Church, and gave the church much of their time and attention.\n\nFortunately, Bassett\u2019s mother was the great granddaughter and an heiress of Augustine Herrman, the original owner of Bohemia Manor, a massive estate in Cecil County, and her family raised Bassett. Eventually this heritage provided him with inherited wealth and a plantation, Bohemia Manor, in Cecil County, Maryland, and much other property in New Castle County, Delaware.\n\nBassett studied the law under Judge Robert Goldsborough of Dorchester County, Maryland and in 1770 was admitted to the Bar. He moved to Dover, Delaware, then just the court town of Kent County, and began a practice there. By concentrating on agricultural pursuits as well as religious and charitable concerns, he quickly established himself amongst the local gentry and \u201cdeveloped a reputation for hospitality and philanthropy.\u201d\n\nBassett was a reluctant revolutionary, more closely in tune with the approach of George Read than with his neighbors from Kent County: Caesar Rodney and John Haslet. Nevertheless, in 1774 he was elected to the local Boston Relief Committee. When the new government of Delaware was organized, Bassett served on the 1776 Delaware Council of Safety, and was a member of the convention responsible for drafting the Delaware Constitution of 1776, which was adopted September 20, 1776. He was then one of the conservatives elected to Delaware's first Legislative Council, and served for four sessions, from 1776/77 through 1779/80. Subsequently, he was a member of the House of Assembly for the 1780/81 and 1781/82 sessions, and returned to the Legislative Council, for three sessions from 1782/83 through 1784/85. He concluded his state legislative career with a final term in the House of Assembly during the 1786/87 session. He thereby represented Kent County in all but one session of the Delaware General Assembly from independence to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution of 1787.\n\nHowever, Bassett\u2019s most notable contributions during the American Revolution were his efforts to mobilize the state\u2019s military. Some sources credit him with developing the plans for raising and staffing the 1st Delaware Regiment, with his neighbor, John Haslet at its command. Known as the \"Delaware Continentals\" or \"Delaware Blues,\" they were from the smallest state, but at some 800 men, were the largest battalion in the army. David McCullough in 1776 describes them \"turned out in handsome red trimmed blue coats, white waistcoats, buckskin breeches, white woolen stockings, and carrying fine, 'lately imported' English muskets. Raised in early 1776, they went into service in July and August 1776. Bassett also participated in the recruitment of the reserve militia that served in the \u201cFlying Camp\u201d of 1776, and the Dover Light Infantry, led by another neighbor, Thomas Rodney.\n\nWhen the British Army marched through northern New Castle County, on the way to the Battle of Brandywine and the capture of Philadelphia, Bassett \u201cappears to have joined his friend Rodney in the field as a volunteer.\u201d Once the Delaware militia returned home after the British retired from the area, Bassett continued as a part-time soldier, assuming command of the Dover Light Horse, Kent County's militia cavalry unit.\n\nBassett was one of the delegates at the Constitutional Convention. He did not supply much input, but did sign the constitution. Meanwhile, the Delaware Constitution of 1776, was in need of revision, and Bassett once again joined with John Dickinson in leading the convention to draft a revision, which became the Delaware Constitution of 1792. Upon his retirement from the United States Senate in 1793 Bassett began a six-year term as the first Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Delaware. At the time it was a court of general civil jurisdiction and the predecessor of the present Delaware Superior Court. By this time Bassett was formally a member of the Federalist Party, and as such was elected Governor of Delaware in 1799. It was during his time in office that Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours first came to Delaware to begin his gunpowder business.\n\nHowever, it was also during his term that Thomas Jefferson was elected President of the United States, causing great concern for the future of the country among the Federalists. The retiring President John Adams, rushed the Judiciary Act of 1801 through the Federalist 6th Congress, creating a number of new judgeships on the United States circuit courts. Being a staunch Federalist and old political ally, Adams, on his last day in office, February 18, 1801, appointed Bassett to one of the positions, as judge of the Third Circuit. He was one of the so-called \"midnight judges.\" Bassett was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1801, and received his commission the same day. But the legislation was repealed by the new Jeffersonian 7th Congress, and his tenure ended quickly on July 1, 1802. He never again held public office.\n\nIn addition to his high profile in government, Bassett was a devout and energetic convert to Methodism. Having met Francis Asbury in 1778 at the home of their mutual friend, Judge Thomas White, Bassett soon had a conversion experience, and for the remainder of his life devoted much of his attention and wealth to the promotion of Methodism. He and Asbury remained lifelong friends. This association caused him to become linked in many people\u2019s minds to the loyalists, as both White and Asbury were viewed to be opposed to the war. But it also led to a strong abolitionist belief, which led him to free his own slaves and advocate the emancipation of others.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He is often confused with his cousin, Gunning Bedford, Sr. (1742-1797), an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution and Governor of Delaware.\n\nBedford was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the College of New Jersey, (now Princeton University) in 1771. He read law to enter the Bar in 1779, and had a private practice in Delaware from 1779 to 1783. He was elected to the Delaware legislature. In 1784, he was appointed Attorney General and served in that position for five years. He was also a delegate to the Federal Constitutional Convention in 1787, and a Delaware state senator in 1788.\n\nBedford was the most vocal supporter of giving small states equal power in the federal government to large states; his experience in local politics, along with his service in the Continental Congress, taught him much about the political and economic vulnerabilities of states like Delaware. Unlike some other small-state representatives who looked to the creation of a strong central government to protect their interests against more powerful neighbors, Bedford sought to limit the powers of the new government. But when the conflict over representation threatened to wreck the Constitutional Convention, he laid regional interests aside and, for the good of the country, sought to compromise.\n\nConcerned primarily with the fate of the small states in a federal union potentially dominated by powerful, populous neighbors, the fiery Bedford warned the delegates at Philadelphia that the small states might have to seek foreign alliances for their own protection. Bedford's threat, \"the small ones would find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice\" was shouted down as treasonous by the other delegates. At first he joined with those who sought merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, believing, as one delegate contended, \"there is no middle way between a perfect consolidation of the states into one nation and a mere confederacy of the states. The first is out of the question, and in the latter they must continue if not perfectly yet equally sovereign\".\n\nBut when the idea of drafting a new Constitution was accepted, he supported the New Jersey Plan, a scheme that provided equal representation for the states in the national legislature, a point on which the Delaware legislature had instructed its delegates not to compromise. He called for strong limitations on the powers of the executive branch and recommended measures by which the states could maintain close control over the national legislature and judiciary, including the appointment of federal judges by the state legislatures. Bedford's speeches in support of these ideas led Georgia delegate William Pierce to describe him as a \"bold\" speaker, with \"a very commanding and striking manner;\" but \"warm and impetuous in his temper and precipitate in his judgement\".\n\nRealizing as the Convention sessions went on that unyielding adherence to his position would endanger the union, Bedford adopted a more flexible stance. He agreed to sit on the committee that drafted the Great Compromise, which settled the thorny question of representation and made possible the Convention's acceptance of the new plan of government.\n\nBedford was a delegate to Delaware's ratification convention. Thanks to his efforts, along with those of John Dickinson, Richard Bassett, and others, Delaware became the first state to approve the Constitution. He resigned his post as Delaware's attorney general in 1789. Widely respected for his knowledge of the law, Bedford was asked by Delaware's senators and fellow signers George Read and Richard Bassett to review a bill, then under consideration, on the organization of the federal judiciary system. Bedford was now to feel watched.\n\nBedford praised the document, which would become the Judiciary Act of 1789, created by 1 Stat. 73, one of the most important pieces of legislation of the period, as a \"noble work;\" but expressed some concerns as well. He admitted that the common law of the United States was difficult to define. \"Yet\", he claimed, \"the dignity of America requires that it [a definition] be ascertained, and that where we refer to laws they should be laws of our own country. If the principles of the laws of any other country are good and worthy of adoption, incorporate them into your own\". He believed the Constitution's ratification had been the moment of \"legal emancipation\", declaring that \"as the foundation is laid so must the superstructure be built\".\n\nOn September 24, 1789, President George Washington selected Bedford to be the first judge for the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Two days later, Bedford was confirmed by the United States Senate, and received his commission to the court, a position he held until his death.\n\nBedford never lost educational interest in his local community,. Believing the establishment of schools \"is, on all hands, justly acknowledged to be an object of first importance;\" he worked for the improvement of education in Wilmington. He was president of the Board of Trustees of Wilmington Academy, and when that institution became Wilmington College, he became its first president. He also served as the first Grand Master of the Delaware Masonic Lodge.\n\nHe died in Wilmington, Delaware, on March 30, 1812. He is buried at the Masonic Home in Christiana, Delaware.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

A famous legal scholar, he avoided the tumult of state politics, preferring to work behind the scenes. But he was devoted to the idea of a permanent union of the newly independent states and loyally supported fellow Virginians James Madison and George Washington at the Constitutional Convention. His greatest contribution as a Founding Father came not in Philadelphia, but later as a judge on the Virginia court of appeals and on the U.S. Supreme Court, where he influenced the interpretation of the Constitution in a number of important decisions. Contemporaries praised Blair for such personal strengths as gentleness and benevolence, and for his ability to penetrate immediately to the heart of a legal question.\n\nBorn in Williamsburg, Virginia, Blair was a member of a prominent Virginia family. He served as mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia from 1751 to 1752. His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His granduncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary. Blair attended William and Mary, receiving an A.B. in 1754. In 1755 he went to London to study law at the Middle Temple. Returning home to practice law, he was quickly thrust into public life, beginning his public career shortly after the close of the French and Indian War with his election to the seat reserved for the College of William and Mary in the House of Burgesses (1766-70). He went on to become clerk of the Royal Governor's Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature (1770-75).\n\nBlair originally joined the moderate wing of the Patriot cause. He opposed Patrick Henry's extremist resolutions in protest of the Stamp Act, but the dissolution of the House of Burgesses by Parliament profoundly altered his views. In response to a series of Parliamentary taxes on the colonies, Blair joined Booker T. Washington and others in 1770 and again in 1774 to draft nonimportation agreements which pledged their supporters to cease importing British goods until the taxes were repealed. In the latter year he reacted to Parliament's passage of the Intolerable Acts by joining those calling for a Continental Congress and pledging support for the people of Boston who were suffering economic hardship because of Parliament's actions.\n\nWhen the Revolution began, Blair became deeply involved in the government of his state. He served as a member of the convention that drew up Virginia's constitution (1776) and held a number of important committee positions, including a seat on the Committee of 28 that framed Virginia's Declaration of Rights and plan of government. He served on the Privy Council, Governor Patrick Henry's major advisory group (1776-78). The legislature elected him to a judgeship in the general court in 1778 and soon thereafter to the post of chief justice. He was named Grand Master of Freemasons in Virginia under the newly organized Grand Lodge of Virginia in 1778. He was also elected to Virginia's high court of chancery (1780), where his colleague was George Wythe, later a fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention. These judicial appointments automatically made Blair a member of Virginia's first court of appeals. In 1786, the legislature, recognizing Blair's prestige as a jurist, appointed him Thomas Jefferson's successor on a committee revising the laws of Virginia.\n\nOn September 24, 1789, Blair was nominated by President George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26, 1789, and received his commission on September 30. Blair resigned on October 25, 1795, and died in Williamsburg, five years later.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention for North Carolina, the first and only governor of the Southwest Territory, and Democratic-Republican Senator from Tennessee (1796\u20131797). He played a major role in establishing the state of Tennessee. He was the first U.S. Senator to be expelled from the Senate and the only Senator expelled outside of the Civil War.\n\nBlount was born near Windsor, North Carolina in Bertie County into a family of distinguished merchants and planters who owned extensive properties along the banks of the Pamlico River.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Blount accepted appointment as the regimental paymaster for the 3rd North Carolina Regiment. Although a regimental paymaster was not a commissioned officer with command responsibility on the battlefield, Blount served under a warrant on the regimental staff and drew the same pay and allowances as a captain. He also participated in the regiment's march north in the late spring of 1777 when it joined Washington's main army in defense of Philadelphia against Sir William Howe's Royal forces. Blount and his comrades had participated in one of the key battles of the war. By demonstrating Washington's willingness to fight and the Continental Army's recuperative powers, the battle convinced France that the Americans were in the war to the end and directly influenced France's decision to support the Revolution openly.\n\nAfter the battle, Blount returned home to become chief paymaster of state forces and later deputy paymaster general for North Carolina. For the next three years he remained intimately involved in the demanding task of recruiting and reequipping forces to be used in support both of Washington's main army in the north and of separate military operations in defense of the southern tier of states.\n\nThe fall of Charleston, South Carolina, to British forces under Sir Henry Clinton in May 1780 exposed North Carolina to invasion. The state again faced the difficult task of raising new units, this time to counter a force of British, Hessian, and Loyalist troops under General Charles Cornwallis. Blount not only helped organize these citizen-soldiers but also took to the field with them. His North Carolina unit served under General Horatio Gates, who hastily engaged Cornwallis in a bloody battle at Camden, South Carolina. On August 16 Gates deployed his units \u2013 his continentals to the right, the North Carolina and Virginia militia on his left flank \u2013 and ordered an advance. The American soldiers were exhausted from weeks of marching and insufficient rations. Furthermore, the militia elements had only recently joined with the regulars, and disciplined teamwork between the two components had not yet been achieved. Such teamwork was especially necessary before hastily assembled militia units could be expected to perform the intricate infantry maneuvers of 18th century linear warfare. While the Continentals easily advanced against the enemy, the militia quickly lost their cohesion in the smoke and confusion, and their lines crumbled before the counterattacking British. Cornwallis then shifted all his forces against the continentals. In less than an hour Gates' army had been lost. This second defeat in the South, the result of inadequate preparations, provided the young Blount a lesson that would stand him in good stead in later years. It also marked the end of Blount's active military career.\n\nBlount was appointed Governor of the Territory South of the Ohio River by President George Washington in 1790. Blount governed from the home of William Cobb, Rocky Mount, located in current Piney Flats, Tennessee. After concluding the Treaty of Holston, he announced that the territorial capital would move to newly founded Knoxville. Blount named Knoxville after the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox. After moving to Knoxville, construction began on his mansion, known as Blount Mansion, in 1792. The mansion still stands in downtown Knoxville and is a popular museum.\n\nWhile serving as U.S. Senator, Blount's affairs took a sharp turn for the worse. In 1797 his land speculations in western lands led him into serious financial difficulties. That same year, he apparently concocted a plan to incite the Creek and Cherokee Indians to aid the British in conquering the Spanish territory of West Florida. A letter he wrote alluding to the plan fell into the hands of President John Adams, who turned it over to the Senate on July 3, 1797. Four days later, on July 7, the United States House of Representatives voted to impeach Blount and on July 8 the Senate voted 25 to 1 to expel him from the Senate. The Senate began an impeachment trial on December 17, 1798, but dropped charges two months later on the grounds that no further action could be taken beyond his expulsion. That set an important precedent for the future with regard to the limitations on actions which could be taken by Congress against its members and former members.\n\nThe episode did not seem to hamper Blount's career in Tennessee. In 1798 he was elected to the Tennessee State Senate and rose to the speakership. He died two years later at Knoxville, where he is buried in the cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn 1792, while governor of the Southwest Territory, Blount built the William Blount Mansion in Knoxville. The mansion is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nBlount County, Tennessee is named after Blount. Grainger County, Tennessee and Maryville, Tennessee are both named after his wife, Mary Grainger Blount. William Blount High School, William Blount Middle School, and Mary Blount Elementary School are named after Blount and his wife. (Blount County, Alabama is named after his younger half-brother Willie Blount, later governor of Tennessee). Raleigh, North Carolina has a street named after Blount going though the center of its downtown.\n\nBlount was the father of William Grainger Blount (1784\u20131827), Tennessee state representative and U.S. Representative from Tennessee, 1815-1819. He was half-brother of Willie Blount (1767\u20131835), Governor of Tennessee, 1809-1815. He was brother to Thomas Blount (1759\u20131812), Revolutionary War veteran and U.S. Representative from North Carolina, 1793-1799, 1805-1809, and 1811-1812.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

David was 5' 7\" tall and weighed 185 lb. He maintained this weight until his retirement, when he gained 20 lb. Upon graduating, he read law and practiced in Allentown, New Jersey and resided in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.\n\nWith the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Brearley was at first a captain in the Monmouth County militia, and rose to the rank of colonel in Nathaniel Heard's New Jersey militia brigade. From 1776 to 1779 he served in the New Jersey Line of the Continental Army, seeing action at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth.\n\nBrearley resigned from the army in 1779 to serve as the New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice. He decided on the famous Holmes v. Walton case where he ruled that the judiciary had the authority to declare whether laws were unconstitutional or not. He held the seat until 1789.\n\nWhile at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 at the age of 42, he served on the panel that decided how long the President's term should be. After signing the Constitution in 1787, he headed up New Jersey's committee that approved the Constitution omgeeee. In 1789, he was a Presidential elector and on September 25, 1789 he was nominated by President George Washington to be the first federal district judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, a new seat created by 1 Stat. 73. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 25, 1789, and received his commission the following day. He died in that office a few months later.\n\nBrearley was the first Grand Master of the New Jersey Masonic Lodge. He is buried in the churchyard of Saint Michael's Episcopal Church in Trenton, New Jersey. David Brearley High School in Kenilworth, New Jersey, was named in his honor.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, the Annapolis Convention (1786) and served in the Delaware General Assembly. He was the father of Congressman James M. Broom and grandfather of Congressman Jacob Broom.\n\nHis father was James Broom, a blacksmith turned prosperous farmer, and his mother was Esther Willis, a Quaker. In 1773 he married Rachel Pierce, and together they raised eight children.\n\nAfter receiving his primary education at Wilmington's Old Academy, he became in turn a farmer, surveyor, and finally, a prosperous local businessman. Even as a young man Broom attracted considerable attention in Wilmington's thriving business community, a prominence that propelled him into a political career. He held a variety of local offices, including borough assessor, president of the city's \"street regulators;\" a group responsible for the care of the street, water, and sewage systems, and justice of the peace for New Castle County. He became assistant burgess (vice-mayor) of Wilmington in 1776 at the age of 24, winning re-election to this post six times over the next few decades. He also served as chief burgess (Mayor) of the city four times. He never lost an election.\n\nAlthough the strong pacifist influence of his Quaker friends and relatives kept him from fighting in the Revolution, Broom was nevertheless a Patriot who contributed to the cause of independence. For example, he put his abilities as a surveyor at the disposal of the Continental Army, preparing detailed maps of the region for General Washington shortly before the Battle of Brandywine. Broom's political horizons expanded after the Revolution when his community sent him as their representative to the state legislature (1784-86 and 1788), which in turn chose him to represent the state at the Annapolis Convention. Like many other delegates, Broom was unable to attend the sessions of the short meeting, but he likely sympathized with the convention's call for political reforms.\n\nDespite his lack of involvement in national politics prior to the Constitutional Convention, Broom was a dedicated supporter of strong central government. When George Washington visited Wilmington in 1783, Broom urged him to \"contribute your advice and influence to promote that harmony and union of our infant governments which are so essential to the permanent establishment of our freedom, happiness and prosperity.\"\n\nBroom carried these opinions with him to Philadelphia, where he consistently voted for measures that would assure a powerful government responsive to the needs of the states. He favored a nine-year term for members of the Senate, where the states would be equally represented. He wanted the state legislatures to pay their representatives in Congress, which, in turn, would have the power to veto state laws. He also sought to vest state legislatures with the power to select presidential electors, and he wanted the President to hold office for life. Broom faithfully attended the sessions of the Convention in Philadelphia and spoke out several times on issues that he considered crucial, but he left most of the speechmaking to more influential and experienced delegates. Georgia delegate William Pierce described him as \"a plain good Man, with some abilities, but nothing to render him conspicuous, silent in public, but cheerful and conversible in private.\"\n\nAfter the convention, Broom returned to Wilmington, where in 1795 he erected a home near Brandywine Creek on the outskirts of the city. Broom's primary interest remained in local government. In addition to continuing his service in Wilmington's government, he became the city's first postmaster (1790-92).\n\nFor many years, he chaired the board of directors of Wilmington's Delaware Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced and repaired mill machinery. He sold his mill property in 1802 to the DuPonts and it became the center of the DuPont manufacturing empire. Broom was also involved in an unsuccessful scheme to mine bog iron ore. A further interest was internal improvements: toll roads, canals, and bridges. A letter to his son James in 1794 touches upon a number of these pursuits.\n\nBroom also found time for philanthropic and religious activities. His long-standing affiliation with the Old Academy led him to become involved in its reorganization into the College of Wilmington, and to serve on the college's first Board of Trustees. Broom was also deeply involved in his community's religious affairs as a lay leader of the Old Swedes Church.\n\nHe died at the age of 58 in 1810 while in Philadelphia on business and was buried there at Christ Church Burial Ground. His home near the Brandywine, the Jacob Broom House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He represented South Carolina in the Continental Congress, the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and the U.S. Senate. Butler defended American slavery for both political and personal motives, though he had private misgivings about the institution, and particularly about the African slave trade. He introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause -- Article 4, Section 2 -- of the U.S. Constitution, but his authorship of this clause has been questioned.\n\nHe was born in Ireland and came to America in 1758 as an officer in the British Army. Butler represented South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention, was a man of startling contrasts. As late as 1772 he was a ranking officer in those British units charged with suppressing the growing colonial resistance to Parliament. In fact, a detachment from his unit, the 29th Regiment of Foot, had fired the shots in the \"Boston Massacre\" of 1770, thereby dramatically intensifying the confrontation between the colonies and England. But by 1779 Butler, now an officer in South Carolina's militia and a man with a price on his head, was organizing American forces to fight the invading Redcoats. Butler lost his considerable estates and fortune during the British occupation of South Carolina, but at the end of the Revolutionary War he was among the first to call for reconciliation with the Loyalists and a renewal of friendly relations with the former enemy. Although an aristocrat to the manner born, Butler became a leading spokesman for the frontiersmen and impoverished western settlers. Finally, this Patriot, always a forceful and eloquent advocate of the rights of the common man during the debate over the Constitution, was a large planter and among the political and social elite of the Southern colonies. In 1793 he held 500 enslaved African-Americans, who worked on his plantation at Butler Island and cotton plantation at St. Simons Island.\n\nThe unifying force in this fascinating career was Butler's strong and enduring sense of nationalism. An Irish nobleman, he severed his ties with the old world to embrace the concept of a permanent union of the thirteen states. His own military and political experiences then led him to the conviction that a strong central government, as the bedrock of political and economic security, was essential to protect the rights not only of his own social class and adopted state but also of all classes of citizens and all the states.\n\nPierce Butler was the third son of Sir Richard Butler, 5th Baronet, a member of the Irish Parliament. Traditionally British gentry directed younger sons into the military or the church, and Butler's father was no exception. In the honored fashion of the times, he bought his son a commission in the 22nd Regiment of Foot. Butler demonstrated both military skill and the advantages of powerful and wealthy parents in his subsequent career in the British Army. His regiment came to North America in 1758 to participate in the French and Indian War and served in the campaigns that resulted in the capture of Canada from the French. Butler later transferred to the 29th Foot (today's Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment), before returning to Ireland in 1762.\n\nThe overwhelming success of the forces of the British Empire and its allies ended French territorial claims in North America and brought about profound changes in the nature of the mother country's relationship with its American colonies. To occupy Canada and other new lands won during the war, Parliament for the first time ordered the permanent stationing of large British garrisons in North America. Because the government had incurred heavy war debts, Parliament chose to support these troops by levying new taxes on the colonists. Americans generally disagreed with Parliament over the need for the garrisons, arguing that their local militias could handle the defense of the colonies. They also opposed the new taxes that began with the Stamp Act of 1765.\n\nButler's regiment was serving on garrison duty in Nova Scotia at the time, but he could not long escape becoming embroiled in the growing controversy. In 1768 the intensity of protests over Parliament's taxes in Massachusetts led London to order the 29th Foot, along with a second infantry regiment the 14th Regiment of Foot, to Boston to maintain the King's peace. In 1771, the year after the \"Massacre,\" Butler, now a major, married Mary Polly Middleton on January 10. She was the daughter of wealthy South Carolina planter and colonial leader Henry Middleton. Marriage led him to seek new directions, for when the 29th received orders to return to Britain in 1773, he decided to leave the army. He sold his commission and used the proceeds to purchase a plantation in the coastal region of South Carolina, adapting to the lifestyle of a southern landowner with apparent ease. Management skills learned in the military undoubtedly proved useful as he increased his land holdings to over 10,000 acres (40 square km). He also began to accumulate a small fleet of coastal vessels to support his expanding business ventures.\n\nWhen war broke out between Great Britain and the colonies in 1775, Butler joined several other former British officers (including the future generals Horatio Gates, Charles Lee, and Richard Montgomery) in casting his lot with the American cause. In Butler's case the success of his business interests as well as the important role played by the Middleton family in the Patriot movement in South Carolina clearly influenced his decision. Butler's father-in-law had been the president of the First Continental Congress, and a brother-in-law would soon sign the Declaration of Independence. Butler himself lost little time in expressing his patriotic sentiments by standing for local election. He began his public service in 1776 when his neighbors elected him to a seat in the South Carolina legislature, a post that he continued to hold until 1789.\n\nAlthough bad health prevented Butler from assuming an active combat role, he offered his military talents to his state, and in early 1779 Governor John Rutledge turned to the former Redcoat to help reorganize South Carolina's defenses. Butler assumed the post of the state's adjutant general, a position that carried the rank of brigadier general, although he continued to prefer to be addressed as major, his highest combat rank.\n\nThe decision to reorganize South Carolina's defenses followed in the wake of a shift in Britain's war strategy. By 1778 the King and his ministers found themselves faced with a new military situation. Their forces in the northern and middle states had reached a stalemate with Washington's continentals, now more adequately supplied and better trained after Valley Forge. The British also faced the prospect of France entering the war as an active partner of the Americans. In response, they adopted a \"southern strategy.\" Assuming that the many Loyalists in the southern states would rally to the Crown if supported by regular troops, they planned a conquest of the rebellious colonies one at a time, moving north from Georgia. They launched their new strategy with the capture of Savannah in December 1778.\n\nButler joined in the effort to mobilize South Carolina's citizen-soldiers to repulse the threatened British invasion and later helped prepare the state units used in the counterattack designed to drive the enemy from Georgia. During the operation, which climaxed with an attempted investiture of Savannah, Butler served as a volunteer aide to General Lachlan McIntosh. The hastily raised and poorly prepared militia troops were no match for the well-trained British defenders, and the effort to relieve Savannah ended in failure.\n\nIn 1780 the British captured Charleston, and with it most of South Carolina's civil government and military forces. Butler, as part of a command group deliberately left outside the city, escaped. During the next two years he employed his considerable military talents in developing a counterstrategy to defeat the enemy's southern operations. He and his fellow South Carolinians, along with their neighbors in occupied portions of Georgia and North Carolina, refused to submit to London's demand that they surrender. Instead, they organized a resistance movement. Butler, as adjutant general, worked with former members of the militia and Continental Army veterans such as Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter to integrate their various partisan efforts into a unified campaign, in conjunction with the operations of the Southern Army under the command of Horatio Gates and later Nathanael Greene.\n\nThese partisan tactics involved considerable expense and personal risk for Butler who, as a former Royal officer, remained a special target for the British occupation forces. Several times he barely avoided capture. Once, surprised by the sudden arrival of enemy dragoons in the middle of the night, he escaped by sneaking from his home dressed only in his nightshirt. On another occasion, a British regiment, repeatedly denounced by Butler for plundering civilian properties \u2013 he called it a \"band of jailbirds\" \u2013 placed a bounty on his head. Throughout the closing phases of the southern campaign he personally contributed cash and supplies to help sustain the American forces and also assisted in the administration of prisoner-of-war facilities.\n\nMilitary operations in the latter months of the Revolution left Butler a poor man. Many of his plantations and ships were destroyed, and the international trade on which the majority of his income depended was in shambles. These economic realities forced him to travel to Europe when the war ended in an effort to secure loans and establish new markets. Betraying a singular tolerance for a foe who had caused him much personal harm, Butler took the occasion to enroll his son in a London school and to engage a new minister from among the British clergy for his church in South Carolina. In late 1785 he returned home, where he became an especially outspoken advocate of reconciliation with former Loyalists and equal representation for the residents of the backcountry. Testifying to his growing political influence, the South Carolina legislature asked Butler to represent the state at the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787.\n\nButler's experiences as a soldier and planter-legislator influenced his forceful support for a strong union of the states at the Convention. As a military leader during the campaigns in the south he had come to appreciate the need for a national approach to defense. As a planter and merchant, especially after his trip to Europe, he came to understand that economic growth and international respect depended upon a strong central government. At the same time, he energetically supported the special interests of his region.\n\nThis dual emphasis on national and state concerns puzzled his fellow delegates, just as other apparent inconsistencies would bother associates throughout the rest of his political career. For example, Butler favored ratification of the Constitution, yet absented himself from the South Carolina convention that approved it. Later, he would serve three separate terms in the United States Senate, but this service was marked by several abrupt changes in party allegiance. Beginning as a Federalist, he switched to the Jeffersonian party in 1795, only to become a political independent in 1804. These changes confused the voters of his state, who rejected his subsequent bids for high public offices, although they did elect him three more times to the state legislature as an easterner who spoke on behalf of the west.\n\nButler retired from politics in 1805 and spent much time in Philadelphia where he had previously established a summer home. He continued his business ventures, becoming one of the wealthiest men in America with huge land holdings in several states. Like other Founding Fathers from his region, Butler also continued to support the institution of slavery. But unlike Washington or Thomas Jefferson, for example, Butler never acknowledged or grasped the fundamental inconsistency in simultaneously defending the rights of the poor and supporting slavery.\n\nThe contradictions in this fascinating man led associates to label him an \"eccentric\" and an \"enigma.\" Within his own lights, however, he followed a steady path along lines which were intended to produce the maximum of liberty and respect for those individuals whom he classed as citizens. His later political maneuverings were animated by his desire to maintain a strong central government, but a government that could never ride roughshod over the rights of the private citizen. He opposed the policies of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton because he decided that they had sacrificed the interests of westerners and had sought to force their policies on the opposition; he later split with Jefferson and the Democrats for the same reason. Butler never wavered from his central emphasis on the role of the common man. Late in life he summarized his view: \"Our System is little better than [a] matter of Experiment.... much must depend on the morals and manners of the people at large.\" This was certainly an interesting view, coming as it did from a former member of the British hereditary aristocracy.\n\nIn January 1771, Major Pierce Butler married Mary Middleton (c.1750 - 1790), the orphaned daughter of South Carolina planter and slave-importer Thomas Middleton, and heiress to a vast fortune. He resigned his commission in the British Army two years later.\n\nFollowing his wife's death, Butler sold off the last of their South Carolina holdings, investing in Georgia sea island plantations. He disinherited his only surviving son Thomas, along with his French wife and children. Butler initially planned to leave his whole fortune to daughter Sarah Butler Mease's eldest son, Pierce Butler Mease, who died in 1810 at age 9. He then left it in equal parts to her other 3 sons, provided they irrevocably adopt Butler as their surname. Two of her sons, John and (the second-named) Pierce Butler Mease (b. 1810), did change their names to inherit.\n\nGrandson Pierce Butler (Mease) married the well-known English actress Frances (\"Fanny\") Kemble in 1834. Kemble's growing abolitionism was a factor in their 1849 divorce, but she waited until 1863 to publish her Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, an eye-witness indictment of slavery. Pierce Butler (Mease) squandered a fortune estimated at $700,000, but was saved from bankruptcy by the March 2-3, 1859 sale of his 436 slaves at Ten Broeck Racetrack, outside Savannah, Georgia -- the largest single slave auction in American history. He was briefly imprisoned for treason, August-September 1861, and sat out the American Civil War in Philadelphia. Union forces occupied the Butler plantations beginning in February 1862, and a similar number of his brother's slaves were freed by the January 1, 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Later that year, Pierce Butler (Mease) inherited his brother's half of their grandfather's plantations, but was unsuccessful in managing them after the war. His daughter, Frances Butler Leigh, defended her father in a rebuttal to her mother's journal: Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation since the War (1883). His other daughter, Sarah Butler Wister, was the mother of Owen Wister, the popular American novelist and author of the 1902 western novel, The Virginian. Wister was the last descendant to inherit the Butler plantations, and wrote about the post-Civil War South in his 1906 novel, Lady Baltimore.\n\nMajor Pierce Butler and many of his descendants are buried in a family vault at Christ Church, Philadelphia.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was a prominent member of one of America's great colonial families that included his cousin Charles Carroll of Carrollton who signed the Declaration of Independence, and his brother John Carroll who was the first Catholic bishop in the United States. He was one of only five men to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution of the United States.\n\nCarroll was a patrician planter who fused family honor with the cause of American independence, willingly risking his social and economic position in the community for the Patriot cause. Later, as a friend and staunch ally of George Washington, he worked for a strong central government which could secure the achievements and fulfill the hopes of the Revolution. Ironically, for one whose name was synonymous with the colonial aristocracy, Carroll fought in the Convention for a government responsible directly to the people of the country.\n\nCarroll was born in Upper Marlboro, Prince Georges County, Maryland, and spent his early years at his family's home, Darnall's Chance. Carroll went abroad for his education. Between 1742 and 1748 he studied under the Jesuits at the College of St. Omer in Flanders. After his return, he only gradually joined the Patriot cause. A large landholder, he was concerned lest the Revolution fail economically and bring about not only his family's financial ruin, but mob rule as well. Furthermore, he was initially prevented from becoming involved in Maryland politics by laws that excluded Catholics from holding public office. Once these laws were nullified by the Maryland constitution of 1776, the way was cleared for his election to the upper house of the Maryland legislature (1777-81). At the end of his term, he became a member of the Continental Congress (1781-84), where, in 1781, he signed the Articles of Confederation. His involvement in the Revolution, like that of other Patriots in this patrician's extended family, was inspired by the family's ancient motto: \"Strong in Faith and War\".\n\nCarroll was an active member of the Constitutional Convention, despite the fact that illness prevented him from attending the early sessions. Like his good friend James Madison, Carroll was convinced that a strong central government was needed to regulate commerce among the states and with other nations. He also spoke out repeatedly in opposition to the payment of members of the United States Congress by the states, reasoning that such compensation would sabotage the strength of the new government because \"the dependence of both Houses on the state Legislatures would be compleat.... The new government in this form is nothing more than a second edition of [the Continental] Congress in two volumes, instead of one, and perhaps with very few amendments\"\n\nHe wanted governmental power vested in the people, and he joined James Wilson in campaigning for popular sovereignty. When it was suggested that the President should be elected by the Congress, it was Carroll, seconded by James Wilson, who moved that the words \"by the legislature\" be replaced with \"by the people\". His signature on the Constitution made him one of two Roman Catholics to sign the document, a further symbol of the advance of religious freedom in America during the Revolutionary period.\n\nCarroll did not arrive at the Constitutional Convention until July 9, but thereafter he attended quite regularly. He spoke about 20 times during the debates and served on the Committee on Postponed Matters. Returning to Maryland after the convention, he campaigned for ratification of the Constitution but was not a delegate to the state convention.\n\nFollowing the Convention, Carroll immersed himself in state and national affairs. He was a key participant in the Maryland ratification struggle. He also defended the Constitution in the pages of the Maryland Journal, most notably in his response to the arguments advanced by the well-known Antifederalist Samuel Chase. After ratification was achieved in Maryland, Carroll became a representative from the sixth district of Maryland in the First Congress, where, reflecting his concern for economic and fiscal stability, he voted for the assumption of state debts by the federal government.\n\nHe later served in the Maryland Senate and as one of three commissioners appointed to survey the District of Columbia. He then became a commissioner (co-mayor) of the new capital city, but advanced age and failing health forced him to retire in 1795. Even then, interest in the good of his region kept him active. In the last year of his life he became one of George Washington's partners in the Patowmack Company, a business enterprise intended to link the middle states with the expanding west by means of a Potomac River canal.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was one of the first Patriots to advocate complete independence from Britain. As a Pennsylvania representative, Clymer was, along with only five others, a signatory of both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. He attended the Continental Congress and served in political office until the end of his life.\n\nClymer was born in Whiteville on March 16, 1740. Orphaned when only a year old, he was apprenticed to his paternal uncle, William Coleman, in preparation for a career as a merchant. He was a patriot and leader in the demonstrations in Philadelphia resulting from the Tea Act and the Stamp Act. He became a member of the Philadelphia Committee of Safety in 1773, and was elected to the Continental Congress 1776-1780. He served ably on several committees during his first Congressional term and was sent to inspect the northern army on behalf of Congress in the fall of 1776. When Congress fled Philadelphia in the face of Sir Henry Clinton's threatened occupation, Clymer stayed behind with George Walton and Robert Morris. The British made a special point in destroying Clymer's country home in Chester County following the Battle of Brandywine.\n\nHe resigned from Congress in 1777, and in 1780 was elected to a seat in the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 1782, he was sent on a tour of the southern states in a vain attempt to get the legislatures to pay up on subscriptions due to the central government. He was reelected to the Pennsylvania legislature in 1784, and represented his state at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. He was elected to the first U.S. Congress in 1789. Clymer shared the responsibility of being treasurer of the Continental Congress with Michael Hillegas, the first Treasurer of the United States.\n\nHe was the first president of the Philadelphia Bank, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and vice-president of the Philadelphia Agricultural Society. When Congress passed a bill imposing a duty on spirits distilled in the United States in 1791, Clymer was placed as head of the excise department, in the state of Pennsylvania. He was also one of the commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the Creek Indian confederacy at Coleraine, Georgia on June 29, 1796. He is considered the benefactor of Indiana Borough, as it was he who donated the property for a county seat in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.\n\nClymer died on January 24, 1813, and was buried at the Friends Burying Ground in Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was the youngest person to sign the United States Constitution and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as the fourth Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and later the U.S. Senate. Dayton was arrested in 1807 for treason in connection with Aaron Burr's conspiracy, he was never tried, but his national political career never recovered.\n\nDayton was born in Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth) in New Jersey. He was the son of Elias Dayton, a merchant who was prominent in local politics. He graduated in 1776 from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). During the Revolutionary War Dayton served under his father in the 3rd New Jersey Regiment and attained the rank of captain by the age of 19.\n\nAfter the war, Dayton studied law and established a practice, dividing his time between land speculation, law, and politics. After serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress and Constitutional Convention (of which he was the youngest member, at the age of 26), he became a prominent Federalist legislator. He was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1786-1787, and again in 1790, and served in the New Jersey State Council (now the New Jersey Senate) in 1790.\n\nElected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1789, he did not take his seat, but was elected and took his seat in 1791. He served as speaker for the Fourth and Fifth Congress. Like most Federalists, he supported the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton, and suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. He supported the Louisiana Purchase and opposed the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801.\n\nDayton met with Aaron Burr in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and became involved in a \"conspiracy\" in which Burr later had been accused of intending to conquer parts of what is now the western United States. (This was never proven.) An illness prevented Dayton from accompanying Burr's aborted 1806 expedition, but in 1807 Dayton was arrested for treason. He was released and never brought to trial but his national political career never recovered.\n\nHe married Susan Williamson and had two daughters but their marriage date is unknown.\n\nAfter resuming his political career in New Jersey, he died in 1824 in his hometown and was interred in an unmarked grave now under the present St. John's Episcopal Church in Elizabeth which replaced the original church in 1860.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He was a militia officer during the American Revolution, a Continental Congressman from Pennsylvania and Delaware, a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, President of Delaware, President of Pennsylvania. Among the wealthiest men in the British American colonies, he is known as the Penman of the Revolution, for his Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, where he eloquently argued the cause of American liberty.\n\nDickinson was born at Croisadore his family's tobacco plantation in Talbot County, near Trappe, Maryland. He was the great grandson of Walter Dickinson who emigrated from England to Virginia in 1654 and, having joined the Society of Friends, came with several co-religionists to Talbot County on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in 1659. There, with 400 acres (1.6 km2) on the banks of the Choptank River he began a plantation, Croisadore, meaning \"cross of gold.\" He also bought 800 acres (3.2 km2) on St. Jones Neck in what became Kent County, Delaware.\n\nCroisadore passed through Walter's son, William, to his grandson, Samuel, the father of John Dickinson. Each generation increased the landholdings, so that Samuel inherited 2500 acres (10 km\u00b2) on five farms in three Maryland counties and over his lifetime increased that to 9000 acres (36 km\u00b2). He also bought the Kent County property from his cousin and expanded it into a massive domain of some 3000 acres (12 km\u00b2) stretching along the St. Jones River from Dover to the Delaware Bay. There he began another plantation and called it \u201cPoplar Hall.\u201d These plantations were large, profitable agricultural enterprises worked by slave labor, producing tobacco in Talbot County and wheat and corn in the more sandy soil of Kent County. As a result the family was enormously wealthy.\n\nSamuel Dickinson first married Judith Troth on 11 April 1710. They had nine children; William, Walter, Samuel, Elizabeth, Henry, Elizabeth \"Betsy,\" Rebecca, Rachel and Rachel. The three eldest sons died of smallpox while in London seeking their education. Widowed, with two young children, Henry and Betsy, Samuel married Mary Cadwalader in 1731. She was the daughter of the prominent Quaker, John Cadwalader of Philadelphia. Their sons, John, Thomas and Philemon were born in the next few years.\n\nFor three generations the Dickinson family had been devout members of the Third Haven Friends Meeting in Talbot County and the Cadwaladers were equally devout members of the Meeting in Philadelphia. But in 1739, John Dickinson's half-sister, Betsy, was married in an Anglican church to Charles Goldsborough in what was called a \"disorderly marriage\" by the Meeting. The couple would be the grandparents of Maryland governor Charles Goldsborough. This event hurt Samuel Dickinson in such a way that he never participated in the Meeting again.\n\nIt may have also been one of the reasons for Samuel\u2019s decision to move the family to Poplar Hall in 1740. Leaving Croisadore to elder son, Henry Dickinson, they made the trek to their new home, where Samuel had already taken a leading role in the community as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Kent County. The move also placed Mary nearer her Philadelphia relations, and young John was to grow up under the growing attraction of that great metropolis.\n\nBy contemporary standards Poplar Hall was itself a busy place, situated on a now straightened bend of the St. Jones River. There was plenty of activity delivering the necessities, and shipping the agricultural products produced. Much of this product was wheat, an especially soft, fine wheat, that along with other wheat from the region, was milled into the famous \u201csuperfine\u201d flour. But the people were largely servants and slaves, employed by, or doing business with the Dickinsons. Neighbors were a long way away over the marshy hinterland, and even those that were there were not close friends, separated psychologically by differences in wealth and religion. The land itself was a vast, damp, mosquito ridden domain, acquired because it was cheaper to buy than to improve, and therefore quickly worn out and abandoned. It had a subtle, quiet beauty, fully appreciated by John Dickinson and his father, but less so by others in the family, and not at all by his wife in the years to come.\n\nDickinson was educated at home, largely by doting parents, but also by recent immigrants employed for that purpose. Included among them was the Presbyterian minister Francis Alison, who later began the well known New London Academy in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Most important was William Killen, who became a life-long friend, and himself had a distinguished career as Delaware\u2019s first Chief Justice and Chancellor. Dickinson was precocious and energetic, and in spite of his love of Poplar Hall and his family, was himself irresistibly drawn to the larger stage up river in Philadelphia.\n\nRecognizing all this, his father sent him, at the age of 18, to begin studying the law under John Moland in Philadelphia. There he made friends with fellow students George Read and Samuel Wharton, among others, and enjoyed the new experience of urban life. By 1753 it was apparent that the place he really needed to study was London, and in spite of having already lost three sons while making similar trips, Samuel Dickinson agreed to send John for what ended up as three years of study at the Middle Temple. He spent those years studying the works of Edward Coke and Francis Bacon at the Inns of Court, and by early 1757 was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar. After returning to Poplar Hall for a lengthy visit he was back in Philadelphia by the fall, having begun his career as barrister and solicitor.\n\nOn July 19, 1770 Dickinson married Mary Norris, also known as Polly, the daughter of another wealthy Philadelphia Quaker, and Speaker of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, Isaac Norris. They had five children, but only two survived to adulthood: Sarah Norris \"Sally\" Dickinson and Maria Mary Dickinson. Dickinson never formally joined the Quaker Meeting, because, as he explained, he believed in the \"lawfulness of defensive war.\" However, now married to another devout Quaker, he was always strongly influenced by the beliefs of the Society of Friends.\n\nHe was already among the wealthiest of men and this marriage only increased that. In Philadelphia, he preferred to live at the family estate of his wife, called Fairhill, near Germantown. Meanwhile he built an elegant mansion on Chestnut Street but never lived there as it was confiscated and turned into a hospital during his 1776-77 absence in Delaware. It then became the residence of the French ambassador and still later the home of his brother, Philemon Dickinson. Fairhill was burned by the British during the Battle of Germantown. While in Philadelphia as State President, he lived at the confiscated mansion of Joseph Galloway at Sixth and Market Streets, now established as the State Presidential mansion.\n\nAs an adult Dickinson lived at his family home at Jones Neck, in Kent County Poplar Hall, for extended periods only in 1776-77 and 1781-82. In August 1781 it was sacked by Loyalists and after being restored, was badly burned in 1804. This home is now owned by the State of Delaware, is undergoing restoration and is open to the public. After his service as President of Pennsylvania, he returned to live in Wilmington, Delaware in 1785 and built a mansion at the northwest corner of 8th and Market Streets.\n\nAs events unfolded Dickinson was one of Pennsylvania's delegates to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and 1776. In support of the cause, he continued to contribute declarations in the name of the Congress. Among the most famous is one written with Thomas Jefferson, a Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, with Dickinson\u2019s famous conclusion that Americans were resolved to die free men rather than live slaves. Another was the Olive Branch Petition, a last ditch appeal to King George III to resolve the dispute. But through it all, agreeing with New Castle County's George Read and many others in Philadelphia and the Lower Counties, Dickinson's object was reconciliation, not independence and revolution. He was a proud devotee of the British Constitution and felt the dispute was with Parliament only. He was also a product of his Quaker heritage, which insisted that disputes be settled without violence.\n\nWhen the Continental Congress began the debate on the Declaration of Independence on July 1, 1776, Dickinson reiterated his opposition to declaring independence at that time. Dickinson believed that Congress should complete the Articles of Confederation and secure a foreign alliance before issuing a declaration. He abstained or absented himself from the votes on July 2nd that declared independence and absented himself again from voting on the wording of the formal Declaration on July 4. Dickinson understood the implications of his refusal to vote stating, \"My conduct this day, I expect will give the finishing blow to my once too great and, my integrity considered, now too diminished popularity.\" Dickinson refused to sign the Declaration and since a proposal had been brought forth and carried that stated, \"for our mutual security and protection,\" no man could remain in Congress without signing, Dickinson voluntarily left and joined the Pennsylvania militia.\n\nFollowing the Declaration of Independence Dickinson was given the rank of brigadier general in the Pennsylvania militia, known as the Associators. He led some 10,000 soldiers to Elizabeth, New Jersey to protect that area against British attack from Staten Island. But because of his unpopular opinion on independence two junior officers were promoted above him. He resigned his commission in December 1776 and went to stay at Poplar Hall in Kent County. While there he learned that his home on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia had been confiscated and converted into a hospital. Despite these setbacks, Dickinson insisted on always espousing his true feelings, no matter the consequence.\n\nAfter his service in Pennsylvania, Dickinson returned to Delaware, and lived in Wilmington. He was quickly appointed to represent Delaware at the Annapolis Convention, where he served as its President. In 1787, Delaware sent him as one of its delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, along with Gunning Bedford, Jr., Richard Bassett, George Read, and Jacob Broom, There, he supported the effort to create a strong central government, but only after the Great Compromise assured that each state, regardless of size, would have an equal vote in the future United States Senate. Following the Convention he promoted the resulting Constitution in a series of nine essays, written under the pen name, Fabius.\n\nIn 1791, Delaware convened a convention to revise its existing Constitution, which had been hastily drafted in 1776. Dickinson was elected president of this convention, and although he resigned the chair after most of the work was complete, he remained highly influential in the content of the final document. Major changes included the establishment of a separate Chancery Court and the expansion of the franchise to include all taxpayers, except blacks and women. Dickinson remained neutral in an attempt to include a prohibition of slavery in the document, believing the General Assembly was the proper place to decide that issue. The new Constitution was approved June 12, 1792.\n\nOnce more Dickinson was returned to the State Senate for the 1793 session, but served for just one year before resigning due to his declining health. In his final years he worked to further the abolition movement, donated a considerable amount of his wealth to the \"relief of the unhappy.\" In 1801 he published two volumes of his collected works on politics.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

Few represented the U.S. state of Georgia at the Constitutional Convention. Born into a poor yeoman farming family, Few achieved both social prominence and political power later in life. Exhibiting those characteristics of self-reliance vital for survival on the American frontier, he became an intimate of the nation's political and military elite. The idea of a rude frontiersman providing the democratic leaven within an association of the rich and powerful has always excited the American imagination, nurtured on stories of Davy Crockett and Abraham Lincoln. In the case of the self-educated Few, that image was largely accurate.\n\nFew's inherent gifts for leadership and organization, as well as his sense of public service, were brought out by his experience in the Revolutionary War. Important in any theater of military operations, leadership and organizational ability were particularly needed in the campaigns in the south where a dangerous and protracted struggle against a determined British invader intimately touched the lives of many settlers. Few's dedication to the common good and his natural military acumen quickly brought him to the attention of the leaders of the Patriot cause, who eventually invested him with important political responsibilities as well.\n\nThe war also profoundly affected Few's attitude toward the political future of the new nation, transforming the rugged frontier individualist into a forceful exponent of a permanent union of the states. Men of his stripe came to realize during the years of military conflict that the rights of the individual, so jealously prized on the frontier, could be nurtured and protected only by a strong central government accountable to the people. This belief became the hallmark of his long public service.\n\nDescendant of Quaker shoemaker, Richard Few of Whiltshire England, and his son Isaac Few, a cooper, who emigrated to Pennsylvania in the 1680s, the Fews lived in northern Maryland, where they eked out a modest living raising tobacco on small holdings. When a series of droughts struck the region in the 1750s, the Fews and their neighbors\u2014actually a sort of extended family consisting of cousins and distant relations\u2014found themselves on the brink of ruin. The whole community decided to abandon its farms and try its luck among the more fertile lands on the southern frontier.\n\nThe group ultimately selected new homesites along the banks of the Eno River one mile from Hillsborough in Orange County, North Carolina, first in what is now Durham County (but was then Orange County), and later east of Hillsborough, in Orange County. Here young Few developed the skills expected of the eighteenth-century farmer.In an account of the early history of Orange County, Francis Nash wrote, \"His father [William Few, Jr.s] though, belonged to the better class of farmers, had more means and a better education than the average settler.\" Such a life left little time for formal schooling, although the community hired an itinerant teacher for a brief time in the 1760s. From this experience Few obtained a rudimentary education that led to a lifelong love of reading. Essentially a self-educated man, Few also found time to read law and qualify as an attorney despite a full-time commitment to the unrelenting demands of agricultural toil.\n\nIn time the Few family achieved a measure of prosperity, emerging as political leaders in rural Orange County. Like many other western settlers, however, the family became involved with the Regulators, a populist movement that grew up in reaction to the political and economic restrictions imposed on the frontier or backcountry farmers by the merchants and planters of the tidewater area and by the local politicians and lawyers. By 1771 protest had become confrontation, and a large group of mostly unarmed westerners gathered to clash with North Carolina militia units at the \"battle\" of the Alamance. The uneven fight ended in total victory for the militia, although most of the Regulator's demands for political representation and economic relief eventually would be met by the state legislature. More immediately, one of Few's brothers \u2013 James Few \u2013 was hanged for his part in the uprising, and the Few family farm just east of Hillsborough was ransacked by Tryon's militia troops. The rest of the family fled to Wrightsboro, Georgia, leaving Few behind to settle their affairs and sell their property.\n\nThese antagonisms within North Carolina began to evaporate as American opinion turned against the imperial measures instituted by Great Britain in the 1770s. Both the eastern planters and the new settlers found new taxes and restrictions on western expansion at odds with their idea of self-government, and Patriot leaders were able to unite the state against what they could portray as a threat to the liberties of all parties.\n\nFew participated in this training as one of the first men to enlist in the volunteer militia or \"minute men\" company formed in Hillsborough. Typically, Few's unit received its tactical instruction from a veteran of the colonial wars, in this case a former corporal in the British Army who was hired by the company as its drill sergeant. Citing the press of family business, Few rejected the offer of a captaincy in one of the first units North Carolina raised for the Continental Army in the summer of 1775. But when he finally settled the family's accounts the next year and joined his relatives in Georgia, where he opened a law office, he quickly placed his newly acquired military knowledge at the service of the Patriot cause in his new state.\n\nGeorgia organized its citizen-soldiers on a geographical basis, forming local companies into a regiment in each county. Few joined the Richmond County Regiment, which his older brother, Benjamin, commanded. For the next two years Few's military duties consisted of attending military assemblies where he instructed his friends and neighbors in the skills he had acquired in the North Carolina militia. Only in 1778, when Georgia faced the threat of invasion by a force of Loyalist militia and British regulars based in Florida, was Few finally called to active duty.\n\nThe Georgians' first military campaign ended in disaster. A force of state and Continental units successfully combined to repulse an enemy raid on Sunbury near the states southeastern border, but a counterattack orchestrated by Major General Robert Howe of the Continental Army and Governor John Houstoun bogged down before the Patriots could reach St. Augustine. Few, now in command of a company of Georgia Militia, watched the collapse of the campaign's logistical support and then the disintegration of the force itself, as senior officers bickered among themselves and as disease began to decimate the units. Only half of the American soldiers survived to return home. At the end of the year a sudden amphibious invasion by British forces resulted in the capture of Savannah, Georgia, and the destruction of the rest of the Continental units under Howe and most of the eastern militia formations. Armed resistance to the British continued in the western part of the state, led by the Richmond County Regiment. Throughout 1779 the regiment, with Few now second in command, frequently turned out to skirmish with probing British units, eventually forcing the enemy to abandon Augusta, which the British had captured soon after the fall of Savannah.\n\nThe success of the citizen-soldiers in defending their own homes began to reverse the fortunes of war in Georgia, prompting the new Continental commander in the region, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, to take the offensive. Lincoln combined his continentals and militia units from Georgia and South Carolina with a French force newly arrived from the Caribbean to lay siege to Savannah. He immediately encountered difficulty, however, in coordinating the efforts of his diverse forces. The French, under pressure to terminate operations quickly in order to move on to other assignments, persuaded Lincoln to launch a full frontal attack. The result was a bloody defeat, but Few's militiamen participated in a successful rear-guard action that shielded the retreat of the American units. In the aftermath of the battle his regiment was posted to the frontier where the Creek Indians, interpreting the defeat before Savannah as proof of the Georgians' weakness, had taken to the field in support of British forces.\n\nEnemy operations in Georgia in 1779 were part of a new \"southern strategy\" by which the British planned to use the state as a base for conquering the rebellious colonies in a sweep up from the south. Few's military service in the later years of the war proved critical both in frustrating this strategy and in enhancing his credentials as a state leader. The western forces, in which Few's regiment played a prominent role, kept the British from consolidating their position. The area never developed into a secure Loyalist base, and British troops needed for subsequent operations against the Carolinas and Virginia had to be diverted to counter the threat posed by the frontier militia units. Few emerged as a gifted administrator and logistician in this demanding and difficult effort to maintain a viable military force in Georgia. He also turned into a bold, innovative partisan commander. Experience and innate common sense enabled him to develop patience, preserve his forces for key attacks, and then pick his time and place to defeat small enemy parties without unduly risking the safety of his men. Most important, he displayed the raw physical stamina required to survive the serious hardships of guerrilla warfare.\n\nMilitary success went hand in hand with political service. During the late 1770s Few also won election to the House of Representatives in the Georgia General Assembly, sat on the state's Executive Council, acted as state surveyor-general, represented Georgia in negotiations with the Indians that succeeded in minimizing the danger of frontier attacks, and served as Richmond County's senior magistrate. Few's growing political prominence and undisputed talent for leadership prompted the state legislature in 1780 to appoint him to represent Georgia in the Continental Congress.\n\nFew served in Congress less than a year when, in the wake of General Nathanael Greene's successful effort to drive the British out of most of Georgia, Congress sent him home to help reassemble Georgia's scattered government. This task accomplished, Few returned to Congress in 1782, where he remained to serve throughout most of the decade. While a member of that body, Few was asked by his state to serve concurrently in the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. This dual responsibility caused him to split his time between the two bodies and therefore to miss portions of the constitutional proceedings. Nevertheless, Few firmly supported the effort to create a strong national union and worked hard to secure the Continental Congress' approval of the new instrument of government. He also participated in the Georgia convention in 1788 that ratified the document.\n\nGeorgia promptly selected Few to serve as one of its original United States senators. Planning to retire from politics at the expiration of his term in 1793, he bowed instead to the wishes of his neighbors and served yet another term in the state legislature. In 1796 the Georgia Assembly appointed him as a circuit court judge. During this three-year appointment he not only consolidated his reputation as a practical, fair jurist but became a prominent supporter of public education. He was a founding trustee of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens in 1785. Few's efforts to establish UGA as the first state-chartered university in the United States indicated the importance this self-educated man gave to formal instruction.\n\nAt the urging of his wife, a native New Yorker, Few left Georgia in 1799 and moved to Manhattan. There, he embarked on yet another career of public service, while supporting his family through banking and the occasional practice of law. His new neighbors promptly elected him to represent them in the New York State Assembly and later as a city alderman. He also served for nine years as New York's inspector of prisons and one year as a federal commissioner of loans before finally retiring to his country home in Dutchess County, New York.\n\nHe died the age of 80 in Fishkill-on-Hudson, survived by his wife Catherine Nicholson and three daughters. He was buried in the yard of the Reformed Dutch Church of Fishkill Landing but was reinterred at St. Paul's Church, Augusta, Georgia.\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

He represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, the Constitutional Convention, and the U.S. Congress.\n\nFitzsimons was born in Ireland around 1741. By 1760 he had immigrated to Philadelphia, and began work as a clerk in a mercantile house. He married Catherine Meade on November 23, 1761 and formed a business partnership with her brother George. Their firm specialized in the West Indies trade, and would operate successfully for over 41 years.\n\nAs the Revolution neared, he supported the Whig position. Early in the Revolutionary War he served as captain of a company of home guards, but the only report of their actions was to support the regular troops for the Battle of Trenton in 1776. Later in the war he provided supplies, ships, and money in support of Pennsylvania\u2019s forces.\n\nFitzsimons entered active politics as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783. He was a member of Pennsylvania\u2019s House of Representatives in 1786 and 1787. He was also a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention in 1787. Although not a leading member of that convention, he did support a strong national government, opposed slavery, and favored giving the Congress powers to tax import and exports, as well as granting the house and the senate equal power in making treaties. He was one of only two Catholic signers of the United States Constitution.\n\nAfter the constitution was established, he served in the first three sessions of the House, finally failing to win re-election in 1794. He lost to upstart John Swanwick, who carried 7 of Philadelphia's 12 Districts and 57% of the vote. This was partially attributed, not to Fitzsimons's own fault but to public opinion turning against the Federalist Party, to which he belonged, in the wake of the Whiskey Rebellion's suppression.\n\nWhile withdrawing from politics, Fitzsimons remained active in civic and business affairs. He served as president of Philadelphia's Chamber of Commerce, as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, and a director of the Bank of North America. He was a founder of the bank, and supported efforts to found the College of Georgetown.\n\nThomas died on August 26, 1811 in Philadelphia and was buried in the cemetery of St. Mary's Catholic Church there. (The cemetery is now part of the Independence National Historical Park.)\n\nThe source of this article is Wikipedia.

January 6, 1705 \u2013 April 17, 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author and printer, satirist, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He formed both the first public lending library in America and first fire department in Pennsylvania. He was an early proponent of colonial unity, and as a political writer and activist he supported the idea of an American nation. As a diplomat during the American Revolution he secured the French alliance that helped to make independence of the United States possible.\n\nFranklin is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character, a marriage of the practical and democratic Puritan values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of Henry Steele Commager, \"In Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.\" To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin, \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.\"\n\nFranklin became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in Philadelphia, becoming very wealthy, writing and publishing Poor Richard's Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin was interested in science and technology, and gained international renown for his famous experiments. He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and Franklin & Marshall College and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. From 1775 to 1776, Franklin was Postmaster General under the Continental Congress and from 1785 to 1788 was President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent abolitionists.\n\nHis colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, has seen Franklin honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.\n\nFranklin's father, Josiah Franklin, was born at Ecton, Northamptonshire, England on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith and farmer, and Jane White. His mother, Abiah Folger, was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on August 15, 1667, to Peter Folger, a miller and schoolteacher and his wife Mary Morrill, a former indentured servant. A descendant of the Folgers, J.A. Folger, founded Folgers Coffee in the 19th century.\n\nJosiah Franklin had seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683; they had three children before emigrating, and four after. After her death, Josiah was married to Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689 in the Old South Meeting House by Samuel Willard. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin's fifteenth child and tenth and last son.\n\nJosiah Franklin converted to Puritanism in the 1670s. Puritanism was a Protestant movement in England to \"purify\" Anglicanism from elements of the Roman Catholic religion, which they considered superstitious. Three things were important to the Puritans: that each congregation would be self-governing, that ministers give sermons instead of performing rituals such as a Mass, and individual Bible study so that each believer could develop a personal understanding and relationship with God. Puritanism appealed to smart, middle-class people such as Benjamin Franklin's father, who enjoyed the governance meetings, discussion, study, and personal independence.\n\nThe roots of American democracy can be seen in these Puritan values of self-government, the importance of the individual and active indignation against unjust authority, which were passed on to Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers, such as John Adams. One of Josiah's core Puritan values was that personal worth is earned through hard work, which makes the industrious man the equal of kings, which Ben Franklin etched onto his father's tombstone, from his father Josiah's favorite Bible quote, from the Hebrew Bible, Proverbs 22:29: \"Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before Kings.\" Hard work and equality were two Puritan values Ben Franklin preached throughout his own life (ibid, p 78) and spread widely through Poor Richard's Almanac and his autobiography.\n\nBen Franklin's mother, Abiah Folger, was born into a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom, when King Charles I of England began persecuting Protestants. They sailed for Boston in 1635. Her father was \"the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.\" As clerk of the court, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners. Ben Franklin followed in his grandfather's footsteps in his battles against the wealthy Penn family that owned the Pennsylvania Colony.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was born on Milk Street, in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 17, 1706 and baptized at Old South Meeting House. His father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, a maker of candles and soap, whose second wife, Abiah Folger, was Benjamin's mother. Josiah's marriages produced 17 children; Benjamin was the fifteenth child and youngest son. Josiah wanted Ben to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although \"his parents talked of the church as a career\" for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He then worked for his father for a time and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade. When Ben was 15, James created The New-England Courant, the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies. When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin invented the pseudonym of \"Mrs. Silence Dogood,\" who was ostensibly a middle-aged widow. Her letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the Courant's readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin left his apprenticeship without permission, and in so doing became a fugitive.\n\nAt age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived he worked in several printer shops around town. However, he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects. After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor Sir William Keith to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper to be empty, Franklin worked as a typesetter in a printer's shop in what is now the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great in the Smithfield area of London. Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of a merchant named Thomas Denham, who gave Franklin a position as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in Denham's merchant business.\n\nIn 1727, Benjamin Franklin, 21, created the Junto, a group of \"like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.\" The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia.\n\nReading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library, and initially pooled their own books together. This did not work, however, and Franklin initiated the idea of a subscription library, where the members pooled their monetary resources to buy books. This idea was the birth of the Library Company, with the charter of the Library Company of Philadelphia created in 1731 by Franklin. Franklin hired the first American librarian in 1732, Louis Timothee.\n\nOriginally, the books were kept in the homes of the first librarians, but in 1739 the collection was moved to the second floor of the State House of Pennsylvania, now known as Independence Hall. In 1791, a new building was built specifically for the library. The Library Company flourished with no competition and gained many priceless collections from bibliophiles such as James Logan and his physician brother William. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library with 500,000 rare books, pamphlets, and broadsides, more than 160,000 manuscripts, and 75,000 graphic items.\n\nUpon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade. By 1730, Franklin had set up a printing house of his own and had contrived to become the publisher of a newspaper called The Pennsylvania Gazette. The Gazette gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, together with a great deal of savvy about cultivating a positive image of an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect; though even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B. Franklin, Printer.'\n\nIn 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local Freemason lodge, becoming a grand master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania. That same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of James Anderson's Constitutions of the Free-Masons. Franklin remained a Freemason throughout the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1736, Franklin created the Union Fire Company, one of the first volunteer firefighting companies in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for New Jersey based on innovative anti-counterfeiting techniques which he had devised. Throughout his career, Franklin was an advocate for paper money, publishing A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation. In 1766 he made a case for paper money to the British House of Commons.\n\nAs he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he set forth a scheme for The Academy and College of Philadelphia. He was appointed president of the academy in November 13, 1749, and it opened on August 13, 1751. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a Bachelor of Arts and one as Master of Arts. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFranklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman, in June 1749 he became a Justice of the Peace for Philadelphia, and in 1751 he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. On August 10, 1753, Franklin was appointed joint deputy postmaster-general of North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his subsequent diplomatic services in connection with the relations of the colonies with Great Britain, and later with France.\n\nIn 1751, Franklin and Dr. Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in what was to become the United States of America.\n\nIn 1753, both Harvard and Yale awarded him honorary degrees.\n\nIn 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.\n\nIn 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia (see \"Associated Regiment of Philadelphia\" under heading of Pennsylvania's 103rd Artillery and 111th Infantry Regiment at Continental Army). He used Tun Tavern as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies. {Reportedly Franklin was elected \"Colonel\" of the Associated Regiment but declined the honor}.\n\nAlso in 1756, Franklin became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,"}, {"url": "https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/blair-sir-james-william-5266", "page_content": "by J. C. H. Gill\n\nSir James William Blair (1870-1944), politician, barrister and judge, was born at Coalfalls, Ipswich, Queensland, on 16 May 1870, younger son of Gordon Blair, a Scots customs officer, and his wife Julia, n\u00e9e Droughton. Educated at first by his Irish mother\u2014a strong personality\u2014he later attended Ipswich West State School, then Ipswich Grammar School from 6 March 1882 to the end of 1888 when he passed the University of Sydney senior public examination. In 1889 he was reading in Brisbane for the preliminary Bar examinations with F. ff. Swanwick, a barrister and schoolmaster who had been a member of parliament. He lived with Swanwick, published some newspaper verse and was admitted to the Queensland Bar on 6 March 1894 on the motion of Dr A. H. Boone.\n\nBlair made friends in 1894 with another 'native son', the then attorney-general T. J. Byrnes, and the two shared chambers until Byrnes's death in 1898. Over twenty years later Blair said, 'I was a hero-worshipper. Byrnes was my hero'. Already considered a master of both written and spoken English, Blair also possessed other attributes valuable in public speaking: he could be forceful, his voice was particularly pleasant and he had many 'graces of speech'. He was junior counsel for the Crown in prosecuting directors of the Queensland National Bank, and was briefed in the libel actions, Hoolan v. Directors of the Eagle and Jarvis v. Charters Towers Evening Telegraph. In the criminal jurisdiction he was counsel on appeal in the Kenniff trial. He had laid the reputation for the later widely held belief in his profession that, 'if the need arose, Jimmy Blair could make a jury weep'.\n\nAssociation with the politicians Swanwick and Byrnes had its effect. On 11 March 1902 Blair contested a general election as an independent candidate for Ipswich which then returned two members to the Legislative Assembly. He was placed second to T. B. Cribb, a member since 1896 who had been treasurer from February 1901. Blair achieved some notoriety by papering Ipswich with heart-shaped cards about an inch square: some said 'In the hearts of the people', others bore the humble legend 'Give Jimmy a vote'. There was only one Jimmy on the ballot paper and sufficient electors gave him a vote.\n\nFor one who subsequently gained a reputation as something of a bon viveur, Blair's parliamentary policy suggested either that the crusading zeal of a young man had not yet faded or that he could shrewdly assess his strongly Nonconformist constituents. He opposed Sunday opening of public houses and favoured rigorous enforcement of the Licensing Act and the introduction of local option without compensation; bars should be restricted to the hours imposed on shops by the Factories and Shops Act and should be closed on polling days. He also favoured more stringent enforcement of the Gambling Act, the minimization of Sunday labour, suppression of Sunday trading and prohibition of the sale of tobacco to children. His education policy sought to restrict government scholarships to State grammar schools, and envisaged a take-over by the State of the grammar schools and the grant to them of more scholarships. State-school parent-committees should not have to contribute to the repair of schools and school-residences. In other fields he sought extension of the Factories and Shops Act to the whole State, and the opening of polls under the Act not only to ratepayers but to all electors.\n\n(Sir) Arthur Morgan formed a coalition government with Labor's W. H. Browne on 17 September 1903. Needing a lawyer for attorney-general, he invited Blair, who thus became a minister at 33 and ex officio leader of the Queensland Bar. He was given the additional portfolio of mines on 27 April 1904 and retained both offices under Kidston. He was out of office during the brief reign of the Philp government from November 1907 but he regained his former portfolios when Kidston resumed power on 18 February 1908.\n\nBlair's first major bill became the Worker's Compensation Act of 1905\u2014a useful protective addition to the industrial laws. It was published with annotations in 1906 with Blair, T. W. McCawley and Thomas Macleod as joint editors. The preface claimed that the Act introduced a principle well known in the United Kingdom but hitherto unknown in Queensland law. In 1905 he and Macleod had revised and edited R. A. Ranking's Queensland Police Code and Justices' Manual of the Criminal Law. Blair had little success with his mining legislation: the 1905 Mining Act amendment bill was rejected, and a 1906 bill to consolidate and amend the laws relating to mining fields, mines and mining lapsed after the second reading. His Children's Court Act of 1907, which took offenders under seventeen into special closed courts, was a success, but his technical instruction bill of the same year was not returned by the Legislative Council.\n\nIn the first session of the seventeenth parliament in 1908 Blair produced and steered through parliament two measures that were to play a part nine years later in the T. J. Ryan government's efforts to abolish the Legislative Council. In November 1907 the council had refused to pass a trades disputes bill and an election Act amendment bill. Kidston sought to appoint enough councillors to have these measures passed. Lord Chelmsford, the governor, refused this on the ground that Kidston had no mandate to increase the size of the Upper House. Kidston asked for a dissolution, was refused, and resigned. Philp tried to form a government, was defeated, and thereupon sought and, to Kidston's consternation, was granted a dissolution. On Kidston's return to power with a large following in February 1908, he sought to resolve future conflicts with the Upper House by constitutional means. First, Blair brought down an amendment of the Constitution repealing the clause in section 9 (amendment of the Constitution) which required a two-thirds majority on the second and third readings of bills for amendment. This paved the way for a further amendment\u2014the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act\u2014under which measures rejected by the council, or which it refused in two consecutive sessions to pass in the form which the assembly desired, could be submitted to the people by way of referendum and, if approved, automatically become law.\n\nDuring the parliamentary recess in 1908, Blair made a 3500 mile (5632 km) motor trip in his 1905 Panhard with four companions through outback Queensland. It enabled him to educate himself in the needs of remote districts, and attracted world-wide interest as automotive pioneering. Given the condition of the roads\u2014where they existed\u2014it was a remarkable achievement; Blair felt he had demonstrated 'the utility of motor transit in the heart of Queensland'.\n\nKidston had spent the recess in the United Kingdom. On his return, he decided that the government could survive only by a fusion with the Opposition. Some Opposition members had to be brought into the cabinet and Blair was one of the ministers displaced. It was said that Kidston promised to compensate him with a seat on the southern Supreme Court bench, and that he had accepted, but he was in fact offered a seat on the northern bench so that C. E. Chubb, who had been there for over fifteen years, could be transferred to Brisbane. Blair refused and had to wait fourteen years for another approach. With Peter Airey and George Kerr, who had also lost portfolios, Blair then led what was called 'the Independent Opposition'. He could have been a thorn in Kidston's side, but came to his rescue in October 1910 when Ryan and Edward Macartney were hammering home the auditor-general's criticism of government expenditure on the University of Queensland. He was unable, however, to stomach Kidston's offer to bear the cost of opposition by the Queensland Tramway Employees' Association to an application for registration under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act by the rival Australian Tramway Employees' Union; the latter ceased work on 19 January 1912. As other unions became involved, the dispute escalated into a general strike. Although Blair actively preached moderation throughout, and persuaded the Ipswich railway workers to go back, his mining constituents and the waterside workers remained out some time longer.\n\nD. F. Denham, who had succeeded Kidston as premier in February 1911, called a general election for 27 April 1912 as soon as the strike had collapsed. A requisition signed by nearly a thousand voters invited Blair to accept nomination as the government candidate for Ipswich. He accepted and worked with a committee of crusty conservatives and former Labor supporters who had 'thrown off the Trades Hall yoke', and who admired his stand in the strike.\n\nHaving been re-elected, Blair returned to the ministry on 3 September as secretary for public instruction, replacing K. McD. Grant who had resigned on a point of principle. He held office until 1 June 1915, usually deputizing on legal matters for Attorney-General T. O'Sullivan who sat in the council. In this last phase of his political career, Blair was responsible for further social legislation. The Criminal Code was amended in 1913 to raise the age of consent from 14 to 17 and to provide elaborately for the protection of girls. The Testator's Family Maintenance Act (1914) gave the court discretion to prevent unjust disinheritance of immediate family. The Friendly Societies Act was also amended that year to permit them to become the only corporate owners of pharmacies in Queensland. State secondary school scholarships, instead of being awarded by competition, went to all those who qualified, and scholarship-extensions were granted to those who passed the junior public examination.\n\nAfter Labor's sweeping victory in the general election of 22 May 1915, the government majority of 22 became a minority of 18. Blair, who had declined Denham's endorsement, stood again as an independent and lost his seat to D. A. Gledson, a Labor candidate, by 400 votes. The mining areas of his electorate abandoned him completely. He claimed to have been sick throughout the campaign and, when it ended, he spent several days in hospital.\n\nHenceforth Blair concentrated on his legal practice. In 1917 he appeared with Ryan for the government in the Legislative Council referendum case, arguing the validity of the constitutional legislation he had had passed in 1908. The State Full Court declared both Acts invalid. The High Court of Australia unanimously reversed this decision and declared that the Legislative Council could be abolished by an Act in accordance with the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act. Blair was also in great demand as a counsel in criminal cases.\n\nThe Judges Retirement Act (1921) removed a number of over-age judges, and Blair accepted the position on the northern bench offered him by Labor Premier E. G. Theodore in 1922. He and his wife moved their home to Townsville. On 24 January 1923 he was transferred to the central bench at Rockhampton. When McCawley died prematurely on 16 April 1925, Blair succeeded him as chief justice on 24 April, spending his first few days of office arranging a memorial fund. From 1930 he acted as deputy governor for brief periods, served as administrator in April 1932 pending the arrival of Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, and was formally appointed lieutenant-governor on 23 May 1933. On 1 June 1930 he had been knighted on the instigation of the A. E. Moore government, and on 3 June 1935 was appointed K.C.M.G.\u2014seemingly directly by the King whose jubilee year it was, for his name did not appear on the Commonwealth list and the W. Forgan Smith government made no recommendations.\n\nThere were three classic cases in Blair's term as chief justice. In 1929 the Country National Progressive ministry set up a royal commission to investigate the purchase by its Labor predecessors of two mines at Mungana in North Queensland. The report condemned W. McCormack and Theodore, both former premiers, and the government immediately proceeded against them and two others for conspiracy, seeking \u00a330,000 in damages. Although complex and highly technical, the case created intense interest and political passion because it was said to be designed expressly to destroy the career of Theodore, then Federal treasurer. The trial lasted twenty-one days before Blair and a jury of four, and was decided in favour of the defendants. Newspapers of all political colours agreed that his 4\u00bd-hour summing-up was extremely fair. The suggestion, under a thin fictional veil, of his venality in Frank Hardy's political novel Power without Glory rests on no more than malicious contemporary gossip.\n\nIn October 1939 Blair presided over an extraordinary criminal trial. On 4 August 1937 members of the League for Social Justice had invaded a Labor caucus meeting in the old Legislative Council chamber at Parliament House, armed with batons, coils of barbed wire and hammers. They were committed for trial on charge of 'assembly in such a manner as to cause fear that they would tumultuously disturb the peace'. With so many accused, the trial had to be held in the Brisbane City Hall. Although Blair made it perfectly clear to the jury that he believed all the accused to be guilty, they were all found not guilty.\n\nBlair's third cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre is known as the Ithaca election petition. Edward Hanlon, a Labor minister and member for Ithaca, was opposed in 1938 by George Webb of the Protestant Labour Party and won by only 456 votes. Webb appealed to Mr Justice Edward Douglas, sitting as an elections tribunal, that Hanlon in his campaign had distributed illegal leaflets: the appeal was upheld. Hanlon's counter-appeal to the Full Court was sustained and Webb's application for leave to appeal to the High Court was refused. Douglas felt aggrieved by the removal of judicial pension rights in 1922 by the Labor government and was concerned at what he saw as threats to judicial independence. Resentment at the reversal of his decision in the Ithaca petition case and suspicion of Blair's attitude over the pensions issue finally boiled over into a statement published in the Brisbane Truth on 22 October 1944. He asserted that Blair had suppressed a pension plan for judges submitted to him for consideration by the government, had received a salary as lieutenant-governor, and had been given large undisclosed payments by the government without statutory authority. Other judges united in condemning Douglas but Blair, now retired, maintained a dignified silence. Questions asked in parliament and statements in the ensuing controversy made in clear that Douglas was mistaken on the pensions question, that Blair had not received any salary as lieutenant-governor, and that the alleged undisclosed payments were in fact the salary equivalent of accumulated periods of sabbatical leave.\n\nIn the parliamentary debates on the establishment of the University of Queensland, Blair had argued unsuccessfully for the waiving of all fees and in 1915-16 became a member of the senate. He was reappointed in 1926 and was elected chancellor in 1927. He moved immediately to improve the university's primitive accommodation and by 1930 had accepted a gift of 200 acres (81 ha) at St Lucia from Dr J. O. Mayne. The work of creating a new campus occupied much of his time, but World War II prevented its completion before his death.\n\nIn 1912-13 Blair was a committee-member of the Ipswich Grammar School Old Boys' Association and became joint patron of its Brisbane branch in 1932. He held office also in both the Queensland Scottish Union and the Queensland Irish Association. A notable athlete in his youth, he was later president of the Queensland Rugby Union. Ipswich district cricket competitions of the early twentieth century included a team called Blair's. In his later years he became more interested in the turf and was president of Tattersall's Club in 1911-22. He was also a member of the Queensland and Johnsonian clubs.\n\nOn 16 May 1940 Blair retired from the bench but remained lieutenant-governor and chancellor of the university. He died of cerebro-vascular disease on 18 November 1944 at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in South Brisbane, leaving an estate valued for probate at \u00a33718. After a service at St John's Cathedral, the state funeral proceeded to Bulimba cemetery. He was survived by his wife May Christina, n\u00e9e Gibson, nineteen years his junior, whom he had married on 29 February 1912 at St Andrew's Church of England, South Brisbane; they had no children.\n\nBlair was regarded as something of a dandy: he frequently wore a 'white gardenia in his buttonhole and a silk handkerchief peeping from his breast pocket'. Like all public men he had his detractors\u2014he was venal, he was weak, he 'married beneath him' because of that weakness, and he lacked dignity. Others saw outstanding gifts which took him, a native son of the people, to some of the highest offices in the State, and delighted in his colourful personality, his gift of ready and apt speech, his wit and love of humour, his kindness of heart and genuine interest in his fellow men."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/abs/blair-education-bill-a-lost-opportunity-in-american-public-education/00188E9BE26F86F03BCE1B46C845052F", "page_content": "Our analysis of the Blair Bill proceeds as follows. Section II describes how and why the Blair Bill made it onto the congressional agenda as often as it did. Drawing on the work of John Kingdon and Richard Valelly, we posit the 1880s as a moment when the \u201cpolicy window\u201d opened, allowing for potential reform. Footnote 34 Section III describes the Blair Bill, traces its legislative history, and sketches out the political battle it instigated. Here we also analyze roll call votes as a way to highlight the partisan rivalries that brought the bill down. Section IV concludes by articulating how our discussion of the Blair Bill debate sheds light on the Great Society's education reform bill.\n\nGoing into the 51st Congress, Blair had reason to be confident that his bill would pass. It had already passed the Senate three times, only to languish in the Democratically controlled House. After the 1888 elections, however, the Republicans would control the House, Senate, and presidency. Even if some Republicans opposed the bill, Blair had worked to cultivate bipartisan support. And since President Benjamin Harrison was a supporter of the bill, Blair felt confident that if he could get the bill through Congress, it would be signed into law. Local control was thus under credible assault and the political context seemed likely to ensure its demise. Yet the status quo went unchanged, and federal intervention would not occur until 1965.\n\nUnderstanding why the Blair Bill failed to pass offers insights into how the nation's education system remained, until the latter half of the twentieth century, protected from federal intervention. The durability of local control is not attributable to widespread endorsement of or \u201cuniversal acceptance\u201d of state over federal responsibility. Blair and his allies challenged, and nearly brought down, this governing arrangement. Footnote 32 Our analysis makes clear how and why local control went unchanged at what David Bateman and Dawn Langan Teele call a \u201crelevant counterfactual node,\u201d that is, a \u201ctemporally defined instance in which an outcome actually was possible but did not occur.\u201d Footnote 33\n\nIn short, Blair's success hinged on the cooperation of a fragile coalition: tariff supporters, nativists, freedmen, and Southern Democrats. Analyzing votes in both the House and Senate, we demonstrate that such a coalition was possible, but failed to materialize under the weight of racial, economic, and regional tensions. More specifically, we show that Northern lawmakers representing constituencies with higher proportions of foreign-born residents opposed the bill. Footnote 30 Blair intentionally pitted those concerned with the Republican Party's nativism against advocates for federal aid, many of whom saw the bill as promoting black civil rights. He positioned himself as an inheritor of the GOP's historic commitment to racial equality, yet he also bolstered the party's hostile attitude toward immigrants, especially Catholics. This tension cost Blair much-needed political support. Footnote 31 In Blair's defeat we see Southern Democrats wholly opposed to the exercise of any federal power on behalf of black citizens cooperating with Northern lawmakers who believed that they had no obligation to provide an education to freed men and women living, primarily, in the South.\n\nYet we also expand on Bateman, Katznelson, and Lapinski's analysis of Blair's fragile coalition by exploring the behavior of northerners\u2014both Republicans and Democrats\u2014whose opposition played an important role in the bill's failure. Winning the support of Southern Democrats was central to Blair's strategy, but their votes alone were insufficient to ensure passage. Blair also needed the votes of those lawmakers representing non-Southern states with lower proportions of illiterate residents. The bill therefore included language explicitly prohibiting federal funds from going to support Catholic schools. Footnote 25 This provision fit a broader pattern of Republican Party hostility toward disproportionately Catholic, immigrant communities in the Northeast and Midwest. Footnote 26 The money Blair proposed to spend also fit with the Republican Party's economic commitments. By spending down the federal surplus, his bill undermined efforts by Democratic lawmakers to reduce the tariff. Footnote 27 Last, Blair wrote his bill seeking to win votes from those with some lingering commitment to the postwar civil rights agenda. Bateman, Katznelson, and Lapinski rightly argue that Blair's proposal was a \u201cdeeply ambivalent and uneven civil rights measure.\u201d Footnote 28 It endorsed segregated schools and failed to provide a clear mechanism for punishing state officials who short-changed black schools. Yet the bill did win support from black civic organizations and civil rights activists. Footnote 29\n\nWe support this view. The Blair Bill sought to appropriate federal money to the states to support primary and secondary schools. The bill's formula stipulated that the amount of money a given state received annually would be based on the number of \u201cilliterates\u201d (a census-defined group) living within its boundaries. Footnote 22 Conditioning funding on literacy levels rather than population ensured that Southern states, with high proportions of illiterate residents, would receive almost two-thirds of the money appropriated. Footnote 23 Blair's plan also obligated any recipient state with segregated schools to distribute its portion of money equally. In so doing, the bill put the federal government on record supporting separate-but-equal schooling well before Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) declared it constitutionally acceptable. In short, Blair hoped to \u201cbuy\u201d Southern Democratic support with federal aid and a promise not to interfere with school segregation. Yet by empowering Congress to set conditions on how the money would be appropriated, and by legislating oversight mechanisms\u2014even weak ones\u2014the Blair Bill would have reallocated the distribution of power between states and the federal government. Footnote 24\n\nDue to its substantive importance, as well as the interesting political debate it generated, the Blair Bill has received some scholarly attention. Footnote 20 David Bateman, Ira Katznelson, and John Lapinski, for example, explain how the fight over the Blair Bill suggests the \u201cpossibility of an alternative South\u201d in which Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans worked across racial, partisan, and geographic lines on issues that \u201cstruck a compromise between a fading, but still real, national concern for the condition of southern blacks, and the local autonomy that was the overarching purpose of white Democratic politics.\u201d Blair failed, they argue, because the Southern supporters he worked so hard to win over abandoned him in 1890. Footnote 21\n\nWhere the Hoover Administration sees \u201chabit\u201d and \u201cuniversal acceptability\u201d as explanations for the American commitment to local control, we instead identify a group of lawmakers who, for a variety of reasons, blocked Blair's effort to bring federal power to bear in education policy. Footnote 18 To substantiate this claim, we explore the decade between 1880 and 1890, during which Congress debated Blair's proposal. We describe the coalition that pushed versions of his bill through the Senate multiple times. We show that it won endorsements from Republican presidents, and it was central to the GOP's political agenda. Footnote 19 Yet after a decade of prolonged debate, with unified control of government, the Republican-controlled Senate surprised Blair in 1890 by voting to kill his bill. Its failure signaled the end, for generations, of meaningful efforts to provide federal aid to the nation's schools. That is, the Blair Bill was not only the first bill to propose direct federal aid to state primary and secondary schools, it was the only bill to do so that passed the House or Senate between the 50th Congress (1887\u201389) and the 80th Congress (1947\u201349).\n\nOur analysis therefore contributes to a corpus of research examining the uneven course of American state development. Footnote 15 In the United States, periods of national state expansion are not evenly distributed over all aspects of the federal government. Federal power grew at different speeds, and with different levels of opposition. For this reason, political development should not be seen as a \u201csingle interruption in political and social life.\u201d Instead, it unfolds \u201cdynamically over time.\u201d Footnote 16 Thus, we argue that the ESEA marks the end of a political conflict initiated in the 1880s, rather than simply one more policy enactment associated with the Great Society. Footnote 17 To explain how Congress enacted the ESEA, we need to understand how and why Great Society Democrats overcame or avoided obstacles that plagued would-be education reformers like Henry Blair. Thinking historically in this way\u2014in particular by documenting the pivotal role race and nativism played in early conflicts over education policy\u2014makes clear why contemporary debates over education also implicate issues of social and political equality.\n\nWe argue that the resilience of local control needs to be explained, not simply attributed to habit or tradition. Through multiple periods during which federal power expanded in significant ways\u2014Reconstruction (1865\u20131877), the Progressive Era (1900\u20131916), and the New Deal (1932\u20131952)\u2014the federal government's role in primary and secondary education went largely unchanged. Footnote 12 In this article we examine the first sustained effort to assert federal authority over primary and secondary schools, instigated during the 1880s by Senator Henry Blair (R-NH). Blair sought enactment of legislation that would turn Congress into a reliable source of funds and oversight for the nation's schools. Like the 1965 ESEA, Blair's proposal targeted money to those states most in need of federal support (more on this below). Early versions of the bill also empowered Congress to play a meaningful role in setting and enforcing standards as to how the money would be spent. Blair's efforts failed, but had he been successful, later political battles over a variety of issues related to equal access might have played out differently. Footnote 13 Furthermore, because the ESEA reflected principles central to late twentieth-century liberalism\u2014bureaucratization and centralized administration\u2014its implementation was judged according to \u201cprocedure and process\u201d rather than a \u201cfocus on student or school results.\u201d Footnote 14 Delaying federal intervention until the 1960s, in other words, had consequences for how the program was implemented.\n\nCommenting on the superiority of state over federal authority in education, a report commissioned by the Hoover Administration in 1929 to study education reform proposals attributes support for local control to the conditions faced by early settlers. \u201cThe frontier was characterized by the relative isolation and necessarily self-contained nature of community life,\u201d the report's authors argued. \u201cHence was developed a unique and powerful habit of local responsibility and control which was so much taken as a matter of course that it was at first universally accepted as the only proper basis of federal relations to education.\u201d Footnote 10 This governing arrangement\u2014state control, almost no federal involvement\u2014remained in place until 1965, when Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act (ESEA). As part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society program, the ESEA, for the first time, directed federal money to schools in districts serving children more likely to come from low-income, historically disadvantaged backgrounds. Footnote 11\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, primary and secondary schooling were \u201calmost exclusively a state and local concern.\u201d Footnote 4 Individual states set out in their constitutions how they intended to provide children with a \u201cpublic\u201d education: one that was \u201cfree, open to all students of a specified age \u2026 and financed and governed by public authorities.\u201d Footnote 5 Schools were primarily funded through property taxes determined and collected by the states themselves. Footnote 6 Decisions about hiring, length of the school year, subjects taught, and building and renovations were also made by local officials. Inconsistency ruled. Per capita expenditures on schools in 1890, for example, ranged from a high of $4.29 (California) to a low of $0.44 (North Carolina). Footnote 7 Connecticut provided a 121-day \u201cschool year\u201d for its children; in South Carolina, children attended for only fifty-one days per year. Signaling further the exclusive role played by state governments, the Department of Education was \u201cdowngraded\u201d in 1869 to a bureau inside the Department of the Interior, making it, according to Morton Keller, \u201clittle more than a data-gathering agency.\u201d Footnote 8 The federal government purchased and made available public land for secondary and elementary schools, but not much else. Footnote 9\n\nDespite a shared belief in the link between education and self-government, the framers did not \u201cconstitutionalize\u201d education policy. Nowhere did they specify the source and quality of educational \u201cencouragements\u201d: how schools were to be funded, maintained, filled, and run, or who would make these choices. As a result, the location and relative power of government to provide children with an education has long been the subject of political contestation. By exploring debates over the federal government's role in guaranteeing Americans an education, we therefore gain important insights into the historical development of the American state.\n\nEducation is not directly addressed in America's founding documents, but it was never far from the minds of those who wrote them. Thomas Jefferson described education as \u201cthe most certain and most legitimate engine of government.\u201d \u201cEducate and inform the whole mass of people,\u201d he argued, \u201cenable them to see that it is in their interest to preserve peace and order, and they will preserve it.\u201d Footnote 1 In his first message to Congress in 1790, George Washington described knowledge as the \u201csurest basis of public happiness.\u201d \u201cIn one in which the measures of government receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours,\u201d he stated, \u201c[education] is proportionately essential.\u201d Footnote 2 In the Northwest Ordinance, passed by the Confederation Congress in 1787, lawmakers declared, \u201creligion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government \u2026 schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\u201d Two years before the Northwest Ordinance, the Confederation Congress adopted a land ordinance stipulating that one-sixteenth of every western township be set aside for \u201cthe maintenance of public schools.\u201d Footnote 3 The framers of the Constitution believed that only an educated citizenry could sustain a government founded upon consent and equality.\n\nThe 1880s were a time of \u201cinsecure majorities\u201d and, consequently, intense partisan conflict. Footnote 74 At the same time, conflict raged within each of the two major parties. Blair sought to capitalize on this moment by pushing a reform proposal, addressing a salient public problem, in a way designed specifically to win bipartisan supporters. Had he been successful, Blair may have set the stage for additional cooperation across partisan and geographic lines even as he eroded local control of education. We now turn to a discussion of the debate over the Blair Bill, which will reveal the reasons for Blair's failure.\n\nFollowing the 1888 election\u2014when Republican Benjamin Harrison was elected president and the GOP regained control of both chambers of Congress\u2014Republicans acted on this skepticism when they pushed a federal elections bill, which sought to shift the power to manage House elections from the states to the federal judiciary. This effort failed when a GOP faction in the Senate\u2014those referred to as \u201csilver Republicans\u201d\u2014defected and joined with Democrats to kill the bill. Footnote 73 The GOP's western wing would also prove pivotal to the fate of Blair's proposal. In the early 1880s, however, Blair was confident that he could put together a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats to get his bill passed. His confidence was justified by inter- and intraparty tensions that made possible this kind of unlikely political coalition.\n\nArthur's plan to ally the GOP with Democratic dissidents is important for two reasons. First, it generated intraparty tensions. In seeking the support of free silver and anti-debt advocates, Arthur and his supporters would force some Republicans to accept compromises to important planks of the party's pro-business agenda. Next, and most importantly, Arthur's approach failed. When he took office, Republicans controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Footnote 71 In the 1882 midterms, however, the GOP suffered a crushing defeat, resulting in a seventy-nine-seat disadvantage in the House and a much smaller majority in the Senate. In 1884, Democrat Grover Cleveland was elected president, and the Democrats would continue to control the House during his first administration. During these years, Republican and Independent electoral efforts in the South faltered considerably. Footnote 72 By the late 1880s many Republicans were losing faith in the prospect of an interregional coalition that included disaffected Democrats and black citizens.\n\nSupport for public education funding from Democratic dissidents proved particularly important once President James Garfield embraced a \u201cdivide the Democrats\u201d political strategy by promoting Southern candidates affiliated with various splinter groups. Following Garfield's assassination, President Chester Arthur continued working to \u201cunite Republicans, Readjusters, Greenbackers, Independents, and \u2018Liberals\u2019\u201d in order to displace the Democratic state governments. Footnote 69 Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler outlined this strategy in a letter to Senator James Blaine (R-ME). \u201cOur straight Republican, carpet-bag, Negro governments \u2026 have been destroyed and cannot be revived,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand without these coalitions or support from Independents we cannot carry enough southern votes to save the House from Bourbon Democratic control, and carry the next presidential fight.\u201d Footnote 70 Victory in the South\u2014a GOP goal throughout the 1880s\u2014required them to make common cause with local whites.\n\nAs Democratic state governments retrenched, factions within the party emerged to request federal money. Disaffected Democrats, in other words, supported Blair. For example, Readjusters in Virginia\u2014a splinter faction of agrarian Democrats\u2014fought to reopen public schools for blacks and whites alike after the legislature defunded the state's young school system. Footnote 67 They also broke with the party in calling for the \u201creadjustment\u201d of state war debts so that more money could be spent on the economically distressed. Footnote 68 This aspect of their agenda departed from the GOP's commitment to \u201cfiscal conservatism\u201d\u2014hard money, balanced budgets, and industrial tariffs. And while Henry Blair counted himself among the party orthodoxy, he campaigned for Readjuster candidates prior to the 1882 election because of their support for public education. Blair was thus willing to set aside potential disagreement over economic policy in order to convince southerners to support the bill.\n\nThe plans hatched by liberal reformers, and implemented throughout the South, proved expensive. As the troops withdrew, and the nation tired of the Reconstruction project, so did the momentum for their continuation. Democratic-controlled state houses abolished boards of education, cut state and local property taxes, and \u201call but dismantled the education systems established during Reconstruction.\u201d Footnote 64 State funds appropriated for public education were frequently used to pay interest on state debt, so teachers frequently went without pay. Footnote 65 So dire was the threat to Southern schools, argued one reformer, that the \u201clittle that has been done [already] \u2026 far surpasses anything that the friends of education can or will do in the South for the next twenty years if they are compelled to rely upon their own resources.\u201d Footnote 66\n\nYet for white audiences paying attention in the late nineteenth century, Blair's invocation of slavery carried a double meaning. First and most obviously, Blair was referring to the central outcome of the war: A largely illiterate population of ex-slaves now expected to play a role in civic life. Yet Republicans also frequently portrayed the Catholic Church as an institution opposed to human freedom. In a speech to Civil War veterans, for example, President Ulysses Grant endorsed federal aid to public schools. In the same speech, he condemned any appropriation for Catholic schools because, he proclaimed, they teach \u201csuperstition, ambition, and ignorance.\u201d Footnote 60 In his 1875 campaign for governor of Ohio, future president Hayes explained his plan to use debate over federal aid to public schools as a weapon to contest the influx of \u201cCatholic foreigners.\u201d In speeches backing Hayes's gubernatorial campaign, future president James Garfield portrayed the Church as \u201cmoving the whole of its front against modern civilization.\u201d \u201cOur fight in Ohio,\u201d he went on, \u201cis only a small portion of the battlefield.\u201d Footnote 61 Federal aid advocates saw in public schools an opportunity to contend with what they portrayed as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of foreigners who threatened to grow the ranks of radicals and Catholics. Footnote 62 Even participants at the annual convention of the National Education Association convention in 1888 linked public school education with the fight against nonnative residents. Footnote 63\n\nFederal aid for the nation's primary and secondary schools played a central role in the plans of postwar reformers, both black and white. W.E.B. Dubois's analysis of Reconstruction reported that \u201cthe first great mass movement for public education at the expense of the state in the South came from Negroes.\u201d Footnote 54 These efforts showed real results. Between 1865 and 1870, the Freedman's Bureau spent more than $5 million on schools throughout the South. By July 1870, there existed 4,239 schools, which employed 9,307 teachers and educated 247,333 students. Footnote 55 One Vermont native who traveled to Mississippi and became active in the public school movement there declared education to be the \u201cenergizing agent of modern civilization.\u201d It was an \u201canswer to the race problem in southern society\u201d because only schooling could \u201cenlighten the white masses\u201d and thereby erode their anti-black prejudices. Footnote 56 Black citizens in particular viewed a commitment to education as central to their political and material advancement. According to Eric Foner, they were even willing to overcome their skepticism of segregated facilities because they believed that separate schools were better than no schools. Footnote 57 Daniel Crofts argues that the Blair's goal of providing federal aid to schools represented \u201cthe one politically promising piece of national legislation which offered something blacks wanted.\u201d Footnote 58 Black newspapers editorialized in favor of the bill, black historian George W. Williams called it \u201cthe grandest measure of our times,\u201d and in September 1883, the Colored National Convention endorsed Blair's proposal. Footnote 59\n\nHayes's decision to link federal aid for internal improvements turned Blair's proposal into a vehicle for Republicans to pursue policy reform and political advantage. Federal aid addressed the concerns of many in the South who recognized that state funds were insufficient relative to what the region needed. Southern poverty handicapped state school systems. Per the 1880 Census, more than 72 percent of \u201cilliterates\u201d living in the United States called the South home. Footnote 51 Southern state governments collectively spent less than a fifth of what non-Southern states spent on education in 1880. Footnote 52 Blair acknowledged these trends when he argued that the \u201cnation as such abolished slavery as a legal institution; but ignorance is slavery, and no matter what is written in your constitutions and your laws slavery will continue until intelligence, the handmaid of liberty, shall have illuminated the whole land.\u201d Footnote 53\n\nHayes combined his patronage with a program of federal aid. In his inaugural address, he acknowledged that the war had \u201carrested [the] material development,\u201d of the South. To rebuild, the former Confederacy needed \u201cthe considerate care of the national government within the just limits prescribed by the Constitution and wise public economy.\u201d Footnote 48 Hayes repeatedly \u201cexpressed himself in very decided terms in favor of a system of internal improvements calculated to benefit and develop the South.\u201d Footnote 49 Part and parcel of this aid program was federal funding for schools. \u201cLiberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the state governments,\u201d he argued, \u201cand, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.\u201d Footnote 50 The GOP thus actively sought to leverage material incentives to win Southern support.\n\nTaking office in 1877, Rutherford Hayes was the first Republican president to confront the dilemma generated by the newly redeemed Southern states. Unwilling to give up on the South, Hayes believed that continued Republican success there required a dual program of patronage and internal improvements. He immediately began appointing \u201cex-Confederates, old-line Whigs, Douglas Democrats, and plain Democrats.\u201d Footnote 45 Overall, one-third of Hayes's Southern appointments during the first months of his administration went to Democrats. Footnote 46 In his diary, Hayes wrote that this patronage policy alone might \u201csecure North Carolina, with a fair chance in Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas,\u201d and maybe even \u201cLouisiana, South Carolina and Florida.\u201d Footnote 47\n\nFederal education aid also led to regional divisions. The Republican Party took the lead in spearheading aid proposals, and most of them explicitly endorsed prohibitions on any appropriations for Catholic institutions. This explicit anti-Catholicism reflected a broader \u201cnativist revival\u201d led by the party's reformist wing. Lawmakers like Blair were hostile toward Catholics and immigrants, who, they believed, were a threat to national cohesion and a potential source of labor radicalism. Footnote 42 Irish Catholics, in particular, \u201cwhose politics were overwhelmingly Democratic, whose Negrophobia was raw and overt, and whose concentration in cities and heavy use of alcohol,\u201d argues Keller, \u201cirritated Protestant Republican sensibilities.\u201d Footnote 43 With record levels of transatlantic immigrants settling primarily outside the South\u2014areas of the country in which the GOP had a clear partisan advantage\u2014Republican lawmakers also recognized a growing political threat. Nativism served those Republicans not accountable to foreign-born voters. Also, with dramatically fewer foreign-born Catholics living in the South, lawmakers there faced less political pressure from constituents worried about nativist policy. Footnote 44\n\nDemocrats also faced internal tensions. As a consequence of the Panic of 1873 and the economic austerity supported by some Democratic governors, a number of splinter groups emerged to speak on behalf of those most harmed by retrenchment. Footnote 39 Self-styled \u201cGreenbackers,\u201d \u201cIndependents,\u201d and \u201cReadjusters\u201d voiced internal dissatisfaction with the party's positions on monetary policy, taxation, federal aid for internal improvements, and payment of state debts incurred during the Civil War. Held together by the war and then Reconstruction, \u201cthe disaffected partners could scarcely wait until Redemption was achieved to air their grievances and fall upon the leaders of the dominant element of Redeemers.\u201d Footnote 40 Federal aid to public education\u2014and the Blair Bill specifically\u2014emerged as a wedge issue dividing Southern Democrats. Opinion throughout the South was mixed with some seeing education funding as a potentially vital source of aid, and others as an unconstitutional expansion of federal power. Footnote 41\n\nRepublican Presidents Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester Arthur, and Benjamin Harrison put varying amounts of effort into increasing the GOP's fortunes in the South. The strategies they implemented were not identical, but they do reflect the party's well-established political commitments and practices: a lingering commitment to black equality, support for the tariff, opposition to currency reform, generous use of patronage and federal aid to incentivize support from persuadable skeptics, and, increasingly, nativism targeting immigrant populations in urban centers. Footnote 38 By 1890, however, the party's internal tensions were such that Blair's federal aid proposal met with an insurmountable level of intraparty opposition.\n\nBlair's wager grew out of an important political reality: The internal dynamics of both parties were particularly unsettled once Reconstruction ended in 1877. Forced to withdraw federal troops from the South, the GOP almost immediately saw its political position weaken. Through violence, intimidation, and voter fraud, Democrats acted quickly to reestablish political supremacy. As a consequence, Republicans found themselves confronting two questions: Did it make sense to commit time and resources to Southern states, where the GOP was increasingly unpopular? And, if so, what was the best strategy for winning support there?\n\nSenator Henry Blair (R-NH) found himself with a window of opportunity in the 1880s to durably enhance federal power at the expense of the states. Provided with the chance to reallocate authority for primary and secondary schools from the states to the federal government, Blair's entrepreneurialism can be seen in his effort to build a national coalition composed of mostly Southern freedmen, white Southern Democrats, and Northern Republicans. This coalition, he believed, could force federal action to mitigate the illiteracy problem in a way that would simultaneously allow the GOP to pursue a broader political goal: its survival in the ex-Confederacy. Blair recognized that turmoil within the Democratic Party, as well as the desire among some southerners for federal money, made possible bipartisan and interregional cooperation. He wagered that an explicit appeal to southerners would compensate for any opposition from Northern Democrats or members of his own party.\n\nAmerican political development (APD) calls our attention to such entrepreneurs and highlights the formative role they play. Footnote 37 Less discussed, though still important, are the decisions of would-be entrepreneurs who failed in otherwise favorable circumstances. Failures of this kind do not simply highlight the political and institutional constraints faced by any lawmaker pushing a reform agenda. Near misses also allow us to consider plausible paths not taken and to appreciate the contingent nature of even long-standing governing arrangements.\n\nPolitical change, John Kingdon explains, is produced by the confluence of three different processes: problem recognition, presentation of alternatives, and political conflict. Footnote 35 When these processes collide, the result is what he describes as a \u201cpolicy window.\u201d When a policy window opens, those advocating for specific proposals find themselves with an opportunity to \u201cpush their pet solutions\u201d or \u201cdraw attention to their special problems.\u201d In short, status quo governing arrangements collapse when skilled politicians take advantage of an unsettled political environment to force action on a specific problem. Kingdon also makes clear that favorable circumstances for a policy change are not sufficient for change to occur. Skillful political entrepreneurship is also necessary. Entrepreneurs attach \u201csolutions to problems, overcoming the constraints by redrafting proposals, and taking advantage of politically propitious events.\u201d Footnote 36\n\n3. THE BLAIR EDUCATION BILL\n\nEntering the House of Representatives in 1875, Henry Blair almost immediately demonstrated interest in education policy. Even before he was the official Republican nominee, Blair wrote William E. Chandler\u2014then a powerful GOP newspaperman in New Hampshire\u2014to request \u201csome data showing the present condition of the cause of education in the South and the means of showing the work accomplished there by the Republican Party among both whites and blacks.\u201dFootnote 75 Blair recognized primary and secondary education policy as ripe for reform. He also recognized that pursuing such reform offered GOP lawmakers an opportunity to build a national, bipartisan, interracial coalition.\n\nAfter serving two House terms, Blair was elected to the Senate in 1879. In his first term, Blair was made chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor. Soon thereafter he introduced S. 151\u2014\u201cto aid in the establishment and temporary support of common schools.\u201dFootnote 76 This bill proposed $105 million in federal appropriations distributed over ten years, allocated in proportion to the number of \u201cilliterates\u201d more than ten years old living in a given state. This provision guaranteed that approximately 75 percent of all money appropriated would go to Southern states because illiteracy rates there were dramatically higher than in the North.Footnote 77 The bill also mandated that recipient states appropriate funds equal to those provided by the federal government. In its first year, the federal government would spend a total of $15 million; for each subsequent year, the total amount appropriated would decrease by $1 million. Blair structured the bill in this way to preempt arguments that he sought a federal takeover of the nation's schools. He claimed that the allocation formula would allow states to use federal funding as a way to jump-start self-sustaining public education systems. Permanent federal intervention would not therefore be necessary.Footnote 78 To ensure that the funds would be spent wisely, the bill created a federal supervisor for each state who was empowered to recommend a rescission of funds as punishment for fraud or misuse.\n\nIn an important concession to Southern members, S. 151 \u201cdemanded literal adherence to the idea of \u2018separate but equal.\u2019\u201dFootnote 79 In particular it stipulated, \u201cnothing herein shall deprive children of different races, living in the same community but attending separate schools, from receiving the benefits of this act, the same as though the attendance therein were without distinction of race.\u201dFootnote 80 This provision, however, guaranteed that the only way white children would receive federal funds would be for states to ensure that schools serving black children received an equal proportion of total funds spent. If states did not provide equal allocation to black schools, they would have to forego federal support.\n\nIn a three-hour speech advocating for his bill, Blair marshaled mountains of census data to illustrate \u201cactual condition of popular education in this country.\u201d He revealed how little Southern states in particular were doing to educate their children. Republican government would only survive if the public could read and write, he claimed. Universal education was one part of a strategy for ending the last \u201cpart of the [Civil] War\u201d against the \u201cforces of ignorance.\u201dFootnote 81 Providing federal funds to elementary and secondary schools was an important way in which the government worked to preserve itself.Footnote 82 Accordingly, Blair argued, the opportunity for learning to do both must \u201cbe provided at the public charge.\u201dFootnote 83 Many Southern Democrats endorsed this view. Senator Lucius Lamar (D-MS), for example, declared his support for S. 151 because \u201cno state could stand secure but on the ground of right, virtue, knowledge, and truth.\u201dFootnote 84\n\nCongress took no action on Blair's proposal prior to adjournment in August 1882. Between August and December, when Congress reconvened for a lame-duck session, President Arthur, the American Social Science Association, and the National Education Assembly endorsed S. 151.Footnote 85 The Interstate Education Alliance\u2014a coalition of white, Southern educators\u2014also called on Congress to enact the proposal. Teachers\u2019 associations, associations of state superintendents, and other local civic organizations operating throughout the South also mobilized to push for the bill.Footnote 86 Finally, as Table 1 illustrates, Congress received 272 petitions calling for the Blair Bill's enactment between 1881 and 1883.Footnote 87\n\nResponding to these demonstrations of support, Blair moved quickly to procure a special order that would bring his bill up for debate. Here he ran into the first instance of Republican opposition. Senator John Logan (R-IL) had authored his own education proposal, which he did not want to set aside. Where the Blair Bill sought to fund education through general revenue, Logan's bill aimed to raise funds through a new tax on whiskey.Footnote 88 More importantly, Logan also opposed appropriating money in proportion to state illiteracy rates. Speaking on the floor, he argued \u201cthat the proposition to distribute this money according to illiteracy is a proposition to ask a certain number of states to pay taxes to educate others. I do not think the country is in favor of any such proposition.\u201dFootnote 89 The sectional basis of Logan's opposition would consistently handicap Blair's efforts. Logan reflected a view held by some within the GOP that the federal government owed nothing to black citizens beyond emancipation. From Logan's perspective, residents of Illinois had no obligation to support the education of black southerners only recently freed from hundreds of years of slavery. Republican infighting thus led the Senate to table both education bills until the next Congress met.Footnote 90\n\nWhen the 48th Congress (1883\u201385) convened in December 1883, Blair immediately reintroduced his bill.Footnote 91 By this time, the political environment had shifted considerably. While the Republicans controlled the presidency and had a two-vote majority in the Senate, the Democrats now controlled the House.Footnote 92 The new political context convinced Blair that his policy and political goals could not be achieved without the support of Southern members. This largely explains the substantive differences between S. 151 and the newly introduced bill, S. 398. Highly suspicious of federal intervention into state functions, Southern Democrats opposed the federal supervisors created by Blair's initial bill. In an August 1883 speech before the National Education Assembly, Blair made known his willingness to instead allow for state administration of funds.Footnote 93 As we discuss below, the effort to weaken this provision led to intraparty conflict among Republicans.\n\nBlair also worked to maintain Southern support by once again protecting funding for states with segregated schools. Despite being a concession to Southern whites, this provision did not disqualify the bill in the eyes of many black citizens. An April 1884 story in the Washington Post, for example, describes a \u201clargely attended mass meeting\u201d organized by the Union Bethel Historical and Literary Association to support the Blair Bill. Frederick Douglass and other notable black public intellectuals were among those at the meeting.Footnote 94 Douglass would continue speaking on behalf of the bill until it failed for the final time in 1890.Footnote 95 Black teachers\u2019 associations in some Southern states also pressed elected officials to support the bill.Footnote 96 While Daniel Crofts makes clear that black civic organizations and leaders were not uniformly supportive of Blair, he does find that many believed federal education funding to be a \u201cray of hope.\u201dFootnote 97 In this way, the Blair Bill served as a political vehicle for Republicans to continue cultivating the support of black voters in the South.\n\nDebate on Blair's new proposal began in March 1884. Once again, he began with a long floor speech built upon a foundation of education statistics culled from the 1880 Census. To meet the nation's educational need, S. 398 proposed to distribute $105 million over ten years. In addition, the bill called for funds to be allocated to states based on the illiteracy rate, required states to match one-third of federal funds appropriated over the first five years after enactment and dollar-for-dollar during the last five years, and allowed states\u2014rather than a federal authority\u2014to oversee the expenditures.Footnote 98\n\nBlair spent a significant amount of time defending the separate-but-equal provision. He argued that separate but equal was acceptable as long as it was enforced. \u201cThe distribution shall be made in such a way as to equalize the money that goes to each child per capita throughout the state \u2026 to produce an equalization of school privileges throughout the state,\u201d Blair claimed, \u201cI do not think that anything could be more just.\u201dFootnote 99 Blair was left to put his faith in state-level officials throughout the South who would be responsible for distributing the money Congress appropriated.\n\nSenate consideration of Blair's proposal ran through March and into April 1884. Over the course of these four weeks, Blair again confronted opposition from fellow Republicans\u2014mostly from the West. For example, John Ingalls (R-KS) questioned the view that \u201cwe are under any obligation to educate the blacks of the South.\u201dFootnote 100 Similarly, Joseph Dolph (R-OR) argued that states outside the South had no obligation to provide funds to educate the poor white citizens or poor black citizens of the former Confederacy.Footnote 101 This internal resistance to the bill demonstrates in early form the Silver-Republican bloc whose influence would peak in the 1890s.Footnote 102 Contemporaneous observers also noted the regional bases of GOP opposition. A March 1884 article in the Washington Post, for example, argued that should the bill fail, Republican \u201csectional conspirators\u201d would be to blame.Footnote 103\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, tended to object for \u201cconstitutional\u201d reasons. The 1884 Democratic Party Platform, for example, declared the party \u201copposed to all propositions which, upon any pretext, would convert the general government into a machine for collecting taxes to be distributed among the states or the citizens thereof.\u201dFootnote 104 Contemporaneous news accounts attributed this provision to those who opposed the Blair Bill.Footnote 105 As we discuss more below, Democratic opposition also came from those who saw federal expenditures for education as a way to sabotage efforts to reduce the tariff.\n\nTo agree on a compromise, Senate Republicans met as a caucus and established a nine-member committee charged with developing a consensus approach to federal aid.Footnote 106 This committee produced a revised measure that appropriated $77 million over eight years, stipulated that states would not receive more money from the federal government than they spent on education at the state or local level, required that black and white schools receive equal funding, and mandated that states submit annual reports to the federal government detailing how they spent the money they received.Footnote 107\n\nIn early April 1884 the Senate considered important provisions to the newly revised bill. One such provision, offered by Senator Benjamin Harrison (R-IN), addressed Blair's willingness to trust that Southern members would distribute money equally between schools for black children and those for white children. Harrison's amendment empowered the secretary of the interior to \u201chear and examine any complaints of misappropriations or unjust discrimination in the use of funds.\u201dFootnote 108 The amendment also required the secretary to present the findings of his investigation to Congress before any additional money would be spent in the state under suspicion. In this way, Harrison addressed a concern raised by some Republicans that the bill did not provide enough federal oversight. Harrison's amendment passed 24\u201322, in a near party-line vote (see Table 2).Footnote 109 Southern Democrats\u2019 united opposition demonstrated their continued resistance to the exercise of federal power for the purpose of ensuring equal treatment of black citizens.\n\nMaintaining the support of this fragile coalition also led the GOP to adopt an amendment authored by Senator John Sherman (R-OH). The Sherman amendment explicitly prohibited Congress from spending any money on \u201csectarian\u201d schools. While Sherman proclaimed his intentions were simply to keep government from \u201cpropagat[ing] any faith,\u201d it was clear to contemporaneous observers that he was actually targeting Catholics.Footnote 110 Significant opposition to Sherman's amendment, as well as the overall bill, appeared in widely distributed Catholic periodicals. The Catholic World, for example, warned its readers that the \u201cProtestant orientation of the common school offered serious danger to Catholics.\u201dFootnote 111 Sherman's amendment passed 32\u201318. But unlike the vote on the Harrison amendment, there were intraparty divisions. As Table 2 indicates, the GOP supported the Sherman amendment by a wide margin (20\u20133), while the Democrats were split (11\u201315).Footnote 112\n\nTo further illustrate those factors influencing votes for and against Sherman's amendment, we examine this roll call in a multivariate regression model. Here we are primarily interested in the extent to which nativist sentiment motivated members to support Sherman's amendment. The dependent variable is a \u201cPro-Sherman Vote,\u201d denoted as 1 if the senator voted for the Sherman amendment and 0 otherwise. Our independent variable of interest is the percentage of foreign-born citizens living in a given senator's state.Footnote 113 We expect that senators representing states with higher levels of foreign-born residents would be less likely to support the Sherman amendment (all else equal) due to concerns about angering a politically active subset of their voters.Footnote 114 To control for other factors that might influence a senator's vote, we include measures of each senator's ideology, as measured by first- and second-dimension DW-NOMINATE scores. Traditionally, the first NOMINATE dimension is seen as distinguishing members based on their attitudes toward government intervention into the economy. A more \u201cliberal\u201d member (negative on the NOMINATE scale) would support intervention, while a more \u201cconservative\u201d member (positive on the NOMINATE scale) would oppose it.Footnote 115 Note that in the late nineteenth century, positive scores register support for the GOP's economic agenda (pro-tariff, hard money), while negative scores register opposition to that program.Footnote 116 The second NOMINATE dimension sometimes picks up additional cleavages over time; however, in the 49th Congress, no additional cleavage is apparent.Footnote 117 Nevertheless, for completeness, we include it. To measure partisanship, we include dummy variables for Southern and Northern Democrats (with Republican thus representing the excluded category).Footnote 118 Finally, we control for the illiteracy rate in a given state, as lawmakers from states with more \u201cilliterates\u201d stood to gain in purely monetary terms from Blair's proposal.\n\nThe results, as reported in Table 3, provide some confirming evidence for our claim about the influence of nativism. In Model 2, we find a negative and significant relationship between support for Sherman's amendment and the proportion of foreign-born residents.Footnote 119 This relationship fits with John Higham's claim that the reformist wing of the GOP held deeply anti-immigrant attitudes.Footnote 120 There is also a strong relationship between a senator's party and his first-dimension NOMINATE score and his support for the Sherman amendment. In the former case, Democrats were significantly less supportive than Republicans. In the latter case, as a given senator's support for the GOP's economic program increases, so does the likelihood he will support Sherman's effort to prohibit state expenditures on Catholic schools.\n\nFollowing a series of votes on narrower aspects of the bill, the Senate passed S. 398 on April 7, 1884. As the first column of Table 4 illustrates, Republicans and Southern Democrats supported the bill by wide margins, while Northern Democrats (those outside the eleven states of the former Confederacy) opposed it.Footnote 121 Despite the lopsided Republican vote, GOP support was weaker than the numbers suggest. Eleven Republicans\u2014including many of the bill's most outspoken opponents\u2014recognized the political liabilities incurred by voting against the measure and chose to absent themselves instead of voting \u201cno.\u201dFootnote 122 The support provided by Southern Democrats would also prove weaker than the vote suggests. As sectional tensions increased during the latter half of the decade, it would be harder for Blair to keep this part of the coalition in line.\n\nSenate passage was just the first step for Blair and his supporters. Next, they needed to get a similar bill through the House, where the Democrats were in control. The chief obstacle proved to be House Speaker John C. Carlisle (D-KY). Styling himself as a Democrat in the mold of Andrew Jackson, Carlisle was dead-set against GOP tariff policy. One contemporaneous account favorable to Carlisle described his motivation as \u201csupport for the rights of people against monopolists of all kind.\u201dFootnote 123 In the mid-1880s tariff reform\u2014which meant the reduction of tariff rates\u2014was central to the Democratic Party's agenda, putting the House majority at odds with Blair and his supporters. Carlisle's biographer makes clear that he believed \u201cno greater danger threatened the States than the possibility that the surplus [which was created by the GOP's high tariff rates] would be used for purposes which would take from them their right to determine their individual and local affairs.\u201dFootnote 124 Once implemented this is precisely what the Blair Bill would do.\n\nAs speaker, Carlisle leveraged his institutional power to prevent the House from taking up the Blair Bill prior to adjournment in early fall 1884.Footnote 125 This delay would prove particularly important because in November 1884, Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Republican James G. Blaine in the presidential election. As a consequence, Gordon McKinney argues, \u201cmany Republicans who felt comfortable with a Republican president overseeing the Southern Democrats\u2019 administration of the program were much less enthusiastic about having a Democratic administration in charge.\u201dFootnote 126\n\nThe 48th Congress took no additional action on Blair's proposal, so he reintroduced the bill in early January 1886, near the start of the 49th Congress (1885\u201387). Public support for the measure was still high, as measured by the number of petitions received (see Table 1), a threefold increase over the prior Congress. Before debate began on the bill (S. 194), which was identical to the one passed in 1884, Blair wrote President Cleveland in an attempt to win his support. \u201cShould the bill become law,\u201d Blair argued, \u201cthat administration which should carry its provisions into execution would become illustrious in the annals of America and of mankind.\u201dFootnote 127 Blair also worked hard to convince skeptical Republicans that the Democratic president could be trusted to administer the program. While Cleveland chose not to take a stand on S. 194, Senate Republicans again voted overwhelmingly in support (see Table 4).Footnote 128\n\nHere again, however, the vote tally obscures GOP skepticism toward Blair's proposal. Echoing many of the objections heard in 1884, Senator Ingalls (R-KS) inveighed against the bill because of its lopsided distribution of funds to Southern states. He then introduced an amendment mandating that the federal government distribute aid based on the number of school-age children living in a state, not the number of illiterates. If adopted, this amendment would have significantly reduced the money committed to the South, thereby putting at risk the Democratic portion of Blair's coalition.Footnote 129 Ingalls's amendment lost, 18\u201324. As Table 5 makes clear, however, it split the GOP, with twelve of twenty-one Republicans voting in favor.Footnote 130 This indicates again the precariousness of Blair's coalition, as a majority of Republicans supported an amendment that would have likely killed the bill.\n\nThe next Republican challenge came from Senator Eugene Hale (R-ME), whose amendment sought to change the bill's appropriation formula by stipulating that funding would be based on the \u201cproportion that the illiteracy of white and colored persons \u2026 had to each other.\u201dFootnote 131 If adopted, this amendment would have required states with the same number of white and black school-age children, but with two times as many illiterate black children, to spend twice as much money on black schools. \u201cBecause it threatened such a drastic reduction of possible federal aid for white public schools in the South,\u201d Crofts explains, \u201cthe [Hale] amendment made the bill unpalatable\u201d to many Southern senators.Footnote 132 As expected, Hale's amendment lost, 14\u201337, as all Southern Democrats opposed this change. But, perhaps ominously, it again split the GOP (14\u201317).Footnote 133\n\nDespite the failure of both amendments, the GOP support that they received suggests that a significant number of Republican senators were looking for a politically acceptable way to undermine Blair's proposal. Many appeared to be voting for any provision with the potential to turn Southern members against the bill. And, overall, much of the support for these amendments came from the party's western/midwestern wing.\n\nAfter passing the Senate, the Blair Bill once again ran into the intractable opposition of Speaker Carlisle. In the 49th Congress, Carlisle used the Education Committee, which he had packed with anti-tariff Democrats, as the vehicle for blocking House consideration of the proposal. The committee median on the first NOMINATE dimension for this Congress is negative (\u22120.201).Footnote 134 This supports the view that, broadly speaking, the economic commitments of committee members made it a hostile venue for the federal aid bill.Footnote 135 And, indeed, once the committee had the bill, it voted to postpone any action on the measure.Footnote 136\n\nWith federal aid languishing once again, Blair's counterpart in the House, Rep. Albert Willis (D-KY), put together a bipartisan coalition of members to goad the House into action. On March 29, 1886, Willis introduced a federal aid bill identical to the one that had passed in the Senate (H.R. 7266).Footnote 137 He then sought to have this version referred to the Labor Committee, a less staunchly anti-tariff committee, which he felt would deal with it more favorably. And while the Labor Committee median on the first NOMINATE dimension for this Congress was also negative (\u22120.141), it appeared more amenable to the GOP's economic agenda than the Education Committee.Footnote 138\n\nThe House took two separate roll call votes on Willis's strategy (see Table 6). The first, spearheaded by James Miller (D-TX) was to force H.R. 7266 back to the Education Committee. That vote failed, 116\u2013133. The House then voted to approve Willis's motion, 138\u2013112, with a majority of Southern Democrats and a majority of Republicans opposing nearly all Northern Democrats. Because it was designed to ensure a final vote on the Blair Bill in the House, the Willis motion should be seen as a \u201ctest vote\u201d to measure overall House support.Footnote 139\n\nWe examine the roll call on the Willis motion in a multivariate model to see how ideology, party, potential distributive benefits based on illiteracy rates, and district demographics\u2014percent foreign born, specifically\u2014influenced members\u2019 votes. The results, which appear in Table 7, show the contours of the House coalition that Blair would need to rely upon. We find that support for the GOP's economic agenda significantly predicts support for the Willis motion. As a given member of the House becomes more conservative on the first NOMINATE dimension, his support for the Willis motion increases. State-level illiteracy rates are also a reliable predictor of member support, suggesting that House members were sensitive to the distributional benefits offered by the bill.\n\nMoving now to an examination of support within the parties, we run models for Democrats and Republicans individually. Table 8 reports the results by party. Democrats who are more conservative on the first NOMINATE dimension\u2014those who are more \u201cpro-tariff\u201d\u2014were significantly more likely to vote for the Willis motion (Model 2). In other words, Blair's bipartisan support hinged on those Democrats who were, on average, less opposed to the GOP's economic program. State-level illiteracy rates are also significant, meaning that Democratic Party support was driven by the distributional gains offered by Blair's proposal.\n\nAmong Republicans, we find that those members from districts with higher proportions of foreign-born residents were significantly less likely to support Willis's motion and therefore less likely to support the underlying bill. GOP House members, like their Senate counterparts, seem to reflect the party's nativist tendencies. State-level illiteracy rates, however, are unrelated to a given member's vote. We also see that the second-dimension NOMINATE score is highly predictive of opposition to the bill, thereby suggesting that those with more conservative views on currency issues (bimetallism)\u2014which defined the second NOMINATE dimension in the House from the Civil War through the realignment of the 1890s\u2014were less likely to support the Willis motion.Footnote 140\n\nThese results demonstrate that a bipartisan, interregional coalition supportive of Blair's approach did exist in the House. Moderate Republicans joined with Democrats from states with high illiteracy rates to push the Blair proposal.\n\nUnfortunately for Willis and his supporters, the change in venues did not bring about the desired results. The Labor Committee instead replaced the provisions allocating funding based on the number of illiterates living in a state with language guaranteeing all states an equal amount of federal aid.Footnote 141 This change was unpalatable to Blair's Southern coalition. Proponents of the substitute amendment understood this and used it as a mechanism to sink the bill. Indeed, one of the amendment's cosponsors, Rep. William Crain (D-TX), characterized the proposal as an \u201cunholy offspring of an ill-assorted alliance between the bleak hills and chilly atmosphere of New Hampshire and the blue-grass fields and sunny clime of Kentucky.\u201dFootnote 142 In the end, House leadership refused to allow a vote on any legislation with language identical to the Blair Bill, so federal aid once again died.\n\nAt the beginning of the 50th Congress (1887\u201389), Blair reintroduced his bill (now S. 371). He had reason to be optimistic about its fate. Public support, as measured by petitions sent to Congress, remained high (see Table 1). In addition, the Democratic Party's advantage in the House had also shrunk to fifteen seats, 167\u2013152. Crofts attributes a portion of those losses to opposition to the Blair Bill, further testifying to its popularity.Footnote 143 When the Senate opened debate in January 1888, Blair immediately worked to capitalize on what he saw as broad public support by presenting it as an electoral issue. The impending presidential election provided him with an \u201copportunity to go directly to the people to secure backing for the bill.\u201dFootnote 144 Accordingly, the Republican Party Platform provided explicit support for the bill. \u201cThe State or Nation, or both combined,\u201d Republicans argued, \u201cshould support free institutions of learning sufficient to afford every child growing up in the land the opportunity of a good common school education.\u201dFootnote 145 In addition, Benjamin Harrison\u2014the GOP presidential nominee in 1888\u2014had supported the Blair Bill while serving in the Senate.Footnote 146\n\nWhen the bill came up for debate in the Senate, Blair's opponents took their usual positions. Some Democrats opposed the measure because they did not believe in education for black citizens. Senator John Morgan (D-AL), for example, claimed that state-sponsored schooling for black children would keep them \u201cout of the cotton fields, where their labor was needed.\u201dFootnote 147 More important than these explicitly racist arguments, however, was an increasingly bipartisan sentiment that federal aid would do more harm than good. A New York Times editorial in February 1888, for example, stated that \u201cone of the most precious rights of a State is that character for stability and self-control which comes of the necessity of taking care of its own interests.\u201dFootnote 148\n\nAs he had in the past, Blair overcame all of the bill's opponents. As the third column of Table 4 illustrates, however, the number of Republican senators opposing the bill grew significantly (from five to twelve) in just two years. In an editorial published immediately following Senate passage, the New York Times offered one explanation for the growing Republican opposition: \u201cThe fact is that [Blair's proposal] has little support in public opinion of the country.\u201dFootnote 149 Absent reliable polling data, any assessment of public opinion is guesswork. Yet the Senate vote provides some evidence of an increasing willingness on the part of Blair's copartisans to publicly oppose federal education aid.\n\nBlair and his supporters would be stymied yet again in the House, as the bill was sent to the Education Committee, now chaired by Rep. Crain, where it languished. But Blair's coalition found some reason for optimism after the 1888 election, as GOP victories resulted in unified Republican control of government for the first time since 1875.Footnote 150 Blair took this as a sign that his bill's time had finally come. According to Gordon McKinney, he attributed Republican electoral successes to support for his bill.Footnote 151\n\nYet because the Blair Bill relied so much on the support of Southern Democrats, the Republican landslide generated a new political problem. Perhaps aiming to capitalize on his party's political advantage, President Harrison used his inaugural address to call for \u201cfurther safeguards\u201d to ensure the legitimacy of national elections. Here he was suggesting strengthened federal powers over the electoral process, a policy change wholly unpalatable to Southern Democrats. By 1889\u201390, racial violence had increased, and according to Albion Tourgee\u2014a long-time advocate for black rights in the South\u2014the year 1890 represented \u201cthe most dangerous epoch [for blacks] since 1860.\u201dFootnote 152 As a consequence, Southern Democrats proved more skeptical of all Republican-initiated federal programs.Footnote 153\n\nDebate on Blair's proposal (now S. 185) began for the final time on February 5, 1890. By this point, the arguments for and against the bill were so well known that few members lingered in the chamber to hear Blair once again make his case. More to the point, Blair's long-windedness was frustrating fellow senators. According to one contemporaneous account, \u201cwhen Mr. Blair began his speech there was a general exodus of senators on both sides of the chamber, and of the eighty-two senators, only five remained while Blair was talking. The press gallery also vacated.\u201dFootnote 154 An editorial in the New York Times characterized Blair as a \u201cbore\u201d and argued that his continued advocacy on behalf of the bill simply allowed him to \u201crelieve his own mind.\u201dFootnote 155 By mid-March, fellow Republican Preston Plumb (KS) was arguing that Blair's effort to \u201ckeep this bill here, all the time, week after week, and month after month, in such a way as to disarrange all the business of the Senate, is not fair.\u201dFootnote 156\n\nWhat distinguishes this iteration of the debate from those preceding it was, according to Blair, the fact that \u201cseveral leading Republicans who had always supported the bill \u2026 would do so no longer.\u201dFootnote 157 This pattern started with President Harrison who, in his first annual message as president, chose not to provide an endorsement. Only three years earlier, Harrison had implored the Senate to pass the Blair Bill so that \u201can increasing body of Southern men\u201d would be taught to show a more \u201ckindly disposition toward the elevation of the colored man.\u201d In early 1889, however, Harrison expressed dissatisfaction with the bill's plan to appropriate money over eight years. \u201cOne Congress cannot bind a succeeding one,\u201d he now argued.Footnote 158 Moreover, when Republicans called for a final vote on the measure in March 1890, President Harrison did not explicitly call on Senate Republicans to vote for it.Footnote 159\n\nOpposition to Blair's proposal among Senate Republicans demonstrates how the party's eroding commitment to black civil rights contributed to the durability of local control. John Coit Spooner (R-WI), an influential Republican who had voted for the Blair Bill in the 49th Congress, provided the most thorough defense of those party members who came to oppose federal aid. Spooner began by \u201cdeny[ing] that the Republican Party is committed to the bill.\u201d Downplaying the GOP's clear role in pushing Blair's proposal, Spooner pointed to its bipartisan support as evidence for his claim that it \u201ccan hardly with justice be said to be a party measure.\u201dFootnote 160 Its failure, he implied, could not be attributed solely to Republican defections. Moreover, he used the bill's bipartisan, interregional appeal as a reason for opposing it.\n\nAfter disclaiming responsibility for the bill's failure, Spooner went on to make an explicitly sectional argument to defend himself and other Republican opponents. Citing \u201cleading newspapers in the South\u201d that had editorialized against Blair, as well as the growing Southern economy, Spooner claimed that southerners no longer wanted or needed federal aid. He held that Southern state governments could now fund their own schools, and he was no longer willing to ask \u201cfarmers of the west and northwest\u201d to contribute to the education of black and white residents of the South.Footnote 161 Similar claims were made by Senators Preston Plumb (R-KS), Gilbert Pierce (R-ND), John Sherman (R-OH), and Eugene Hale (R-ME).Footnote 162 Prioritizing their concern for white farmers in the West, the GOP knowingly abandoned one of the last remaining policy reforms aimed at advancing civil rights and shoring up the party's Southern wing.\n\nRepublicans also used the murder of a deputy U.S. marshal in Florida to further justify the party's turn against federal aid to the South. Protesting that the Blair Bill did not do enough to ensure that the appropriated money would be spent in accordance with the principle of separate but equal, Republicans like Spooner and Sherman claimed that the bill conceded too much to the South.Footnote 163 The GOP, in other words, was willing to deny black southerners aid it had promised for nearly a decade as a way of punishing the region's white majority. The Republican coalition supporting the measure collapsed under the weight of GOP opposition because some argued that the bill did too much\u2014proposing too much spending and binding the federal government to fund years into the future\u2014and because it did not do enough\u2014as oversight mechanisms were too weak. Coalitional tension of this kind therefore helped to shore up local control of education.\n\nIn an interview published in the New York Mail and Press, Blair recounted his dawning awareness that a significant number of Republicans had turned against the measure. \u201cIf an early vote was taken,\u201d Blair recalled, \u201cthe bill would be defeated by about a ten or twelve [vote] majority.\u201d In response, he \u201cadopted the tactics of getting time.\u201d From February 17 to 20, Blair mounted a one-man \u201creverse filibuster\u201d on behalf of his bill. Over those four days, he begged Republicans to honor their obligations to the freedmen and their families. \u201cYou can reconstruct the South,\u201d Blair argued, \u201cin no other way than by beginning with the children.\u201dFootnote 164\n\nAfter nearly two months of debate on the measure, Blair agreed to bring his bill to a vote. Newspaper accounts published on March 20, 1890, predicted a close result, but according to Daniel Crofts and Gordon McKinney, Blair was confident that he had the necessary support to ensure its enactment.Footnote 165 He miscalculated. \u201cSometime during the night,\u201d Blair recalled in an interview, Senators Henry Payne (D-OH) and John Sherman (R-OH) both decided to reverse positions and oppose the measure. Sherman's reversal in particular surprised Blair.Footnote 166 But Sherman was not alone. The final vote tally shows a significant number of defections, as slightly more than 40 percent of Republicans cast votes to kill federal education aid (see the fourth column of Table 4). They were joined by a bare majority of Southern Democrats and all but one Northern Democrat.\n\nTo better understand the dynamics of the voting on the Blair Bill, we drill down and examine the individual vote choices of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate\u2014including \u201cpairing\u201d\u2014on the four final-passage votes between the 48th and 51st Congresses.Footnote 167 Our goal is to identify when changes occurred, and whether they were due to sitting senators switching their vote (conversion) or new senators casting a different vote (replacement). On the Republican side (Table 9), support remained strong between the 48th and 49th Congresses, as only one senator (William Frye, RI) switched from yea to nay. Between the 49th and 50th Congresses, only one GOP senator (John Spooner, WI) again switched; however, two new GOP senators\u2014Charles Farwell (IL) and Frank Hiscock (NY)\u2014voted nay in the 50th Congress after replacing Republicans John Logan (IL) and Warner Miller (NY), who had voted yea in the 49th Congress. Three of the other four GOP nay votes in the 50th Congress came from senators who were present but did not vote in the 49th Congress: John Hawley (WI); Dwight Sabin, (MN), and Nelson Aldrich (RI).Footnote 168 Between the 50th and 51st Congresses, two Republican senators switched their votes from yea to nay: Philetus Sawyer (WI) and Henry Blair (RI). Blair switched from yea to nay because he saw that his proposal was about to lose, and by switching before the final tabulation was announced, he put himself in a position to call for reconsideration. Edward Wolcott (CO) also voted nay, after replacing Thomas Bowen (CO), who had voted yea in the previous Congress. Finally, John Sherman (OH) cast a vote, after sitting out the previous three. He had voiced support for the bill, but ultimately chose instead to vote nay.Footnote 169\n\nOn the Democratic side (Table 10), some significant switches occurred between the 49th and 50th Congresses: Daniel Voorhees (IN), Joseph Blackburn (KY), and John Kenna (WV) all switched from yea to nay, while William Bate (TN) voted nay after replacing Howell Jackson (TN), who voted yea in the previous Congress. Here we see clear erosion of Southern support for the Blair Bill. Between the 50th and 51st Congresses, three Southern Democrats, perhaps fearing that Republicans would go back on some of their states\u2019 rights promises regarding administration of the new education program\u2014switched from yea to nay: James Berry (AR), James Jones (AR), and Edward Walthall (MS). And four other Southern Democrats who voted yea in the 50th Congress chose to pair off or not vote at all: Wilkinson Call (FL), James Eustis (LA), Matt Ransom (NC), and Zeb Vance (NC). Henry Payne (OH) also switched from yea to nay.\n\nHistorians have not reached a consensus on why Republicans turned against the Blair Bill. McKinney suggests that Republicans from the Midwest believed economic issues to be more of a priority than the education bill, while Crofts suggests that sectional tensions generated a belief among Republicans that the Blair Bill was too conciliatory.Footnote 170 Blair himself frequently relied on nativist appeals to explain Congress's repeated failures to enact his legislation. Speaking on the floor of the Senate in 1888, he recalled being shown \u201cthe letter of a Jesuit priest, in which he begged a member of Congress to oppose this bill and to kill it, saying that they had organized all over the country for its destruction, that they had succeeded in the committee of the House, and \u2026 if they had only known it early enough they could have prevented its passage through the Senate.\u201d Continuing, Blair warned of a \u201cJesuit organization which has set out to control this country \u2026 they have come to our shores and they are among us today, and they understand that they are to secure the control of the continent by destroying the public school system of America.\u201dFootnote 171 Repeating this charge three years later, Blair contrasted \u201cthe Jesuits who have undertaken the overthrown of the public school system of this country,\u201d with \u201cthe twenty-five millions of people who inhabit the Southern States.\u201d Unlike \u201cthe people of the North,\u201d southerners \u201care Protestants and liberals and are free from the vast influx of immigration which has overflowed and transformed Northern states, in whose school systems the Jesuit has now much power.\u201dFootnote 172\n\nBlair's conspiracy theories notwithstanding, Table 1 does show that enthusiasm for his federal education bill\u2014marked by the number of petitions sent to Congress on behalf of the legislation\u2014declined significantly between the 50th and 51st Congresses.Footnote 173 Perhaps reflecting this decline in support, GOP opposition played a pivotal role in the bill's defeat. If the same number of Republicans who had voted for the bill in 1888 had done so again in 1890, the Blair Bill would have made it through the Senate. Of course, the bill had passed the Senate on three prior occasions, so there was no guarantee that Senate passage portended enactment. Yet with a Republican president and a GOP majority in the House, this appeared to be Blair's best chance for success. By 1890, however, Senate Republicans looked askance at the Blair Bill. The party instead set its sights on economic reforms and, for a brief time, a new federal elections bill.Footnote 174\n\nBefore concluding, we present regression results (Table 11) examining the final-passage votes on the Blair Bill in the Senate in the 48th, 49th, 50th, and 51st Congresses. Across each Congress we find that economic conservatism consistently predicts support for the Blair Bill. We also find reliable support from members representing states with higher illiteracy levels. If we replace ideology with party, we find that the most reliable supporters of the Blair Bill were Republicans. (Although by the 50th Congress, increasing GOP defections had made Southern Democrats\u2014all else equal\u2014as likely to support the bill as Republicans.) Importantly, in none of these models is the proportion of foreign-born residents in a state a significant predictor. This finding is mitigated by the fact that nativism explains vote choice on amendment votes (as we discuss above) and that immigrants tended to congregate inside specific congressional districts, thereby diluting their statewide influence."}, {"url": "https://www.williamblair.com/bios/James-White", "page_content": "As of March 31, 2023 *Includes strategic partnerships with Allier Capital, BDA Partners, and Poalim Capital Markets.\n\nWilliam Blair is a premier global boutique with expertise in investment banking, investment management, and private wealth management.

His father was at one point the acting Royal Governor and a Virginia Councillor, while Blair himself was the Williamsburg Mayor in 1751.\n\nBlair attended the College of William and Mary and received an Artium Baccalaureatus (\u201cA.B.\u201d) Degree in 1754 which is more commonly known as a \u201cB.A.\u201d. Blair went on study law in London and then to practice law, but was elected to a seat in the House of Burgesses. He served as a clerk of the Royal Governor\u2019s Council between 1770 and 1775 in the upper house of the colonial legislature.\n\n\n\nJohn Blair was a well-known legal scholar, but preferred to work in the background, avoiding the spotlight of state politics. He liked the idea of the union of all of the states in a permanent manner. While he did attend the Constitutional Convention, he made a greater contribution at a later time as a Virginia Court of Appeal Judge. Through that position and as a U.S. Supreme Court Judge, he was an influencing factor on the way the Constitution was interpreted in several crucial decisions. Many respected him for being able to cut through the fluff and get to the heart of any matter at law.\n\nInitially, John Blair would join the moderate wing devoted to the Patriot cause. Blair was in direct opposition to Patrick Henry\u2019s protest of the Stamp Act, but when the House of Burgesses was dissolved by Parliament, Blair changed his thinking as well as his views. He worked tirelessly alongside Booker T. Washington in 1770 and 1774 to draft crucial nonimportation agreements which would have the effect of stopping the import of goods from Britain until the taxes which were previously imposed were finally repealed.In 1774, John Blair pledged his support to the residents of Boston who were undergoing hard economic times due to the actions of Parliament. He joined the ranks of those who called for Continental Congress.As the Revolution started, so did John Blair\u2019s foray into state politics. He was to draft up Virginia\u2019s constitution as a member of the convention in 1776. He was also appointed to several very important committee positions which included a seat in the 28 member Committee that drafted the plan of the Virginia Government and the state\u2019s Declaration of Rights.John Blair served for a time on the Privy Council, and between 1776 and 1778, he was a part of the major advisory group to Governor Patrick Henry. Blair was elected to the general court as a Judge in 1778 by the legislature. That position eventually propelled Blair to the position of Chief Justice. Blair was named Grand Master of Freemasons through the Grand Lodge of Virginia in 1778 and elected to Virginia\u2019s High Court of Chancery in 1780. Through this series of Judicial Appointments, Blair was made a member of Virginia\u2019s first court of appeals.The Virginia Legislature recognized his accomplishments as a jurist by appointing him successor to Thomas Jefferson on a committee formed to revise Virginia\u2019s laws. Blair was nominated by President George Washington to the United States Supreme Court on September 24, 1789 and confirmed by the US Senate on September 26, 1789.

He was the son of John Blair, a colonial official and nephew of James Blair, founder and first president of the College of William and Mary. Signer Blair graduated from that institution and studied law at London's Middle Temple. Thereafter, he practiced at Williamsburg. In the years 1766-70 he sat in the Virginia House of Burgesses as the representative of William and Mary. From 1770 to 1775 he held the position of clerk of the colony's council.\n\nAn active patriot, Blair signed the Virginia Association of June 22, 1770, which pledged to abandon importation of British goods until the Townshend Duties were repealed. He also underwrote the Association of May 27, 1774, calling for a meeting of the colonies in a Continental Congress and supporting the Bostonians. He took part in the Virginia constitutional convention (1776), at which he sat on the committee that framed a declaration of rights as well as the plan for a new government. He next served on the Privy Council (1776-78). In the latter year, the legislature elected him as a judge of the General Court, and he soon took over the chief justiceship. In 1780 he won election to Virginia's high chancery court, where his colleague was George Wythe.\n\nBlair attended the Constitutional Convention religiously but never spoke or served on a committee. He usually sided with the position of the Virginia delegation. And, in the commonwealth ratifying convention, Blair helped win backing for the new framework of government.\n\nIn 1789 Washington named Blair as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he helped decide many important cases. Resigning that post in 1796, he spent his remaining years in Williamsburg. A widower, his wife (born Jean Balfour) having died in 1792, he lived quietly until he succumbed in 1800. He was 68 years old. His tomb is in the graveyard of Bruton Parish Church.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-GW-533b)\n\nJames Madison, Virginia\n\nThe oldest of 10 children and a scion of the planter aristocracy, Madison was born in 1751 at Port Conway, King George County, VA, while his mother was visiting her parents. In a few weeks she journeyed back with her newborn son to Montpelier estate, in Orange County, which became his lifelong home. He received his early education from his mother, from tutors, and at a private school. An excellent scholar though frail and sickly in his youth, in 1771 he graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), where he demonstrated special interest in government and the law. But, considering the ministry for a career, he stayed on for a year of postgraduate study in theology.\n\nBack at Montpelier, still undecided on a profession, Madison soon embraced the patriot cause, and state and local politics absorbed much of his time. In 1775 he served on the Orange County committee of safety; the next year at the Virginia convention, which, besides advocating various Revolutionary steps, framed the Virginia constitution; in 1776-77 in the House of Delegates; and in 1778-80 in the Council of State. His ill health precluded any military service.\n\nIn 1780 Madison was chosen to represent Virginia in the Continental Congress (1780-83 and 1786-88). Although originally the youngest delegate, he played a major role in the deliberations of that body. Meantime, in the years 1784-86, he had again sat in the Virginia House of Delegates. He was a guiding force behind the Mount Vernon Conference (1785), attended the Annapolis Convention (1786), and was otherwise highly instrumental in the convening of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. He had also written extensively about deficiencies in the Articles of Confederation.\n\nMadison was clearly the preeminent figure at the convention. Some of the delegates favored an authoritarian central government; others, retention of state sovereignty; and most occupied positions in the middle of the two extremes. Madison, who was rarely absent and whose Virginia Plan was in large part the basis of the Constitution, tirelessly advocated a strong government, though many of his proposals were rejected. Despite his poor speaking capabilities, he took the floor more than 150 times, third only after Gouverneur Morris and James Wilson. Madison was also a member of numerous committees, the most important of which were those on postponed matters and style. His journal of the convention is the best single record of the event. He also played a key part in guiding the Constitution through the Continental Congress.\n\nPlaying a lead in the ratification process in Virginia, too, Madison defended the document against such powerful opponents as Patrick Henry, George Mason, and Richard Henry Lee. In New York, where Madison was serving in the Continental Congress, he collaborated with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in a series of essays that in 1787-88 appeared in the newspapers and were soon published in book form as The Federalist (1788). This set of essays is a classic of political theory and a lucid exposition of the republican principles that dominated the framing of the Constitution.\n\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives (1789-97), Madison helped frame and ensure passage of the Bill of Rights. He also assisted in organizing the executive department and creating a system of federal taxation. As leaders of the opposition to Hamilton's policies, he and Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nIn 1794 Madison married a vivacious widow who was 16 years his junior, Dolley Payne Todd, who had a son; they were to raise no children of their own. Madison spent the period 1797-1801 in semiretirement, but in 1798 he wrote the Virginia Resolutions, which attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts. While he served as Secretary of State (1801-9), his wife often served as President Jefferson's hostess.\n\nIn 1809 Madison succeeded Jefferson. Like the first three Presidents, Madison was enmeshed in the ramifications of European wars. Diplomacy had failed to prevent the seizure of U.S. ships, goods, and men on the high seas, and a depression wracked the country. Madison continued to apply diplomatic techniques and economic sanctions, eventually effective to some degree against France. But continued British interference with shipping, as well as other grievances, led to the War of 1812.\n\nThe war, for which the young nation was ill prepared, ended in stalemate in December 1814 when the inconclusive Treaty of Ghent which nearly restored prewar conditions, was signed. But, thanks mainly to Andrew Jackson's spectacular victory at the Battle of New Orleans (Chalmette) in January 1815, most Americans believed they had won. Twice tested, independence had survived, and an ebullient nationalism marked Madison's last years in office, during which period the Democratic-Republicans held virtually uncontested sway.\n\nIn retirement after his second term, Madison managed Montpelier but continued to be active in public affairs. He devoted long hours to editing his journal of the Constitutional Convention, which the government was to publish 4 years after his death. He served as co-chairman of the Virginia constitutional convention of 1829-30 and as rector of the University of Virginia during the period 1826-36. Writing newspaper articles defending the administration of Monroe, he also acted as his foreign policy adviser.\n\nMadison spoke out, too, against the emerging sectional controversy that threatened the existence of the Union. Although a slaveholder all his life, he was active during his later years in the American Colonization Society, whose mission was the resettlement of slaves in Africa.\n\nMadison died at the age of 85 in 1836, survived by his wife and stepson.\n\nImage: Courtesy of the Collection of Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa\n\nGeorge Mason, Virginia\n\nIn 1725 George Mason was born to George and Ann Thomson Mason. When the boy was 10 years old his father died, and young George's upbringing was left in the care of his uncle, John Mercer. The future jurist's education was profoundly shaped by the contents of his uncle's 1500-volume library, one-third of which concerned the law.\n\nMason established himself as an important figure in his community. As owner of Gunston Hall he was one of the richest planters in Virginia. In 1750 he married Anne Eilbeck, and in 23 years of marriage they had five sons and four daughters. In 1752 he acquired an interest in the Ohio Company, an organization that speculated in western lands. When the crown revoked the company's rights in 1773, Mason, the company's treasurer, wrote his first major state paper, Extracts from the Virginia Charters, with Some Remarks upon Them.\n\nDuring these years Mason also pursued his political interests. He was a justice of the Fairfax County court, and between 1754 and 1779 Mason was a trustee of the city of Alexandria. In 1759 he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses. When the Stamp Act of 1765 aroused outrage in the colonies, George Mason wrote an open letter explaining the colonists' position to a committee of London merchants to enlist their support.\n\nIn 1774 Mason again was in the forefront of political events when he assisted in drawing up the Fairfax Resolves, a document that outlined the colonists' constitutional grounds for their objections to the Boston Port Act. Virginia's Declaration of Rights, framed by Mason in 1776, was widely copied in other colonies, served as a model for Jefferson in the first part of the Declaration of Independence, and was the basis for the federal Constitution's Bill of Rights.\n\nThe years between 1776 and 1780 were filled with great legislative activity. The establishment of a government independent of Great Britain required the abilities of persons such as George Mason. He supported the disestablishment of the church and was active in the organization of military affairs, especially in the West. The influence of his early work, Extracts from the Virginia Charters, is seen in the 1783 peace treaty with Great Britain, which fixed the Anglo-American boundary at the Great Lakes instead of the Ohio River. After independence, Mason drew up the plan for Virginia's cession of its western lands to the United States.\n\nBy the early 1780s, however, Mason grew disgusted with the conduct of public affairs and retired. He married his second wife, Sarah Brent, in 1780. In 1785 he attended the Mount Vernon meeting that was a prelude to the Annapolis convention of 1786, but, though appointed, he did not go to Annapolis.\n\nAt Philadelphia in 1787 Mason was one of the five most frequent speakers at the Constitutional Convention. He exerted great influence, but during the last 2 weeks of the convention he decided not to sign the document.\n\nMason's refusal prompts some surprise, especially since his name is so closely linked with constitutionalism. He explained his reasons at length, citing the absence of a declaration of rights as his primary concern. He then discussed the provisions of the Constitution point by point, beginning with the House of Representatives. The House he criticized as not truly representative of the nation, the Senate as too powerful. He also claimed that the power of the federal judiciary would destroy the state judiciaries, render justice unattainable, and enable the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. These fears led Mason to conclude that the new government was destined to either become a monarchy or fall into the hands of a corrupt, oppressive aristocracy.\n\nTwo of Mason's greatest concerns were incorporated into the Constitution. The Bill of Rights answered his primary objection, and the 11th amendment addressed his call for strictures on the judiciary.\n\nThroughout his career Mason was guided by his belief in the rule of reason and in the centrality of the natural rights of man. He approached problems coolly, rationally, and impersonally. In recognition of his accomplishments and dedication to the principles of the Age of Reason, Mason has been called the American manifestation of the Enlightenment. Mason died on October 7, 1792, and was buried on the grounds of Gunston Hall.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CP-121)\n\nJames McClurg, Virginia\n\nJames McClurg was born near Hampton, VA, in 1746. He attended the College of William and Mary and graduated in 1762. McClurg then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and received his degree in 1770. He pursued postgraduate medical studies in Paris and London and published Experiments upon the Human Bile and Reflections on the Biliary Secretions (1772) in London. His work and writings were well-received and respected by the medical community, and his article was translated into several languages. In 1773 McClurg returned to Virginia and served as a surgeon in the state militia during the Revolution.\n\nBefore the end of the war the College of William and Mary appointed McClurg its professor of anatomy and medicine. The same year, 1779, he married Elizabeth Seldon. James McClurg's reputation continued to grow, and he was regarded as one of the most eminent physicians in Virginia. In 1820 and 1821 he was president of the state medical society.\n\nIn addition to his medical practice, McClurg pursued politics. In 1782 James Madison advocated McClurg's appointment as secretary of foreign affairs for the United States but was unsuccessful. When Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry declined to serve as representatives to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, McClurg was asked to join Virginia's delegation. In Philadelphia McClurg advocated a life tenure for the President and argued for the ability of the federal government to override state laws. Even as some at the convention expressed apprehension of the powers allotted to the presidency, McClurg championed greater independence of the executive from the legislative branch. He left the convention in early August, however, and did not sign the Constitution.\n\nJames McClurg's political service did not end with the convention. During George Washington's administration McClurg served on Virginia's executive council. He died in Richmond, VA, on July 9, 1823.\n\nEdmund Randolph, Virginia\n\nOn August 10, 1753, Edmund Randolph was born in Tazewell Hall, Williamsburg, VA. His parents were Ariana Jenings and John Randolph. Edmund attended the College of William and Mary and continued his education by studying the law under his father's tutelage.\n\nWhen the Revolution broke out, father and son followed different paths. John Randolph, a Loyalist, followed the royal governor, Lord Dunmore, to England, in 1775. Edmund then lived with his uncle Peyton Randolph, a prominent figure in Virginia politics. During the war Edmund served as an aide-de-camp to General Washington and also attended the convention that adopted Virginia's first state constitution in 1776. He was the convention's youngest member at age 23. Randolph married Elizabeth Nicholas in 1776.\n\nRandolph continued to advance in the political world. He became mayor of Williamsburg and Virginia's attorney-general. In 1779 he was elected to the Continental Congress, and in November 1786 Randolph became Governor of Virginia. In 1786 he was a delegate to the Annapolis Convention.\n\nFour days after the opening of the federal convention in Philadelphia, on May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph presented the Virginia Plan for creating a new government. This plan proposed a strong central government composed of three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial, and enabled the legislative to veto state laws and use force against states that failed to fulfill their duties. After many debates and revisions, including striking the section permitting force against a state, the Virginia Plan became in large part the basis of the Constitution.\n\nThough Randolph introduced the highly centralized Virginia Plan, he fluctuated between the Federalist and Antifederalist points of view. He sat on the Committee of Detail that prepared a draft of the Constitution, but by the time the document was adopted, Randolph declined to sign. He felt it was not sufficiently republican, and he was especially wary of creating a one-man executive. He preferred a three-man council since he regarded \"a unity in the Executive\" to be the \"foetus of monarchy.\" In a Letter . . . on the Federal Constitution, dated October 10, 1787, Randolph explained at length his objections to the Constitution. The old Articles of Confederation were inadequate, he agreed, but the proposed new plan of union contained too many flaws. Randolph was a strong advocate of the process of amendment. He feared that if the Constitution were submitted for ratification without leaving the states the opportunity to amend it, the document might be rejected and thus close off any hope of another plan of union. However, he hoped that amendments would be permitted and second convention called to incorporate the changes.\n\nBy the time of the Virginia convention for ratification, Randolph supported the Constitution and worked to win his state's approval of it. He stated his reason for his switch: \"The accession of eight states reduced our deliberations to the single question of Union or no Union.\"\n\nUnder President Washington, Edmund Randolph became Attorney General of the United States. After Thomas Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State, Randolph assumed that post for the years 1794-95. During the Jefferson-Hamilton conflict he tried to remain unaligned. After retiring from politics in 1795, Randolph resumed his law practice and was regarded as a leading figure in the legal community. During his retirement he wrote a history of Virginia. When Aaron Burr went on trial for treason in 1807, Edmund Randolph acted as his senior counsel. In 1813, at age 60 and suffering from paralysis, Randolph died while visiting Nathaniel Burwell at Carter Hall. His body is buried in the graveyard of the nearby chapel.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CCD-40)\n\nGeorge Washington, Virginia\n\nThe eldest of six children from his father's second marriage, George Washington was born into the landed gentry in 1732 at Wakefield Plantation, VA. Until reaching 16 years of age, he lived there and at other plantations along the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers, including the one that later became known as Mount Vernon. His education was rudimentary, probably being obtained from tutors but possibly also from private schools, and he learned surveying. After he lost his father when he was 11 years old, his half-brother Lawrence, who had served in the Royal Navy, acted as his mentor. As a result, the youth acquired an interest in pursuing a naval career, but his mother discouraged him from doing so.\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1748, Washington joined a surveying party sent out to the Shenandoah Valley by Lord Fairfax, a land baron. For the next few years, Washington conducted surveys in Virginia and present West Virginia and gained a lifetime interest in the West. In 1751-52 he also accompanied Lawrence on a visit he made to Barbados, West Indies, for health reasons just before his death.\n\nThe next year, Washington began his military career when the royal governor appointed him to an adjutantship in the militia, as a major. That same year, as a gubernatorial emissary, accompanied by a guide, he traveled to Fort Le Boeuf, PA, in the Ohio River Valley, and delivered to French authorities an ultimatum to cease fortification and settlement in English territory. During the trip, he tried to better British relations with various Indian tribes.\n\nIn 1754, winning the rank of lieutenant colonel and then colonel in the militia, Washington led a force that sought to challenge French control of the Ohio River Valley, but met defeat at Fort Necessity, PA - an event that helped trigger the French and Indian War (1754-63). Late in 1754, irked by the dilution of his rank because of the pending arrival of British regulars, he resigned his commission. That same year, he leased Mount Vernon, which he was to inherit in 1761.\n\nIn 1755 Washington reentered military service with the courtesy title of colonel, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, and barely escaped death when the French defeated the general's forces in the Battle of the Monongahela, PA. As a reward for his bravery, Washington rewon his colonelcy and command of the Virginia militia forces, charged with defending the colony's frontier. Because of the shortage of men and equipment, he found the assignment challenging. Late in 1758 or early in 1759, disillusioned over governmental neglect of the militia and irritated at not rising in rank, he resigned and headed back to Mount Vernon.\n\nWashington then wed Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy widow and mother of two children. The marriage produced no offspring, but Washington reared those of his wife as his own. During the period 1759-74, he managed his plantations and sat in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He supported the initial protests against British policies; took an active part in the nonimportation movement in Virginia; and, in time, particularly because of his military experience, became a Whig leader.\n\nBy the 1770s, relations of the colony with the mother country had become strained. Measured in his behavior but strongly sympathetic to the Whig position and resentful of British restrictions and commercial exploitation, Washington represented Virginia at the First and Second Continental Congresses. In 1775, after the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord, Congress appointed him as commander in chief of the Continental Army. Overcoming severe obstacles, especially in supply, he eventually fashioned a well-trained and disciplined fighting force.\n\nThe strategy Washington evolved consisted of continual harassment of British forces while avoiding general actions. Although his troops yielded much ground and lost a number of battles, they persevered even during the dark winters at Valley Forge, PA, and Morristown, NJ. Finally, with the aid of the French fleet and army, he won a climactic victory at the Battle of Yorktown, VA, in 1781.\n\nDuring the next 2 years, while still commanding the agitated Continental Army, which was underpaid and poorly supplied, Washington denounced proposals that the military take over the government, including one that planned to appoint him as king, but supported army petitions to the Continental Congress for proper compensation. Once the Treaty of Paris (1783) was signed, he resigned his commission and returned once again to Mount Vernon. His wartime financial sacrifices and long absence, as well as generous loans to friends, had severely impaired his extensive fortune, which consisted mainly of his plantations, slaves, and landholdings in the West. At this point, however, he was to have little time to repair his finances, for his retirement was brief.\n\nDissatisfied with national progress under the Articles of Confederation, Washington advocated a stronger central government. He hosted the Mount Vernon Conference (1785) at his estate after its initial meetings in Alexandria, though he apparently did not directly participate in the discussions. Despite his sympathy with the goals of the Annapolis Convention (1786), he did not attend. But, the following year, encouraged by many of his friends, he presided over the Constitutional Convention, whose success was immeasurably influenced by his presence and dignity. Following ratification of the new instrument of government in 1788, the electoral college unanimously chose him as the first President.\n\nThe next year, after a triumphal journey from Mount Vernon to New York City, Washington took the oath of office at Federal Hall. During his two precedent-setting terms, he governed with dignity as well as restraint. He also provided the stability and authority the emergent nation so sorely needed, gave substance to the Constitution, and reconciled competing factions and divergent policies within the government and his administration. Although not averse to exercising presidential power, he respected the role of Congress and did not infringe upon its prerogatives. He also tried to maintain harmony between his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose differences typified evolving party divisions from which Washington kept aloof.\n\nYet, usually leaning upon Hamilton for advice, Washington supported his plan for the assumption of state debts, concurred in the constitutionality of the bill establishing the Bank of the United States, and favored enactment of tariffs by Congress to provide federal revenue and protect domestic manufacturers.\n\nWashington took various other steps to strengthen governmental authority, including suppression of the Whisky Rebellion (1794). To unify the country, he toured the Northeast in 1789 and the South in 1791. During his tenure, the government moved from New York to Philadelphia in 1790, he superintended planning for relocation to the District of Columbia, and he laid the cornerstone of the Capitol (1793).\n\nIn foreign affairs, despite opposition from the Senate, Washington exerted dominance. He fostered United States interests on the North American continent by treaties with Britain and Spain. Yet, until the nation was stronger, he insisted on the maintenance of neutrality. For example, when the French Revolution created war between France and Britain, he ignored the remonstrances of pro-French Jefferson and pro-English Hamilton.\n\nAlthough many people encouraged Washington to seek a third term, he was weary of politics and refused to do so. In his \"Farewell Address\" (1796), he urged his countrymen to forswear party spirit and sectional differences and to avoid entanglement in the wars and domestic policies of other nations.\n\nWashington enjoyed only a few years of retirement at Mount Vernon. Even then, demonstrating his continued willingness to make sacrifices for his country in 1798 when the nation was on the verge of war with France he agreed to command the army, though his services were not ultimately required. He died at the age of 67 in 1799. In his will, he emancipated his slaves.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nGeorge Wythe, Virginia\n\nGeorge Wythe, the second of Thomas and Margaret Wythe's three children, was born in 1726 on his family's plantation on the Back River in Elizabeth City County, VA. Both parents died when Wythe was young, and he grew up under the guardianship of his older brother, Thomas. Though Wythe was to become an eminent jurist and teacher, he received very little formal education. He learned Latin and Greek from his well-educated mother, and he probably attended for a time a grammar school operated by the College of William and Mary.\n\nWythe's brother later sent him to Prince George County to read law under an uncle. In 1746, at age 20, he joined the bar, moved to Spotsylvania County, and became associated with a lawyer there. In 1747 he married his partner's sister, Ann Lewis, but she died the next year. In 1754 Lt. Gov. Robert Dinwiddie appointed him as acting colonial attorney general, a position that he held for only a few months. The next year, Wythe's brother died and he inherited the family estate. He chose, however, to live in Williamsburg in the house that his new father-in-law, an architect, designed and built for him and his wife, Elizabeth Taliaferro. They married in 1755, and their only child died in infancy.\n\nAt Williamsburg, Wythe immersed himself in further study of the classics and the law and achieved accreditation by the colonial supreme court. He served in the House of Burgesses from the mid-1750s until 1775, first as delegate and after 1769 as clerk. In 1768 he became mayor of Williamsburg, and the next year he sat on the board of visitors of the College of William and Mary. During these years he also directed the legal studies of young scholars, notably Thomas Jefferson. Wythe and Jefferson maintained a lifelong friendship, first as mentor and pupil and later as political allies.\n\nWythe first exhibited revolutionary leanings in 1764 when Parliament hinted to the colonies that it might impose a stamp tax. By then an experienced legislator, he drafted for the House of Burgesses a remonstrance to Parliament so strident that his fellow delegates modified it before adoption. Wythe was one of the first to express the concept of separate nationhood for the colonies within the British empire.\n\nWhen war broke out, Wythe volunteered for the army but was sent to the Continental Congress. Although present from 1775 through 1776, Wythe exerted little influence and signed the Declaration of Independence after the formal signing in August 1776. That same year, Wythe, Jefferson, and Edmund Pendleton undertook a 3-year project to revise Virginia's legal code. In 1777 Wythe also presided as speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nAn appointment as one of the three judges of the newly created Virginia high court of chancery followed in 1778. For 28 years, during 13 of which he was the only chancellor, Wythe charted the course of Virginia jurisprudence. In addition, he was an ex officio member of the state superior court.\n\nWythe's real love was teaching. In 1779 Jefferson and other officials of the College of William and Mary created the first chair of law in a U.S. institution of higher learning and appointed Wythe to fill it. In that position, he educated America's earliest college-trained lawyers, among them John Marshall and James Monroe. In 1787 he attended the Constitutional Convention but played an insignificant role. He left the proceedings early and did not sign the Constitution. The following year, however, he was one of the Federalist leaders at the Virginia ratifying convention. There he presided over the Committee of the Whole and offered the resolution for ratification.\n\nIn 1791, the year after Wythe resigned his professorship, his chancery duties caused him to move to Richmond, the state capital. He was reluctant to give up his teaching, however, and opened a private law school. One of his last and most promising pupils was young Henry Clay.\n\nIn 1806, in his eightieth year, Wythe died at Richmond under mysterious circumstances, probably of poison administered by his grandnephew and heir, George Wythe Sweeney. Reflecting a lifelong aversion to slavery, Wythe emancipated his slaves in his will. His grave is in the yard of St. John's Episcopal Church in Richmond.\n\nBack to Main Founding Fathers Page"}, {"url": "https://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/faq/who-signed-declaration-independence", "page_content": "56 delegates to the Continental Congress signed the engrossed Declaration of Independence.

President Washington appointed him as one of the original Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Scion of a prominent Virginia family, Blair was born at Williamsburg in 1732. He was the son of John Blair, a colonial official and nephew of James Blair, founder and first president of the College of William and Mary. Signer Blair graduated from that institution and studied law at London's Middle Temple. Thereafter, he practiced at Williamsburg. In the years 1766-70 he sat in the Virginia House of Burgesses as the representative of William and Mary. From 1770 to 1775 he held the position of clerk of the colony's council. An active patriot, Blair signed the Virginia Association of June 22, 1770, which pledged to abandon importation of British goods until the Townshend Duties were repealed. He also underwrote the Association of May 27, 1774, calling for a meeting of the Colonies in a Continental Congress and supporting the Bostonians; and took part in the Virginia constitutional convention (1776), at which he sat on the committee that framed a declaration of rights as well as the plan for a new government. He next served on the Privy Council (1776-78). In the latter year, the legislature elected him as a judge of the General Court and he soon took over the chief justiceship. In 1780 he won election to Virginia's high chancery court, where his colleague was George Wythe. Blair attended the Constitutional Convention religiously, but never spoke or served on a committee. On the other hand, he usually sided with the position of the Virginia delegation. And, in the Commonwealth ratifying convention, Blair helped win backing for the new framework of Government. In 1789 Washington named Blair as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he helped decide many important cases. Resigning that post in 1796, he spent his remaining years in Williamsburg. A widower, his wife (born Jean Balfour) having died in 1792, he lived quietly until he succumbed in 1800. He was 68 years old. His tomb is in the graveyard of Bruton Parish Church. Drawing: Pastel (ca. 1790) by William Williams.

A $3 million camera and computerized system monitor the condition of the Declaration of Independence, Constitution , and Bill of Rights .\n\nOn August 2, 1776, roughly a month after the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence, an \u201cengrossed\u201d version was signed at the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall ) in Philadelphia by most of the congressional delegates (engrossing is rendering an official document in a large clear hand).

At that time few of the colonists consciously desired to separate from Britain. As the American Revolution proceeded during 1775\u201376 and Britain undertook to assert its sovereignty by means of large armed forces, making only a gesture toward conciliation, the majority of Americans increasingly came to believe that they must secure their rights outside the empire. The losses and restrictions that came from the war greatly widened the breach between the colonies and the mother country; moreover, it was necessary to assert independence in order to secure as much French aid as possible.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the revolutionary convention of North Carolina specifically authorized its delegates in the Congress to vote for independence. On May 15 the Virginia convention instructed its deputies to offer the motion\u2014\u201cthat these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States\u201d\u2014which was brought forward in the Congress by Richard Henry Lee on June 7. John Adams of Massachusetts seconded the motion. By that time the Congress had already taken long steps toward severing ties with Britain. It had denied Parliamentary sovereignty over the colonies as early as December 6, 1775, and on May 10, 1776, it had advised the colonies to establish governments of their own choice and declared it to be \u201cabsolutely irreconcilable to reason and good conscience for the people of these colonies now to take the oaths and affirmations necessary for the support of any government under the crown of Great Britain,\u201d whose authority ought to be \u201ctotally suppressed\u201d and taken over by the people\u2014a determination which, as Adams said, inevitably involved a struggle for absolute independence.\n\nBritannica Quiz Famous Documents\n\nThe passage of Lee\u2019s resolution was delayed for several reasons. Some of the delegates had not yet received authorization to vote for separation; a few were opposed to taking the final step; and several men, among them John Dickinson, believed that the formation of a central government, together with attempts to secure foreign aid, should precede it. However, a committee consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston was promptly chosen on June 11 to prepare a statement justifying the decision to assert independence, should it be taken. The document was prepared, and on July 1 nine delegations voted for separation, despite warm opposition on the part of Dickinson. On the following day at the Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, with the New York delegation abstaining only because it lacked permission to act, the Lee resolution was voted on and endorsed. (The convention of New York gave its consent on July 9, and the New York delegates voted affirmatively on July 15.) On July 19 the Congress ordered the document to be engrossed as \u201cThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America.\u201d It was accordingly put on parchment, probably by Timothy Matlack of Philadelphia. Members of the Congress present on August 2 affixed their signatures to this parchment copy on that day and others later.\n\nThe signers were as follows: John Hancock (president), Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts; Button Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, and George Walton of Georgia; William Hooper, Joseph Hewes, and John Penn of North Carolina; Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., and Arthur Middleton of South Carolina; Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Maryland; George Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, and Carter Braxton of Virginia; Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, and George Ross of Pennsylvania; Caesar Rodney and George Read of Delaware; William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, and Lewis Morris of New York; Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, and Abraham Clark of New Jersey; Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, and Matthew Thornton of New Hampshire; Stephen Hopkins and William Ellery of Rhode Island; and Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, and Oliver Wolcott of Connecticut.

As instructed by John Hancock, Washington read the Declaration of Independence to the army on July 9th.\n\nJohn Jay was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1775-1776 (and would later become its President), but was recalled by his home state in May. He was initially more moderate, a supporter of reconciliation rather than rebellion, but his views became progressively more radical over the course of the American Revolution. Edward Rutledge wrote Jay on June 29th, imploring him to come to Philadelphia for what he anticipated would be a monumental week; he clearly believed Jay would be against the Declaration, telling him, \"recollect the manner in which your Colony is at this Time represented.\" John Adams wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1823 that although Jay was absent from the proceedings in Congress, he felt confident that Jay would have signed the Declaration of Independence had he been present.\n\nOnly 19 years old in the summer of 1776, Alexander Hamilton was with the Continental Army in New York City when the Declaration of Independence was drafted, approved, and signed.\n\nIn 1776, James Madison was just 25 years old, and a member of the Virginia state legislature. When Madison became a delegate to the Continental Congress four years later, he was the youngest delegate, just 29 years old. His longevity--surviving the 2nd and 3rd presidents, Adams and Jefferson, by a decade--combined with his role as Father of the United States Constitution and as 4th President of the United States, caused people to believe he had inside knowledge of the events surrounding the Declaration of Independence, even though he wasn't there. The best connection he could draw in response was that he was a close friend of Jefferson, and that he was a member of the Virginia legislature when they instructed their delegates to Congress to declare independence. As he wrote to Frederick A. Packard (author of Life of George Washington) in 1830, \"But not being a member of the Congress of that date, I can have no personal knowledge of what passed on the occasion.\" Despite having no connection to July 4th, many wished that Madison, who was dying in June 1836, would last until the holiday so he could share the distinction of dying on the same national holiday as Adams and Jefferson.

The website is no longer live.\n\nElbrecht determined the text traced back to at least 1956, when radio newscaster Paul Harvey published a version of it in his book, \"The Rest of the Story,\u201d Slate and the Courant reported. But similar versions have also been attributed to Rush Limbaugh Jr., the late conservative broadcaster\u2019s father and Texas author and columnist T.R. Fehrenbach.\n\n\"My gut tells me that the originator of the legends, the pre-Harvey and pre-Limbaugh spinner of tales, was someone who was so respected by his peers that they never questioned his lack of historical knowledge,\" Elbrecht told the Courant in 2002. \u201cAs the stories got repeated, the circle got bigger, the messenger more mainstream and finally they were accepted by many folks who just never thought to check.\"\n\nThe essay and its claims started to pick up pace in 1999, when it was sent as a chain email titled, \u201cThe Price they Paid,\u201d according to a report by George Washington University\u2019s History News Network. Iterations of it have been republished and tweaked for decades.\n\nHere\u2019s how the essay ran on Facebook July 4:\n\n\u201cHave you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence? Five signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War. They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well-educated, but they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured. Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags. Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward. Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton. At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson, Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters. He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt. Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months. John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished. So, take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July holiday and silently thank these patriots. It's not much to ask for the price they paid. Remember: freedom is never free! We thank these early patriots, as well as those patriots now fighting to KEEP our freedom! I hope you will show your support by sending this to as many people as you can, please.

However, there is no evidence any of these five Declaration signers was afforded worse conditions than other prisoners due to their signatory status, and Stockton was the only of the five signers imprisoned specifically for that status, according to Snopes, which debunked the essay in depth in 2005. None of the five men died in prison or was outright killed by the British, either.\n\n\"Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured.\"\n\nTwo sons of one signatory, Abraham Clark, were indeed captured and imprisoned by the British, but according to Snopes, only one signer\u2019s son has been identified as being killed during the war: John Witherspoon\u2019s eldest son, James.

Before this, he was a lawyer and a family man who became interested in, and then convinced of the necessity of the cause of independence for the American colonies. Once convinced, James became committed to independence. This is his story.\n\nJames Smith was born in about 1719 in Ireland, then moved to Cheshire County, Pennsylvania with his family when he was between ten and twelve years old. James\u2019s father was a farmer of some success, and this success enabled James to benefit from a good, solid, but simple classical education with the minister of the family\u2019s local church. After this good foundation of education, James studied law at the office of his older brother, George, who kept his own law office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen he was twenty-six years old, James was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, whereupon he opened his own law office near Shippensburg in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Because this was essentially a frontier area at the time, there was not much law to practice, and James spent much of his time there surveying land instead. While he did practice law sparsely in Cumberland County, he eventually moved to York, Pennsylvania after four or five years in the relative wilderness, so that he would be able to exclusively practice law.\n\nWhen James was forty-one years old, he married Eleanor Armor, who was the daughter of John Armor of New Castle, Delaware. She was ten years James\u2019s junior. Together, they had five children, only one of whom made it past childhood, married, and had children of her own. Other children of James and Eleanor made it past childhood, but they either did not marry or did marry and did not have children. This child, Mary, had two children who lived past childhood, only one of whom had children of their own, and neither of those children had their own children, so James\u2019s direct line of descent ended after his great-grandchildren.\n\nAn engraving of James Smith.\n\nIn the early 1760s, James started an iron foundry, but it was not successful. The market for iron was there, but James put the business in the hands of two overseers who were not good at managing the business. In James\u2019s own words, \u201cone of whom was a knave, and the other a fool.\u201d James lost a substantial sum on this business, but it allowed him to become more known by the public in the area in which he lived. This was important in his political career, which was something he began to take interest in when he became concerned in the early 1770s about the obvious rift between the colonies and Great Britain.\n\nJames attended a provincial assembly in 1774, where he submitted a paper he had written that was called Essay on the Constitutional Power of Great Britain over the Colonies in America. In the paper, James advocated for the colonies boycotting all goods from Britain. James believed that this technique would hurt British merchants in a financial way, which would push them to demand that Parliament back away from some or all of the oppressive laws they had passed against the colonies. Coincidentally, this is exactly what the First Continental Congress did in the fall of that year.\n\nAlso in 1774, James put together a company of volunteer militiamen in York County, Pennsylvania. The volunteers elected him as their Captain. Thanks to the British pressure on American trade and general freedom, the militia soon grew to enough men to be a battalion, and the battalion chose James as its Commander. Because James was fifty-five years old at this time, he deferred his Commander position to a younger man.\n\nIn 1775, James was elected as a delegate to the colonial assembly in Philadelphia. At the assembly, he said that\n\n\u201cif the British administration should determine by force to effect a submission to the late arbitrary acts of the British parliament, in such a situation, we hold it our indispensable duty to resist such force, and at every hazard, to defend the rights and liberties of America.\u201d\n\nThese were considered strong words at the time, as many colonists at that time in history were hoping for a reconciliation with Great Britain. This was especially true in Pennsylvania, where many of the citizens were Quakers, and therefore hoping for peace instead of conflict.\n\nJames made a name for himself as a voice in favor of American independence while in the colonial assembly. After the proposal for independence by Richard Henry Lee at the Second Continental Congress, and especially after the initial skirmish battles at Lexington and Concord, it became clearer that independence was the only answer. This allowed Pennsylvania to appoint a new slate of delegates to the Continental Congress. Among the new ones was James.\n\nAs part of the Second Continental Congress, James was able to become a signer of the Declaration of Independence. After the Declaration was signed, James went with Captain Francis Wade and Dr. Young to York with a printed broadside copy of the Declaration to read to the public in the town square. James served for two years on the Continental Congress, and since the Congress was meeting in Philadelphia, which was near James\u2019s office, he offered his office as a place for the Congress\u2019s Board of War to meet.\n\nAt the same time, he was serving in Congress, James also continued to serve on Pennsylvania\u2019s colonial assembly. In 1781, James was elected to be a Brigadier General of the Pennsylvania Militia. At this time, he also went back to practicing law at his own law office. James practiced law until 1800 when he retired at age eighty-one.\n\nIn addition to his work on the Continental Congress and the Pennsylvania colonial assembly, James also did a short stint as a judge of the state High Court of Appeals, and did one term in the Pennsylvania State Assembly, after it became a state instead of a colony. In 1785, James was elected to the new United States Congress, but declined to serve because of his age, believing he was too old to participate in such things anymore.\n\nShortly before James crossed over to the other side, a fire destroyed his office and most of his papers with it, so little is known about his actual life today, besides what was recorded by others. James crossed to the other side in July of 1806 in York, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the First Presbyterian Churchyard there."}, {"url": "https://ancestralfindings.com/james-wilson-the-signers-of-the-declaration-of-independence/", "page_content": "James Wilson was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In addition, he was an influential and important person in the design of the new nation of the United States of America. A lawyer, university professor, political leader, militia commander, and US Supreme Court justice, James wore a lot of proverbial hats. This is his unique story of becoming a self-made man and influential leader in colonial America.\n\nJames Wilson was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Born in Scotland in 1742, James was elected to the Continental Congress twice, served at the Constitutional Convention that produced the US Constitution, and served as an Associate Justice on the US Supreme Court (one of the six original justices appointed there by George Washington), and taught law as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania (where he taught the first course on the new US Constitution to President Washington and his cabinet).\n\nJames was the son of William Wilson and Alison Landall, the fourth of their seven children. His parents were farmers near Ceres, Fife, Scotland. They were also Presbyterians. James studied at St. Andrews University, Glasgow University, and Edinburgh University, but did not graduate from any of these. James studied the popular Enlightenment thinkers of the day, and also, like most Scotsmen, played golf.\n\nAfter leaving university, and full of new ideas from the Scottish Enlightenment, James left Scotland for the American colonies in 1765, settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bringing letters of introduction with him to assist him in starting his new life, James was able to become a tutor, and then a professor at the Academy and College of Philadelphia (which is now known as the University of Pennsylvania). James petitioned the university for a degree, since he was teaching there, and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree several months after making his petition.\n\nWhilst tutoring and being a professor, James was also studying law at the office of future fellow Signer, John Dickinson. This study allowed him the knowledge necessary to be admitted to the bar in Philadelphia n 1767. Once admitted, James set up his own law office in Reading, Pennsylvania, and began practicing as a lawyer. It turns out, that James was an excellent attorney, and his office became extremely successful. James earned a small fortune off of it in just a few years, and this fortune allowed him to purchase a farm near Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In addition to being a lawyer, in which work he took cases in eight counties near Reading, James was a founding trustee of Dickinson College and a vice-president of the American Philosophical Society. James also wrote on theological matters, with his religious beliefs seeming to move around the Christian spectrum for most of his life. He did, though, always seem to subscribe to some form of Christianity.\n\nJames married Rachel Bird in 1771. She was the daughter of William Bird and Bridget Hulings. Together, James and Rachel had six children, consisting of four sons and two daughters. Rachel crossed to the other side in 1786. James re-married in 1793 to Hannah Gray, the daughter of Ellis Gray and Sarah D\u2019Olbear. Together, they had a son named Henry, who crossed to the other side at four years of age. After James crossed, Hannah re-married to Doctor Thomas Bartlett, a widower with two daughters, and they had a daughter together named Caroline.\n\nIn 1774, James published a pamphlet called \u201cConsiderations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British Parliament.\u201d James argued in the pamphlet that Parliament had no authority in the American colonies because the colonies did not have representation in Parliament. James believed that all political power was derived from the people. Still, he thought the colonies should maintain their allegiance to the King, even while making their own laws. This was a similar view to that taken by John Adams and Thomas Jefferson at that time.\n\nHannah Gray\n\nJames was commissioned as a colonel in the Fourth Cumberland County Battalion in 1775 and rose to the rank of brigadier general of the Pennsylvania State Militia after Pennsylvania became a state.\n\nJames was appointed to the Continental Congress as a delegate from Pennsylvania in 1776 and was a steadfast believer in independence at that time. Still, he believed his duty as a delegate was to vote the will of the people of the colony. So, he took several more polls of his constituents before voting in favor of independence at the Congress. As a part of the Continental Congress, James became a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nJames left the Continental Congress in 1777. In 1787, he served at the Philadelphia Convention, where he was a member of that group\u2019s Committee of Detail. This convention produced the first draft of what would become the US Constitution. James was the principal designer of the executive branch of the federal government, which includes the US Presidency. As a politician and designer of a new nation, James was a staunch believer in popular control of the government, a strong national government, and state representation in Congress proportional to its population.\n\nWith Charles Pinkney and Roger Sherman, James proposed the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted each slave in the new nation as three-fifths of a person for Congressional representation purposes. Also, even though he preferred the US President to be elected directly by the people, James was the one who proposed the use of an electoral college, which provided the basis for the Electoral College we still use today. In addition, he opposed the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn 1790, he played a large role in writing the Pennsylvania state constitution.\n\nJames was one of the first associate justices on the US Supreme Court, being appointed to it by George Washington in 1789.\n\nDespite these incredible successes in his life, James suffered financial setbacks in his later years, thanks primarily to unstable economic conditions in the new United States and bad personal investments. He was even briefly imprisoned in debtors\u2019 prisons in New Jersey and North Carolina, where he was able to continue to perform his duties as a Supreme Court justice. His son, Bird, paid his debts to get him out of debtor\u2019s prison, so he didn\u2019t have to be there long. James complained of creditors hounding him like wolves. It was probably both a humiliation and a seeming slap in the face after all he\u2019d done to create the new country everyone was enjoying.\n\nWhile visiting a friend in North Carolina in 1798, James experienced a bout of malaria and crossed to the other side of a stroke not long after. He was only fifty-five years old at the time. James was the first US Supreme Court justice to cross to the other side.\n\nJames was buried at the Johnston Cemetery on Hayes Plantation near Edenton, North Carolina, but in 1906 was moved close to his first wife, Rachel, to the Christ Churchyard in Philadelphia."}, {"url": "https://www.ushistory.org/declaration//signers/smith.html", "page_content": "Signers of the Declaration of Independence Short biographies on each of the 56 Declaration signers\n\nMenu Menu\n\nJames Smith Representing Pennsylvania at the Continental Congress\n\nby Ole Erekson, Engraver, c1876, Library of Congress\n\nBorn: Circa 1719 Birthplace: Dublin, Ireland Education: Informal, Classical education. Apprenticed law with brother George. (Lawyer) Work: Resume with dates. Died: July 11, 1806\n\nJames Smith was born in Ireland around 1719. He emigrated to Cheshire County Pennsylvania with his family when he was ten or twelve years old. His father was a successful farmer and James benefited from a good, simple, classical education from a local Church Minister. He later studied law at the office of his older brother George, in Lancaster. Smith was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar at age twenty-six, and set up an office in Cumberland County, near Shippensburg. This was a frontier area at the time, so he spent much of his time engaged in surveying, only practicing law when such work was available. After four or five years he moved back to more populated York, where he might practice law exclusively.\n\nDuring the 1760s Smith became a leader in the area. He attended a provincial assembly in 1774 where he offered a paper he had written, called \"Essay on the Constitutional Power of Great Britain over the Colonies in America.\" In the essay, he offered a boycott of British goods, and a General Congress of the Colonies, as measures in defense of colonial rights. Later that year he organized a volunteer militia company in York, which elected him Captain. His company later grew to be a battalion, at which point he deferred leadership to younger men.\n\nHe was appointed to the provincial convention in Philadelphia in 1775, the state constitutional convention in 1776, and was elected to the Continental Congress the same year. He remained in Congress only two years, and as Congress was meeting in Philadelphia in those days, provided his office for meetings of the Board of War.\n\nJames Smith retired from the Congress in 1777, and served in few public offices after: one term in the State assembly, a few months as a judge of the state High Court of Appeals. In 1782 he was appointed Brigadier General of the Pennsylvania militia. He was reelected to Congress in 1785 but declined to attend due to advancing age. Little is known about his work, because a fire destroyed his office and papers shortly before he died."}]}
