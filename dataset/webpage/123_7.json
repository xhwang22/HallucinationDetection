The band is especially recognized in the evolution of the country-rock music genre and what has come to be referred to as the San Francisco Sound.\n\nThe band whose original lineup was made up of a group of friends were discovered by local disc jockeys with a new record label looking for musicians to sign. In their early career, their sound was a blend of folk and beat music but as their career progressed, they incorporated various musical genres like country rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe band was active between 1964 to 1969 and then 1974 to 1975. Some of their well-received songs like Laugh, Laugh has made it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the songs that shaped Rock and Roll. During the height of their popularity, they were considered teen idols and appeared on various television music variety shows like Shindig, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and films like Wild Wild Winter and Village of Giants.\n\nWho are the members of The Beau Brummels Rock Band?\n\nSal Valentino was the brain behind the band when it first began. He was the one who dreamed of it before going on to introduce others to form The Beau Brummels.\n\nHe began to perform at a young age with a series of appearances on television. His performances got him a regular gig at a club (El Cid, San Francisco). To form a much-needed band he called on his childhood friend Ron Elliot who was a guitarist and songwriter. Ron then recruited the other members which included Declan Mulligan (singer/ rhythm guitarist), Ron Meagher (bassist), and Victor Savant (pianist).\n\nAs they performed at the club, they got a more lucrative deal to perform at another club (Morocco Room, San Mateo, California. The owner of the club (Rich Romanello) invited disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell to listen to them at the club as they were looking for new acts to sign to their upcoming record label (Autumn Records). They quickly signed them and their early records were produced by Sly Stone.\n\nThe Beau Brummels band\u2019s original members include the following\n\nSal Valentino as lead vocalist, tambourine. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Elliott as lead guitarist, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Meagher as bassist and backing vocals (1964- 1967, 1974)\n\nDeclan Mulligan as the rhythm guitarist, backing vocals and harmonica.(1964- 1965, 1974-75)\n\nJohn Peterson as the drummer. (1964- 1966, 1974-75)\n\nThe subsequent members of The Beau Brummels include\n\nDon Irving as guitarist and backing vocals. (1965-1966)\n\nDan Levitt played the banjo and guitar (1974-1975)\n\nPeter Tepp played the drums for their 1975 tour.\n\nAs much as they tried to keep it together, the band naturally went through changes in personnel over time. Mulligan left the band in 1965 and was replaced by Don Irving.\n\nElliott left the group next as he constantly suffered seizures due to his diabetic condition. So he had difficulty touring with the band.\n\nIn 1966, Irving got inducted into the armed forces so had to leave. Peterson left the band to join Harpers Bizarre. Meagher was also drafted into the military.\n\nIn 1974, four of the original members with a new member came together to work on another album which was then released in 1975.\n\nWhere are they?\n\nAfter recording a self-titled studio album that was released in 1975, The Beau Brummels members split up again but continued to appear in several incarnations between the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. They featured in shows alongside The Dinosaurs, The Smithereens, and performed at shows like the Baypop Festival 2000, Summer of Love Festival 2002.\n\nDespite the band split of several years, Valentino didn\u2019t release his first solo album until 2006. The album was titled Dreamin\u2019 Man and he went ahead to release two more solo albums in late 2006 and 2008. Unfortunately, John Peterson died on the 11th of November 2007 due to a heart attack.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the original band members came together again to record a studio album that was released on Bay Sound Records in March. The new album contained fifteen songs written by Elliott and some drum tracks recorded by late Peterson in 1965. They did the re-recording of some of their well-known songs including \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d, \u201cJust a Little\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d.\n\nAlthough the band members continue to concentrate on their individual lives and careers, the band remains a favorite for Classic Rock Lovers."}, {"url": "https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/felix-cavaliere-rascals-2017.htm", "page_content": "Felix Cavaliere is a legendary rock/soul singer/songwriter who had a great impact in the 1960s, as one of the two lead singers and songwriters of the band, The Rascals. He co-wrote (with Eddie Brigati) several classic hit songs that have remained popular to this day, such as the number one hits \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d and \u2018People Got To Be Free.\u201d The Rascals also had a #1 hit with their recording of \u201cGood Lovin\u2019.\u201d\n\nBorn in Pelham, New York and now living in Nashville, Cavaliere has had an excellent career which has spanned 50 years. In addition to his work with The Rascals, he has recorded several solo albums and produced other artists such as Laura Nyro and Jimmie Spheeris. Currently, he tours with his band, Felix Cavaliere\u2019s Rascals, which plays about 60 shows per year.\n\nIt was in 1965 that Cavaliere (who sings and plays keyboards) formed The Rascals (originally called the Young Rascals) with Eddie Brigati (vocals, percussion), Gene Cornish (guitar, harmonica) and Dino Danelli (drums, percussion). Soon after, they signed with Atlantic Records and subsequently had a #1 hit with \u201cGood Lovin\u2019.\u201d It was from 1966-1968 that the band had a flurry of hits, including the #1 hits \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d and \u201cPeople Got To Be Free,\u201d plus the Top 10 hits \u201cA Beautiful Morning,\u201d \u201cHow Can I Be Sure\u201d and \u201cA Girl Like You.\u201d In addition, The Rascals had three more Top 20 hits: \u201cYou Better Run\u201d (which later became a cover hit for Pat Benatar), \u201cI\u2019ve Been Lonely Too Long\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Wonderful.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE: STREAMING AUDIO https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Felix_Cavaliere_interview_excerpt.mp3 Here\u2019s an excerpt of our interview with Felix Cavaliere of The Rascals, who recalls how he wrote (with Eddie Brigati) the classic hit songs, \u201cGroovin'\u201d and \u201cA Beautiful Morning.\u201d\n\nAfter The Rascals broke up in the early 1970s, Cavaliere began his solo career, and he has since recorded seven solo albums: Felix Cavaliere (1974), Destiny (1975), Treasure (1977), Castles in the Air (1979), Dreams in Motion (1994), Nudge it up a Notch (2008), and Midnight Flyer (2010).\n\nNotably, The Rascals were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and Cavaliere & Brigati were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009. They\u2019ve also been inducted in the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and their hit \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nWe are pleased to do this new Q&A interview with Felix Cavaliere. He tells how The Rascals got started, how he co-wrote their big hits, and his recent projects.\n\nDK: You\u2019ve been inducted into both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. How does it feel to be recognized for these great honors?\n\nFelix Cavaliere: Well, it really feels good, obviously. Especially the Songwriters Hall of Fame, which is a unique group. It\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not publicized as much, but it\u2019s very cool because of the people who are in there. And of course, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is what everyone knows. It\u2019s kind of a big deal as far as the public is concerned\u2026they love it. [I do think] that there\u2019s so many people who are really deserving of being in there, who aren\u2019t in there yet. But I\u2019m proud to be there\u2026it\u2019s a select group.\n\nDK: Going back to The Rascals in the \u201860s, how did the group form? I read that you were first in a group called Joey Dee & The Starliters.\n\nCavaliere: I was working with Joey Dee, and how should I put it nicely\u2014I was rejected by the United States military (laughs). So at that point, in those years, we really had a difficult time realizing our future because we were getting drafted. When the government did not want me\u2014it was fine with me\u2014I started a band. I started calling up these guys I knew. I had worked in Europe with Joey Dee and I\u2019d seen the Beatles before they came to the United States\u2014we worked with them in Frankfurt, Germany, and in Sweden. And I really thought, Man, I know I can do this (start a rock band). So I called up the other guys, and said, \u201cWould you guys like to form a band? Let\u2019s go out there and do it.\u201d I basically asked everybody to come on and try this with me. And the good news was that it took us only six months to have a record deal, which is unheard of today.\n\nDK: You wrote most of the Rascals\u2019 hits with Eddie Brigati. How did the two of you write together? Did one of you focus more on the music and the other the lyrics?\n\nCavaliere: Basically, I wrote the titles of the songs and the music for the songs, and I gave Eddie a good template, and he filled in the verses. I did the choruses and the titles, but I felt he was better at telling the stories verbally than I was.\n\nDK: So would you say one of Eddie\u2019s main skills as a songwriter, was to tell the stories, that he was a good lyricist?\n\nCavaliere: Absolutely.\n\nDK: Your #1 hit \u201cGroovin\u2019\u201d still sounds great today. How did you and Eddie write this song?\n\nCavaliere: What happened is, you know, musicians work primarily on Friday and Saturday nights. And when you have a romantic situation, [working weekends] kind of interferes with everybody else\u2019s schedule who are not musicians. They usually have Friday and Saturday off. So Sunday afternoon is the only time I can be with my significant other. I just felt like\u2026I\u2019m gonna write a song to make amends for the fact that we\u2019re always busy on weekends. So [I wrote the line] \u201cGroovin\u2019 on a Sunday afternoon.\u201d It was really interesting\u2026a lot of people relate to that in different ways, like a day off, picnics. But that\u2019s what it was.\n\nDK: You wrote another hit song that had a nice, positive feeling: \u201cA Beautiful Morning.\u201d So was it a beautiful morning when you wrote that song?\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of The Rascals performing in their Broadway show,\n\nOnce Upon A Dream. Felix Cavaliere speaks in the intro.\n\nCavaliere: Well yes. At the time, we were number one in America with another record, and we were in Hawaii. And I\u2019m very happy to say, [that Hawaii] was a real stronghold for The Rascals. [The fans] loved us in Hawaii. So we were out there, and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s write a song that shows this kind of blissful state\u2014you\u2019re madly in love, you\u2019ve got a number one record, and you\u2019re in paradise on a beautiful island. Let\u2019s see if we can write something to convey this feeling to people. And it was just like a heartfelt outpouring of joy.\n\nDK: Another great Rascals song is \u201cPeople Got To Be Free,\u201d which is more of a message song. What inspired you to write this song?\n\nCavaliere: I was working for Bobby Kennedy\u2019s (presidential) campaign, and you know that Robert Kennedy got assassinated. I just felt compelled to say something. The record company didn\u2019t really like the idea, but they let it [be released as a single] and it became number one in all the places that were oppressed, such as South Africa, Berlin and Hong Kong, So I was always very proud of that. [Writing this song] was a direct result of the assassination. In my eyes, Bobby Kennedy was an idealistic person who had visions for how our country should be, and his brother (John Kennedy) as well. So I was attracted very much to that. I just thought that it would be a good direction for me, and the United States of America.\n\nDK: After The Rascals had a great run of hits, the band eventually broke up. Can you tell me why the band decided to break up?\n\nCavaliere: Well, the band didn\u2019t decide\u2014Eddie Brigati decided to leave. And that really was the demise of the whole thing. I don\u2019t know why he decided to leave, other than he just couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore. But he left, and I always used the analogy\u2026it\u2019s like if one of your tires on your car decides to leave. All of a sudden, you really can\u2019t go (laughs). And we never really knew why. He didn\u2019t pursue another career as a soloist\u2026he just left. So it kind of disrupted the flow of energy that we had in a positive direction.\n\nDK: After the Rascals broke up, you recorded several solo albums. For Rascals fans who would like to explore your solo work, which of your albums would you recommend they check out first?\n\nCavaliere: Well, even though The Rascals didn\u2019t officially break up (after Eddie Brigati and guitarist Gene Cornish left)\u2014we went to Columbia Records and we did an album called Peaceful World, which I really enjoyed because it carries like a badge of honor. In Japan, they had a vote: Which album would you like to see made into a digital CD status? Because it was all analog. And that was the album that was chosen. So I would start with Peaceful World.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a video of The Rascals\u2019 classic hit, \u201cGroovin\u2019.\u201d\n\nI just continued to make albums, but the problem is, that once you\u2019re known as a Rascal, it\u2019s pretty hard to become a Felix (laughs). So I just enjoy making music, and the bottom line being that I will continue to do so, hopefully.\n\nDK: In 2012, the Rascals reunited for a Broadway show called Once Upon a Dream that was directed by Steven Van Zandt (of the E Street Band). How did this show come together?\n\nCavaliere: It\u2019s kind of a long story. To shorten it, it started with a cancer benefit to honor Kristen Ann Carr that Bruce Springsteen and Steven (performed at). One of my daughters had cancer at that time, so when I got a call to perform with the guys, I immediately accepted. It evolved from there, and in 2012 [The Rascals reunited for a show]. It was supposed to be a one-shot, but it turned out that Steve had plans to try something different, and that\u2019s what happened.\n\nDK: How many shows did you and the other Rascals play on Broadway?\n\nCavaliere: We did two weeks there and then we took it on the road. [But it became a] problem, because it was too big a production to go on the road\u2026it couldn\u2019t support itself. But it was fun and everybody got along, and I\u2019m happy to say that there were no arguments, no fights.\n\nDK Since the band reunited for these shows, was there talk about staying together and touring as a band?\n\nCavaliere: Yes, there were a lot of thoughts about that (but it didn\u2019t happen). But I\u2019m still trying. I have a concept\u2014I would like to call it the Aloha Tour. I would love to take it to Hawaii. I really want to publicize that. It would be great to play with the other guys one last time. I recently worked in Hawaii and I got such a great feeling. I said, \u201cCome on guys, let\u2019s go out there and do it, The Aloha Tour.\u201c\n\nDK: I read that you do tour as Felix Cavaliere\u2019s Rascals. Do you play a lot of shows?\n\nCavaliere: Well, I did over 60 shows last year. I had one of the best years I ever had. I\u2019m really happy to say, people love the music, and I\u2019m the only one (of The Rascals) out there providing it. So I\u2019m very happy to take up that banner, because I really enjoy being around people that appreciate and love the music. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find many musicians who don\u2019t like playing\u2014I love playing. So I hope to continue.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the video of The Rascals\u2019 hit, \u201cA Beautiful Morning.\u201d\n\nDK: I read that you\u2019re writing your memoir. Is that true?\n\nCavaliere: Yes. We\u2019re just about finished with it. We\u2019re now just collecting some photographs, and some forwards and introductions from people for the book. It\u2019s a process that I\u2019ve never done before. I\u2019m hoping to get it out by this September.\n\nDK: Of all the songs you\u2019ve written, are there a couple songs that are your favorites?\n\nCavaliere: Not really. I really feel that each song has a purpose and a season\u2026you know what I\u2019m saying? Like in the springtime I love \u201cA Beautiful Morning.\u201d And then when I look at the news, I love \u201cPeople Got To Be Free.\u201d They\u2019re all kind of like children, and I\u2019m just very thankful that they\u2019re still around."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Ron_Meagher", "page_content": "Main article: The Beau Brummels\n\nWhen guitarist-songwriter Ron Elliott was putting the band together in 1964, he asked a friend, Kay Dane, if she knew any good bass players.[1] Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird. He has long hair!\"[1] After joining the band, Meagher proved to be important to the band's image, as he was one of the first American rock musicians with Beatlesque hair.[2] In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels.[2] Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.[3] He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle.[4]\n\nDuring the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War.[2] Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.[5] After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan.[2]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: The Beau Brummels discography\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://americansongwriter.com/8-songs-you-didnt-know-elvis-costello-wrote-for-other-artists/", "page_content": "\u201cIt\u2019s not a thought you have going into it,\u201d said Elvis Costello on songwriting. \u201cIt\u2019s something you find yourself doing.

Here\u2019s a look at eight songs Costello wrote or co-wrote for other artists from the late 1970s through the early 2000s.\n\n1. \u201cGirls Talk,\u201d Dave Edmunds (1979)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello\n\nElvis Costello initially wrote pop-slanted \u201cGirls Talk\u201d for himself but gave it to Welsh singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Edmunds to record first. Off Edmunds\u2019 fifth album, Repeat When Necessary, the song, which Costello once said was about female gossip, hit moderately on the charts in the UK and was later released by Costello and the Attractions as a B-Side to their cover of the Homer Banks and Allen Jones soul song \u201cI Can\u2019t Stand Up for Falling Down.\u201d In 1979, Elvis Costello and the Attractions also turned Nick Lowe\u2019s 1974 song \u201c(What\u2019s So Funny \u2018Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\u201d\u2014coincidently produced by Edmunds\u2014a hit.\n\nThere are some things you can\u2019t cover up\n\nWith lipstick and powder\n\nThought I heard you mention my name\n\nCan\u2019t you talk any louder?\n\nDon\u2019t come any closer\n\nDon\u2019t come any nearer\n\nMy vision of you\n\nCan\u2019t come any clearer\n\nOh I just want to hear girls talk\n\n2. \u201cThe Other End (Of the Telescope),\u201d Til Tuesday (1988)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello and Aimee Mann\n\nIn 1988, Costello co-wrote \u201cThe Other End (Of the Telescope)\u201d with Aimee Mann for her band \u2018Til Tuesday\u2019s third and final album Everything\u2019s Different Now. (Costello later recorded his own version of the song for his 17th album All This Useless Beauty in 1996.) A softened ballad, exploring some of the misperceptions of one\u2019s self and others, the song was written remotely by Costello and Mann. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in the room together,\u201d said Costello. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the song I wrote with Burt Bacharach recently, what I call mail order songs. Your partner sends you whatever part of the composition you\u2019re not writing, in this case, the music. Mostly, my contribution was the words. It was specifically written for her and the situation she was in at the time. I kept the intro and then wrote a whole other story.\u201d\n\nShall we agree that just this once\n\nI\u2019m gonna change my life\n\nUntil it\u2019s just as tiny or\n\nImportant as you like?\n\nAnd in time we won\u2019t even recall that we spoke\n\nWords that turned out to be as big as smoke\n\nAs smoke disappears in the air\n\nThere\u2019s always something that\u2019s smoldering somewhere\n\n3. \u201cMy Brave Face,\u201d Paul McCartney (1989)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney co-wrote many of the tracks off his 1989 album Flowers in The Dirt with Costello, and it was their collaborative single, \u201cMy Brave Face,\u201d that made the biggest hit, peaking at No. 18 in the U.K. and No. 25 in the U.S. McCartney\u2019s Hog Hill Mill studio, a converted corn mill near his farm home in southern England, is where the pair wrote the majority of Flowers in The Dirt, armed with a pencil, paper, and acoustic guitar.\n\n\u201cFor us, the best bit from the writing sessions was literally after we\u2019d finished,\u201d said McCartney. \u201cWe\u2019d get our words written down and then we\u2019d just take our guitars downstairs to the studio and record \u2019em.\u201d McCartney added, \u201cIt was great, coming really hot off the skillet. That\u2019s my expression\u2014it feels like we just cooked something, bang, right to your plate.

Cash\u2019s 76th album features a cover of Harry Chapin\u2019s \u201cCat\u2019s in the Cradle\u201d, some rerecorded tracks, and collaborations, including Costello\u2019s offering of \u201cHidden Shame.\u201d Boom Chicka Boom also features backing vocals by Cash\u2019s mother, Carrie Cloveree (on \u201cFamily Bible\u201d), along with The Jordanaires, Elvis Presley\u2019s old backing group, who had also worked with Cash on some of his earlier Columbia recordings in the late 1950s.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say that you don\u2019t know me\n\nI\u2019m sad in ways you never understood\n\nEach time I try to tell the ugly truth\n\nYou always let it pass you by\n\n\n\nYou said I\u2019d never tell you a lie\n\nJust because I could\n\nDid you really think I was a bad man\n\n\n\nYou always said that that should be my middle name\n\nBut you don\u2019t know the half of it\n\nYou don\u2019t know how that name fits\n\nYou don\u2019t know my hidden shame\n\n5. \u201cAll This Useless Beauty,\u201d June Tabor (1992)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello\n\nThough he later recorded \u201cAll This Useless Beauty\u201d as the title track of his 1996 album, Costello first gave the song to British folk singer June Tabor for her 1992 release Angel Tiger. In 1994, Tabor grabbed another Costello song \u201cI Want to Vanish\u201d for her album Against the Streams, which was also recorded by Costello as the closing track of All This Useless Beauty.\n\nIt\u2019s at times such as this, she\u2019d be tempted to spit\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t so ladylike\n\nShe imagines how she might have lived\n\nBack when legends and history collide\n\nSo she looks to her prince, finding he\u2019s so charmingly\n\nSlumped at her side\n\nThose days are recalled on the gallery wall\n\nAnd she\u2019s waiting for passion or humor to strike\n\n6. \u201cThe Nameless One,\u201d Wendy James (1993)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello\n\nAfter a five-year run with the alt-pop band, Transvision Vamp in the mid-80s through early \u201990s\u2014and following the band\u2019s third and final album together, Little Magnets Versus the Bubble of Babble, in 1991\u2014singer Wendy James had her solo breakout with Now Ain\u2019t the Time for Your Tears. Elvis Costello wrote the entirety of her debut, with some tracks co-written by his then-wife British musician, and a former bassist for the Pogues, Cait O\u2019Riordan.\n\nWritten solely by Costello, \u201cThe Nameless One\u201d served as James\u2019 debut single. The album, its title pulled from Bob Dylan\u2019s 1964 acoustic ballad \u201cThe Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,\u201d feeds more combustible power-pop and punk renderings for the singer.\n\nAnd Huckleberry Finn\n\nYour huckleberry friend\n\nHas done you in\n\nFinn Mac Cool\n\nCool Hand Luke\n\nLuke and Matt\n\nAnd that other top cat\n\nJack the Hat Mcvitie\n\nOld blue eyes is back\n\nHogan\u2019s heroes\n\nAnd Logan\u2019s run\n\nAlma Cogan\n\nVolkswagen\n\nJohnny Logan\n\nRun for your wife\n\nThis is your life\n\n\u2026 On Mars\n\n7. \u201cThe Scarlet Tide\u201d Alison Krauss (2003)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello and T-Bone Burnett\n\nCo-written by Costello and T-Bone Burnett, \u201cScarlet Tide\u201d was performed by Alison Krauss and featured in the 2003 drama Cold Mountain. The film, based on the 1997 novel by Charles Frazier, starred Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, along with supporting roles by Jack White, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Donald Sutherland, and others. The song was nominated for a 2004 Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nIn 2004, Costello and Emmylou Harris also recorded the song for his album The Delivery Man, while Joan Baez used it on her 2008 album Day After Tomorrow.\n\nWhen I recall his parting words\n\nMust I accept his fate\n\nOr take myself far from this place\n\nI thought I heard a black bell toll\n\nA little bird did sing\n\nMan has no choice\n\nWhen he wants every thing\n\nWe\u2019ll rise above the scarlet tide\n\nThat trickles down through the mountain\n\nAnd separates the widow from the bride\n\n8. \u201cThe Girl in the Other Room,\u201d Diana Krall (2004)\n\nWritten by Elvis Costello\n\nFor the first time, Diana Krall released an album of original material, The Girl in the Other Room, in 2004 with a number of songs co-written with her husband Elvis Costello, including the title track.

Rather ironically, rock & roll stardom was never something that interested him, nor -- due to chronic health problems -- was the life of a rock & roll musician something he courted, much less enjoyed. Born in California, and raised in North Beach, he attended St. Peter & Paul's School, where one of his friends a couple of grades ahead of him was Sal Valentino.\n\nElliott's parents were both musical if not professional musicians -- his father played the drums and his mother the accordion, and they'd even had a band for a few years after he was born. Elliott was a natural performer as a boy, and turned to music at around age 10. He was involved with his school's arts programs, especially their scaled-down student productions of Broadway shows, and it was through such performances and the exposure he received to the work of George Gershwin and Jerome Kern, that he began learning about popular music. His father's love of country music, including Lefty Frizzell, also rubbed off on Elliott as boy; Valentino, by contrast, was more seriously involved in rock & roll, leading a band of his own in his teens. Elliott's childhood was complicated by his development of juvenile diabetes, which had near-catastrophic consequences when he was 12 years old -- the condition was brought under control, but the need for careful monitoring didn't mesh well with the requirements of his later career as a rock & roll musician, which wasn't anything he'd planned on.\n\nElliott entered his teens with a surprising degree of musical sophistication -- somewhere between old-style country players and the giants of Tin Pan Alley, he was a bit contemptuous of a lot of rock & roll, which he found too primitive for his taste. One major exception he made was for the Everly Brothers, whose finely textured vocals and playing, and mix of country music with pop sensibilities, seemed to represent the place where Elliott stood musically better than any other rock & roll act. In an interview with Jud Cost for the Sundazed Records box San Fran Sessions, Elliott admitted that as a teenager he would probably have liked to have come to New York and study at someplace like Juilliard or what was then known as the High School of Music and Art (now the School of the Performing Arts, of Fame renown), and partake of the Broadway theater of the era.\n\nInstead, he stayed in northern California and attended St. Ignatius High School and began writing music on his own. He realized while still in his teens that he was a lot less comfortable with and capable of writing lyrics than he was music, and acquired a collaborator in the guise of classmate and fellow theater enthusiast Bob Durand. Elliott subsequently became a music major at San Francisco State College, focusing on composition. He did perform a little bit, including work as part of a trio with a drummer and saxman, at an Irish dance hall called Richmond Hall, but that was mostly to earn a little money and keep his hand in performing -- by his own admission, Elliott never considered himself a very strong guitarist.\n\nElliott's big year was 1964, ironically enough a point in time where American rock & roll had, for the first time, been eclipsed by an overseas-spawned rival. He felt that he'd achieved some level of professionalism and proficiency as a composer, but still -- apart from the occasional campus performances of his work -- had no means of getting any of his music played. Additionally, he was increasingly at odds with where rock & roll seemed to be going -- in the spring of that year, he chanced one day to hear the first verse of a new record by the Four Seasons (possibly \"Ronnie\" or \"Silence Is Golden\"), switched it off, and wrote \"Laugh, Laugh\". It was a few weeks later that Sal Valentino called him up -- the two had remained friends across the years and Valentino had a problem, as a singer who had a gig but no band to back him up. The two agreed to try and put a band together, and the Beau Brummels were the result, assembled from the ranks of friends from their old neighborhood, drummer John Petersen, guitarist/bassist Ron Meagher, and singer/bassist Dec Mulligan. The group began playing locally in the area around San Francisco, and in the fall of 1964 were spotted by disc jockey Tom Donahue at a gig at a club in San Mateo. He signed them up with Autumn Records in short order.\n\nElliott had already written \"Laugh, Laugh\" in collaboration with Durand when the Beau Brummels were founded, but it wasn't among the very first songs cut by the band when they were signed by Autumn Records in the fall of 1964. Rather, the group did a handful of other Elliott-authored songs, getting to \"Laugh Laugh\" in November of that year. Their subsequent success with that song masked a rift within the group -- Elliott had initially been happy to be part of the Beau Brummels because they were a vehicle for getting his songs performed and recorded, which was something he didn't get from his formal studies in college, but he soon realized that he couldn't get the other members to accept his more advanced and complex songs; they would complain if there were too many chords, and even \"Laugh Laugh\" was an issue at first.\n\nOnce it became a Top 20 hit, and they followed it up with \"Just a Little\" (which reached the Top Ten), the bandmembers found themselves on a schedule of near-constant touring and personal appearances through most of 1965 and a chunk of 1966, which quickly became very debilitating for Elliott, as well as demoralizing. He'd signed on to help out an old friend to play some gigs locally and maybe get his songs played, but the paired hits suddenly meant they were playing all over the country, doing multiple shows at each locale and doing hops of several hundred miles between shows, by plane if they were lucky; and they were under so much pressure to release new product, that even the songs that he could get the band to play were barely worked on before being rushed into the marketplace.\n\nElliott was especially frustrated when the group's second album was released in what he regarded as partly finished form, without a coherent sound or with any of its songs (apart from the three earlier single sides) in an optimum state of development -- though heard 40 years later, it sounds like a masterpiece and a killer showcase for Elliott's lyrical, downbeat but haunting observations on love and life, which made him almost a precursor to Doug Hopkins' work with the Gin Blossoms nearly 30 years later. Worse yet, on a couple of occasions -- once just ahead of an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show -- he suffered seizures from his diabetic condition (which was much harder to monitor on the road in the '60s) that left him unable to perform. The constant touring wore them all down, and the acquisition of the Autumn label by Warner Bros. led to an embarrassing third album, Beau Brummels '66, consisting of covers of other artists' hit songs, which was was especially galling to Elliott, as the band's principal composer, and he was further distressed to find out the reason behind it: Donahue had sold Autumn Records to Warner Bros., but had sold his publishing company, to which Elliott was under contract, to another party; thus, Warner Bros. felt no compulsion to record Elliott's songs, rather than those on which they owned the publishing; that is, until Beau Brummels '66, loaded with Warner Bros.-owned songs (all performed in a lethally stiff, dull manner) stiffed royally, and wiser heads began to prevail.\n\nElliott relocated to Los Angeles, hoping that by being closer to where their new label was located he might get more control over the music and generate more musical activity for himself. The other members continued living in the Bay area, and 340 miles between them finally provided Elliott with an iron-clad reason to give up being a performing member of the Beau Brummels; instead, much as Glen Campbell and then Bruce Johnston filled Brian Wilson's spot in the touring version of the Beach Boys from 1964 on, so Don Irving became Elliott's stand-in on guitar in the performing version of the Beau Brummels who, by then, were down to a quartet with the departure of Dec Mulligan (who was either fired or quit -- depends whom you ask). By 1967, the Beau Brummels had ceased to exist as a band -- John Petersen jumped to the Warner Bros. group Harpers Bizarre. Elliott, Valentino, and Meagher were given the freedom in the studio, however, to do a real album, made up of songs written, chosen, and recorded for that purpose -- Elliott also finally got to break out of the formula-writing that Autumn had wanted, and generate, with Valentino co-writing, a classic album in Triangle. They followed this up a year later with the country-rock classic Bradley's Barn, by which time Ron Meagher was also gone, in response to a draft notice.\n\nDuring this same period, Elliott got to work as an arranger on Roots, the most accomplished (and many fans would say just plain the best) album ever recorded by his longtime idols the Everly Brothers, who also recorded two of his songs on the album.\n\nBy 1969, Valentino had departed (to land in Stoneground), and Elliott was left as a solo performer. He still had a contract with Warner Bros., however, and a serious songwriting talent, and some serious musical ambitions. The result was The Candlestickmaker, a concept album of dazzling range, complexity, and beauty -- along with Neil Young's self-titled debut solo album and Van Dyke Parks's Song Cycle (on which Elliott played), it was one of the most daring artistic statements to come out of the Warner-Reprise orbit in the '60s. It might've been the soundtrack to a documentary film about the tumultuous times in which it was made, as the \"Candlestick Maker Suite\" a kind of dark-toned, was an ominous precursor to Don McLean's \"American Pie\" -- or, perhaps more aptly, the bridge between works such as Bob Dylan's \"Visions of Johanna\" and McLean's magnum opus.\n\nElliott never had any illusions about the album's sales potential (though it has since received rave reviews as a lost gem in the Warner Bros. library, and a CD reissue in 2003), and busied himself later that year producing Living in the Country by Levitt & McClure (who'd played on his album), and in the years since he played and recorded with Randy Newman, Van Morrison, Little Feat, Dolly Parton, and produced such acts as Pan and DeWitt \"Scotty\" Scott, in addition to participating on new sides by the reunited Beau Brummels in the '70s. Although Elliott has remained in the business, and also participated with Valentino on occasional projects in the years since, he's never seen commercial success to match his early songs with the Beau Brummels."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/ron-tyson", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nRon Tyson was born on 8 February, 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, is an Actor, Music Department, Soundtrack.

In total, Gordy wrote or co-wrote 240 of the approximately 15,000 songs in the catalog of Motown's Jobete Music music publishing affiliate. Among the other artists who recorded his compositions are LaVern Baker, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, the Temptations and Martha Reeves & the Vandellas.\n\nGordy parlayed his songwriting success into record production, and in 1957, after discovering a band called the Matadors, began signing artists. He formed a record company in 1959, Tamla Records, which would become Motown. Its first major success came with the Matadors\u2014after their name was changed to the Miracles, and later Smokey Robinson and the Miracles.\n\nGordy was born in Detroit in 1929, and operated a record store before developing his songwriting craft and launching Motown, which became legend thanks to artists also including the Supremes, the Four Tops, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, the Jackson 5, Mary Wells, the Marvelettes, Steve Wonder and Marvin Gaye. But the foundation for Motown's success rested on songwriters, who besides Gordy, included such Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees as Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland, Nick Ashford, Valerie Simpson, Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.\n\nOf course, Motown was essentially a full-service star-making company, and also fielded its own stellar production teams and studio musicians--all giving the company its signature soul/R&B sound. Relocating to Los Angeles in 1972, Gordy produced the Billie Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues starring Diana Ross, while Motown continued to produce big hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a nonperformer in 1988 and published the autobiography To Be Loved in 1994. In 1998 he was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame, and in 2013 he became the first living person to receive the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Pioneer Award.\n\nIn 2016 Gordy received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama for \"helping to create a trailblazing new sound in American music\" through his songwriting, record production and establishment of Motown in launching the careers of countless legendary artists in shaping American history."}, {"url": "https://americansongwriter.com/10-songs-you-didnt-know-babyface-wrote-for-other-artists/", "page_content": "Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds has written and produced 200 R&B hits and more than 50 pop songs in the Top 10, and won 12 Grammy Awards throughout his career.

The truth is, [when I was young] I was too shy to say something to the actual girl I was in love with, so I just wrote it in a song.

Lyrically, the song talks about the sad love songs playing on the radio as reminders of an ex-love\u2014It\u2019s just another sad love song / Rackin\u2019 my brain like crazy / Guess I\u2019m all torn up / Be it fast or slow / It doesn\u2019t let go / Or shake me / And it\u2019s all because of you.\n\n7. \u201cMost Girls,\u201d P!nk (2000)\n\nWritten by Babyface and Damon Thomas\n\nThe second single off P!nk\u2019s 2000 debut Can\u2019t Take Me Home, also co-produced by Reid and Edmonds, the empowering \u201cMost Girls\u201d\u2014Most girls want a man with the bling bling / Got my own thing, got the ching ching / I just want real love\u2014was one of three tracks Babyface also co-wrote on the album.\n\n8. \u201cBest Thing I Never Had,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 (2011)\n\nWritten by Babyface, Beyonc\u00e9, Antonio Dixon, Larry Griffin, Jr., Caleb Sean McCampbell, Patrick Smith, and Shea Taylor\n\nBabyface had already collaborated with Beyonc\u00e9 on \u201cBroken-Hearted Girl\u201d off of her 2008 I Am\u2026 Sasha Fierce album, and again off of 4 for track \u201cBest Thing I Never Had,\u201d which he also helped produce.\n\n9. \u201cBaby I,\u201d Ariana Grande (2013)\n\nWritten by Babyface, Antonio Dixon, and Patrick Smith\n\nAriana Grande\u2019s debut album Yours Truly features several tracks written and produced by Edmonds, including \u201cBaby I,\u201d which was Grande\u2019s second single ever released. The album was recorded over a three-year period and features the late rapper Mac Miller, along with Big Sean, The Wanted\u2019s Nathan Sykes, and Mika. Grande\u2019s former Victorious co-star Leon Thomas III also co-wrote several songs on Yours Truly.\n\n10. \u201cStronger Together,\u201d Jessica Sanchez (2016)\n\nWritten by Babyface, Bruce Roberts, and Carole Bayer Sager\n\nBabyface co-wrote the song \u201cStronger Together\u201d for Jessica Sanchez, which appeared on her 2016 album of the same name. The song title was pulled from the slogan Hilary Clinton was using in her presidential campaign and was also played following Clinton\u2019s speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPhoto by Paras Griffin/Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/who-wrote-the-most-beatles-songs/", "page_content": "John Lennon was the dominant early creative force in the Beatles. But Paul McCartney quickly began to catch up as their career together unfolded. George Harrison made a late push into songwriting as well.\n\nSo, who wrote the most Beatles songs?\n\nAs you'll see, there are individual albums where Lennon and McCartney take center stage. Lennon, for instance, wrote or co-wrote an astonishing 10 songs for 1964's A Hard Days Night. On the other hand, McCartney is credited for the vast majority of 1967's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nOn several occasions, things were in complete equilibrium: 1965's Help! and Rubber Soul, and 1966's Revolver. They basically split the songwriting difference on 1968's The Beatles, too. But there was clearly a sense of competition about things: Lennon would write \"Day Tripper\" and McCartney delivered \"We Can Work It Out\"; Lennon brought in \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" and McCartney countered with \"Penny Lane.\"\n\nAll were ascribed to \"Lennon-McCartney,\" creating lingering questions about who did what. One resourceful fan became so desperate to figure it out that he resorted to mathematical formulas.\n\nThere have been a few surprising admissions along the way: Lennon later told David Scheff that he had a big hand in creating \"Eleanor Rigby,\" which is typically credited solely to McCartney. (\"The first verse was his,\" Lennon said in his final major interview, \"and the rest are basically mine.\") Meanwhile, McCartney revealed that he wrote the melody for \"In My Life,\" a track that has become intrinsically linked to Lennon.\n\nWe're taking the Beatles' word for it, since they were the only ones in the room \u2013 save for producer George Martin and engineers like Geoff Emerick \u2013 as their storied discography was created.\n\nThe junior members of the Beatles' songwriting stable are also included here, though Harrison didn't begin to make major statements of his own until the group's later era. (The youngest member of the Beatles had only one credit over their first four studio albums \u2013 but then made 11 contributions over their final four.) Ringo Starr often sang others' words, but added a handful of songwriting credits as well.\n\nWe're focusing on officially released Beatles songs, not bootlegs, radio recordings, anthology extras or songs they gave away. Keep reading to find out who wrote the most Beatles songs: It's a rundown that promises a photo finish.\n\n13 beatles-please-please-me-image loading...\n\nPlease Please Me (1963)\n\nJohn Lennon (5): \"Please Please Me\"; \"Ask Me Why\"; \"There's a Place\"; \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\"; co-wrote \"Misery\"\n\nPaul McCartney (4): \"Love Me Do\"; \"P.S. I Love You\"; \"I Saw Her Standing There\"; co-wrote \"Misery\"\n\nConsidering the majority of this zippy debut album was recorded on a single day \u2013 Feb. 11, 1963, to be precise \u2013 Please Please Me is a wonder of pop smarts and lyrical wit. Lennon wrote one more song than did McCartney for the final track listing, giving away \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" for Harrison to sing.\n\n12 With-the-Beatles-Image loading...\n\nWith The Beatles (1963)\n\nJohn Lennon (5): \"It Won't Be Long\"; \"All I've Got to Do\"; \"Not a Second Time\"; co-wrote \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and \"Little Child\"\n\nPaul McCartney (4): \"All My Loving\"; \"Hold Me Tight\"; co-wrote \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" and \"Little Child\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (1): \"Don't Bother Me\"\n\nReleased only a matter of months after the debut, With the Beatles found the prolific Lennon again writing one more tune than McCartney \u2013 but McCartney scores the biggest hit with \"All My Loving.\" Harrison makes his songwriting debut, but the throwaway, decidedly standoffish \"Don't Bother Me\" hardly points to the wonders of his late-'60s output.\n\n11 Hard-Days-Night-Image loading...\n\nA Hard Day's Night (1964)\n\nJohn Lennon (10): \"A Hard Day's Night\"; \"I Should Have Known Better\"; \"Tell Me Why\"; \"If I Fell\"; \"Any Time at All\"; \"You Can't Do That\"; \"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\"; \"I'll Cry Instead\"; \"I'll Be Back\"; \"When I Get Home\"\n\nPaul McCartney (3): \"Can't Buy Me Love\"; \"And I Love Her\"; \"Things We Said Today\"\n\nHarrison vanished just as quickly as he'd appeared, with Lennon taking center stage for the Beatles' first major motion-picture project. McCartney had only three originals, but he made every one count. A Hard Day's Night includes three of his best early songs.\n\n10 Beatles-For-Sale-Image loading...\n\nBeatles for Sale (1964)\n\nPaul McCartney (5): \"Eight Days a Week\"; \"I'll Follow the Sun\"; \"Every Little Thing\"; \"What You're Doing\"; co-wrote \"Baby's in Black\"\n\nJohn Lennon (4): \"I'm a Loser\"; \"No Reply\"; \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\"; co-wrote \"Baby's in Black\"\n\nMcCartney's ascension as the group's most prolific late-period songwriter was officially underway. This is the first \u2013 but certainly not the last \u2013 album in which Lennon doesn't dominate, in this case likely because he had run out of gas creatively so soon after A Hard Day's Night. So, Beatles for Sale is heavily populated with cover songs. Harrison is missing again, relegated to singing one of Lennon's tunes.\n\n9 Beatles-Help-Image loading...\n\nHelp! (1965)\n\nJohn Lennon (5): \"Help!\"; \"Ticket to Ride\"; \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\"; \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\"; \"It's Only Love\"\n\nPaul McCartney (5): \"Yesterday\"; \"I've Just Seen a Face\"; \"The Night Before\"; \"Another Girl\"; \"Tell Me What You See\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (2): \"I Need You\"; \"You Like Me Too Much\"\n\nThis album found the Beatles turning a creative corner, and that included Harrison, too. \"I Need You\" was his most fully formed composition to date. But as with their last movie project, Lennon is firing on all cylinders: Two of his contributions went to No. 1. Meanwhile, McCartney contributes a timeless classic with \"Yesterday\" \u2013 but in a sign of things to come, nobody else performed on it.\n\n8 Beatles-Rubber-Soul-Image loading...\n\nRubber Soul (1965)\n\nJohn Lennon (8): \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\"; \"Nowhere Man\"; \"Girl\"; \"Run for Your Life\"; co-wrote \"In My Life,\" \"Wait,\" \"What Goes On\" and \"The Word\"\n\nPaul McCartney (8): \"Drive My Car\"; \"I'm Looking Through You\"; \"Michelle\"; \"You Won't See Me\"; and co-wrote \"In My Life,\" \"Wait,\" \"What Goes On\" and \"The Word\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (2): \"If I Needed Someone\"; \"Think for Yourself\"\n\nRingo Starr (1): co-wrote \"What Goes On\"\n\nTouring now nearly behind them, the Beatles completed the first project that felt like an album-length experience. This finally gave them the space to experiment with sound and feel, notably on Lennon's sitar-driven \"Norwegian Wood.\" Starr earns his first-ever co-writing credit on the tangy \"What Goes On,\" while Harrison offers a convincing jangle with \"If I Needed Someone.\"\n\n7 Beatles-Revolver-Image loading...\n\nRevolver (1966)\n\nJohn Lennon (6): \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"; \"And Your Bird Can Sing\"; \"I'm Only Sleeping\"; \"She Said She Said\"; \"Doctor Robert\"; co-wrote \"Eleanor Rigby\"\n\nPaul McCartney (6): \"Good Day Sunshine\"; \"For No One\"; \"Got to Get You Into My Life\"; \"Here, There and Everywhere\"; \"Yellow Submarine\"; co-wrote \"Eleanor Rigby\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (3): \"Taxman\"; \"Love You To\"; \"I Want to Tell You\"\n\nThe Beatles's best album is a balancing act of Lennon-McCartney brilliance, as they showcase every element of their songwriting genius. Even the goofy song they gave to Starr is a triumph of childlike wonder. Harrison earns the coveted opening slot with \"Taxman,\" part of a three-song flurry of activity \u2013 the most he'd ever have on a single-album Beatles release.\n\n6 Beatles-Sgt-Pepper-Image loading...\n\nSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\n\nPaul McCartney (9): \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\"; \"When I'm 64\"; \"With a Little Help From My Friends\"; \"Fixing a Hole\"; \"Getting Better\"; \"Lovely Rita\"; \"She's Leaving Home\"; Sgt. Pepper's (Reprise)\"; co-wrote \"A Day in the Life\"\n\nJohn Lennon (4): \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; \"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\"; \"Good Morning Good Morning\"; co-wrote \"A Day in the Life\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (1): \"Within You Without You\"\n\nMcCartney took a leadership role in conceiving and executing this project, and that plays out in the songwriting totals. He even made a key contribution to Lennon's crowning-achievement finale. The increasingly spiritual Harrison didn't think much of the album concept, relegating himself to just one entry for Sgt. Pepper's \u2013 and none of his bandmates are featured on his raga-inspired \"Within You Without You.\"\n\n5 Beatles-Magical-Mystery-Tour-Image loading...\n\nMagical Mystery Tour (1967)\n\nPaul McCartney (4): \"Magical Mystery Tour\"; \"The Fool on the Hill\"; \"Your Mother Should Know\"; co-wrote \"Flying\"\n\nJohn Lennon (2): \"I Am the Walrus\"; co-wrote \"Flying\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (2): \"Blue Jay Way\"; co-wrote \"Flying\"\n\nRingo Starr (1): co-wrote \"Flying\"\n\nOriginally an EP release in the Beatles' native U.K., Magical Mystery Tour was another McCartney-driven concept. Lennon contributed the titanic \"I Am the Walrus\" but otherwise was largely silent. (The full-length U.S. version included three stand-alone Lennon singles to balance things out.) \"Flying\" was the only Beatles instrumental ever released by EMI, and the first-ever song credited to all four members.\n\n4 Beatles-White-Album-Image loading...\n\nThe Beatles (1968)\n\nJohn Lennon (13): \"Revolution 1\"; \"Dear Prudence\"; \"Glass Onion\"; \"Julia\"; \"Cry Baby Cry\"; \"Yer Blues\"; \"Happiness is a Warm Gun\"; \"I'm So Tired\"; \"Sexy Sadie\"; \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\"; \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\"; \"Revolution 9\"; \"Good Night\"\n\nPaul McCartney (12): \"Blackbird\"; \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\"; \"I Will\"; \"Martha My Dear\"; \"Mother Nature's Son\"; \"Birthday\"; \"Honey Pie\"; \"Helter Skelter\"; \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\"; \"Rocky Raccoon\"; \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\"; \"Wild Honey Pie\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (4): \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"; \"Savoy Truffle\"; \"Long Long Long\"; \"Piggies\"\n\nRingo Starr (1): \"Don't Pass Me By\"\n\nEverybody came back from a trip to India with a satchel full of songs \u2013 including Starr, who garners his first-ever solo composing credit. It's worth noting, however, that there isn't a single collaborative song here. In many cases, the others simply served as a backing band for the main composer. Some of the songs were even recorded as solo projects. That underscores both the irony of self-titling this project and the issues still to come for a splintering group.\n\n3 Beatles-Yellow-Submarine-Image loading...\n\nYellow Submarine (1969)\n\nJohn Lennon (2): \"All You Need is Love\"; co-wrote \"Hey Bulldog\"\n\nPaul McCartney (2): \"All Together Now\"; co-wrote \"Hey Bulldog\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (2): \"It's All Too Much\"; \"Only a Northern Song\"\n\nThe soundtrack to an animated film of the same name included some previously issued songs (including Starr's title track), some songs that had earlier been left on the cutting-room floor (including Harrison's \"Only a Northern Song,\" a Sgt. Pepper-era reject) and one killer rock song (\"Hey Bulldog\") that somehow found Lennon and McCartney collaborating again like the days of yore.\n\n2 Beatles-Abbey-Road-Image loading...\n\nAbbey Road (1969)\n\nPaul McCartney (8): \"You Never Give Me Your Money\"; \"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\"; \"Oh! Darling\"; \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\"; \"Golden Slumbers\"; \"Carry That Weight\"; \"The End\"; \"Her Majesty\"\n\nJohn Lennon: (6): \"Come Together\"; \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\"; \"Sun King\"; \"Mean Mr. Mustard\"; \"Polythene Pam\"; \"Because\"\n\nGeorge Harrison: (3): \"Something\"; \"Here Comes the Sun\"; co-wrote \"Octopus' Garden\"\n\nRingo Starr (1): co-wrote \"Octopus' Garden\"\n\nRecorded after Let It Be but released before, Abbey Road is the sound of the Beatles giving it one more try. Glad they did. Lennon came in with two great ideas (\"Come Together\" and \"I Want You\"), then acquiesced to McCartney's soaring Side Two medley concept by handing over some witty unfinished snippets. Harrison's striking pair of contributions, however, make it clear that the center can't hold much longer. Really, it's a miracle that these wildly creative voices had been contained in one unit for this long.\n\n1 Beatles-Let-It-Be-Image loading...\n\nLet It Be (1970)\n\nJohn Lennon (5): \"Dig a Pony\"; \"One After 909\"; \"Across the Universe\"; \"Dig It\"; co-wrote \"I've Got a Feeling\"\n\nPaul McCartney (5): \"Get Back\"; \"Let It Be\"; \"Two of Us\"; \"The Long and Winding Road\"; co-wrote \"I've Got a Feeling\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (2): \"I Me Mine\"; \"For You Blue\"\n\nA by-then rare Lennon-McCartney co-write on \"I've Got a Feeling\" was really just a combining of two other stray ideas. Otherwise, Lennon's late-period recession continued: \"Across the Universe\" had been bouncing around for a couple of years at this point. McCartney wrote the album's two big hits, while Harrison's \"I Me Mine\" provided a glimpse into his Phil Spector-produced early-solo sound.\n\nBeatles EPs Extras Comps 2 loading...\n\nOther Beatles Releases\n\nJohn Lennon (20): \"This Boy\"; \"I Call Your Name\"; \"Yes It Is\"; \"I Feel Fine\"; \"Day Tripper\"; \"Rain\"; \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"; \"Revolution\"; \"Don't Let Me Down\"; \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\"; \"You Know My Name (Look up the Number)\"; \"Real Love\"; and co-wrote \"She Loves You,\" \"From Me to You,\" \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" \"Thank You Girl,\" \"I'll Get You,\" \"We Can Work It Out,\" \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" and \"Free as a Bird\"\n\nPaul McCartney (15): \"She's a Woman\"; \"I'm Down\"; \"Paperback Writer\"; \"Penny Lane\"; \"Hello, Goodbye\"; \"Lady Madonna\"; \"Hey Jude\"; and co-wrote \"She Loves You,\" \"From Me to You,\" \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" \"Thank You Girl,\" \"I'll Get You,\" \"We Can Work It Out,\" \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" and \"Free as a Bird\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (3): \"The Inner Light\"; \"Old Brown Shoe\"; and co-wrote \"Free as a Bird\"\n\nRingo Starr (1): co-wrote \"Free as a Bird\"\n\nThis is where Lennon runs his score back up. He was the principal songwriter on the Beatles' stand-alone singles, whereas the bulk of McCartney's credits are in a collaborative role. Lennon also began the demo that sparked the band's reunion in his absence for \"Free as a Bird.\" The other three Beatles completed the song in the mid-'90s, 25 years after their final sessions together. Back then, they'd gathered to finish recording Harrison's \"I Me Mine\" \u2013 and Lennon wasn't there that day either.\n\nBeatles_Writing loading...\n\nWho Was the Fifth Beatle?"}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/motown-sound-producers-and-songwriters/", "page_content": "Photos: Motown Records Archives\n\nEmanating from Detroit, aka Motor City, the Motown sound forever transformed the landscape of soul and pop music. For the last 60 years, guided by the vision of founder Berry Gordy, Motown\u2019s music has transcended generations and left an indelible imprint upon culture all over the world. While the label created superstars like Diana Ross And The Supremes, Four Tops, The Temptations, Gladys Knight And The Pips, and a plethora of others, the major forces behind the tremendous success of \u201cHitsville USA\u201d were the songwriters and producers who worked behind the scenes to give the world \u201cThe Sound Of Young America.\u201d\n\nHere are 15 songwriters and producers who shaped the Motown sound.\n\n15: Ivy Jo Hunter\n\nIvy Jo Hunter is one of the unsung heroes of Motown. Trained in orchestral music, he began as a session player, then became a principal musician in the Motown house band before settling in as a songwriter and producer. He co-wrote \u201cAsk The Lonely\u201d and \u201cLoving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\u201d by Four Tops, Martha And The Vandellas\u2019 anthem \u201cDancing In The Street\u201d and The Spinners\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll Always Love You\u2019, and he produced the 1968 Top 40 hit single \u201cYou\u201d for Marvin Gaye. As an integral part of the Motown machine, Hunter accomplished much with little fanfare.\n\nCheck out: \u201cDancing In The Street\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n14: Clarence Paul\n\nClarence Paul is credited with mentoring \u201cLittle\u201d Stevie Wonder, but he was also a writer and producer on some legendary Motown songs. He composed \u201cHitch Hike\u201d for Marvin Gaye and co-composed the energetic \u201cFingertips,\u201d which, as the live recording \u201cFingertips \u2013 Part 2,\u201d Stevie Wonder took No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Paul and Wonder began a fruitful songwriting partnership, resulting in \u201cUntil You Come Back To Me (That\u2019s What I\u2019m Gonna Do)\u201d and \u201cHey Love,\u201d and he produced Wonder\u2019s version of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cBlowin\u2019 In The Wind,\u201d which went to No.1 on the R&B chart and No.9 on the pop charts in summer of 1966. Clarence Paul died in 1995, in Los Angeles, with Stevie Wonder at his bedside.\n\nCheck out: \u201cHitch Hike\u201d\n\nHitch Hike\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n13: Harvey Fuqua\n\nIf Harvey Fuqua did nothing but establish the R&B and doo-wop group The Moonglows, with whom Marvin Gaye got his start, that would have been enough. But Fuqua was instrumental in the early development of the Motown sound. While married to Gwen Gordy, sister of Berry Gordy, he distributed Motown\u2019s first hit single, Barrett Strong\u2019s \u201cMoney (That\u2019s What I Want)\u201d, on their Anna Records imprint. When Fuqua sold Anna Records to Berry Gordy, he became a songwriter and producer at Motown. Fuqua brought Tammi Terrell to the label and began to produce her classic duets with Marvin Gaye, including \u201dAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d \u201cYour Precious Love,\u201d \u201cIf This World Were Mine\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Build My Whole World Around You.\u201d A true pioneer in African-American music, Harvey Fuqua died in 2010.\n\nCheck out: \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u201d\n\nAin't No Mountain High Enough\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n12: Syreeta Wright\n\nSyreeta Wright was not only the muse, but the creative partner of Stevie Wonder as the latter was developing into one of the leading masterminds in music history. Together they wrote \u2018It\u2019s A Shame\u2019 (recorded by The Spinners), \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)\u201d and Wonder\u2019s 1971 album, Where I\u2019m Coming From \u2013 the first project on which Wonder had full creative control, and also composed the sophisticated \u201cIf You Really Love Me,\u201d which entered the Top 10 on the Billboard Pop Charts. Over the course of her career, Wright would continue to work with Wonder; she also made significant recordings with keyboardist extraordinaire Billy Preston and focused on her own solo work until her death in 2004.\n\nCheck out: \u201cIf You Really Love Me\u201d\n\nIf You Really Love Me\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n11: Johnny Bristol\n\nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Harvey Fuqua, Johnny Bristol was a major component of the Motown sound of the late 60s and early 70s. He penned Motown standards such as Gladys Knight And The Pips\u2019 \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Do Wrong,\u201d Jr Walker And The All-Stars\u2019 \u201cWhat Does It Take (To Win Your Love)\u201d and David Ruffin\u2019s \u201cMy Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me).\u201d Bristol also holds the distinction of being producer and co-writer of the final singles for the Diana Ross-era Supremes and Smokey Robinson-era Miracles. With The Supremes\u2019 \u201cSomeday We\u2019ll Be Together\u201d (1969), and The Miracles\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019ve Come Too Far to End It Now\u201d (1972), Bristol gave Ross and Robinson fitting swansongs as they transitioned to solo acts. Bristol later resumed his own recording career, and continued to write and produce until he passed away in 2004.\n\nCheck out: \u201cSomeday We\u2019ll Be Together\u201d\n\nSomeday We'll Be Together\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n10: Frank Wilson\n\nWhen Motown moved Detroit to Los Angeles, writer/producer Frank Wilson was an integral part of the transition, joining Motown in the mid-60s at its newly opened office on the West Coast. Wilson wrote several hits, among them \u201cChained\u201d (for Marvin Gaye) and \u201cYou\u2019ve Made Me So Very Happy,\u201d (Brenda Holloway), which, two years later, become a gigantic hit for Blood, Sweat And Tears. As The Supremes\u2019 music began to reflect changes in society, Wilson penned \u201cLove Child,\u201d which soared to No.1 on the Billboard 100. He composed \u201cAll I Need\u201d for Four Tops\u2019 thematic Still Waters album and also handled production on The Supremes\u2019 first albums of their post-Diana Ross era. Wilson continued his hot streak during the 70s, penning big hits with Eddie Kendricks (\u201cKeep On Truckin,\u201d \u201cBoogie Down,\u201d \u201cShoeshine Boy\u201d), which took Motown into the disco era. After leaving the label in 1976, Wilson became a born-again Christian. He continued to write and produce R&B and gospel music until his death, in 2012.\n\nCheck out: \u201cKeep On Truckin\u201d\n\nKeep On Truckin'\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n9: William \u201cMickey\u201d Stevenson\n\nEvery great record label needs an A&R person with an ear for songwriting and producing. At Motown, Mickey Stevenson was the man for the job. After his audition as a singer didn\u2019t go well, Stevenson took Berry Gordy up on his offer to be the label\u2019s A&R man. One of the most important brains behind the Motown operation, Stevenson oversaw classics like \u201cDancing In The Street.\u201d which he co-wrote with Ivy Jo Hunter and Marvin Gaye; \u201cIt Takes Two,\u201d co-written with Sylvia Moy for Gaye and Kim Weston, Stevenson\u2019s former wife; \u201cAsk the Lonely,\u201d for Four Tops; Jimmy Ruffin\u2019s \u201cWhat Becomes Of The Brokenhearted\u201d, and Gaye\u2019s \u201cStubborn Kind Of Fellow.\u201d among others. Of all his noteworthy accomplishments as a songwriter and producer, Stevenson\u2019s greatest feat may have been establishing the Motown house band, the legendary Funk Brothers.\n\nCheck out: \u201cWhat Becomes Of The Brokenhearted\u201d\n\nWhat Becomes Of The Brokenhearted\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n8: Lionel Richie\n\nLionel Richie came to Motown as a member and primary writer/producer of the funk band Commodores, and was as comfortable writing ballads (\u201cJust To Be Close,\u201d \u201cEasy,\u201d \u201cThree Times A Lady\u201d) as he was funk hits (\u201cBrick House,\u201d \u201cLady (You Bring Me Up),\u201d \u201cToo Hot Ta Trot\u201d). His duet with fellow Motown superstar Diana Ross, \u201cEndless Love,\u201d is one the most beloved ever written, and sparked Richie\u2019s solo career.\n\nAfter leaving Commodores, Richie catapulted into superstardom in the 80s. In 1982, the first single from his eponymous debut album, \u201cTruly<\u201d topped the Billboard Hot 100, while \u201cYou Are\u201d and \u201cMy Love\u201d both reached the Top 5. His next album, Can\u2019t Slow Down, was even bigger, producing two No.1 hits, \u201cAll Night Long\u201d and \u201cHello,\u201d and earning him a Grammy for Album of The Year. During the 80s, Richie was the most decorated of Motown\u2019s songwriters and producers.\n\nCheck out: \u201cToo Hot Ta Trot\u201d\n\nToo Hot Ta Trot\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n7: The Corporation\n\nAfter Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown, label founder Berry Gordy assembled a team of writers and producers, because he did not want any more \u201cbackroom superstars\u201d. Gordy, along with Alphonso Mizell, Freddie Perren, and Deke Richards, became known as The Corporation, and their first project was to create material for Motown\u2019s newest signees, Jackson 5. The Corporation (whose members were never individually billed) came out of the box smoking in 1969 with the No.1 hit \u201cI Want You Back,\u201d and followed it up with \u201cABC,\u201d \u201cThe Love You Save\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d in 1970. A short-lived ensemble, The Corporation disbanded in 1972, when Hal Davis took over producing duties for Jackson 5.\n\nCheck out: \u201cI Want You Back\u201d\n\nI Want You Back\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n6: Marvin Gaye\n\nKnown as the \u201cPrince Of Motown\u201d, Marvin Pentz Gaye became a superstar solo act, but his work as a key songwriter and producer for Motown should not be overstated. He cut his teeth writing \u2018Beechwood 4-5789\u2019 for The Marvelettes, in 1962, and \u201cDancing In The Street\u201d for Martha And The Vandellas. For The Originals, who sang background on some of Motown\u2019s biggest releases, Marvin wrote and produced the doo-wop-influenced singles \u201cBaby I\u2019m For Real\u201d (1969) and \u2018The Bells\u2019 (1970), both of which reached the Top 15 on the Billboard Pop charts.\n\nReworking an original idea by Renaldo \u201cObie\u201d Benson, Gaye developed the classic song \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On.\u201d On this masterwork of the same name, Gaye continued to develop his songwriting, composing \u201cMercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology)\u201d and \u201cInner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).\u201d Shortly after, \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d became a No.1 hit for Gaye in 1973, and the parent album was both commercially successful and revered by critics. Throughout the 70s, Gaye\u2019s songwriting and producing resulted in further landmark works such as \u2018I Want You\u2019 , \u201cGot To Give It Up,\u201d and countless others.\n\nCheck out: \u201cInner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\u201d\n\nMarvin Gaye - Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n5: Stevie Wonder\n\nChild prodigy \u201cLittle\u201d Stevie Wonder would grow into the genius the world knows as, simply, Stevie Wonder. After working as an apprentice to The Funk Brothers and being mentored by Clarence Paul, Wonder was ready to express his virtuosity as songwriter and producer. He co-wrote \u2018Tears Of A Clown\u2019 in 1970, helping to give Smokey Robinson And The Miracles their only chart-topping single. That same year\u2019s \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)\u201d was Wonder\u2019s first self-produced hit, peaking at No.3 on the US Pop chart.\n\nStevie entered the 70s with his full artistry on display, composing \u201cIt\u2019s A Shame\u201d for The Spinners. He also co-wrote and produced Syreeta Wright\u2019s first two albums In 1972, Wonder would embark on his \u201cclassic period\u201d, during which he released Music Of My Mind, Talking Book (both 1972), Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness\u2019 First Finale (1974) and his magnum opus, Song In The Key Of Life (1976). He continued to score hits throughout the 80s. Though his work rate slowed in the decades since, Stevie Wonder remains the consummate Motown songwriter and producer.\n\nCheck out: \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)\u201d\n\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n4: Ashford and Simpson\n\nHailing from New York City, Ashford and Simpson brought an East Coast sensibility to Motown. Joining the label as staff writers in 1966, the couple was assigned to Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and they wrote and/or produced all but one of the duo\u2019s late-60s singles, including some of Motown\u2019s best duets, such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d \u201cYour Precious Love,\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like the Real Thing\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re All I Need To Get By.\u201d\n\nTheir winning streak continued through the 70s, when Ashford and Simpson wrote and produced almost all the songs on Diana Ross\u2019 self-titled debut album, among them the gospel-inspired \u201cReach Out And Touch (Somebody\u2019s Hand)\u201d and Ross\u2019 grandiose revision of \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough.\u201d On her Surrender album they penned \u201cRemember Me,\u201d and they also contributed The Boss\u2019 disco-flavored title track. After a partnership in both music and marriage that lasted almost 50 years, Nick Ashford passed away in 2012.\n\nCheck out: \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like The Real Thing\u201d\n\nAin't Nothing Like The Real Thing\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n3: Norman Whitfield\n\nThrough grit and determination, the incomparable Norman Whitfield ascended through Motown\u2019s ranks and led the label into the 70s with his interpretation of psychedelic soul. Starting in the quality-control department, he went on to co-write Marvin Gaye\u2019s hit \u201cPride And Joy,\u201d The Marvelettes\u2019 \u201cToo Many Fish In The Sea,\u201d and The Velvelettes\u2019 \u201cNeedle In A Haystack.\u201d\n\nWhitfield replaced Smokey Robinson as the main producer for The Temptations in 1966, when his smash hit \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud To Beg\u201d outperformed Robinson\u2019s \u201cGet Ready\u201d on the pop charts. Alongside frequent collaborator Barrett Strong, Whitfield had an unprecedented run producing some of The Temptations\u2019 greatest songs, including \u201c(I Know) I\u2019m Losing You,\u201d \u201cCloud Nine,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Next to You,\u201d \u201cBall Of Confusion (That\u2019s What The World Is Today),\u201d \u201cJust My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\u201d and \u201cPapa Was A Rollin\u2019 Stone.\u201d He also crafted \u2018War\u2019 for Edwin Star and \u201cI Heard Through The Grapevine,\u201d which Gladys Knight And The Pips tackled in 1967 before Marvin Gaye made it a crossover smash the following year. Whitfield was the most prominent producer at Motown until his departure in 1975. He passed away in 2008, leaving a legacy of unforgettable music.\n\nCheck out: \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud To Beg\u201d\n\nAin't Too Proud To Beg\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n2: Smokey Robinson\n\nBob Dylan called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest poet\u201d, and William \u201cSmokey\u201d Robinson has been the poet laureate of Motown since the beginning. As the lead vocalist of The Miracles, Smokey composed some Motown\u2019s best-known early material, including \u2018Shop Around\u2019 , which became the label\u2019s first million-selling hit record, \u201cYou\u2019ve Really Got A Hold on Me,\u201d \u201cI Second That Emotion\u201d and \u201cBaby, Baby Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d as well as co-writing the group\u2019s only No.1 hit during their Robinson years, \u201cThe Tears Of A Clown.\u201d All in all, Smokey composed 26 Top 40 hits for The Miracles. Additionally, he\u2019s also responsible for \u2018My Guy\u2019, which Mary Wells took to the top of the charts; \u201cThe Way You Do The Things You Do\u201d \u201cMy Girl,\u201d \u201cSince I Lost My Baby\u201d and \u201cGet Ready,\u201d all gifted to The Temptations; and \u201cAin\u2019t That Peculiar,\u201d which became Marvin Gaye\u2019s second No.1. Even later in his career, with hits like \u201dQuiet Storm\u201d and \u201cCrusin\u2019\u201d, his pen was still poetic. Smokey remains an ambassador and undoubtedly one of the key architects of the Motown sound.\n\nCheck out: \u201cMy Guy\u201d\n\nMy Guy\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\n1: Holland-Dozier-Holland\n\nIt could be argued that Holland-Dozier-Holland are the most prolific songwriting and production team in pop music\u2019s long history. Over the course of five years, from 1962 to 1967, the trio wrote, arranged and produced many of the compositions that helped to establish the Motown sound. Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland served as the composers and producers for each song, while Eddie Holland wrote the lyrics and arranged the vocals. The result was Motown magic.\n\nH-D-H composed 25 No.1 hit singles, such as Martha And The Vandellas\u2019 \u201cHeat Wave\u201d and Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),\u201d and they also turned out classics for Four Tops (\u201cBaby I Need You Loving,\u201d \u201cReach Out, I\u2019ll Be There\u201d) and The Supremes, penning ten out of the latter group\u2019s 12 No.1 his, including \u201cBaby Love,\u201d \u201cStop! In The Name Of Love\u201d and \u201cYou Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On.\u201d Without question, Holland-Dozier-Holland was the engine that drove the Motown machine to success.\n\nCheck out: \u201cBaby Love\u201d\n\nBaby Love (\"16 Big Hits\" Version)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAll of Motown\u2019s chart-topping hits feature on the newly-expanded 11CD edition of the Motown: The Complete No. 1s box set."}]}
