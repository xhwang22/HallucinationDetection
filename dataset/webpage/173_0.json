The first show in color was a musical variety special titled \"Premiere\". Hardly anyone had a color TV that could see the show.\n\nIn 1963, the British Secretary of War, 46 year old John Profumo ,was forced to resign when he lied about an affair with 19 year old Christine Keeler. Keeler was also involved with the Soviet naval attach\u00e9 and charges of espionage were feared. No proof of spying was ever found.\n\nIn 1975, on September 5th, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme tried to assassinate President Ford in Sacramento, California. She failed when her gun wouldn't fire. President Ford escaped a second assassination attempt 17 days later on September 22 when Sarah Jane Moore tried to shoot him in San Francisco. A bystander saw her raise her arm, grabbed it, and the shot went wild.\n\nIn 1988, on December 21st, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie Scotland. The explosion killed all 259 people on board and another 11 on the ground. The flight had left Heathrow Airport in London less than an hour before, on its way to New York. After an exhaustive (and long) investigation it came to be believed that two individuals from Libya had planted the bomb.\n\nIn 1999, on January 1st, the Euro became the new official single currency of the eurozone. It was used by Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain and has since spread in use. Daily, over 337 million Europeans use the euro."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/robert-hogg-birth-1953-death-1974/32212451", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Robert's lifetime.\n\nIn 1953, in the year that Robert Hogg was born, on July 27th, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The Armistice was to last until \"a final peaceful settlement is achieved\". No peaceful settlement has ever been agreed upon.\n\nIn 1960, Robert was merely 7 years old when on May 1st, an American CIA U-2 spy plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the Soviet Union. Powers ejected and survived but was captured. The U.S. claimed that the U-2 was a \"weather plane\" but Powers was convicted in the Soviet Union of espionage. He was released in 1962 after 1 year, 9 months and 10 days in prison.\n\nIn 1966, Robert was merely 13 years old when on September 8th, the first Star Trek episode, \"The Man Trap,\" was broadcast on NBC. The plot concerned a creature that sucked salt from human bodies. The original series only aired for 3 seasons due to low ratings.\n\nIn 1974, in the year of Robert Hogg's passing, on August 9th, Gerald R. Ford became the 38th President of the United States. He had been Vice President for 8 months when he became President due to the resignation of President Nixon."}, {"url": "https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/robert-gordon-hogg-birth-1878-death-1942-australia/143727835", "page_content": "Refresh this page to see various historical events that occurred during Robert's lifetime.\n\nIn 1878, in the year that Robert Gordon Hogg was born, in Africa, the death of the last confirmed Cape lion occurred. The Cape lion was slightly larger than other lions and had black ears, a black mane, and black hair on its belly.\n\nIn 1896, when he was 18 years old, on August 17th, the first pedestrian v car fatality occurred in Great Britain. Bridget Driscoll, age 44, was walking with her family on the grounds of The Crystal Palace in London when she was hit by a car driven by Arthur James Edsall. Edsall claimed to be going 4.5 mph and Driscoll's death was ruled an \"accidental death\" after an inquest.\n\nIn 1917, when he was 39 years old, the NHL (National Hockey League) was established as a response to the demise of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The first superstar of the League was \"Phantom\" Joe Malone of the Montreal Canadiens, a leading scorer with records that still stand. The Canadiens won the NHL championship over the Senators.\n\nIn 1934, when he was 56 years old, on November 11th 1933, an extremely strong dust storm hit South Dakota, stripping topsoil. Other strong dust storms had occurred during 1933. Severe droughts continued to hit the Great Plains and the dust storms devastated agricultural production as well as people's' lives for several years. The Roosevelt administration and scientists eventually determined that farming practices had caused the conditions that led to the dust storms and the changes they implemented in farming stopped the Dust Bowl.\n\nIn 1942, in the year of Robert Gordon Hogg's passing, on February 19th, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This authorized the Secretary of War to \"prescribe certain areas as military zones.\" On March 21st, he signed Public Law 503 which was approved after an hour discussion in the Senate and 30 minutes in the House. The Law provided for enforcement of his Executive Order. This cleared the way for approximately 120,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry to be evicted from the West Coast and to be held in concentration camps and other confinement sites across the country. In Hawaii, a few thousand were detained. German and Italian Americans in the U.S. were also confined."}, {"url": "https://www.harpenden-history.org.uk/harpenden-history/people-2/adventurers/george_hogg_his_life_in_china/george_hogg_1915-1945_and_st_georges_school_-_1927-1934", "page_content": "George \u2018Aylwin\u2019 Hogg entered St George\u2019s in 1927 and left in 1934. His short and remarkable life has left a profound legacy on the people of China, and also on his school, St George\u2019s.\n\nFor those unacquainted with the story, Hogg went up to Wadham College Oxford in \u201934 to read \u2018Greats\u2019 (PPE), thereby following a family tradition (all of his brothers also attended Wadham). From Oxford, Hogg managed to persuade his parents to finance a travelling expedition across America, and then to Japan and China with his Aunty, the well-known international pacifist campaigner Muriel Lester \u2013 today\u2019s \u2018Gap Year\u2019. Hogg stayed in touch with St George\u2019s and like many of his friends, he wrote back to The Georgian, the school magazine, updating them of his travels.\n\nIndeed, whilst at Oxford he also played against the School 1st XV in the annual old boys match, was good enough to make the all-star OG\u2019s sevens team (which won the Herts tournament 7 years running in the 1930s), and also played for the inaugural OG cricket team The Dragons.\n\nHogg\u2019s actions in China as a reporter for the Manchester Guardian, and especially in saving a school in war-torn China from the ravages of the Japanese Army were remarkable. It is an heroic story that ended in tragedy, as Hogg died in Shandan, Gansu Province, in 1945 at the age of 30.\n\nThis story of Hogg is now well known amongst most of the community of St George\u2019s, but this was not always so. Mrs Weatherly, the school Archivist, first delved into the archives in the 1980s following on from articles by James McManus, the Telegraph and later Times journalist. The coming of the film, The Children of Huang Shi and the biography of Hogg Ocean Devil in 2008 acted as a further stimulus for the School\u2019s interest in George Hogg\u2019s life.\n\nA special insight into the History of in China\n\nIn 2008 the school sent a group of students and staff to research the life of Hogg further. We travelled up to Gansu province, to the town where he died. We visited memorials, statues and his tomb.\n\nWe also interviewed some of his former students whose lives he saved and also the brothers who he adopted. This was edited skilfully by the history students and made into a DVD which is used to teach the students of St Georges during Year 9. The story of Hogg and the question of his significance allows us to study not only St George\u2019s in the 1930s, but also China and the Far East during the Second World War. This unit has widened our teaching of the Second World War and given the students an understanding of the events of the Sino-Japanese War, including the atrocities that occurred to cities like Nanjing. It also gives students a better sense of China as a modern country today \u2013 the history of the decline of its imperial monarchy, the failure of its Republic, the period of Civil War and the rise of Communism. Students answer questions on the significance of Hogg*, and examine the accuracy of the film The Children of Huang Shi as an interpretation of his life. They are upset that St George\u2019s does not feature however!\n\nWhat is most exciting about the history of George Hogg is that so much of it is still living. This was evident from our trip to China in 2008 and also this summer when we welcomed two of Hogg\u2019s surviving adopted sons and also other members of the Hogg family to celebrate his life and legend. During the summer, the school was given the George Hogg private papers by the Hogg family which will go on to enrich our understanding and teaching of Hogg even further. We have much more to learn!\n\n* See also four presentations by pupils in 2011, evaluating the significance of George Hogg in world history, as an indication of how his life and work are studied in St George\u2019s School."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/174340485/gordon-douglas-hogg", "page_content": "Gordon was born in Nelson, BC and the family moved to Revelstoke shortly after.

Formally called the National Prohibition Act, the Volstead Act enabled law enforcement agencies to carry out the 18th Amendment. It said that \"no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor except as authorized by this act\" and defined intoxicating liquor as any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume.\n\nIn 1922, he was only 3 years old when on November 4th, British Egyptologists George Carnarvon and Howard Carter unearthed the first step leading to King Tutankhamen's tomb in the Valley of the Kings. By the end of the month they had unearthed the steps and broken through the door into the intact tomb. This was the only tomb that had remained unlooted that had been found (and is, to date). Filled with gold, jewels, and ancient everyday items, the find was priceless - in terms of money and history.\n\nIn 1930, by the time he was merely 11 years old, as head of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, William Hays established a code of decency that outlined what was acceptable in films. The public - and government - had felt that films in the '20's had become increasingly risque and that the behavior of its stars was becoming scandalous. Laws were being passed. In response, the heads of the movie studios adopted a voluntary \"code\", hoping to head off legislation. The first part of the code prohibited \"lowering the moral standards of those who see it\", called for depictions of the \"correct standards of life\", and forbade a picture from showing any sort of ridicule towards a law or \"creating sympathy for its violation\". The second part dealt with particular behavior in film such as homosexuality, the use of specific curse words, and miscegenation.\n\nIn 1944, in the year of Robert Gordon Hogg's passing, on June 22nd, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, called the G.I. Bill, was signed into law, pushed through by the veteran's organizations. Benefits provided for veterans to return to school (high school, vocational school, or college), obtain low interest home mortgages and low interest business loans, and (if needed) one year of unemployment insurance. Since most returning vets immediately found work, less than 20% of the unemployment benefits were distributed."}], "Gordon Hogg is a Canadian politician.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gordon_J._Hogg", "page_content": "Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Gordon J.

It has also inspired him to foster four young people and to go on and found Night Hoops Basketball, a no-cost community program that helps get youth of the street.\n\nHogg has also earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees, and latterly a Ph.D, for which his thesis very much hewed to his passion: \u2018Creating Public Policy in a Complex Society.\u2019\n\nPeace Arch News"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Gordie_Hogg", "page_content": "What we do.

He previously represented Surrey-White Rock in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1997 to 2017 as part of the British Columbia Liberal Party caucus, serving in several cabinet positions under Premier Gordon Campbell during that time, and was the mayor of White Rock, British Columbia from 1984 to 1993.\n\nBackground\n\nHogg was born in Victoria to Kathleen and Dr. Allan Hogg, a prominent physician in White Rock, who was instrumental in establishing the first White Rock Hospital in 1954, and is the oldest of four children. Dr. Hogg went on to deliver more than 1,100 children during his time in the community, with a wing of the Peace Arch Hospital named in his honour.[1][2]\n\nWhile attending the University of British Columbia (UBC), Hogg was a two-sport athlete, playing football and basketball, including winning the National Junior Men\u2019s Basketball Championship in 1967.[3] He graduated from UBC with a bachelor of arts in sociology and psychology, and from Antioch College with a master's degree in psychology.[4][5]\n\nHogg began coaching baseball in the community in his teens. He was asked to go before White Rock City Council to request support for the team to go to Edmonton for the championships. Upon returning home, Hogg said that he thought the whole thing had been pointless, to which his mother replied \u201cSon, I hoped I\u2019d always raised you to be the kind of person that if you didn\u2019t like something, you wouldn\u2019t complain about it, but you\u2019d get involved and try and make a difference.\u201d Hogg has said that this is what led him to run for politics, first at the municipal level, then provincially and federally.[2][6]\n\nHe had worked for the Salvation Army's House of Concord as a probation officer, and the British Columbia corrections service as a regional director.[2][7] In 1996, while working as director of the Burnaby Youth Custody Centre, he established Night Hoops, a nighttime basketball program for at-risk youth to help reduce recidivism and other related issues.[8]\n\nHogg and his wife LaVerne have one son, Blair.

Dr. Hogg went on to deliver more than 1,100 children during his time in the community, with a wing of the Peace Arch Hospital named in his honour.[1][2]\n\nWhile attending the University of British Columbia (UBC), Hogg was a two-sport athlete, playing football and basketball, including winning the National Junior Men\u2019s Basketball Championship in 1967.[3] He graduated from UBC with a bachelor of arts in sociology and psychology, and from Antioch College with a master's degree in psychology.[4][5]\n\nHogg began coaching baseball in the community in his teens. He was asked to go before White Rock City Council to request support for the team to go to Edmonton for the championships. Upon returning home, Hogg said that he thought the whole thing had been pointless, to which his mother replied \u201cSon, I hoped I\u2019d always raised you to be the kind of person that if you didn\u2019t like something, you wouldn\u2019t complain about it, but you\u2019d get involved and try and make a difference.\u201d Hogg has said that this is what led him to run for politics, first at the municipal level, then provincially and federally.[2][6]\n\nHe had worked for the Salvation Army's House of Concord as a probation officer, and the British Columbia corrections service as a regional director.[2][7] In 1996, while working as director of the Burnaby Youth Custody Centre, he established Night Hoops, a nighttime basketball program for at-risk youth to help reduce recidivism and other related issues.[8]\n\nHogg and his wife LaVerne have one son, Blair.

He lost to her again in 2021.\n\nIn an interview with The VOICE in 2017, he pointed out that he was on White Rock Council first as a Councillor for 10 years and then as the mayor for another 10 years.\n\nHe then became an MLA from the riding of Surrey-White Rock in a 1997 by-election. He was re-elected in 2001, 2005, 2009, and again in 2013.\n\nHe held several portfolios as MLA including Minister of Children and Family Development, Parliamentary Secretary for Youth Sport to the Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development, Parliamentary Secretary for Social Entrepreneurship to the Minister of Finance, Minister of State for Mining, and Minister of State for ActNow BC. Hogg also served as chair of the Government Caucus.\n\nHogg was a counsellor, probation officer and regional director for corrections prior to his election to the Legislative Assembly. He received his bachelor of arts in sociology and psychology from the University of British Columbia and his master\u2019s degree in psychology from Antioch College.\n\nGordon Hogg and his wife, LaVerne, live in White Rock and have one son.

I\u2019ve talked to others who have decided not to run again and they\u2019ve said they have all gone through some form of withdrawal, and I\u2019m going through that, too.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Hogg said, he has always felt very connected to White Rock residents, from his earliest days in Little League, through playing fastball and basketball, and later coaching \u2013 as well as in his 20 years as councillor and mayor.\n\n\u201cYou lose some of that when you\u2019re going to Victoria and dealing with big-picture issues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe office also represented a significant time commitment, he noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been averaging 70 hours a week. You come in at 7:30 in the morning and you usually don\u2019t get out until 8:30 p.m., and there are also a lot of events on Friday nights and Saturdays and Sundays \u2013 but I\u2019ve loved every bit of it.\u201d\n\nAnd, Hogg said, he wouldn\u2019t rule out a return to politics in some other arena in the future.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that in any real sense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to rule out any options. Right now I\u2019m wanting to focus on my work (as MLA) for the next eight months.\u201d\n\nHogg said that since he first made it known he was considering withdrawing from provincial politics, he has been approached by several community organizations wondering whether he would consider serving on their boards.\n\nAnd while he\u2019s not making any commitments, he said he doesn\u2019t doubt that, once his provincial duties are over, he will continue to be heavily involved in the community.\n\n\u201cI think I can contribute \u2013 I\u2019ve learned a lot over the years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s also been invited to become an adjunct professor at Simon Fraser University, where he completed his PhD earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to doing some teaching there \u2013 and they\u2019ve also been talking with me about turning my dissertation (Creating Public Policy in a Complex Society) into a book.\u201d\n\nThe former counsellor, probation officer and regional director of corrections occupied a number of posts in government, including minister of state for mining, minister of state for ActNow BC and minister of children and family development.\n\nHis current duties include serving on the Select Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and the Select Standing Committee on Education.\n\nBut while he has worked on projects that have created important precedents and travelled internationally to address prestigious groups, Hogg said his most memorable and rewarding achievements have tended to be \u201cthe little things\u201d; helping find funding for a deaf student to pursue post-secondary education, for example, or \u201cworking with groups like the White Rock Stroke Club and the Friends of the Semiahmoo Bay \u2013 little organizations that do great work but don\u2019t get a lot of financial support \u2013 and being able to get them some money.\u201d\n\nSuch groups, he said \u201care the heart and soul of a community.\u201d\n\nIn a prepared statement released Tuesday morning, Hogg thanked a \u201cstrong support system\u201d including his family, and his constituency and legislative staff \u201cfor ensuring I was prepared and well-represented.\u201d He also thanked the people of Surrey-White Rock \u201cfor placing your confidence in me and bringing forward your issues and ideas.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Premier Christy Clark said \u201cGordie\u2019s unique wit and wisdom will be missed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the course of his career, Gordie has held an impressive array of roles, and in each he made tremendous and lasting contributions to BC public life,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMost recently, as Parliamentary Secretary for Youth Sport, Gordie brought to life the Premier\u2019s Award for Aboriginal Youth Excellence in Sport, which honours and celebrates the next generation of First Nations leaders.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://archive.news.gov.bc.ca/releases/news_releases_2005-2009/2006OTP0134-001042-Attachment2.htm", "page_content": "!DOCUMENT HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\n\nHON.

(Contributed photo)\n\nPeace Arch News reached out to the four candidates running for the South Surrey-White Rock riding in the Sept. 20 federal election and asked them each to respond to four questions.\n\nBelow are the responses from Gordie Hogg (Liberals) in his own words:\n\n1) Following another summer of record-breaking heat in B.C., what actions would your party take, if elected, to immediately address the causes and impacts of climate change?\n\nA: I know that climate change is real, as do the residents of Lytton, those who lost loved ones in the heat dome, and most other Canadians.\n\nIf elected, I commit to building on the results of the Liberals\u2019 2015 $60 billion climate plan and to ensuring that our community directly benefits from goals in the new $17.6 billion strategy for a green recovery \u2013 reaching net-zero by 2050, preserving 25 per cent of our lands and oceans by 2025, boosting domestic green technology and energy, creating sustainable jobs and planting two billion trees.\n\nSouth Surrey/White Rock is witnessing the impacts of climate change. I commit to ensuring that residents benefit from programs like the $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund to help manage droughts and floods, restore shorelines and make our homes more energy efficient.\n\nFor 15 years I\u2019ve worked with local activists to rid our community of thermal coal, and I\u2019m pleased to announce that all exports of thermal coal will end no later than 2030. This is an important milestone, the first of many.\n\n2) Canada remains in the grips of a global pandemic. What steps need to be taken to get Canadians safely through this crisis, to facilitate economic recovery and to ensure our nation is better prepared for future public-health emergencies?\n\nA: When COVID hit, the Liberal government took immediate, decisive action to stabilize the economy and support Canadians with the largest economic aid package in generations. As of Sept. 1, 76.7 per cent of Canadians 12-plus are fully vaccinated, a key signpost of progress towards normal life.\n\nI will advocate for our community as we navigate the next steps in Canada\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nIn April, the Liberals launched a $101.4 billion growth strategy with important measures including a $30 billion childcare program, a $17.6 billion investment in a green recovery, support for small businesses, tourism and entrepreneurs, targeted tax measures and income supports including boosting Old Age Security. Economic recovery needs to be felt at the household level, and I will strive to ensure that it is.\n\nIn terms of future public-health emergencies, I will support Liberal government campaigns to rebuild domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity, boost research, protect the most vulnerable and make long-term care homes safer.\n\n3) The price of everything from housing to food and child care is rising rapidly. What steps would a government formed by your party take to ensure all Canadians have access to safe and adequate housing and a healthy diet?\n\nA: I\u2019ve seen the financial pressure facing our community in young families who fear they may never be able to buy their first home, and seniors who fear the loss of life-long homes.\n\nI commit to ensuring that residents benefit from Liberal government programs for first-time homebuyers, rent-to-own projects, social housing initiatives, the $40-billion National Housing Strategy and the $2 billion Canada Housing Benefit. Housing is for people, not speculators.\n\nI commit to supporting the Liberal government\u2019s measures to help our families \u2013 the Canada Child Benefit, $10 a day daycare, reduced taxes on small businesses and the middle class, targeted income supports, and jobs. New recovery programs and infrastructure investments are projected to create one million jobs, and I will ensure some of these jobs are in our community.\n\nI will support programs that put more money in residents\u2019 pockets and connect residents with resources. Poverty is the biggest reason people are hungry or homeless, and I commit to connecting people to programs to make sure there\u2019s food on every table and a roof over every head.\n\n4) Racial justice and reconciliation are at the forefront of Canadian consciousness. What steps need to be taken to help right past wrongs and ensure that all Canadians are granted equal voice, opportunity and respect?\n\nA: I am proud of the diversity of our community.\n\nI am proud to be part of a party that has made historic investments to support equality, diversity and reconciliation via commitments to a $30 billion child-care program, an $18 billion program for Indigenous peoples, more than $1 billion to address systemic racism, and the most significant advancement in disability rights in 30 years.\n\nThese commitments will help ensure that all Canadians can participate fully in our communities.\n\nIn terms of righting past wrongs, I was very pleased to have worked closely with the Semiahmoo First Nation on the lifting of its 16-year boiled-water advisory and look forward to continuing action to advance meaningful reconciliation.\n\nIn April, the Liberal government passed legislation to adopt the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, an action that paves the way for transformative change in First Nations communities.\n\nThese and other Liberal government programs support equality, opportunity and respect, values enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms that I will strive to advance across our community.\n\n\n\neditorial@peacearchnews.com\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nCanada Election 2021"}]}
