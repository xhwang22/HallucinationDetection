As she spoke, there was the muffled pounding of Mr. Mamet's typewriter, a sound that is part of the texture of her life.\n\nMany of the people Miss Crouse has loved have been involved with writing, the theater, or both. She could have rejected it all, overwhelmed by the surfeit of talent in her household. Instead, she became an actress and married a playwright. Right now she is starring as Viola in the Circle Repertory's lighthearted version of Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night,'' directed by Mr. Mamet. The critics have hailed her performance as ''outstanding,'' and said she exudes ''charm along with intelligence.''\n\nMiss Crouse's father was Russel Crouse, who wrote, among many plays, ''Life with Father'' and ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' in collaboration with Howard Lindsay, the man after whom she was named. Her mother, Anna, wrote children's books with her father. Her older brother, Timothy, wrote ''The Boys on the Bus,'' a funny, much-admired description of the press corps covering the 1972 Presidential campaign. Her maternal grandfather was John Erskine, the noted English professor who wrote ''The Private Life of Helen of Troy,'' and who headed the Juilliard School of Music for many years. Her father's father was a newspaperman. Family of Busy Typewriters ''In our family, the work ethic was held up as some kind of byword,'' Miss Crouse remembered. ''At any hour, somebody's typewriter was going. If my father had been an actor instead of a playwright, I might have had problems.''\n\nMiss Crouse remembers her growing-up years as golden and romantic, ''part of the way Broadway used to be.'' Celebrities streamed to the family's town house in the East 60's, a home with Victorian antiques and tasseled red draperies. Among the frequent guests were Sherwood Anderson, Eugene O'Neill, Edna Ferber, John Steinbeck, Frederic March (''I remember him well - his noble bearing''), John Mason Brown, Howard Lindsay, Dorothy Stickney, Ethel Merman, Mary Martin and Irving Berlin. They ate and drank and sang and played charades ''in a spirit of fun and affection,'' Miss Crouse said. ''I thought everybody had a life like that. My brother and I were made part of that - introduced to every guest, being asked what we were doing at school. When we weren't asked to join in, we sat at the top of the stairs, just fascinated by all the goings-on.''"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-6118-1_2", "page_content": "In the midst of a successful stage and film career, Lindsay Crouse asked to be admitted to the beginners\u2019 acting class at The Neighborhood Playhouse.
