We have to keep the live music for sure, depending on how many people we can bring, and if they will be seated or standing,\" he said.\n\n\"With technology we have the opportunity to bring something which is hybrid, live and digital.

It was a three-day event featuring the Charles Lloyd Quartet, an American group, alongside a dozen participants in a competition for European jazz artists. Staged again the following year, the festival was extended to five days to accommodate more guest artists\u2014most notably the American pianist Bill Evans and the American vocalist Nina Simone\u2014and increased participation in the competition. The Montreux Jazz Festival subsequently became an annual affair, and it continued to grow, both in duration and in scope. By the late 1970s it typically spanned two weeks in early to mid-July and encompassed not only jazz but an eclectic mix of blues, gospel, soul, rock, and other popular music genres.\n\nAs the festival gained in popularity, it outgrew the Montreux Casino, and in 1993 it moved to the Montreux Convention Centre, which provided multiple auditoriums and event spaces. Meanwhile, the festival activities became increasingly diverse, embracing workshops, lectures, films, and other events. Separate competitions were established for particular instruments, and many non-European musicians joined the ranks of the contestants. A special contest\u2014called Tremplin L\u00e9manique (\u201cSpringboard of Lake Geneva\u201d)\u2014for local bands was inaugurated in 2008. By this time the festival had spread well beyond the confines of the convention centre to nearby venues, including parks, trains, boats, and small indoor settings. Between ticketed and free events, the audience numbered in the hundreds of thousands."}, {"url": "https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com/en/news/smoke-on-the-water-50-years/", "page_content": "On December 4, 1971, a fire in a small Swiss town gave birth to a worldwide hit\u2026 We look back at this incredible story that put Montreux and its Festival on the map.\n\n\u201cFire!\u201d On that famous 4th of December 1971, around 4.15pm, Frank Zappa\u2019s concert at the Montreux Casino was interrupted. The flames invaded the building, the smoke was visible far and wide. No casualties were reported, but for Claude Nobs, it was a disaster: the venue that hosted his jazz festival every summer (he had just celebrated its 5th edition there), as well as the pop concerts organised throughout the year with bands such as Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin, collapsed before his eyes.\n\nBarely recovered from the shock, Claude was faced with an urgent challenge: finding a new recording venue for Deep Purple. He didn\u2019t know it yet, but the British band will single-handedly turn the tragedy into gold, the fire into a worldwide hit and, of course, Monsieur Nobs into \u201cFunky Claude\u201d.\n\nClaude Nobs and Jean-Paul Marquis \u00a91971 Alain Bettex\n\nTHE INITIAL PLAN: THE CASINO\n\nThe hard rock band was in Montreux to record their next album at the Casino with a mobile studio borrowed from the Rolling Stones. The location was perfect: the musicians did not want a standard recording studio and they were already familiar with the Montreux Casino, having performed there in 1969. As a sidenote, a girl named Michaela Maiterth, then aged 13 years old, was there that night and discovered her passion for live music. Twenty years later, she would become the programmer of the Montreux Jazz Festival and invite Deep Purple to perform many times.\n\nCasino concert hall in flames \u00a9Alain Bettex 1971\n\nPLAN B: THE PAVILLON\n\nAfter the fire at the Casino, Claude did everything he could so that Deep Purple could still record their album in Montreux. He found a plan B: the \u201cPavillon des Sports\u201d, now known as the Petit Palais. It\u2019s here that guitarist Ritchie Blackmore first improvised the famous riff on his Fender Stratocaster. But the recording session was short-lived: the police arrived following complaints from the neighbourhood. It is said that the roadies resisted just long enough for the guitar riff to be recorded on tape\u2026\n\nLausanne double bass player L\u00e9on Francioli in the ruins of the Casino \u00a9Alain Bettex 1971\n\nPLAN C: THE GRAND HOTEL IN TERRITET\n\nClaude Nobs then had the idea of going in the Grand Hotel in Territet, which was not used during the winter. The inside of the hotel was soundproofed with mattresses and the musicians had to go through the balconies to listen to the recordings in another room. One morning, bassist Roger Glover woke up with the line \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 in his head. The band had the idea of telling the story of the fire and the unusual recording context of the album. Legend has it that Claude Nobs convinced them to include the song on the album and predicted that it would be a hit. The rest is history\u2026\n\nAN ANTHEM FOR THE MONTREUX JAZZ FESTIVAL\n\nSince then, Deep Purple has played nine concerts at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Each time the band plays its anthem in their \u201chome ground\u201d, there is always a special emotional energy, a thrill that runs through the audience. Among the legendary performances of \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d in Montreux, we will remember a superb jazzy introduction in 2004, an epic version with a symphony orchestra in 2011 or a duet with Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank, during the 50th edition of the Festival. Quite a symbol.\n\n\u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d live at Montreux Jazz Festival in 1996\n\nOn this very special anniversary, the Montreux Jazz Festival team would like to thank the members of Deep Purple for their friendship over the years and for the unexpected gift they gave to the city of Montreux fifty years ago: an anthem for eternity.\n\n\u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d with symphony orchestra at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2011\n\nDid you know? \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d is often played at the Montreux Jazz Festival by other musicians.
