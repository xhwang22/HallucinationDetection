In the occupied territories, the SS encroached upon the jurisdiction of the civilian authorities and even the Wehrmacht. However, as the invading Allied armies and Allied bombings from the air brought the war home to Germany in 1943\u20131944, the SS was challenged by two powerful rivals.\n\nThe Nazi Party apparatus under the Chief of the Party Chancellery, Martin Bormann, was one of those rivals. The power of the party bureaucracy was anchored in the Party District Leaders (Gauleiter) who also had state authority in their positions as Reich Defense Commissars and could mobilize the German population for the final struggle. Hence the party could control the ever-lessening stream of man- and woman-power into military, police, and auxiliary functions in the last year of the war. Moreover, in his second function as the Secretary of the F\u00fchrer, Bormann controlled access to Hitler, whose health and connection with real events declined precipitously after the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt, and played an ever greater role in translating the F\u00fchrer's statements into orders for implementation.\n\nDespite postwar disclaimers of powerlessness against SS infiltration, Albert Speer, the Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production, also enjoyed good access to Hitler. Speer had control over the allocation of raw materials, construction resources, and the engineering corps of the state, whose significance increased in proportion to the level of destruction that Allied bombing wrought in the Reich.\n\nThe SS began to disintegrate in 1945. Individual SS officers hoped to exploit tensions between the western Allies and the Soviet Union to open negotiations for a separate peace with the western Allies that would permit the Nazi state to survive and fight on against the USSR. These officers included\n\nSS General Karl Wolff\u2014the Highest SS and Police Leader for German-occupied Italy\n\nSS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Heydrich's successor as chief of the RSHA\n\nSS General Walter Schellenberg, the chief of the RSHA Department VI (SD Foreign Intelligence Agency)\n\nand even Himmler himself\n\nFacing unyielding demands for unconditional surrender, the SS men who sent out feelers, lacked the authority\u2014or the conception of themselves in a post-Nazi state\u2014to offer unconditional surrender even to the western Allies.\n\nWolff succeeded in persuading German military authorities in Northern Italy to surrender to the Anglo-Americans on May 2, 1945, five days before the end of the war. In late April, Himmler himself made an offer of unconditional surrender through an intermediary to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Commander-in-Chief of the UK, and US forces in Europe. Hitler heard of the offer by radio on April 29, 1945; in one of his last official acts, the Nazi F\u00fchrer dismissed Himmler from all of his offices and positions.\n\nDespite these musings about a separate peace at the highest levels, the SS continued to eliminate enemies of the regime, even as the Nazi German state lurched towards collapse in the winter of 1944\u20131945. Of the 1.2 million prisoners who died in the concentration camps (excluding some 865,000 Jews sent directly to the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau), around 350,000 reportedly died in the last five months of the war, almost 30%. Most succumbed to the consequences of SS criminal neglect: starvation, exposure, and disease. Moreover, the SS camp staff and guards shot, hanged, or otherwise killed thousands of prisoners in the last months of the war.\n\nOn orders from Himmler not to permit concentration camp prisoners to fall alive into enemy hands, the SS guards forced tens of thousands of prisoners on the road, often in bitter winter weather, as the Allied and Soviet advances forced the evacuation of concentration camps. German authorities transported prisoners by truck, open railcar, and on foot to camps located in the interior of the Reich. Remembered by the prisoners as \u201cdeath marches\u201d because of the high mortality rates and the brutality of the SS guards in shooting prisoners along the way, these evacuations continued until the very end of the war, contributing significantly to the dreadful death toll.\n\nNor were the inmates of Gestapo and Kripo prisons spared. As Soviet troops overran German positions in the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Reich itself, Security Police officials often slaughtered the remaining prisoners\u2014Jews and non-Jews\u2014before moving west themselves. Often the result of local initiative driven by racial hatred, revenge, or fear, such massacres continued until the last days of the war. There are insufficient records to fully document these killings or to even attempt an estimate of total numbers of victims.\n\nSS Members after World War II\n\nOn May 6, 1945, Hitler's successor, Reich President and Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, formally relieved Himmler of his duties, in accordance with Hitler's orders. Despite his promise to all SS men that he would assume full responsibility for their actions, the former SS chief intended to disappear, donning the uniform of a Secret Field Police and carrying papers in name of Heinrich Hitzinger. On May 20, Soviet troops captured \u201cHitzinger\u201d and turned him over to the British, to whom Himmler confessed his identity. As his captors attempted a body search, Himmler committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule.\n\nSeveral other top SS leaders followed Himmler's example, including Odilo Globocnik, the mastermind of Operation Reinhard. Others disappeared into Soviet captivity, or into assumed identities in occupied Germany, or by emigrating to the Americas. Adolf Eichmann, who coordinated the deportation of the central and west European Jews to the east for the RSHA, emigrated under false papers to Argentina after the war. Allied authorities sent some SS leaders back to the scenes of their crimes to stand trial and, after conviction, to face execution, as in the case of Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the commandant of Auschwitz, who was prosecuted and executed in Poland. In awareness of SS criminal activity, Allied commanders subjected all SS personnel in occupied Germany to automatic arrest.\n\nWith Himmler and Heydrich dead, the victorious Allies selected Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Heydrich's successor as chief of the RSHA, to represent the SS and all of its crimes at the trial of the major war criminals in Nuremberg, which opened in November 1945. The tribunal prosecutors also indicted and convicted the SS and the Gestapo-SD collectively as criminal organizations. Leaders of three key SS organizations\u2014the concentration camp administration, the Einsatzgruppen, and the Himmler's Reich Commissariat for Strengthening German Racial Stock\u2014were tried in three subsequent Nuremberg trials under the auspices of the International Military Tribunal.\n\nEach of the victorious Allied powers and each of the governments reconstituted after liberation from German occupation tried hundreds of mid-level and lower-level SS officials. Though members of the SS continued to stand in defendant's docks in the Federal Republic of Germany and elsewhere after the end of World War II\u2014even up to the present day\u2014the vast majority of SS and police were never called to account for their crimes."}, {"url": "https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/questions/3915/finding-information-on-german-soldiers-from-world-war-i-and-world-war-ii", "page_content": "My answer consists of three parts. I start with World War II because more (individual) records are available and I assume people are more interested in it. The second part focusses on World War I and possible research difficulties. The last part covers projects and institutions providing e.g. information on burial sites and memorials of both wars.\n\nWorld War II\n\nYour primary source for historical records on German armed forces, especially for World War II, is the national archive (Bundesarchiv). Since 2019, documents from the former Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt, Deutsche Dienststelle f\u00fcr die Benachrichtigung der n\u00e4chsten Angeh\u00f6rigen von Gefallenen der ehemaligen deutschen Wehrmacht) are kept in department PA (Personenbezogene Ausk\u00fcnfte zum Ersten und Zweiten Weltkrieg).\n\nPlease see their list on their records. These include personnel documents, listings, documents on military losses and a register containing over 18 million soldiers from World War II.\n\nYou have to fill a request form, provide known information (obligatory: name and birth date) on your ancestors, check options what kind of information you are interested in. You also have to state your relationship, e.g. \u201egrandson\u201c.\n\n(They may ask you to provide additional information to prove your relationship, especially if your family name differs or you are looking for ancestors other than your direct ancestors. It could help to provide this information in your first query. To give an example: If you are looking for a brother of your grandfather, the WASt most likely will send you information if you truthfully state that this brother was never married and died without known children.)\n\nThe report usually contains basic biographical information (father, date and place of birth), drafting date, dog tag number, training units and units in the course of war, ranks, notes on injuries and captivity.\n\nYou may have to wait up to two years before you receive an answer. The information is provided in accordance with the fee schedule of the Federal Archives.\n\nImportant: Please note that these compiled reports will not tell you what your ancestor experienced, whether he participated in war crimes, or what kind of man he was. It's a mere bureaucratic listing of his military career. A lot of records were destroyed, so there might be gaps and the military career might be reconstructed from listings only, not from individual personal records. Read publications on certain units (often written by veterans with a strong bias), literature on a particular theatre and modern literature on the general history of World War II for a broader perspective.\n\nIf your ancestor was an officer or official in the Wehrmacht, the Bundesarchiv in Freiburg (Bundesarchiv, Abteilung Milita\u0308rarchiv) holds personnel documents. They also have documents on military trials and awards for all ranks. The Bundesarchiv in Berlin has records on members of SA, SS and Waffen-SS. For access and costs please contact the Bundesarchiv.\n\nGeneral note on using German archive resources:\n\nContact them and tell them what you are looking for. Ask if it is necessary/possible to come by or if the research can be done by the archive. (The latter is often possible for simple tasks like information on the membership in the Nazi party (NSDAP) and other simple research tasks. German Archives usually do not conduct extensive research, you have to do this on your own or use a professional research service.) Their reply will contain information on available records, archive use and prices. They will also send you a Benutzungsantrag (application). You have to fill your details, what you are working on and what is the purpose of your research (academic, private (e.g. genealogy), official \u2026) and sign their conditions. To give you an idea about the price tag: In summer 2013 I paid the Bundesarchiv for 30 minutes of research 15,34 EUR and 0,43 EUR for each copy. Visiting a archive and doing research there is usually free of charge.\n\nInformation on war captivity might be contained in your dossier from the Deutsche Dienststelle. The German Red Cross, Suchdienst M\u00fcnchen has access to records on prisoners in Soviet captivity and missing soldiers. A soviet record on a German prisoner of war usually consist of five pages. It contains information that might also be helpful for genealogical questions other than those concerning the POW himself:\n\nnotes on camps and relocations\n\nbiographical information about the POW (birth date and place, last known address, language knowledge, membership in political parties, confession, education, profession, family status, possessions, private connections to the Soviet Union, trials, practical skills)\n\nmilitary information (drafting date, branch of service, unit, dog tag number, rank, function, awards, if surrendered of captured, date and place)\n\nvisual nature and special characteristics of the POW\n\nbiographical information about his parents, wife and siblings (name, surname, age, profession, place of residence) and even more details on the father (possessions)\n\nThey send you the records within several weeks. The records are in Russian. They usually add a letter with a translation of notes on camps and relocations. They do not translate biographical and military details. You\u2019ll get a summary where you can see which column contains which information and have to look for translation elsewhere.\n\nAs far as I know, this service is free of charge. They ask for donations. Please keep in mind, that the Suchdienst also helps to find missing individuals in modern conflicts.\n\nThe German Red Cross Suchdienst provides also access to Vermisstenbildlisten. These lists of casualties missed in action were created in the 1950s. The database was created from inquiries from family members and other parties, it is no collection of all missing soldiers. 125.000 pages in 225 volumes contain 1.400.000 soldiers (and civilians), 900.000 entries with photographs. The lists are online since April 2015, however using them remains complicated as they can\u2019t be searched by name or birth date. You need a Feldpostnummer, a camp number, a field address or a last known place.\n\nInformation on Luftwaffe officers is compiled on a private website: Luftwaffe Officer Career Summaries.\n\nWorld War I\n\nLooking at World War I it is important to know where in Germany your ancestors lived. Within the forces of the German Empire, dominated by Prussia, the contingents of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg and Saxony remained semi-autonomous and also kept their own records.\n\nA lot of of records on participants of World War I were destroyed when the Prussian military archive in Potsdam burned down in 1945. Except for some Reichsmarine (navy) records, almost all individual documents from the Prussian army are lost. Records on navy members from the years between 1871 and 1947 might available from the Deutsche Dienststelle (as detailed above).\n\nRecords on combatants from Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden and Saxony are kept in local archives:\n\nThe records from W\u00fcrttemberg and Baden are freely accessible online from the archive. Please see this introduction (in German): Soldaten im Ersten Weltkrieg Findmittel zu den Personalunterlagen des XIV. Armeekorps im Generallandesarchiv Karlsruhe jetzt online. You choose the relevant time period for the personnel rosters and search them by unit (not indexed).\n\nThe Bavarian records (Kriegsranglisten und -stammrollen des K\u00f6nigreichs Bayern) are also available on Ancestry.com. They usually contain short biographical information like occupation and place of residence, military career (rank, participation in battles, awards) and information on the soldier\u2019s parents.\n\nI haven\u2019t used the Saxon archive on my own, so I don\u2019t know if research for individual military records is conducted by the archive. Please see my general hints above.\n\nWhat to do if your ancestor fought in the Prussian army? During the war the army announced deaths, injuries, missing soldiers and prisoners of war in the so-called Verlustlisten. These lists were on public display. They contain names, places of births and complete or incomplete (just day and month) birth dates. The names are listed according to the soldier\u2019s units, so if your ancestor was killed or injured, was missing in action or became a POW, you can reconstruct where he was fighting and which unit he was a member of around this time. List of abbreviations (with translations) for different types of injuries and deaths.\n\nThe German genealogy association Verein f\u00fcr Computergenealogie has the only complete, indexed and freely accessible collection of them. You can search the indexed records using this search mask. A list of Prussian soldiers missed in action was also indexed. These lists are sorted by unit and contain information on those to be contacted (mostly family members) as well.\n\nThere are a lot of publications on units from WWI, written by veterans. These books often give a detailed insight on routes and military action and sometimes also contain photos and listings.\n\nFor officers, other compiled lists exists, e.g. Friedrich Uebe: Ehrenmal des preu\u00dfischen Offizier-Korps : alphabetisches Verzeichnis der im Weltkriege 1914/1918 gefallenen Angeho\u0308rigen des preu\u00dfischen Offizier-Korps. 1939. (Worldcat entry). This book contains an alphabetical list of surnames of fallen officers naming the last unit, date and place of death. A source for promotions and transfers of officers is the military journal Milit\u00e4r-Wochenblatt, available on Ancestry.\n\nFallen members of the navy are listed in the Marine-Gedenkbuch (34833 handwritten names) according to their units/ships. This book was indexed as well.\n\nThe archives of the International Prisoners-of-War Agency hold 500,000 pages of lists and six million index cards regarding prisoners of war (WW I), including German POW.\n\nWorld War I and World War II\n\nFor military losses of both wars you can use a search engine (\u201cGr\u00e4bersuche\u201d) provided by the Volksbund. Their database of cemeteries contains information like date and place of death. It contains also information on soldiers missed in action or death soldiers not buried on known cemeteries. Contacting the Volksbund on one of their database entries can be useful. Often they have additional information like the original burial place or the last known military unit of the war victim in their repositories. Their help is free of charge, please consider a donation.\n\nA widely overlooked source on dead combatants are local death registers in the place of last residence. These registers often note rank, place of death, the communicating military office and/or circumstances of death. A copy can be requested from the local Standesamt (register office) or from the communal archive (the registers can be transferred from the register office to the archive after a certain period of time, just ask the register office who holds the documents). Fees apply.\n\nSometimes, these records were destroyed towards the end of World War II.\n\nThe private project Denkmalprojekt.org has a database of war memorials and other lists on combatants from both wars. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t link source files for their lists and the photographs of memorials are tiny.\n\nThe so-called Krankenbuchlager was a collection of documents especially used for veterans services and other social services. It contained a large number of records from military hospitals from both wars, but only a small fraction of all these documents ever created. According to the Bundesverwaltungsamt, e.g. only 2 % of all records from the period between 1934\u20131945 are still available. The Krankenbuchlager stopped providing information for private matters in 2007 and was closed in 2013. Contingents of the collection became part of the Bundesarchiv, Abteilung Milita\u0308rarchiv in Freiburg (birth cohort from 1802-1899, from the period between 1891 and 1899 only records from servicemen born in the months of January and July could be available) some years ago. The remaining documents (a significant number of them were destroyed in recent decades) \u2013 mostly resources on World War II, but also on World War I \u2013 were transferred to Deutsche Dienststelle. It is unknown to me to which extend these resources are used to answer requests and what WWI material is available to them."}, {"url": "https://libguides.manchestercc.edu/c.php?g=273883&p=1827922", "page_content": "More than any other of the major German officials who worked for the anti-Jewish dictator Adolf Hitler, Hermann G\u00f6ring is an example of a decent man who became corrupted by power. During G\u00f6ring's boyhood, at the end of the nineteenth century, Germany was vigorous and full of promise. As a young man, he saw his country, which was defeated in World War I (1914-18), grow frightened and desperate. The people finally turned to Hitler to save them. Instead, Hitler involved Germany in a bloody and barbaric series of events that ended in shame and defeat. Hermann G\u00f6ring's fate was no better.\n\nUnhappy beginnings\n\nHermann Wilhelm G\u00f6ring (pronounced hair-mon vil-helm ger-ring) was born in a little town south of Munich, Germany, in January 1893. His father, Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring, represented Germany's business interests in various foreign countries. When she was 19, G\u00f6ring's mother, Franziska \"Fanny\" Tiefenbrun, married Heinrich G\u00f6ring, a 45-year-old widower with five children. Besides serving as stepmother to these children, she also gave birth to four children of her own. Hermann was the last.\n\nWhen G\u00f6ring was three months old, his mother went to join her husband in the country of Haiti, where he was stationed. G\u00f6ring was left behind for three years to be raised by a family in the town of Furth. Without his family, G\u00f6ring was a lonely, unhappy child. When they were finally reunited he struck at his mother in rage.\n\nBack in Germany, the career of G\u00f6ring's father reached a dead end because he advocated that black people be treated as human beings. This was a highly unpopular idea among the Germans at that time. He soon retired and died from alcoholism in 1913.\n\nChildhood and schooling\n\nAfter his father's retirement, G\u00f6ring went to live at the castle of his godfather, an Austrian physician named Hermann von Epenstein. One day at the private school he attended, the teachers criticized G\u00f6ring for writing an admiring essay about his godfather. The teachers said that von Epenstein was Jewish and that students were not expected to write essays in praise of Jews. That night the 11-year-old G\u00f6ring packed his bags and returned home.\n\nG\u00f6ring then attended two different military academies, where he excelled at mountain climbing and horseback riding. A loyal, self-confident boy, he dreamed of becoming a hero that all of Germany would respect. He graduated in 1912 with highest honors. After graduation, G\u00f6ring served as a junior officer in the Prinz Wilhelm Regiment. He was popular with young women, in part because of his striking blue-green eyes and blond good looks.\n\nDuring World War I, G\u00f6ring proved to be a brave pilot. He was awarded Germany's highest honor for an aviator, the Blue Max. On July 7, 1918, he was appointed the last commander of the famed Richthofen Squadron and began to develop his excellent management skills.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring worked as a stunt pilot and as a commercial pilot for a Swedish airline. In Stockholm, Sweden, he met 32-year-old Swedish baroness Carin von Fock-Kantzoa, a married woman with an 8-year-old son. The baroness divorced her husband, a Swedish soldier, and she and G\u00f6ring were married in 1923.\n\nG\u00f6ring and many other young German soldiers during the postwar period felt betrayed by their government. Their political leaders never led them to suspect that they might be forced to surrender to the enemy. When the war ended in 1918, Germany's enemies saw to it that the country was punished. The victorious countries demanded huge sums of money, known as reparations, to make up for the damages Germany had caused during the war. The payment of these reparations resulted in economic hardships for the German people. The lack of jobs was also a serious problem. Poor and stripped of illusions, G\u00f6ring, like many young men, was looking for something in which to believe.\n\nJoins Nazi Party\n\nAdolf Hitler now marched into the life of G\u00f6ring and all of Germany. Anti-Jewish feeling and talk of German racial purity were rampant. As head of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi for short), Hitler preached that Germans were a superior race and should rule the world. He believed that Jews were a \"poisonous\" race that had caused Germany's defeat in the war. Hitler also said that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I must be done away with. G\u00f6ring agreed and joined the Nazi Party. At first G\u00f6ring resisted Hitler's strong anti-Jewish or antisemitic beliefs. However, G\u00f6ring totally worshiped Hitler and soon abandoned his own tolerant views and went along with the Nazi leader's anti-Jewish speeches and writings.\n\nBy 1923, the G\u00f6rings' house had become the hub of Nazi social activities. It was at this house that the Nazis planned their first failed attempt to take over the German government. This would later be called the Munich Beer Hall Putsch. In the aftermath, G\u00f6ring was severely wounded. He fled to Austria and then Switzerland. During G\u00f6ring's slow recovery, he was in great pain and became a morphine (a highly addictive pain medication) addict, a problem that was to plague him on and off for the rest of his life.\n\nG\u00f6ring was free of drugs and had healed from his wounds by 1926, but the ordeal had disturbed his glandular system. From then on he remained very fat, and future enemies enjoyed making fun of this condition. The next year Germany excused all political prisoners and G\u00f6ring returned to his native land.\n\nChange of fortune\n\nBy 1927, the Nazi Party had grown large and enjoyed a great deal of support among the German people. G\u00f6ring, who had not been invited to rejoin Hitler's staff, got a job selling BMW automobiles. Within a year, he became very successful and visible in Berlin's (Germany's capital) social scene. Hitler, now aware of how he could use G\u00f6ring, selected him to head the ticket of the Nazi Party in the 1928 elections. Although the party lost, G\u00f6ring was able to prove his popularity. Hitler rewarded him with a handsome salary, and the G\u00f6rings bought a large house in a desirable district of Berlin.\n\nOver the next four years the Nazi Party grew in political strength, and so did G\u00f6ring. On January 29, 1933, Germany's president, Paul von Hindenberg, appointed Hitler chancellor. G\u00f6ring persuaded von Hindenberg that Hitler was the only man who could lead Germany out of its difficult problems caused by the worldwide depression (economic downturn). G\u00f6ring became the most important minister in Hitler's cabinet.\n\nA political crisis required that a new election be held on March 5, 1933. The Nazis did well, but failed to earn a winning majority. On March 23, through political maneuvering, G\u00f6ring had many of the Nazis' opponents arrested on questionable grounds. Their absence allowed the Nazis to drum up more than the two-thirds majority vote they needed to have Hitler placed in charge of the government. In June a new law was decreed: \"The [Nazi] Party constitutes the only political party in Germany.\"\n\nThat same year, the former political police force was replaced by the secret state police, better known as the Gestapo. Thousands of Germans were arrested for being Jews or Catholics, or because their opinions differed from the Nazis', who put them in concentration camps. The camps were places where the Nazis confined people they regarded as \"enemies of the state.\" G\u00f6ring was held in contempt by the more brutish Nazis for his \"squeamishness\" about inflicting pain and suffering on others. He tried unsuccessfully to keep brutality out of the camps where the prisoners were sent. Nevertheless, G\u00f6ring learned to turn a blind eye to the growing terrorist tactics practiced by the Nazis throughout German society.\n\nWith his love of flying, G\u00f6ring particularly enjoyed being Reichminister of Aviation. As head of the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, he spent the years 1934 through 1936 strengthening the country's air power.\n\nBy 1933, the Nazis maintained ultimate power over Germany. Hitler combined the office of president with that of chancellor, making himself head of state as well as commander in chief of the armed forces. He was now dictator of Germany. G\u00f6ring gathered his senior officers later that day, and all swore allegiance to Hitler.\n\nLoss and remarriage\n\nG\u00f6ring's wife, Carin, died in 1931 after a long illness, leaving him heartbroken. Northeast of Berlin he built himself a grand mansion named Carin Hall in her honor. G\u00f6ring, now a collector of fine art, furnished the home with priceless tapestries and paintings. By this time, G\u00f6ring had begun sporting elaborate costumes, and wearing rouge and expensive colognes.\n\nBeginning in 1933, G\u00f6ring had a new companion, the German actress Emmy Sonnemann. She became his second wife in 1935 at an elaborate wedding attended by Hitler and other Nazi dignitaries. Emmy gave birth to G\u00f6ring's daughter, Edda, three years later.\n\nIn 1936, Hitler began planning for war, a secret that soon leaked out. His aim was to place all German-speaking peoples outside of Germany's borders under the Nazi flag. G\u00f6ring, now second in command only to Hitler, was made head of all economic matters. At the height of his powers in 1938 and 1939, G\u00f6ring presided over the passage of laws reducing the freedom of German citizens and destroying that of the Jews.\n\nStart of war\n\nGermany's attack on Poland in 1939 marked the beginning of World War II. After Germany's quick victory over Poland, G\u00f6ring was treated as a hero. Germany's war against the West made great gains with the fall of Holland, Belgium, and France in 1940. Hitler granted G\u00f6ring the title of Reich Marshal and, in a speech, even referred to G\u00f6ring as his successor.\n\nLoss of favor\n\nG\u00f6ring was not to remain Hitler's right-hand man for long. During the course of World War II he fell into disfavor with the F\u00fchrer (pronounced fyoor-uhr and meaning \"my leader\"), the title Hitler gave to himself, over a variety of issues. As Hitler became unreasonable and increasingly bad tempered, G\u00f6ring grew disillusioned. When the Nazis started to lose ground in the Soviet Union (Russia), Hitler denied all responsibility. As head of the air force, \"I certainly got the blame,\" G\u00f6ring was quoted as saying. \"From that time on the relationship between the F\u00fchrer and myself steadily deteriorated.\" G\u00f6ring was also held responsible for the declining protection afforded by the Luftwaffe during the massive Allied bombing campaigns against German cities and industries. (The Allies consisted of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France.) Hitler began to berate G\u00f6ring and refer to him scornfully. Eventually, G\u00f6ring assigned most of his duties regarding concentration camps and the Gestapo to various underlings.\n\nBy this time, G\u00f6ring was pessimistic about the war and frightened about his family's fate if Germany lost. He continued to obey the orders of the F\u00fchrer, but avoided contact with the Nazi leadership as much as possible. G\u00f6ring now spent most of his time at Carin Hall. When Hitler found out that Carin Hall was being protected by German paratroops, he ordered them to leave. G\u00f6ring had his most precious possessions packed and taken to Bavaria. In February 1945, he and his aides left in a staff car, and he had Carin Hall destroyed by dynamite.\n\nArrest and imprisonment\n\nG\u00f6ring arrived in Obersalzberg, Bavaria, where he set up military headquarters. Hitler was wrongly informed by G\u00f6ring's enemies that he had launched a coup d'etat (a sudden overthrow of the government by force). Hitler then stripped him of all his titles, and had SS troops arrest G\u00f6ring and his family at the castle where they were staying. (The SS, an abbreviation for Shutzstaffeln or Security Squad, was Hitler's protection unit.) In April 1945, Hitler committed suicide in order to avoid falling into the hands of Soviet troops who were closing in on his underground bunker. G\u00f6ring, who by now had been freed, expressed regret that he would never have the chance to convince Hitler of his loyalty.\n\nIn May 1945, near the end of the war, G\u00f6ring was arrested by the Allies. He still believed, however, that he would be able to charm his way back into a comfortable civilian life. At first he received special treatment, including fine food and wine, to encourage him to talk. He condemned Hitler, discussed Nazi policies and procedures at length, and did his best to make his own actions appear favorable to his Allied captors. But he was soon placed in solitary confinement and treated as just another prisoner of war.\n\nIn 1946, the Allies put the Nazi criminals publicly on trial in Nuremberg, Germany. The Nuremberg Trials marked the first time in history that a group of victorious powers had established an international court in which they could try their defeated enemies on charges of violations of criminal laws. The Nuremberg Tribunal, as the group of powers was known, made it known that a nation's conduct must be governed by laws even during wartime.\n\nTestifies at Nuremberg\n\nThe courtroom was packed on March 13, 1946, the day G\u00f6ring testified in his own behalf at the Nuremberg Trials. Having lost much of the extra weight that made him almost a comic figure, he appeared handsome and even noble. During his testimony he was initially very nervous, which was betrayed by his shaking hands. But his voice gained strength and confidence with each question he answered.\n\n\"He embellished his replies with [witty answers], attracting gales of laughter from the public in the courtroom, then subtly hushed the listeners with some throwaway self-incrimination of apparent sincerity,\" according to G\u00f6ring's biographer David Irving. Newspapermen in the courtroom were amazed by his brilliant performance on the stand. One prosecutor commented: \"Now you see why he was so popular.\" One Nazi lawyer commented about him admiringly: \"That G\u00f6ring is quite a guy.\"\n\nAlthough arrogant, G\u00f6ring handled himself very effectively against the U.S. prosecutor, smirking and making clever, sarcastic comments. The bullying British prosecutor did cause G\u00f6ring to break out into a sweat, however, when he asked why G\u00f6ring had executed escaped British pilots, and questioned his loyalty to Hitler in the light of the atrocities ordered by Hitler.\n\nProud of his own performance on the stand, G\u00f6ring told his fellow defendants: \"If you handle yourselves half as well as I did, you'll be doing all right.\" An attorney for one of the other defendants remarked: \"G\u00f6ring had nothing to lose. That's why he played the part to the very end--with [vigor] and shrewdness.... He won round after round against [the American] ... but he's as self-centered, vain, and pompous as ever.\"\n\nIn his final address to the Nuremberg court, G\u00f6ring declared: \"The German people trusted the F\u00fchrer. Given his authoritarian direction of the state, [the people] had no influence on events. Ignorant of the crimes of which we know today, the people have fought with loyalty, self-sacrifice, and courage, and they have suffered too in this life-and-death struggle into which they were arbitrarily thrust. The German people are free from blame.\"\n\nDespite G\u00f6ring's efforts to justify the rule of the Nazis and his masterful speaking skills, the tribunal found \"his guilt ... unique in its enormity\" and sentenced him to death by hanging. G\u00f6ring listened to the verdict stonefaced, but after returning to his cell he fought an emotional breakdown and asked to be left alone. G\u00f6ring's written request to be executed by a firing squad, in the military tradition, was refused.\n\nAt around 11:00 P.M. on October 15, 1946, just a few hours before he was to be hanged, G\u00f6ring swallowed a dose of poison. He was found dead in his bed within minutes. How he procured the vial of poison remains a mystery. The next day, his body and those of the Nazi criminals who had been hanged the night before were burned in a crematorium. Their ashes were later poured into a muddy gutter.\n\nG\u00f6ring thought that he would be remembered as a hero in Germany. This never happened. Despite his many outstanding qualities, and his successful efforts to save a number of Jews who were family friends, he was guilty of moral cowardice. \"All through his association with Adolf Hitler,\" Leonard Mosley points out in The Reich Marshal: A Biography of Hermann G\u00f6ring, \"there were moments when he might have changed the course of National Socialism and Germany's race to [hell]--by arguing with and persuading the F\u00fchrer to begin with, by [seizing power from] him when that was no longer possible.\""}, {"url": "https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=235976", "page_content": "#10\n\nPost by wolfguy \u00bb 22 Jan 2021, 10:49\n\nIt was called Kampfgruppe Bock, led by leiter of Stapoleitstelle Berlin, SS-Standartenfuhrer Wilhelm Bock.

He joined in 1933.\n\n\n\nHe was an SS officer, SS #36,225. In 1939, on Hitler's 50th birthday, he was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer (April 20, 1939).\n\n\n\nH Heydrich was also a Sonderf\u00fchrer in the Propaganda Ministry under Dr. Joseph Goebbels. He was a writer/journalist in that capacity, and when the campaign on the eastern front opened he was assigned to the 697 Panzer Propaganda Kompanie as editor of the soldier newspaper, Die Panzerfaust.\n\n\n\nAn accomplished fencer, equestrian, and musician (he was part of a stringed quartet along with his brother, Reinhard, and Admiral Canaris, in Berlin) Heinz was also a combat veteran of the invasion of Poland and then France. Physically he was tall like Reinhard, a handsome man, and an athlete in terms of his physical fitness. Heinz maintained his Catholic faith although Reinhard renounced his in favor of National Socialism and its doctrine.\n\n\n\nHe attended his brother's memorial service in Prague after Reinhard was assassinated in May 1942, and again in Berlin where he is pictured accepting condolences from among others, Adolph Hitler. Although much has been made of the packet of documents he received and read the evening before the Berlin funeral, the notion that Heinz suddenly became fully aware of his brother's role in the multiple policies and projects having to do with \"the Final Solution\" is fanciful but not historically correct. H Heydrich grew up in the same household as his brother; he was taught the same nationalistic thought processes as Reinhard; he fought with and for his brother in the streets during their Freikorps days; upon joining the NSDAP and the SS he wrote scathing editorials in both public papers and the Party media about the \"Jewish Problem\"; he witnessed and heard about firsthand as a writer/photographer/editor in Poland, France, and then Russia the mass executions taking place per his brother's directives; he spent hours talking with Reinhard, Himmler, Goebbels, and other leading Party officials about what Hitler believed necessary to be done in many areas other than extermination.\n\n\n\nIn short, he was neither ignorant nor a fool.\n\n\n\nHis demeanor the morning after reading the documents and certainly a personal letter from his brother, to be opened only by Heinz as Reinhard had directed when he left a similar \"last letter\" to his wife, Lina, prior to participating in the war as a fighter pilot, was that of a man who had lost a brother he truly loved and respected, had read his last letter to him with all that may have entailed, and if there were documents regarding the mass extermination policies, plans, and decisions in the packet they would have been essentially known of by Heinz to begin with. As Reinhard was as precise, detail driven, and careful (read: possessing of a policeman's well developed sense of paranoia) the burning of some if not all of the documents in the packet may have been a directive of his to Heinz.\n\n\n\nIn late 1944, Heinz Heydrich shot himself in his office on the special train assigned to PPK 697, near Reisenberg, Poland. Again, when looked into objectively the story around his suicide (\"freitod\") does not hold water. By 1944, the shortage of paper of all grades was acute throughout Germany. With the many soldier and service newspapers the Nazi military machine under Goebbels created the shortages were even worse. For example, in a special edition of Die Panzerfaust when the war in the east was going well for the Germans, the issue boasted 96 pages of editorial and photos. By the end of 1944 it was down to 2-3 pages per issue, as were most others of the same genre.\n\n\n\nThe myth that a state agency inspector was \"looking into\" a paper shortage at Die Panzerfaust and that Heinz believed his use of said paper and printing press since his brother's death to forge ID and visa documents for many Jewish folks to escape Germany had been discovered - leading him to commit suicide - is likewise silly. The grade of paper used by Die Panzerfaust, especially as the shortages grew, was \"rag\" paper. Document forgery of the level and quality demanded in Nazi Germany's ID and travel paperwork demanded high quality paper. ID documents, or Kennkarte, were printed using a thin cardboard - not paper - that was folded into six sections. Attempting to forge kennkarte and visa paperwork on \"rag\" paper would be like forging a US passport on toilet paper - not exactly going to fool anyone.\n\n\n\nIn short, Heinz Heydrich is only known to have helped two Jewish folk to escape Germany, and this was circa 1943. My research on this is reflected in the below narrative. Of great interest is the surviving Heydrich family members' utter silence about Heinz. This can be attributed to his helping two Berlin Jews to successfully escape as described below - and what Lina Heydrich, an unrepentant National Socialist who worshiped her husband, Reinhard, as well as Himmler and Adolph Hitler, and who was close with the wife of Joseph Goebbels as well as SS officer Jochin Peiper's spouse, among others, saw as an unforgivable betrayal of all she held dear by a family member.\n\n\n\nLina once said of Heinz's suicide that he, in her opinion, did not have the psychological armor to see \"it\" through to the end. Implying he was not as mentally strong as her Reinhard was. I believe the truth is that Heinz Heydrich was offered a quiet and \"honorable\" out that would secure his family's safety - as so many others were to include Rommel and those mid-level and senior German officers who were tried and convicted after the July 20, 1944 attempt on Hitler.\n\n\n\nAs Himmler asked of her in January 1945, after she thanked him for his condolences regarding the death of her brother-in-law, \"...Himmler was concerned that news of the suicide of the late Reinhard Heydrich's brother should not become common knowledge.\" Lina complied, reporting to Himmler she had instructed the town mayor in Wreschen, where she was then staying, to remain silent on the topic, as well (Reinhard Heydrich, The Biography, Volume 2, Enigma, Max Williams, Page 251).\n\n\n\nOne brother became inhumane and the mainspring of mass murder - the other remained humane and saved a young woman and her child from that mass murder. \"Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.\" - John 15:13\n\n\n\nHer name is Dolores Beatrice Lieselotte Lafaire. She was born on May 20, 1918, in Germany. She was Jewish. Later in life she confirmed who it was that saved her child and she from certain death.\n\n\n\nDolores married a young German officer and Olympic medalist (Equestrian - 1928 Olympics), Richard Sahla. They had one child. Major Richard Sahla would serve in the invasion of Poland in 1939. He would be convicted by court martial of murdering four Polish women while they were in jail, and seriously wounding a 5th, who was able to identify him.\n\n\n\nRichard Sahla was stripped of his rank, assigned to a penal battalion, and was killed in action on the Russian front in 1942. His grave is lost for all time.\n\n\n\nDolores would lose Gerrit LaFaire, her 23-year old brother, on August 16, 1942, a victim of the Nazis. Her mother and father, both Jewish, disappeared into the camps. Both died there.\n\n\n\nThe young woman with a child to raise met and married German actor Karl Johns. Johns made a number of films for the Nazi film industry and was a favorite of Joseph Goebbels. Johns (later, upon immigration to the United States, shortened to simply \"John\") was born on March 24, 1905. There is no record of his parents. As Johns' wife, Dolores and her child were safe from the extermination policies of Goebbels/Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich only as long as her husband remained on the Nazis' good side.\n\n\n\nIn 1943, after hearing Johns make disparaging statements / jokes about Hitler and himself, Joseph Goebbels sent the actor to an SS run work camp (Hessisch Lichtenau), a muntions factory under the Buchenwald KZ system. Karl John would be liberated by American forces in 1945.\n\n\n\nBefore his exile the actor turned to a friend in the Propaganda Ministry he felt he could trust. The man was well educated, a musician, an equestrian, and with the means to help him if he so chose to. Karl Johns had nothing to lose by approaching him, as all was lost already.\n\n\n\nThe man, a German officer, agreed to help the actor. He provided forged documents of high quality and two exit visas for Johns' wife and child. They would escape through Scandinavia and make their way to England. The officer knew Delores, and he knew her child's father was Richard Sahla, Olympic equestrian champion and now dead and buried on the eastern front.\n\n\n\nOnce liberated, Karl Johns reunited with Dolores and they immigrated to the United States where now Karl John resumed his acting career in Hollywood. They lived quietly and well, never forgetting the man who saved Dolores and child.\n\n\n\nKarl John passed away in 1977 at the age of 72. Dolores lived to a ripe old age before passing, and as Karl chose to be buried in Berlin, she requested the same and the two were reunited once again.\n\n\n\nThe German officer who saved this family out of friendship was, under German law at the time, guilty of treason. He'd made it possible for two German Jews (Berlin Jews, at that) to successfully escape the Nazi extermination policy at the time. Further, he done so at the behest of another \"traitor\" under German law, Karl John, who had dared speak ill of Nazi Germany's \"messiah\" and Joseph Goebbels.\n\n\n\nThe penalty of such crimes of high treason was death.\n\n\n\nAnd in November 1944, the officer in question, SS Hauptsturmfuhrer Heinz Siegfriend Heydrich, younger brother to the mainspring of the Final Solution, SS General Reinhard Heydrich (assassinated on May 27, 1942, in Prague), was offered the option of suicide (\"frietod\") for his crimes - and to avoid the scandal that would befall Hitler, Himmler, and the SS were it known a Heydrich had saved two Jews from the policies and programs of his \"mythical\" elder brother, Reinhard.\n\n\n\nHeinz Heydrich's grave, somewhere near Reisenberg, Poland, is likely unmarked and forgotten. His brother Reinhard's grave in Berlin was recently dug into for reasons unknown and remains once again unmarked.\n\n\n\nIn England, the Sahla Family fondly remembers Dolores and her child; Karl John who sought to see them escape certain death in a KZ, and Heinz Siegfried Heydrich who in saving them both gave up his life for the sake of remaining human.\n\n\n\n**Photos of Dolores Sahla-John, Major Richard Sahla, and Karl John and their extended families are available online.

Due to warring ideologies, tussles between the Soviet Union and its allies, and the legacy of the First World War, Germany actually surrendered twice.\n\nAs an Allied victory looked more and more certain in 1944 and 1945, the United States, U.S.S.R., France, and the United Kingdom bounced around ideas on the terms of a German surrender. But it was still unclear how the military or political surrender signing would be orchestrated by the time Adolf Hitler died by suicide in a Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945, and his dictatorship reached a bloody end.\n\nHitler had designated Karl D\u00f6nitz, a naval admiral and ardent Nazi, as his successor in the event of his death. D\u00f6nitz was doomed not to rule a new Germany, but rather to orchestrate its dissolution. He quickly deputized Alfred Jodl, chief of the operations staff of the Armed Forces High Command, to negotiate the surrender of all German forces with General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nD\u00f6nitz hoped negotiations would buy him time to get as many German people and troops as possible out of the path of the advancing Russians. He also hoped to convince the United States, Britain, and France, all of whom distrusted the U.S.S.R., to turn against the Soviet Union so that Germany might continue its war on that front. Eisenhower saw through the ruse, though, and insisted Jodl sign an instrument of surrender without negotiations. (Hear stories from the last living voices of WWII.)\n\nOn May 7, Jodl signed an unconditional \u201cAct of Military Surrender\u201d and a ceasefire that would go into effect at 11:01 p.m. Central European Time on May 8. When Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin heard that Germany had signed an unconditional surrender of all its troops in Reims, he was furious. He argued that since the U.S.S.R. had sacrificed the most troops and civilians during the war, its most important military commander should accept Germany\u2019s surrender rather than the Soviet officer who had witnessed the signing in Reims. Stalin opposed the location of the signing, too: Since Berlin had been the capital of the Third Reich, he argued, it should be the site of its surrender.\n\nBut Stalin\u2019s third objection\u2014that Jodl was not Germany\u2019s most senior military official\u2014would prove the most convincing to the rest of the Allies, all of whom remembered how the signing of the armistice that ended World War I had helped plant the seeds of the next world war.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nIn 1918, as the German Empire had teetered on the brink of defeat, it collapsed and was replaced by a parliamentary republic. Matthias Erzberger, the new secretary of state, had signed the armistice of Compi\u00e8gne, in which Germany unconditionally surrendered.\n\nThe surrender came as a shock to most German civilians, who had been told their military was on the verge of victory. As a result, rumors began to circulate that Germany\u2019s new, civilian government\u2014and other popular scapegoats, such as Marxists and Jews\u2014had stabbed the military in the back. Erzberger was eventually murdered as a result of the myth, which became a common refrain among the members of the new Nazi Party as they consolidated to seize power. (Meet the forgotten 'wolf children' of the second World War.)\n\nStalin argued that allowing Jodl to surrender for Germany in World War II could open the door to a new stab-in-the-back myth since he had been deputized by D\u00f6nitz, a civilian head of state. Worried that Germany could again insist that its surrender was illegitimate if anyone but Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the supreme commander of all German forces, personally signed the document, the Allies decided to restage the surrender.\n\nOn May 8, Keitel headed to Karlshorst, a suburb of Berlin, to sign the document in front of Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov and a small Allied delegation. But Keitel argued a minor point, hoping to add a clause giving his troops a grace period of at least 12 hours to ensure they received their cease fire orders before facing any penalties for continuing to fight. Zhukov ultimately offered Keitel a verbal promise but did not grant his request to add the clause. Due to the delay, the document was not executed until after the ceasefire was supposed to begin\u2014and May 9 had already arrived.\n\nThe Russians celebrate May 9 as Victory Day to this day. The Reims surrender wasn\u2019t even reported in the Soviet press until a day afterward, proof according to some observers that the second surrender was a propaganda move orchestrated so Stalin could claim a larger part of the credit for ending the war. In the rest of the world, though, V-E (Victory in Europe) Day is celebrated on May 8, the day the ceasefire was officially slated to begin."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history", "page_content": "World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. His murder catapulted into a war across Europe that lasted until 1918. During the conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers) fought against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Canada, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers). Thanks to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare, World War I saw unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction. By the time the war was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than 16 million people\u2014soldiers and civilians alike\u2014were dead.\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand\n\nTensions had been brewing throughout Europe\u2014especially in the troubled Balkan region of southeast Europe\u2014for years before World War I actually broke out.\n\nA number of alliances involving European powers, the Ottoman Empire, Russia and other parties had existed for years, but political instability in the Balkans (particularly Bosnia, Serbia and Herzegovina) threatened to destroy these agreements.\n\nThe spark that ignited World War I was struck in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2014heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire\u2014was shot to death along with his wife, Sophie, by the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914. Princip and other nationalists were struggling to end Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe assassination of Franz Ferdinand set off a rapidly escalating chain of events: Austria-Hungary, like many countries around the world, blamed the Serbian government for the attack and hoped to use the incident as justification for settling the question of Serbian nationalism once and for all.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II\n\nBecause mighty Russia supported Serbia, Austria-Hungary waited to declare war until its leaders received assurance from German leader Kaiser Wilhelm II that Germany would support their cause. Austro-Hungarian leaders feared that a Russian intervention would involve Russia\u2019s ally, France, and possibly Great Britain as well.\n\nOn July 5, Kaiser Wilhelm secretly pledged his support, giving Austria-Hungary a so-called carte blanche, or \u201cblank check\u201d assurance of Germany\u2019s backing in the case of war. The Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary then sent an ultimatum to Serbia, with such harsh terms as to make it almost impossible to accept.\n\nWorld War I Begins\n\nConvinced that Austria-Hungary was readying for war, the Serbian government ordered the Serbian army to mobilize and appealed to Russia for assistance. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and the tenuous peace between Europe\u2019s great powers quickly collapsed.\n\nWithin a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War I had begun.\n\nThe Western Front\n\nAccording to an aggressive military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan (named for its mastermind, German Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen), Germany began fighting World War I on two fronts, invading France through neutral Belgium in the west and confronting Russia in the east.\n\nOn August 4, 1914, German troops crossed the border into Belgium. In the first battle of World War I, the Germans assaulted the heavily fortified city of Liege, using the most powerful weapons in their arsenal\u2014enormous siege cannons\u2014to capture the city by August 15. The Germans left death and destruction in their wake as they advanced through Belgium toward France, shooting civilians and executing a Belgian priest they had accused of inciting civilian resistance.\n\nFirst Battle of the Marne\n\nIn the First Battle of the Marne, fought from September 6-9, 1914, French and British forces confronted the invading German army, which had by then penetrated deep into northeastern France, within 30 miles of Paris. The Allied troops checked the German advance and mounted a successful counterattack, driving the Germans back to the north of the Aisne River.\n\nThe defeat meant the end of German plans for a quick victory in France. Both sides dug into trenches, and the Western Front was the setting for a hellish war of attrition that would last more than three years.\n\nParticularly long and costly battles in this campaign were fought at Verdun (February-December 1916) and the Battle of the Somme (July-November 1916).

In the latter poem, McCrae writes from the perspective of the fallen soldiers:\n\nPublished in 1915, the poem inspired the use of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance.\n\nVisual artists like Otto Dix of Germany and British painters Wyndham Lewis, Paul Nash and David Bomberg used their firsthand experience as soldiers in World War I to create their art, capturing the anguish of trench warfare and exploring the themes of technology, violence and landscapes decimated by war.\n\nThe Eastern Front\n\nOn the Eastern Front of World War I, Russian forces invaded the German-held regions of East Prussia and Poland but were stopped short by German and Austrian forces at the Battle of Tannenberg in late August 1914.\n\nDespite that victory, Russia\u2019s assault forced Germany to move two corps from the Western Front to the Eastern, contributing to the German loss in the Battle of the Marne.\n\nCombined with the fierce Allied resistance in France, the ability of Russia\u2019s huge war machine to mobilize relatively quickly in the east ensured a longer, more grueling conflict instead of the quick victory Germany had hoped to win under the Schlieffen Plan.\n\nRussian Revolution\n\nFrom 1914 to 1916, Russia\u2019s army mounted several offensives on World War I\u2019s Eastern Front but was unable to break through German lines.\n\nDefeat on the battlefield, combined with economic instability and the scarcity of food and other essentials, led to mounting discontent among the bulk of Russia\u2019s population, especially the poverty-stricken workers and peasants. This increased hostility was directed toward the imperial regime of Czar Nicholas II and his unpopular German-born wife, Alexandra.\n\nRussia\u2019s simmering instability exploded in the Russian Revolution of 1917, spearheaded by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, which ended czarist rule and brought a halt to Russian participation in World War I.\n\nRussia reached an armistice with the Central Powers in early December 1917, freeing German troops to face the remaining Allies on the Western Front.\n\nAmerica Enters World War I\n\nAt the outbreak of fighting in 1914, the United States remained on the sidelines of World War I, adopting the policy of neutrality favored by President Woodrow Wilson while continuing to engage in commerce and shipping with European countries on both sides of the conflict.\n\nNeutrality, however, it was increasingly difficult to maintain in the face of Germany\u2019s unchecked submarine aggression against neutral ships, including those carrying passengers. In 1915, Germany declared the waters surrounding the British Isles to be a war zone, and German U-boats sunk several commercial and passenger vessels, including some U.S. ships.\n\nWidespread protest over the sinking by U-boat of the British ocean liner Lusitania\u2014traveling from New York to Liverpool, England with hundreds of American passengers onboard\u2014in May 1915 helped turn the tide of American public opinion against Germany. In February 1917, Congress passed a $250 million arms appropriations bill intended to make the United States ready for war.\n\nGermany sunk four more U.S. merchant ships the following month, and on April 2 Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and called for a declaration of war against Germany.\n\nGallipoli Campaign\n\nWith World War I having effectively settled into a stalemate in Europe, the Allies attempted to score a victory against the Ottoman Empire, which entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers in late 1914.\n\nAfter a failed attack on the Dardanelles (the strait linking the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean Sea), Allied forces led by Britain launched a large-scale land invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915. The invasion also proved a dismal failure, and in January 1916 Allied forces staged a full retreat from the shores of the peninsula after suffering 250,000 casualties.\n\nDid you know? The young Winston Churchill, then first lord of the British Admiralty, resigned his command after the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1916, accepting a commission with an infantry battalion in France.\n\nBritish-led forces also combated the Ottoman Turks in Egypt and Mesopotamia, while in northern Italy, Austrian and Italian troops faced off in a series of 12 battles along the Isonzo River, located at the border between the two nations.\n\nBattle of the Isonzo\n\nThe First Battle of the Isonzo took place in the late spring of 1915, soon after Italy\u2019s entrance into the war on the Allied side. In the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, also known as the Battle of Caporetto (October 1917), German reinforcements helped Austria-Hungary win a decisive victory.\n\nAfter Caporetto, Italy\u2019s allies jumped in to offer increased assistance. British and French\u2014and later, American\u2014troops arrived in the region, and the Allies began to take back the Italian Front.\n\nWorld War I at Sea\n\nIn the years before World War I, the superiority of Britain\u2019s Royal Navy was unchallenged by any other nation\u2019s fleet, but the Imperial German Navy had made substantial strides in closing the gap between the two naval powers. Germany\u2019s strength on the high seas was also aided by its lethal fleet of U-boat submarines.\n\nAfter the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, in which the British mounted a surprise attack on German ships in the North Sea, the German navy chose not to confront Britain\u2019s mighty Royal Navy in a major battle for more than a year, preferring to rest the bulk of its naval strategy on its U-boats.\n\nThe biggest naval engagement of World War I, the Battle of Jutland (May 1916) left British naval superiority on the North Sea intact, and Germany would make no further attempts to break an Allied naval blockade for the remainder of the war.\n\nWorld War I Planes\n\nWorld War I was the first major conflict to harness the power of planes. Though not as impactful as the British Royal Navy or Germany\u2019s U-boats, the use of planes in World War I presaged their later, pivotal role in military conflicts around the globe.\n\nAt the dawn of World War I, aviation was a relatively new field; the Wright brothers took their first sustained flight just eleven years before, in 1903. Aircraft were initially used primarily for reconnaissance missions. During the First Battle of the Marne, information passed from pilots allowed the allies to exploit weak spots in the German lines, helping the Allies to push Germany out of France.\n\nThe first machine guns were successfully mounted on planes in June of 1912 in the United States, but were imperfect; if timed incorrectly, a bullet could easily destroy the propeller of the plane it came from. The Morane-Saulnier L, a French plane, provided a solution: The propeller was armored with deflector wedges that prevented bullets from hitting it. The Morane-Saulnier Type L was used by the French, the British Royal Flying Corps (part of the Army), the British Royal Navy Air Service and the Imperial Russian Air Service. The British Bristol Type 22 was another popular model used for both reconnaissance work and as a fighter plane.\n\nDutch inventor Anthony Fokker improved upon the French deflector system in 1915. His \u201cinterrupter\u201d synchronized the firing of the guns with the plane\u2019s propeller to avoid collisions. Though his most popular plane during WWI was the single-seat Fokker Eindecker, Fokker created over 40 kinds of airplanes for the Germans.\n\nThe Allies debuted the Handley-Page HP O/400, the first two-engine bomber, in 1915. As aerial technology progressed, long-range heavy bombers like Germany\u2019s Gotha G.V. (first introduced in 1917) were used to strike cities like London. Their speed and maneuverability proved to be far deadlier than Germany\u2019s earlier Zeppelin raids.\n\nBy the war\u2019s end, the Allies were producing five times more aircraft than the Germans. On April 1, 1918, the British created the Royal Air Force, or RAF, the first air force to be a separate military branch independent from the navy or army.\n\nSecond Battle of the Marne\n\nWith Germany able to build up its strength on the Western Front after the armistice with Russia, Allied troops struggled to hold off another German offensive until promised reinforcements from the United States were able to arrive.\n\nOn July 15, 1918, German troops launched what would become the last German offensive of the war, attacking French forces (joined by 85,000 American troops as well as some of the British Expeditionary Force) in the Second Battle of the Marne. The Allies successfully pushed back the German offensive and launched their own counteroffensive just three days later.\n\nAfter suffering massive casualties, Germany was forced to call off a planned offensive further north, in the Flanders region stretching between France and Belgium, which was envisioned as Germany\u2019s best hope of victory.\n\nThe Second Battle of the Marne turned the tide of war decisively towards the Allies, who were able to regain much of France and Belgium in the months that followed.\n\nThe Harlem Hellfighters and Other All-Black Regiments\n\nBy the time World War I began, there were four all-Black regiments in the U.S. military: the 24th and 25th Infantry and the 9th and 10th Cavalry. All four regiments comprised of celebrated soldiers who fought in the Spanish-American War and American-Indian Wars, and served in the American territories. But they were not deployed for overseas combat in World War I.\n\nBlacks serving alongside white soldiers on the front lines in Europe was inconceivable to the U.S. military. Instead, the first African American troops sent overseas served in segregated labor battalions, restricted to menial roles in the Army and Navy, and shutout of the Marines, entirely. Their duties mostly included unloading ships, transporting materials from train depots, bases and ports, digging trenches, cooking and maintenance, removing barbed wire and inoperable equipment, and burying soldiers.\n\nFacing criticism from the Black community and civil rights organizations for its quotas and treatment of African American soldiers in the war effort, the military formed two Black combat units in 1917, the 92nd and 93rd Divisions. Trained separately and inadequately in the United States, the divisions fared differently in the war. The 92nd faced criticism for their performance in the Meuse-Argonne campaign in September 1918. The 93rd Division, however, had more success.\n\nWith dwindling armies, France asked America for reinforcements, and General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, sent regiments in the 93 Division to over, since France had experience fighting alongside Black soldiers from their Senegalese French Colonial army. The 93 Division\u2019s 369 regiment, nicknamed the Harlem Hellfighters, fought so gallantly, with a total of 191 days on the front lines, longer than any AEF regiment, that France awarded them the Croix de Guerre for their heroism. More than 350,000 African American soldiers would serve in World War I in various capacities.\n\nToward Armistice\n\nBy the fall of 1918, the Central Powers were unraveling on all fronts.\n\nDespite the Turkish victory at Gallipoli, later defeats by invading forces and an Arab revolt that destroyed the Ottoman economy and devastated its land, and the Turks signed a treaty with the Allies in late October 1918.\n\nAustria-Hungary, dissolving from within due to growing nationalist movements among its diverse population, reached an armistice on November 4. Facing dwindling resources on the battlefield, discontent on the homefront and the surrender of its allies, Germany was finally forced to seek an armistice on November 11, 1918, ending World War I.\n\nTreaty of Versailles\n\nAt the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Allied leaders stated their desire to build a post-war world that would safeguard itself against future conflicts of such a devastating scale.\n\nSome hopeful participants had even begun calling World War I \u201cthe War to End All Wars.\u201d But the Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, would not achieve that lofty goal.\n\nSaddled with war guilt, heavy reparations and denied entrance into the League of Nations, Germany felt tricked into signing the treaty, having believed any peace would be a \u201cpeace without victory,\u201d as put forward by President Wilson in his famous Fourteen Points speech of January 1918.\n\nAs the years passed, hatred of the Versailles treaty and its authors settled into a smoldering resentment in Germany that would, two decades later, be counted among the causes of World War II.\n\nWorld War I Casualties\n\nWorld War I took the lives of more than 9 million soldiers; 21 million more were wounded. Civilian casualties numbered close to 10 million. The two nations most affected were Germany and France, each of which sent some 80 percent of their male populations between the ages of 15 and 49 into battle.\n\nThe political disruption surrounding World War I also contributed to the fall of four venerable imperial dynasties: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia and Turkey.\n\nLegacy of World War I\n\nWorld War I brought about massive social upheaval, as millions of women entered the workforce to replace men who went to war and those who never came back. The first global war also helped to spread one of the world\u2019s deadliest global pandemics, the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 20 to 50 million people.\n\nWorld War I has also been referred to as \u201cthe first modern war.\u201d Many of the technologies now associated with military conflict\u2014machine guns, tanks, aerial combat and radio communications\u2014were introduced on a massive scale during World War I.\n\nThe severe effects that chemical weapons such as mustard gas and phosgene had on soldiers and civilians during World War I galvanized public and military attitudes against their continued use. The Geneva Convention agreements, signed in 1925, restricted the use of chemical and biological agents in warfare and remain in effect today.\n\nPhoto Galleries\n\nFrench soldiers work together to camouflage a 370mm railway gun before battle.

Stubby once saved multiple soldiers when he roused them from their sleep after a German mustard gas attack. The phrase \"war dog\" is a technical one, and did not apply to U.S. dogs at this time, according to Kathleen Golden, curator of the National Museum of American History's Division of Armed Forces History. \"It wasn't until World War II that the United States began using dogs officially,\" she says. Before then, they were considered \"mascots.\" In 1922, a bulldog named Jiggs was inducted into the U.S. Marine Corps by General Smedley Butler. He later was promoted to Sergeant Major Jiggs. Germans called the U.S. Marines \"Teufel-Hunden,\" or \"Devil Dogs,\" inspiring Jiggs and a succession of other decorated bulldog mascots. Belgians decorated their dogs with the hats of German soldiers in 1914, after the dogs were used to move light artillery and machine guns on small carts. Ronald Aiello, president of the United States War Dogs Association, says that German shepherds, bulldogs, Airedale terriers and retrievers were the most commonly used dog breeds during World War I. Terriers were a preferred breed during the war, Golden says, for their loyalty, rodent-hunting skills and friendly demeanors. New Zealander soldier W. J. Batt poses here with a regimental mascot at Walker's Ridge during the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey on April 30, 1915. A German Army dog is photographed wearing a hat and glasses, with a pair of binoculars around his neck. The Germans began using dogs in an official capacity during wartime in the late 19th century, not long before the start of World War I. The Allied Forces had at least 20,000 dogs on the battlefields of World War I, while the Central Powers\u2014primarily Germany\u2014had about 30,000. Golden says that during World War I, \"Dogs were primarily used as messengers.\" On July 5, 1916, this messenger dog used by the British Army in Flanders, Belgium runs to the front with urgent messages. Message dogs were often outfitted with collars that had attached cylinders. Here, a sergeant of the Royal Engineers places a message into the cylinder on August 28, 1918, at Etaples, France. Messenger dogs such as \"Wolf,\" an Alsatian, often had to negotiate dangerous obstacles, including barbed wire entanglements. Here, Wolf clears a fence at the Western Front in Flanders, Belgium. While horses were often used to haul heavy guns and other equipment, teams of dogs would also be recruited for hauling weapons and other objects. Italian soldiers oversee dogs performing such work in 1917. Dogs, with their keen sense of hearing, endured frequent exposure to gunfire and other loud sounds during World War I. This dog belonged to Captain Richardson of the U.K., who brought his canine companion with him to the trenches in 1914. Visual cues were critical for dogs on missions during World War I. German soldiers in 1916 appear to point something important out to a dog serving as a messenger in the field. World War I dogs, especially terriers, proved to be productive rat hunters. That was an invaluable skill in the war's rat-infested trenches. Here, a terrier poses with some of his kill near the front lines of France in May 1916. In France in 1915, a dog is dressed up as a German soldier\u2014complete with pipe and goggles\u2014to the amusement of soldiers marching by. Resting in a wooden building at an airfield, German military pilots smoke pipes and chat alongside their canine companion. Dogs were great \"morale boosters\" for troops on both sides of the battlefields during World War I, Golden says. Mascots such as \"Doreen,\" an Irish wolfhound, were often brought to memorial services. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in human history, with military and civilian casualties estimated at over 16 million. Doreen was a mascot of the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards. These dogs are armed with first aid equipment and stimulants as they help search for wounded soldiers in no man's land. Aiello explains that \"dogs were trained to find the wounded or dying soldiers on the battlefield. This would let the medics know who was still alive so the injured could get immediate medical treatment.\" This dog finds a wounded soldier lying under a tree in Austria, July 1916. A French Red Cross dog demonstrates his climbing skills by scaling a 6-foot-high wall. Dogs often had to maneuver over comparable obstacles while searching for wounded soldiers. \"I think that Red Cross dogs were the heroes of World War I,\" Aiello says. The dogs would not only locate wounded soldiers, as shown in this 1917 image, they would also help to transport them from the battlefield. A French sergeant and a dog, both wearing gas masks, marched to the front lines. Many dogs were injured by toxic gas. Still others died from exposure to chemical agents like chlorine and phosgene. During the spring of 1917 a French messenger dog wearing a gas mask runs through a cloud of poisonous gas. German soldiers and their dogs wore gas masks as well. The Germans were the first to use such chemical weapons during this war, releasing clouds of poisonous chlorine at Ypres, Belgium in April 1915. A German Army dog manages to leap over a trench in France while delivering a message from one outpost to another. Thousands of dogs died while serving in World War I, often while delivering messages. Once a message was delivered, the dog would be turned loose to move silently to a second handler. Two soldiers captured a pair of German dogs during World War I. The canines were named Crown Prince and Kaiser Bill. The men, wounded in battle, posed with the dogs before returning with them to the United States. This dog, photographed in 1915 in a trench at Flanders, Belgium, and other military dogs have safeguarded and aided people on battlefields from before World War I to the present, says Aiello, who was deployed to Vietnam in 1966 with his own canine companion, Stormy. \"They protect our troops and would die for us.\" 1 / 26 : Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain\n\nThis postcard from 1917 shows a U.S. Army balloon and hanger leaving its port.

A Royal Navy volunteer reserve lieutenant, Norman Wilkinson, came up with a radical solution: Instead of trying to hide ships, make them conspicuous. Shown: British Gunboat HMS Kildangan, 1918 Ships\u2019 hulls were painted with startling stripes, swirls and irregular abstract shapes that made it more difficult to figure out the ship\u2019s size, speed, distance and direction.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.\n\nThese recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.\n\nListed here are the 280 Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"F\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 12 of these listings. Georg-Wolfgang Feller, a 13th doubted recipient, is listed by the AKCR. However, the AKCR itself challenges his listing. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized.\n\nRecipients\n\nService Number of presentations Posthumous presentations Heer 179 13 Kriegsmarine 17 0 Luftwaffe 65 7 Waffen-SS 19 1\n\nThe Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists, one for each of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. Of the 280 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \"F\", 25 were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and three the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords; 21 presentations were made posthumously. Heer members received 179 of the medals; 17 went to the Kriegsmarine, 65 to the Luftwaffe, and 19 to the Waffen-SS.\n\nThis along with the + (plus) indicates that a higher grade of Knight's Cross was awarded as well.\n\nThis along with an * (asterisk) indicates that the Knight's Cross was awarded posthumously.\n\nThis along with the !
