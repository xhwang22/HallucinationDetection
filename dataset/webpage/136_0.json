He has played for both Celtic and Swindon Town in all positions apart from striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis started his career with Scottish Premier League club Celtic. He broke into the first team during the 2007\u201308 season, but never managed to hold down a starting place over the next few years. He spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan to Dundee United. Caddis was sold to English League One club Swindon Town in August 2010. He spent the 2012\u201313 season on loan to Birmingham City, and joined the club on a permanent contract in September 2013. After three-and-a-half seasons in his second spell with Birmingham, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2017.\n\nCaddis played regularly for the Scotland under-21 team and also captained the side. He made his senior debut in 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nCaddis attended St Joseph's Academy.\n\nClub career\n\nCeltic\n\nCaddis trained with the under-17s team at Celtic before moving to the under 19s, where he quickly became captain. He often trained with the Celtic first team. He made his competitive debut coming on as a substitute in Celtic's 1\u20130 victory away to Falkirk on 27 January 2008. He then made his first start just six days later against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in the Scottish Cup. He assisted Scott McDonald for the first goal in the 5\u20131 victory. Caddis made his home debut on 20 February against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 first leg fixture. He went on to play 17 times in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic.\n\nCaddis appeared in Celtic's 3\u20133 Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna in December 2009.\n\nDundee United (loan)\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Caddis joined Dundee United on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut against Inverness CT on 14 February playing the full 90 minutes on the right wing as the game ended 1\u20131. He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract. Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back. He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season. He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury. He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions. At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer. He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United. A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash. When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September. He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty. On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315 \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates \u2013 he was the regular penalty-taker, and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable. The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve. In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back, but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches. At the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed. He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months. In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision. On 26 January, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with EFL League One club Bury on 25 February 2017. He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia, but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement. This time, he made his senior debut as an 88th-minute substitute for goalscorer Ikechi Anya as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan. As of July 2016, all of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Celtic 2006\u201307 Scottish Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2007\u201308 Scottish Premier League 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 4 0 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 7 0 2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League 10 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 13 0 Total 17 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 24 0 Dundee United (loan) 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 11 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 11 0 Swindon Town 2010\u201311 League One 38 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 42 1 2011\u201312 League Two 39 4 4 0 2 0 5 1 50 5 2012\u201313 League One 0 0 \u2014 0 0 \u2014 0 0 Total 77 5 6 0 3 0 6 1 92 6 Birmingham City (loan) 2012\u201313 Championship 27 0 1 0 0 0 \u2014 28 0 Birmingham City 2013\u201314 Championship 38 5 2 0 2 0 \u2014 42 5 2014\u201315 Championship 45 6 1 0 2 1 \u2014 48 7 2015\u201316 Championship 39 4 0 0 1 0 \u2014 40 4 2016\u201317 Championship 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2014 1 0 Total 149 15 4 0 6 1 \u2014 159 16 Bury 2016\u201317 League One 9 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9 0 Career total 263 20 13 0 11 1 8 1 295 22\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nSwindon Town\n\nFootball League Two: 2011\u201312\n\nIndividual"}, {"url": "https://arabarchive.co.uk/player.php?id=359", "page_content": "Paul arrived at United on loan from Celtic.

Good going forward, hard working and with good touch and distribution the teenager displayed all the raw ingredients to become a top quality full-back.\n\n\n\nInitially used from the bench, Caddis\u2019 was given a starting spot in the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Barcelona at Parkhead. Although he would be subbed that night the youngster did not look out of his depth in such illustrious company.\n\n\n\nWith Hinkel and Wilson already vying for the right-back berth Caddis may have to bide his time before he becomes a first team regular but the early signs are that he has the talent to ensure that even internationalists can\u2019t take a starting spot for granted.\n\n\n\nHe was a very good player but he just wasn\u2019t given sufficient opportunities to progress and many were sceptical that he would make it. Buying in was seen as better too often to taking a gamble on a youngster. Caddis may have been a good prospect but with Celtic messing up the league titles in 2008 & 2009 and then having multiple changes in managers, it doesn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s career let alone a developing youngster. Gordon Strachan in his last season & then Tony Mowbray were poor coaches during those spells.\n\nPaul Caddis was loaned out to Dundee United to gain first team experience in the January 2009 transfer window.\n\nHe returned to Celtic and featured in pre-season friendlies, this time under Neil Lennon. However, in Aug 2010 he made a transfer to Swindon after a successful \u00a3350,000 double bid for both himself and Simon Ferry. We hoped him the best.\n\nHe definitely had the making of a good player for Celtic, and some of the support were very much convinced that Celtic had missed out on a great player to be if the Club had held onto him and developed him.\n\n\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nA successful time at Swindon, he helped them to the league two title in England.\n\nHe then went onto have a long career with Birmingham over five seasons, and was a firm favourite. Made himself a hero by scoring a dramatic equaliser at the death in the last league match of Birmingham City\u2019s season in 2013/14 season to keep them up in their division.\n\nA proud moment came in 2016 when he finally made his debut for Scotland, a debut late in his career, albeit only playing a few minutes late on in the game after being subbed on in a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in a friendly.\n\nIn 2017, Paul Caddis signed for Blackburn Rovers, coincidentally under Tony Mowbray his former Celtic manager. He later moved to Bradford and then most memorably returning to Swindon where he (again) helped the club win the league two title. He wrapped up his playing career in 2022 but had ended his time in the senior game on the playing side in 2021.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c14 years ago I was involved the last time Celtic won the title at tannadice.

He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.[10]\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old Caddis, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract.[11] Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back.[12] He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.[13]\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season.[14] He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury.[15] He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions.[16] At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.[17]\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer.[5] He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United.[18] A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.[19]\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash.[20] When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September.[21] He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty.[22][23] On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.[24]\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315[25] \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates; he was the regular penalty-taker,[26] and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable.[27] The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve.[26] In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back,[28] but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches.[29]\n\nAt the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough[30] \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed.[31] He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months.[32] In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision.[33] On 26 January 2017, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.[34]\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with League One club Bury on 25 February 2017.[35] He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.[36] He made 13 appearances in what remained of the season, helping his club narrowly avoid relegation.[37][38] Although Clark wanted to keep him at the club, he chose not to extend his stay.[39]\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nFollowing a trial spell during which manager Tony Mowbray assessed the player's fitness, Caddis signed a two-year contract with another League One club, Blackburn Rovers, in July 2017.[40] After 21 appearances, the last of which was in the 2018\u201319 EFL Cup,[41] his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 31 August 2018.[42]\n\nBradford City\n\nCaddis joined Bradford City of League One on trial in October 2018 after injuries left the club without a fit right back.[43] On 16 November he signed a contract until the end of the 2018\u201319 season.[44] He made his debut the following day, playing the whole of a 1\u20131 draw away to Peterborough United that put an end to the team's six-match losing streak.[45] He scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20134 draw with Peterborough in the FA Cup, but his shot was saved as his team were eliminated on penalties.[46]\n\nIn February 2019, Caddis captained Bradford City for one match under caretaker manager Martin Drury before incoming manager Gary Bowyer appointed Hope Akpan in his place.[47] Caddis went on to play in 27 league matches, mainly as a starter,[41] as Bradford City were unable to avoid relegation to League Two. He was one of eleven players to be released when their contracts expired at the end of the season.[48]\n\nReturn to Swindon Town\n\nAfter training with the League Two club for a few weeks, Caddis rejoined Swindon Town on 15 November 2019 on a short-term contract.[49] He made his first appearance the following day as the third of three stoppage-time substitutes in a 3\u20132 win away to Salford City that took Swindon top of the table,[50] and soon established himself as a regular in the starting eleven. In January 2020 his contract was extended to the end of the 2020\u201321 season.[51] He played more or less regularly for the duration of his contract, and was released when it expired in June 2021.[52]\n\nWhile waiting for new playing opportunities, Caddis started working towards coaching qualifications. He was given a job as an under-16s coach in League One club Fleetwood Town's academy in November 2021,[53] and eventually, on 18 June 2022, he officially announced his retirement from professional football in order to focus on full-time coaching.[54]\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.[55]\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia,[56] but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement.[57] This time, he did make his senior debut, replacing goalscorer Ikechi Anya after 88 minutes as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.[58]\n\nManagerial career\n\nOn 20 April 2023, Caddis was appointed as manager of National League North club Hereford, officially taking charge from 1 May.[59]\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan.[60] In the 2016\u201317 season, all three of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.[61]\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nHonours\n\nSwindon Town\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nIndividual\n\nReferences\n\nInternational statistics:\n\n\"Paul Caddis\".

Good going forward, hard working and with good touch and distribution the teenager displayed all the raw ingredients to become a top quality full-back.\n\n\n\nInitially used from the bench, Caddis\u2019 was given a starting spot in the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Barcelona at Parkhead. Although he would be subbed that night the youngster did not look out of his depth in such illustrious company.\n\n\n\nWith Hinkel and Wilson already vying for the right-back berth Caddis may have to bide his time before he becomes a first team regular but the early signs are that he has the talent to ensure that even internationalists can\u2019t take a starting spot for granted.\n\n\n\nHe was a very good player but he just wasn\u2019t given sufficient opportunities to progress and many were sceptical that he would make it. Buying in was seen as better too often to taking a gamble on a youngster. Caddis may have been a good prospect but with Celtic messing up the league titles in 2008 & 2009 and then having multiple changes in managers, it doesn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s career let alone a developing youngster. Gordon Strachan in his last season & then Tony Mowbray were poor coaches during those spells.\n\nPaul Caddis was loaned out to Dundee United to gain first team experience in the January 2009 transfer window.\n\nHe returned to Celtic and featured in pre-season friendlies, this time under Neil Lennon. However, in Aug 2010 he made a transfer to Swindon after a successful \u00a3350,000 double bid for both himself and Simon Ferry. We hoped him the best.\n\nHe definitely had the making of a good player for Celtic, and some of the support were very much convinced that Celtic had missed out on a great player to be if the Club had held onto him and developed him.\n\n\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nA successful time at Swindon, he helped them to the league two title in England.\n\nHe then went onto have a long career with Birmingham over five seasons, and was a firm favourite. Made himself a hero by scoring a dramatic equaliser at the death in the last league match of Birmingham City\u2019s season in 2013/14 season to keep them up in their division.\n\nA proud moment came in 2016 when he finally made his debut for Scotland, a debut late in his career, albeit only playing a few minutes late on in the game after being subbed on in a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in a friendly.\n\nIn 2017, Paul Caddis signed for Blackburn Rovers, coincidentally under Tony Mowbray his former Celtic manager. He later moved to Bradford and then most memorably returning to Swindon where he (again) helped the club win the league two title. He wrapped up his playing career in 2022 but had ended his time in the senior game on the playing side in 2021.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c14 years ago I was involved the last time Celtic won the title at tannadice.

Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nScottish footballer\n\nPaul McLean Caddis (born 19 April 1988) is a Scottish football coach and former professional footballer who is manager of National League North side Hereford. Caddis played in more than 350 professional matches at club level and represented his country at youth and senior levels. Having predominantly played as either a right back or right winger, he could also play as a left back or anywhere across the midfield, due to his versatility and his ambidexterity. He has played for both Celtic and Swindon Town in all positions, apart from striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis started his career with Scottish Premier League club Celtic. He broke into the first team during the 2007\u201308 season, but never managed to hold down a starting place over the next few years. He spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan to Dundee United. Caddis was sold to English League One club Swindon Town in August 2010. He spent the 2012\u201313 season on loan to Birmingham City, joined the club on a permanent contract in September 2013, and in the final match of that season, he scored the stoppage-time goal that saved the team from relegation from the Championship.\n\nAfter three-and-a-half seasons in his second spell with Birmingham, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2017. A short spell with Bury of League One preceded a season with Blackburn Rovers and seven months with Bradford City. He rejoined Swindon Town in November 2019, played his last match in 2021, and announced his retirement a year later.\n\nCaddis played regularly for the Scotland under-21 team and also captained the side. He made his full international debut for Scotland in 2016.\n\nHaving joined Fleetwood Town as an academy coach in 2021, he was then appointed as manager of Hereford in April 2023, in his first managerial role.[4]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 136 281 281 952 8 428 37 915 82 237\n\nSi Ferry Meets...

He often trained with the Celtic first team. He made his competitive debut coming on as a substitute in Celtic's 1\u20130 victory away to Falkirk on 27 January 2008. He then made his first start just six days later against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in the Scottish Cup. He assisted Scott McDonald for the first goal in the 5\u20131 victory. Caddis made his home debut on 20 February against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 first leg fixture. He went on to play 17 times in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic.\n\nCaddis appeared in Celtic's 3\u20133 Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna in December 2009.[7]\n\nDundee United (loan)\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Caddis joined Dundee United on loan until the end of the season.[8] The opportunity to develop under Craig Levein was a key factor in his decision.[9] He made his debut against Inverness CT on 14 February playing the full 90 minutes on the right wing as the game ended 1\u20131. He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.[10]\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old Caddis, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract.[11] Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back.[12] He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.[13]\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season.[14] He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury.[15] He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions.[16] At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.[17]\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer.[5] He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United.[18] A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.[19]\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash.[20] When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September.[21] He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty.[22][23] On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.[24]\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315[25] \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates; he was the regular penalty-taker,[26] and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable.[27] The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve.[26] In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back,[28] but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches.[29]\n\nAt the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough[30] \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed.[31] He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months.[32] In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision.[33] On 26 January 2017, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.[34]\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with League One club Bury on 25 February 2017.[35] He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.[36] He made 13 appearances in what remained of the season, helping his club narrowly avoid relegation.[37][38] Although Clark wanted to keep him at the club, he chose not to extend his stay.[39]\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nFollowing a trial spell during which manager Tony Mowbray assessed the player's fitness, Caddis signed a two-year contract with another League One club, Blackburn Rovers, in July 2017.[40] After 21 appearances, the last of which was in the 2018\u201319 EFL Cup,[41] his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 31 August 2018.[42]\n\nBradford City\n\nCaddis joined Bradford City of League One on trial in October 2018 after injuries left the club without a fit right back.[43] On 16 November he signed a contract until the end of the 2018\u201319 season.[44] He made his debut the following day, playing the whole of a 1\u20131 draw away to Peterborough United that put an end to the team's six-match losing streak.[45] He scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20134 draw with Peterborough in the FA Cup, but his shot was saved as his team were eliminated on penalties.[46]\n\nIn February 2019, Caddis captained Bradford City for one match under caretaker manager Martin Drury before incoming manager Gary Bowyer appointed Hope Akpan in his place.[47] Caddis went on to play in 27 league matches, mainly as a starter,[41] as Bradford City were unable to avoid relegation to League Two. He was one of eleven players to be released when their contracts expired at the end of the season.[48]\n\nReturn to Swindon Town\n\nAfter training with the League Two club for a few weeks, Caddis rejoined Swindon Town on 15 November 2019 on a short-term contract.[49] He made his first appearance the following day as the third of three stoppage-time substitutes in a 3\u20132 win away to Salford City that took Swindon top of the table,[50] and soon established himself as a regular in the starting eleven. In January 2020 his contract was extended to the end of the 2020\u201321 season.[51] He played more or less regularly for the duration of his contract, and was released when it expired in June 2021.[52]\n\nWhile waiting for new playing opportunities, Caddis started working towards coaching qualifications. He was given a job as an under-16s coach in League One club Fleetwood Town's academy in November 2021,[53] and eventually, on 18 June 2022, he officially announced his retirement from professional football in order to focus on full-time coaching.[54]\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.[55]\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia,[56] but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement.[57] This time, he did make his senior debut, replacing goalscorer Ikechi Anya after 88 minutes as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.[58]\n\nManagerial career\n\nOn 20 April 2023, Caddis was appointed as manager of National League North club Hereford, officially taking charge from 1 May.[59]\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan.[60] In the 2016\u201317 season, all three of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.[61]\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nHonours\n\nSwindon Town\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nIndividual\n\nReferences\n\nInternational statistics:\n\n\"Paul Caddis\".

My wife eventually took her to the doctor, that was the Tuesday, we went back on the Friday and my wife said, \u2018Nothing\u2019s changed, her character is not getting better, she\u2019s like a walking zombie.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo they took a finger-prick test, a healthy blood-sugar level is between four and seven, my daughter\u2019s was up at 25-plus, her ketone level was 11-12-plus. My wife called me as I was preparing a training session for my under-16s at Fleetwood and said \u2018The doctors are really worried, they want to blue-light her to hospital\u2019.\n\n\u201cI met my wife and two girls at the hospital, Summer was quite down and quite weak, and before we knew it she was hooked up to monitors and drips and lying in a bed with 24-hour care for three days. No nurse or doctor would leave her in a room alone.\n\n\u201cShe went into a state called DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis)and the quickest way to describe it is acid in the blood. It starts to attack the vital organs, it started attacking her pancreas, once that gets to a stage where it\u2019s fought off, it then starts attacking the lungs, the kidneys and if it\u2019s not treated immediately it\u2019s a life-threatening disease. In most cases with children that\u2019s how they find out they are diabetic because there are no key signs.\n\n\u201cAfter three days she came off the drips, three four days later she cracked a smile and that smile will live with my wife and I and our youngest daughter. As a father I just want to be my daughter\u2019s hero, give her the answers she needs, I want to make her better but she was lying there and I was helpless. That was the hardest thing for me.\n\n\u201cShe went in to hospital on the Friday and by the Saturday afternoon, I remember counting the finger-pricks and she had 74. I hated seeing it and it got to the stage where she was just offering her fingers but they were so frequent they ended up going to her heel just to get blood out. It was a horrible three days.\u201d\n\nHappily, a few weeks on Summer is out of hospital, back at school and learning to control Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThankfully she is fine now. I am the first person to say I was completely ignorant of what diabetes was, I genuinely just thought you had to inject yourself and you went on with your day.\n\n\"But it\u2019s not like that, you have got to count carbs, you have got to deal with low blood glucose levels at 2:30am with no explanation, you have got to deal with high blood-sugars, you have got to deal with signs of when your sugars are going high.\n\n\u201cFor instance, my daughter is very placid, very calm, no problem at all, but we have noticed when her bloods are high she has started to answer back and she has never, ever done that.

Now life just has to be planned, today she went to school and I have got to plan a packed lunch and write how many carbs everything is and how many units she needs.

You go up Ben Nevis in Scotland, starting around 5pm, we travel through the night to Scafell Pike in the Lakes and straight after that we\u2019ll head to Snowdon. \u201cWe are looking forward to it, we have raised over \u00a33,000, the owner at Swindon Town actually donated \u00a3500 last night. The support has been unbelievable.\n\n\u201cWe put something on social media and it\u2019s just grown from there, it\u2019s a cause that\u2019s now very close to my heart \u2013 research into diabetes.

He has played for both Celtic and Swindon Town in all positions apart from striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis started his career with Scottish Premier League club Celtic. He broke into the first team during the 2007\u201308 season, but never managed to hold down a starting place over the next few years. He spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan to Dundee United. Caddis was sold to English League One club Swindon Town in August 2010. He spent the 2012\u201313 season on loan to Birmingham City, and joined the club on a permanent contract in September 2013. After three-and-a-half seasons in his second spell with Birmingham, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2017.\n\nCaddis played regularly for the Scotland under-21 team and also captained the side. He made his senior debut in 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nCaddis attended St Joseph's Academy.\n\nClub career\n\nCeltic\n\nCaddis trained with the under-17s team at Celtic before moving to the under 19s, where he quickly became captain. He often trained with the Celtic first team. He made his competitive debut coming on as a substitute in Celtic's 1\u20130 victory away to Falkirk on 27 January 2008. He then made his first start just six days later against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in the Scottish Cup. He assisted Scott McDonald for the first goal in the 5\u20131 victory. Caddis made his home debut on 20 February against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 first leg fixture. He went on to play 17 times in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic.\n\nCaddis appeared in Celtic's 3\u20133 Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna in December 2009.\n\nDundee United (loan)\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Caddis joined Dundee United on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut against Inverness CT on 14 February playing the full 90 minutes on the right wing as the game ended 1\u20131. He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract. Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back. He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season. He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury. He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions. At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer. He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United. A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash. When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September. He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty. On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315 \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates \u2013 he was the regular penalty-taker, and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable. The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve. In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back, but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches. At the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed. He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months. In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision. On 26 January, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with EFL League One club Bury on 25 February 2017. He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia, but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement. This time, he made his senior debut as an 88th-minute substitute for goalscorer Ikechi Anya as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan. As of July 2016, all of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Celtic 2006\u201307 Scottish Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2007\u201308 Scottish Premier League 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 4 0 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 7 0 2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League 10 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 13 0 Total 17 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 24 0 Dundee United (loan) 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 11 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 11 0 Swindon Town 2010\u201311 League One 38 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 42 1 2011\u201312 League Two 39 4 4 0 2 0 5 1 50 5 2012\u201313 League One 0 0 \u2014 0 0 \u2014 0 0 Total 77 5 6 0 3 0 6 1 92 6 Birmingham City (loan) 2012\u201313 Championship 27 0 1 0 0 0 \u2014 28 0 Birmingham City 2013\u201314 Championship 38 5 2 0 2 0 \u2014 42 5 2014\u201315 Championship 45 6 1 0 2 1 \u2014 48 7 2015\u201316 Championship 39 4 0 0 1 0 \u2014 40 4 2016\u201317 Championship 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2014 1 0 Total 149 15 4 0 6 1 \u2014 159 16 Bury 2016\u201317 League One 9 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9 0 Career total 263 20 13 0 11 1 8 1 295 22\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nSwindon Town\n\nFootball League Two: 2011\u201312\n\nIndividual"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23938373", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nBirmingham City have signed former Swindon Town skipper Paul Caddis for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal.\n\nThe 25-year-old Scot was first loaned to Blues a year ago after falling out with ex-Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio.\n\nAfter a successful season on loan at St Andrew's, Caddis was hopeful of making the move permanent, only for Birmingham to fail with a string of offers.\n\nBut Blues' need for a right-back was enhanced by an injury to Neal Eardley in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Ipswich.\n\nWhere it all started Paul Caddis was given his debut for Celtic as a 19-year-old by Gordon Strachan in January 2008.\n\nSummer signing Eardley could be sidelined for several months after suffering knee ligament damage.\n\nAnd the cash-strapped, up-for-sale Championship club have now found the funds to complete the signing.\n\nIrvine-born Caddis, who still had a year to run on his contract at the County Ground, was thought be the target for several second-tier clubs.\n\nCaddis, who joined Swindon from Celtic in 2010, was made captain by Di Canio during the 2011-12 season, in which they won the League Two title.\n\nBut Caddis was stripped of the armband last summer and sent out on loan after Di Canio suggested that the defender had \"changed his attitude\".\n\nDespite struggling with a shoulder injury, Caddis made 28 appearances for Blues last season, mostly at right-back.\n\nMeanwhile, Birmingham, who cancelled striker Marlon King's contract on Friday, to reduce their wage bill, have released 19-year-old midfielder Eddy Gnahore by mutual consent."}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/10702125/paul-caddis-celtic-barcelona-champions-league-debut/", "page_content": "PAUL CADDIS endured a remarkable 24 hours after making his debut for Celtic in the Champions League.\n\nThe right-back was faced with marking Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi as the Scottish side took on Barcelona in 2008 on his first game as a 20-year-old.\n\n2 AS a young pro Paul Caddis made his debut for Celtic against Barcelona Credit: Scottish News and Sport\n\n2 The next day Caddis was in the papers for the wrong reasons Credit: Youtube - Under the cosh\n\nBut less than a day after his highs on the pitch he hit the lows of being at the centre of a media storm.\n\nDuring the game, Caddis, now 35, understandably struggled to contain the world class talent managed by Pep Guardiola that would go on to win a famous sextuple.\n\nCeltic gave a good account of themselves as they battled to a 3-2 defeat at Celtic Park.\n\nJan Vennegoor of Hesselink opened the scoring before a quick equaliser from Messi.\n\nBarry Robson gave the Scottish giants hope before Thierry Henry and Messi completed a comeback win for the LaLiga giants.\n\nSpeaking about the game on the Under the Cosh podcast, Caddis said: \"I knew regardless of what I did, if I got abused, they [team and fans] would look after me for being a young lad.\n\n\"But if I did alright I had everything to gain so I was fine.\n\n\"To play against them was a different level.

With Michael Bostwick available again having missed out at the Wham Stadium, the former Lincoln defender came straight bakcv into the side at the expense of Josh Earl who returned to the bench.\n\nThe Swindon side contained a couple of familiar faces with Lee Camp, a former loan signing back in 2003, and Matty Palmer both lining up against the Brewers, Palmer handed the captain's armband for his return to the Pirelli.\n\nAlbion got off to a lively start hemming their visitors deep inside their own half and Swindon were forced into a very early change when Ellis Iandolo injured himself in a challenge right on the touchline that resulted in him taking no further part, Jonathan Grounds slotting into the centre of the Town defence.\n\nThe Brewers continued to look for an early breakthrough and it almost came on ten minutes, Lucas Akins crossing for Sean Clare to glance a header towards goal that was easy for Camp to gather in.\n\nSwindon broke forwards and a speculative long range effort from Scott Twine was straight at Ben Garratt who then had to come to the edge of his area to head away under pressure from Brett Pitman.\n\nA good chance came Albion's way on 16 minutes, Akins nipping in to intercept a weak header from Paul Caddis back to Camp but from a difficult angle he could only find the side netting.\n\nJonny Smith almost notched against his former loan side on 21 minutes, a route one ball out from Garratt eventually landing at his feet and an early taken shot forced Campt to beat the ball away with Clare unable to keep the rebound on target.\n\nSmith may not have found the target himself but his next action was a crucial assist on 26 minutes swinging in a perfect free kick for HAMER to rise highest and head beyond Camp into the corner of the net.\n\nAlbion looked to add a second but it was the visitors who got themselves back on terms on 35 minutes. No pressure was applied as Dominic Thompson crossed from the left and although the initial delivery was cleared the ball fell for PAYNE who measured a curling 25-yard left footer into the corner of the goal.\n\nHalf time: Burton Albion 1-1 Swindon Town\n\nPayne tried his luck again in the early second half exchanges when Bostwick's attempted clearance landed at his feet and he hit an early rising effort that cleared to goal relatively comfortable. Payne was becoming quite influential and a run deep into the Burton box almost resulted in a second goal for the visitors as his low ball found Brett Pitman but Hayden Carter was on the line to deny him a goal.\n\nThe visitors were looking the more dangerous side and Twine's long range effort midway through the half forced a scrambling save from Garratt before Brett Pitman, under pressure in the box headed the rebound wide of the target.\n\nJoe Powell was summonsed from the bench as Albion looked for a creative spark in the remaining minutes as Clare was replaced with over twenty minutes remaining.\n\nAS Albion pushed to a 4-4-2 for the last ten minutes Powell found himself with a little gap on the edge of the box to shoot for goal but his effort was blocked as the visitors.\n\nPowell was also instrumental as Albion hit the front again seven minutes from time. A booming free kick was sent into the mix and BRAYFORD was there to thump a header beyond Camps outstretched right hand into the goal.\n\nJonny Smith limped off gingerly in the closing minutes with what looked like a hamstring injury and Terry Taylor was brought on as Hasselbaink shuffled his pack around but Albion held out for a crucial victory over one of their relegation rivals to move eight points clear of danger."}, {"url": "https://the72.co.uk/2022/02/24/birmingham-city-legends-quiz-5-quickfire-questions-on-paul-caddis/", "page_content": "Paul Caddis initially joined the Blues on loan but would go on to make himself a hero at Birmingham City.\n\nThe versatile ace\u2019s debut was a sign of things to come, producing a man-of-the-match performance as Birmingham City defeated Peterborough United.\n\nCaddis eventually signed permanently in 2013 and went on to spend a further four-and-a-half years at St Andrew\u2019s.\n\nIn the 2013/14 season, Caddis featured heavily again, but it was a tough season for Birmingham City.

My wife eventually took her to the doctor, that was the Tuesday, we went back on the Friday and my wife said, \u2018Nothing\u2019s changed, her character is not getting better, she\u2019s like a walking zombie.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo they took a finger-prick test, a healthy blood-sugar level is between four and seven, my daughter\u2019s was up at 25-plus, her ketone level was 11-12-plus. My wife called me as I was preparing a training session for my under-16s at Fleetwood and said \u2018The doctors are really worried, they want to blue-light her to hospital\u2019.\n\n\u201cI met my wife and two girls at the hospital, Summer was quite down and quite weak, and before we knew it she was hooked up to monitors and drips and lying in a bed with 24-hour care for three days. No nurse or doctor would leave her in a room alone.\n\n\u201cShe went into a state called DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis)and the quickest way to describe it is acid in the blood. It starts to attack the vital organs, it started attacking her pancreas, once that gets to a stage where it\u2019s fought off, it then starts attacking the lungs, the kidneys and if it\u2019s not treated immediately it\u2019s a life-threatening disease. In most cases with children that\u2019s how they find out they are diabetic because there are no key signs.\n\n\u201cAfter three days she came off the drips, three four days later she cracked a smile and that smile will live with my wife and I and our youngest daughter. As a father I just want to be my daughter\u2019s hero, give her the answers she needs, I want to make her better but she was lying there and I was helpless. That was the hardest thing for me.\n\n\u201cShe went in to hospital on the Friday and by the Saturday afternoon, I remember counting the finger-pricks and she had 74. I hated seeing it and it got to the stage where she was just offering her fingers but they were so frequent they ended up going to her heel just to get blood out. It was a horrible three days.\u201d\n\nHappily, a few weeks on Summer is out of hospital, back at school and learning to control Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThankfully she is fine now. I am the first person to say I was completely ignorant of what diabetes was, I genuinely just thought you had to inject yourself and you went on with your day.\n\n\"But it\u2019s not like that, you have got to count carbs, you have got to deal with low blood glucose levels at 2:30am with no explanation, you have got to deal with high blood-sugars, you have got to deal with signs of when your sugars are going high.\n\n\u201cFor instance, my daughter is very placid, very calm, no problem at all, but we have noticed when her bloods are high she has started to answer back and she has never, ever done that. She starts to get a bit ratty, upset, emotional, and it\u2019s simply because her bloods are high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult three-four weeks but we are getting there, she has been a little trooper, she has been absolutely brilliant, she has started slowly taking her own injections, she is learning with it. \u201cShe is finding it difficult at times but the advice from the diabetes team is to let diabetes live with her, let diabetes fit around her life rather than her fitting around diabetes.\n\n\u201cWithin five-six days of leaving hospital we were at Harry Potter World in London to show her she can still live a normal life. Now life just has to be planned, today she went to school and I have got to plan a packed lunch and write how many carbs everything is and how many units she needs. Everything has to be planned.\n\n\u201cWe are living with it, listen there are worse-off people in the world but when it\u2019s your own daughter it hits home a bit more.\u201d\n\nEven more planning will be required for the trek that lies ahead, the infamous Three Peaks Challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest I probably didn\u2019t research it as much as I should because it turns out it\u2019s pretty daunting. One of my mates has been in the army for 14 to 15 years and he says it\u2019s one of the toughest things he\u2019s done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to give a little bit back, I\u2019ve been a professional athlete for 16 to 17 years and I wanted to do something active, something to train for. You go up Ben Nevis in Scotland, starting around 5pm, we travel through the night to Scafell Pike in the Lakes and straight after that we\u2019ll head to Snowdon. \u201cWe are looking forward to it, we have raised over \u00a33,000, the owner at Swindon Town actually donated \u00a3500 last night. The support has been unbelievable.\n\n\u201cWe put something on social media and it\u2019s just grown from there, it\u2019s a cause that\u2019s now very close to my heart \u2013 research into diabetes. The technology in the last five or six years has been unbelievable. I firmly believe maybe not in our lifetime or my daughter\u2019s lifetime but they will find a cure.\u201d\n\nThat really is a mountain worth climbing.\n\nRead more about the Caddis\u2019 experience on their Go Fund Me page here.\n\nREAD NEXT"}, {"url": "https://the72.co.uk/2018/10/30/five-things-for-bradford-city-fans-to-know-about-paul-caddis/", "page_content": "Paul Caddis is currently training with League One side Bradford City, as reported by The72 earlier today. Here are five things for the Bantams fans to know about him-\n\n1. Scotland international- Caddis played once for Scotland\u2019s Under-19\u2019s as a youngster and went onto make 13 caps for their Under-21\u2019s side. He then made his first and only ever senior cap when he came on as a late substitute against the Czech Republic.\n\n2. Started out at Celtic- The 30-year-old rose through Celtic\u2019s youth ranks and went onto play for their first-team 24 times as well as enjoying a loan spell at Dundee United in 2008.\n\n3. Moved south in 2010- Swindon Town signed Caddis in August 2010 and he became a key player for the Robins. Caddis played a key part in their promotion to League One in 2012 was impressive for the County Ground side.\n\n4. Was a hit at Birmingham- The Blues initially signed Caddis on loan in 2012 but the deal was made permanent after a year. He 159 games in all competitions for them and scored the goal to keep them in the Championship on the final day of the 2013/14 season.\n\n5. Had recent spells in League One- Caddis left Birmingham in January 2017 and joined Bury in the third tier a month later. He spent the remainder of the 2016/17 season with the Shakers before joining their North-West rivals Blackburn Rovers in July 2017. He was part of the Rovers\u2019 side who were promoted from League One last season, but he had his contract terminated by mutual consent in August.\n\nPaul Caddis is an experienced player and would be a decent signing for a struggling Bradford City side."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14253640", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nquote Ultimately I've got to do what's best for the football club\n\nBurton Albion manager Paul Peschisolido has been impressed by trialist keepers Ross Atkins and Bertrand Bossu.\n\nAtkins, 21, plays for Derby, while 30-year-old Frenchman Bossu, who has played for a host of UK clubs, had a recent unsuccessful trial at Yeovil.\n\nPeschisolido said: \"Bertrand has been outstanding in the training sessions.

Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d\n\nPaul Caddis has played more than 350 matches professionally at club level, while also represented his country in youth and senior competitions.\n\nDue to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the midfield. He played in every position for Celtic and Swindon Town, except striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis began his professional career at Celtic. Caddis broke into the first-team during the 2007/08 season but was never able to maintain a place in the starting lineup over the following years.\n\nDundee United took him on loan for the second half the 2008-09 campaign before being sold to English League One club Swindon Town, in August 2010.\n\nIn 2012-13, Caddis spent the season on loan at Birmingham City, and then joined the club permanently in September 2013 and scored the goal in stoppage time that prevented the team from being relegated from the Championship.\n\nIn January 2017, his contract with Birmingham was mutually terminated after three-and a half seasons.\n\nAfter a short stint with Bury in League One, he spent a year with Blackburn Rovers before spending seven months at Bradford City.\n\nHe returned to Swindon Town after a short spell with Bury in League One, played his final match in 2021 and announced his retirement one year later.\n\nCaddis captained Scotland\u2019s under-21 team, and played for them regularly. In 2016, he made his debut as a full-time international for Scotland.\n\nThis is what fans said as Hereford appoint the ex-Swindon, Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn, Bradford player as their new manager\u2026\n\n@BrummieHayden: Blues legend.
